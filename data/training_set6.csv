The chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and rocket developer SpaceX said in August that the event would be held on Oct. 31.

Co-founded by Musk in 2016, San Francisco-based Neuralink aims to implant wireless brain computer chips to help cure neurological conditions like Alzheimer's, dementia and spinal cord injuries and fuse humankind with artificial intelligence.

Musk said in a 2019 presentation that Neuralink was aiming to receive regulatory approval for trials to implant chips into humans by the end of 2020, but the company has yet to receive such an approval or bring a product to market.

Musk approached brain chip implant developer Synchron Inc about a potential investment after he expressed frustration to Neuralink employees over their slow progress to win regulatory clearance for its devices.

5,You think your customers want a humanlike AI; you may be wrong,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1338009807.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,29/10/2022,Why brands should consider striving for an AI virtual assistant that's more than human rather than humanlike.,https://venturebeat.com/ai/you-think-your-customers-want-a-humanlike-ai-you-may-be-wrong/,"Join us on November 9 to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit. Register here.

Artificial intelligence—including automated virtual assistants (VAs)—is a hot topic for brands. The market for VAs is projected to grow more than six times, to $23 billion by 2027, accelerated by a COVID-19-era desire to serve customer needs remotely and at scale. From Alexa to Slackbot to Capital One’s Eno to Domino’s Dom, lately it seems like every brand has its own VA.

There’s a wide variety in how brands are approaching the design of VA experiences today, and there seems special interest in the highly humanlike ones—VAs that aim for the appearance and behavior of the real humans who previously fielded these inquiries. But that’s where brands potentially misstep. Instead, they could strive for a VA that’s more than human.

Beyond the humanlike

Let’s say your brand decides to create a VA for your customer service experience. You know that brands benefit when customers feel less like they’re interacting with an institution and more like they’re interacting with a trustworthy human. You know that big data and AI can feel intimidating and impersonal. You figure that putting a human face on an algorithm can make it feel more comfortable, natural, intuitive.

After all, customers are used to talking to humans in assistant roles—it would be easy to think that customers would want to preserve as much of that experience as possible, regardless of whether the intelligence on the other end of the line is human or artificial. It could follow that replacing the human with the artificial is best done with an artificial human likeness.

So, you give the VA a recognizably human name, personal pronouns (probably she/her), describe the VA thinking/feeling/acting humanlike—from “She’s your advocate, always looking for ways to help” to “She’s your friend, ready with a joke to cheer you up.” You design the VA to have a voice that sounds friendly, agentic—she introduces herself by name, uses familiar vernacular, tells jokes, dishes banter. You give her a human face.

But this approach comes with baggage.

For one thing, it sets expectations, which can (and very well may) lead to customer disappointment (customers aren’t really interacting with a human, after all). At worst, it can lead to perceptions of deception.

What’s more, while we may find human interaction comfortable in the abstract, we also know that we humans carry preconceived notions, stereotypes and past experiences into each social interaction. These biases introduce deeply complex risks to the choice of a human form (let alone a name, voice, and vocabulary) for your brand’s VA—and may even inadvertently reinforce these biases.

The advantages of being non-human

Rather than aiming to achieve the hallmarks of a human interaction, there’s room to lean into the advantages of actually being non-human. Instead of replacing the human assistant—with all the weight of biases, expectations and functional capabilities that might come with that territory—what if we focused on what VAs bring to the table that is additive and complementary to the human aspects of the service experience? On emphasizing that this is something different—something that can provide immediate convenience, inspire tech-forward confidence, actually be everywhere at once?

What if we strove for a VA that’s more than human?

We see some exciting examples of this in the market today. RBC Royal Bank’s NOMI is named and described as a distinct entity that customers can point to, but NOMI operates mostly in the background, tied to multiple intelligent tools woven throughout the mobile banking experience. NOMI brings insights to the customer’s fingertips in a concrete way without a concrete form factor. The effect is a seamless interface that lends an air of unmistakable digital prowess to a trusted financial services brand.

Domino’s Dom takes a pluckier approach to more than human consistent with the brand’s personality. Dom’s appearance hints at human while embracing chatbot, with its hat-wearing chat-bubble form and personable voice, within an interactive messaging screen that responds to clicks and pizza emojis alike. Dom achieves friendliness while feeling more dynamic than merely human—with scale and convenience that makes ordering a pie feel more immediate than ever.

Apple’s Siri takes on an amorphous form of just color and movement patterns (along with the voice, which Apple adapted due to representation concerns of the very kind discussed above). The form flexes easily from phone to watch to car to laptop, all while maintaining the sense that the customers interact directly with the same Siri at each touchpoint. Siri also references having a life of its own: when asked what Siri did today, Siri might describe telling other people stories as they cozy up to the fire during a cold night—emphasizing too, its scale of reach. With warm and whimsical touches of familiar humanity, Apple augments the mysterious appeal of an abstract form factor that allows for a cohesive experience across an entire ecosystem.

A high-tech differentiator

Analytic power immediately available at customers’ fingertips, distinct cool-factor surprises of digital prowess, sheer scale of simultaneous customer interactions—these feats aren’t possible for a human. Rather than set expectations for humanlike interactions, successful VAs can lean into being a high-tech differentiator and complement to the high-touch, human elements of the brand experience.

So, when deciding how to represent your brand’s VA, ask yourself:

What need is the VA addressing? What progress must the VA enable customers to make in their lives? How should it change how customers feel about your brand?

What progress must the VA enable customers to make in their lives? How should it change how customers feel about your brand? How much spotlight—if any—should the VA get? Who or what do you want to get “credit” for the AI capabilities—a prominent VA or your overall brand?

Who or what do you want to get “credit” for the AI capabilities—a prominent VA or your overall brand? How does the VA complement—and uniquely add to—the service experience? Which form of representation puts the underlying technology in its best light to elevate and enhance all other aspects of the experience—including any handoffs to human customer service reps?

Which form of representation puts the underlying technology in its best light to elevate and enhance all other aspects of the experience—including any handoffs to human customer service reps? Does this representation flex cohesively across the entire experience? Will a given representation present coherently across every possible touchpoint where customers might encounter the VA—now and in the future?

These answers will point toward how you can best leverage your brand’s technological capabilities as a powerful component of your brand. Done well, a VA experience will allow your customers the sense that they’re able to do things they couldn’t before and relate to your brand in ways they couldn’t have imagined otherwise—most likely by leaning into the advantages of being more than human.

SHANGHAI, Oct 24 (Reuters) - China's chip imports fell 12.4 percent in September, according to official customs data published on Monday, continuing a decline amid tensions with the United States and an ongoing chip shortage.

The country imported 47.6 billion chip units during the month, compared with 54.3 billion units in September 2021, according to the data, which had been due for release earlier this month but was delayed due to the Communist Party Congress.

That maintains an ongoing downward trend for chip imports.

In the first nine months of 2021, China imported 417.1 billion units of chips, down 12.8 percent year-on-year.

Chip imports to China surged in 2021, as tensions between the U.S. and China over technology policy escalated and a global chip shortage caused many companies in China to stockpile supplies.

Separate data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that domestic chip output in September fell 16.4% year-on-year to 26.1 billion units. In the first nine months of 2022, total output fell 10.8% to 245 billion units.

Achieving self sufficiency for China's chip industry remains a key policy priority for Beijing, especially as Washington continues to target the progress of China's semiconductor sector, with the latest being a set of sanctions announced by the Biden administration earlier this month.

The sanctions have caused major overseas-based chip manufacturing equipment companies to cease supplying key Chinese chip companies, including Yangtze memory Technologies Co (YMTC) and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) (0981.HK), and makers of advanced artificial intelligence chips to cease supplying companies and laboratories.

9,How Sam’s Club uses AI to get pumpkin pie to holiday tables,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1132704475.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,26/10/2022,Sam’s Club has steadily increased its AI efforts to help get the right assortment into the right clubs at the right time during the holidays.,https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-sams-club-uses-ai-to-get-pumpkin-pie-to-holiday-tables/,"Join us on November 9 to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit. Register here.

When a member of one of the 600 Sam’s Clubs across the U.S. wants a fresh pumpkin pie to serve this holiday season, Vinod Bidarkoppa, SVP and chief technology officer at Sam’s Club, wants to make sure it’s on the shelf and ready to go.

Unlike mass-market retailers — like Sam’s Club’s parent company Walmart — satisfying and retaining members is the most important strategy for a membership-only warehouse chain. That’s why Sam’s Club has steadily increased its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts, based on connected intelligence. Since Bidarkoppa joined the company in February 2020, he said his team has worked hard to figure out how to make sure the right assortment of products gets into the right stores at the right time — especially during the peak holiday season.

“With accurate AI forecasting, last year we sold enough pies to cover the length of 450 football fields while staying ahead of customer demand and reducing food waste,” Bidarkoppa told VentureBeat. “If we have actually delighted our members and every member who wanted a pumpkin pie got it, that’s a victory for us.”

Sam’s Club needs to understand demand and inventory

The journey of Sam’s Club’s pumpkin pies begins by determining how many pies members will buy across the 600 clubs — and, therefore, how many need to be ordered from suppliers and shipped to stores.

Event Low-Code/No-Code Summit Learn how to build, scale, and govern low-code programs in a straightforward way that creates success for all this November 9. Register for your free pass today. Register Here

“We do a machine-learning [ML] based forecast looking at a number of variables, including local weather conditions, holiday dates and shelf life, and come up with an unbiased, unconstrained demand forecast,” he said. “Then, suppliers replenish pumpkin pies into distribution centers, where machine learning also exists to help plan the most efficient way to ship all of those pumpkin pies to the 600 clubs.”

After they arrive at stores, the pumpkin pies — which arrive semi-frozen and need to be prepared for sale — need to be stocked on the shelves. But how many are needed to keep up with member demand while not allowing leftovers to go to waste? That’s where AI and ML also play a part.

“If you overstock, there’s a lot that’s going to be wasted,” he said. “But if you’re under-produced, then you have a disappointed member who says, ‘What’s the holiday without a pumpkin pie?”

The company’s Fresh Sales App uses AI to predict — in some cases as much as hourly — how many pies or other products need to be stocked, based on ML forecasts generated for each item at the club.

“This system takes into account the minimum presentation level — how much inventory I want in that club at a particular time,” he said. “So it almost always feels like it’s full and we don’t disappoint the members.”

Last week, Sam’s Club unveiled its latest computer vision-based ML tool, an autonomous floor scrubber that does, indeed, clean the floors but also has a mounted camera that scans and captures all the items on the store’s shelves twice a day. The scrubber then sends “hot item” alerts to the backroom, so associates can prioritize the receipt of items most at risk of selling out.

“We have patented models around object detection which have roughly about 90% accuracy and coverage of the entire club space,” Bidarkoppa said.

Once a truck filled with pumpkin pies arrives from the distribution center, Sam’s Club’s ClubIQ tool prioritizes in what order associates need to unload the pies and other items from the truck. The system also analyzes historical item sales behavior for upcoming holiday events and tells associates which items to put on the floor first based on the popularity of that item – down to the club level.

Connecting Sam’s Club’s AI ecosystem

“This is an ecosystem that exists in a machine-driven model,” Birdarkoppa explained. “In the end, the goal is really to delight our members, but powering all of this is the AI behind it.”

This connected AI and ML-powered ecosystem also continues to learn over time.

“It doesn’t stop with the data signals we pick up,” he said. “We feed it back into the model and these become learning systems. So, the more we learn from the signals, the better the models become and the better the outcome is for both our associates and our members.”

Club associates, he insists, love the inventory intelligence and item recognition technology.

“Instead of having to manually find out all of these details, the machine helps them very precisely,” he said. “They love the fact that there are things that help our members instead of having to do unnecessary administrative manual tasks — today we are north of 15% of tasks that are automatically handled by because of this technology, and imagine that at our scale.”

Sam’s Club plans to build on AI success

Birdarkoppa says Sam’s Club plans to build on its AI efforts — which clearly go beyond pumpkin pies.

“Whether it’s planning, buying, planning, moving or selling across all of those core retail processes, we will continue to double down on machine learning,” he said. “There’s a long list of things that are on my to-do list and really excited with what we can do with this technology, for both our members and associates.”

As a membership-driven organization, Birdarkoppa again emphasized the company’s need to have a member-focused lens across all of its processes and tasks.

“That bleeds into the technology stack and how we work within the tech organization,” he said. That applies to AI-driven tools, too — for example, one of the objective functions in any Sam’s Club algorithm is how it will affect membership retention and growth.

“In the end, we are in the business of making our members happy,” he said.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Peak’s inaugural Decision Intelligence (DI) Maturity Index found that while the U.S. was an early leader in artificial intelligence (AI), India is now the more mature market when it comes to readying their business to adopt AI.

While the U.S. was an early leader in AI, with 28% of U.S. businesses adopting the technology over six years ago – compared to 25% in India and 20% in the U.K. – India is the more mature market when it comes to leveraging AI, scoring 64 (out of 100) on Peak’s DI maturity scale, while the U.S. charted 52 and the U.K. just 44.

How India does AI differently

What’s setting Indian businesses apart is internal communication and education about AI to ensure broad support – 18% of U.S. workers weren’t sure if their business used AI, compared to only 2% of Indian workers. Further, 78% of junior staff in India expect AI to have a positive impact on worker well-being over the next five years, compared to 47% of those in the U.S.

The report also found that the way businesses structure data teams is crucial to successful AI adoption, with the majority of Indian businesses having data practitioners embedded in commercial teams to support analysis – by contrast most U.S. businesses have a central data team.

This is because New York is the top financial services center in the U.S. – an industry that is the second most-mature industry behind IT, computing and technology with a mean maturity score of 56 across all three markets (U.S., U.K. and India). This can be attributed to historical investments in data infrastructure and tech, and the fintech boom.

Methodology

Drawing on insights from a survey of 3,000 decision-makers from businesses with at least 100 employees across the U.S., U.K. and India, Peak’s Decision Intelligence Maturity Index defines a number of key indicators for commercial AI readiness across five pillars: decision-making, strategy, data and technology, people and process, and value. Each of the pillars within the framework is weighted, and contributes to an overall index score of 0 (least) to 100 (most mature), an indicator of a business’s ability to effectively adopt, deploy and leverage DI.

Telling artificial intelligence models to “think” step by step when carrying out a task can improve their performance so much that they can outperform humans at jobs AIs usually struggle with.

Using the phrase “let’s think step by step” to cajole AIs into taking more logical decisions was first suggested in a May study presented at a computational neuroscience conference.

Well, now tools based on the same idea have progressed to the point that they are helping researchers to analyse and write scientific papers, generate code and brainstorm ideas.

The tools come from natural language processing (NLP), an area of artificial intelligence aimed at helping computers to ‘understand’ and even produce human-readable text. Called large language models (LLMs), these tools have evolved to become not only objects of study but also assistants in research.

LLMs are neural networks that have been trained on massive bodies of text to process and, in particular, generate language. OpenAI, a research laboratory in San Francisco, California, created the most well-known LLM, GPT-3, in 2020, by training a network to predict the next piece of text based on what came before. On Twitter and elsewhere, researchers have expressed amazement at its spookily human-like writing. And anyone can now use it, through the OpenAI programming interface, to generate text based on a prompt. (Prices start at about US$0.0004 per 750 words processed — a measure that combines reading the prompt and writing the response.)

“I think I use GPT-3 almost every day,” says computer scientist Hafsteinn Einarsson at the University of Iceland, Reykjavik. He uses it to generate feedback on the abstracts of his papers. In one example that Einarsson shared at a conference in June, some of the algorithm’s suggestions were useless, advising him to add information that was already included in his text. But others were more helpful, such as “make the research question more explicit at the beginning of the abstract”. It can be hard to see the flaws in your own manuscript, Einarsson says. “Either you have to sleep on it for two weeks, or you can have somebody else look at it. And that ‘somebody else’ can be GPT-3.”

Organized thinking

Some researchers use LLMs to generate paper titles or to make text more readable. Mina Lee, a doctoral student in computer science at Stanford University, California, gives GPT-3 prompts such as “using these keywords, generate the title of a paper”. To rewrite troublesome sections, she uses an AI-powered writing assistant called Wordtune by AI21 Labs in Tel Aviv, Israel. “I write a paragraph, and it’s basically like a doing brain dump,” she says. “I just click ‘Rewrite’ until I find a cleaner version I like.”

Artificial-intelligence tools aim to tame the coronavirus literature

Computer scientist Domenic Rosati at the technology start-up Scite in Brooklyn, New York, uses an LLM called Generate to organize his thinking. Developed by Cohere, an NLP firm in Toronto, Canada, Generate behaves much like GPT-3. “I put in notes, or just scribbles and thoughts, and I say ‘summarize this’, or ‘turn this into an abstract’,” Rosati says. “It’s really helpful for me as a synthesis tool.”

Language models can even help with experimental design. For one project, Einarsson was using the game Pictionary as a way to collect language data from participants. Given a description of the game, GPT-3 suggested game variations he could try. Theoretically, researchers could also ask for fresh takes on experimental protocols. As for Lee, she asked GPT-3 to brainstorm things to do when introducing her boyfriend to her parents. It suggested going to a restaurant by the beach.

Encoding coding

OpenAI researchers trained GPT-3 on a vast assortment of text, including books, news stories, Wikipedia entries and software code. Later, the team noticed that GPT-3 could complete pieces of code, just like it can with other text. The researchers created a fine-tuned version of the algorithm called Codex, training it on more than 150 gigabytes of text from the code-sharing platform GitHub1. GitHub has now integrated Codex into a service called Copilot that suggests code as people type.

Computer scientist Luca Soldaini at the Allen Institute for AI (also called AI2) in Seattle, Washington, says at least half their office uses Copilot. It works best for repetitive programming, Soldaini says, citing a project that involves writing boilerplate code to process PDFs. “It just blurts out something, and it’s like, ‘I hope this is what you want’.” Sometimes it’s not. As a result, Soldaini says they are careful to use Copilot only for languages and libraries with which they are familiar, so they can spot problems.

Literature searches

Perhaps the most established application of language models involves searching and summarizing literature. AI2’s Semantic Scholar search engine — which covers around 200 million papers, mostly from biomedicine and computer science — provides tweet-length descriptions of papers using a language model called TLDR (short for too long; didn’t read). TLDR is derived from an earlier model called BART, by researchers at the social media platform Facebook, that’s been fine-tuned on human-written summaries. (By today’s standards, TLDR is not a large language model, because it contains only about 400 million parameters. The largest version of GPT-3 contains 175 billion.)

tl;dr: this AI sums up research papers in a sentence

TLDR also appears in AI2’s Semantic Reader, an application that augments scientific papers. When a user clicks on an in-text citation in Semantic Reader, a box pops up with information that includes a TLDR summary. “The idea is to take artificial intelligence and put it right into the reading experience,” says Dan Weld, Semantic Scholar’s chief scientist.

When language models generate text summaries, often “there’s a problem with what people charitably call hallucination”, Weld says, “but is really the language model just completely making stuff up or lying.” TLDR does relatively well on tests of truthfulness2 — authors of papers TLDR was asked to describe rated its accuracy as 2.5 out of 3. Weld says this is partly because the summaries are only about 20 words long, and partly because the algorithm rejects summaries that introduce uncommon words that don’t appear in the full text.

In terms of search tools, Elicit debuted in 2021 from the machine-learning non-profit organization Ought in San Francisco, California. Ask Elicit a question, such as, “What are the effects of mindfulness on decision making?” and it outputs a table of ten papers. Users can ask the software to fill columns with content such as abstract summaries and metadata, as well as information about study participants, methodology and results. Elicit uses tools including GPT-3 to extract or generate this information from papers.

Joel Chan at the University of Maryland in College Park, who studies human–computer interactions, uses Elicit whenever he starts a project. “It works really well when I don’t know the right language to use to search,” he says. Neuroscientist Gustav Nilsonne at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, uses Elicit to find papers with data he can add to pooled analyses. The tool has suggested papers he hadn’t found in other searches, he says.

Evolving models

Prototypes at AI2 give a sense of the future for LLMs. Sometimes researchers have questions after reading a scientific abstract but don’t have the time to read the full paper. A team at AI2 developed a tool that can answer such questions, at least in the domain of NLP. It began by asking researchers to read the abstracts of NLP papers and then ask questions about them (such as “what five dialogue attributes were analysed?”). The team then asked other researchers to answer those questions after they had read the full papers3. AI2 trained a version of its Longformer language model — which can ingest a complete paper, not just the few hundred words that other models take in — on the resulting data set to generate answers to different questions about other papers4.

A model called ACCoRD can generate definitions and analogies for 150 scientific concepts related to NLP, whereas MS^2, a data set of 470,000 medical documents and 20,000 multi-document summaries, was used to fine-tune BART to allow researchers to take a question and a set of documents and generate a brief meta-analytical summary.

NatureTech hub

And then there are applications beyond text generation. In 2019, AI2 fine-tuned BERT, a language model created by Google in 2018, on Semantic Scholar papers to create SciBERT, which has 110 million parameters. Scite, which has used AI to create a scientific search engine, further fine-tuned SciBERT so that when its search engine lists papers citing a target paper, it categorizes them as supporting, contrasting or otherwise mentioning that paper. Rosati says that that nuance helps people to identify limitations or gaps in the literature.

AI2’s SPECTER model, also based on SciBERT, reduces papers to compact mathematical representations. Conference organizers use SPECTER to match submitted papers to peer reviewers, Weld says, and Semantic Scholar uses it to recommend papers based on a user’s library.

Computer scientist Tom Hope, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and AI2, says that other research projects at AI2 have fine-tuned language models to identify effective drug combinations, connections between genes and disease, and scientific challenges and directions in COVID-19 research.

But can language models allow deeper insight or even discovery? In May, Hope and Weld co-authored a review5 with Eric Horvitz, chief scientific officer at Microsoft, and others that lists challenges to achieving this, including teaching models to “[infer] the result of recombining two concepts”. “It’s one thing to generate a picture of a cat flying into space,” Hope says, referring to OpenAI’s DALL·E 2 image-generation model. But “how will we go from that to combining abstract, highly complicated scientific concepts?”

That’s an open question. But LLMs are already making a tangible impact on research. “At some point,” Einarsson says, “people will be missing out if they’re not using these large language models.”",artificial intelligence,nature.com

The ability to enable responsible artificial intelligence (AI) with models that help to mitigate bias and work reliably in a consistent manner, is no easy task.

Responsible AI involves both testing and providing AI explainability. Among the vendors that provide testing tools for AI is TruEra, which recently joined the Intel disruptor program to help advance explainable AI. Up to now, organizations have faced a challenge with tools like TruEra’s. More often than not, testing has been a point-in-time exercise rather than a continuous, automated approach.

Continuous testing has been accomplished in the software and devops with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. But that approach has mostly not been available for AI and machine learning (ML) workloads.

“If you find a bug, how do you test, debug and identify the problem and then write a test so that the bug never comes back?” Will Uppington, cofounder and CEO of TruEra, told VentureBeat. “Machine learning developers do not have those tools today, they don’t have systematic ways of evaluating and testing their models and then systemically debugging those models.”

To that end, TruEra today announced the release of the 2.0 version of its diagnostics platform, TruEra Diagnostics, providing data scientists with an automated test that integrates continuous testing into the AI/ML development workflow.

What an automated test harness brings to ML development

The common development workflow for data scientists is to use a Jupyter notebook to build out models.

Uppington explained that TruEra Diagnostics 2.0 can fit directly into notebooks. By adding several lines of code, a data scientist can create a test that will automatically run every time a model is trained. They can also set up a series of policies to automatically test a system when certain thresholds or constraints are met.

For example, if a model, either in development or in production, generates an error or failure, TruEra Diagnostics 2.0 can provide a link that will enable a developer to debug test results.

The TruEra system’s user interface also provides recommendations to help data scientists determine what tests should be run. Uppington explained that the tests are often dependent on the specific model, but there are several common categories. One such category is testing for bias.

Users can run a test against bias metrics and see if the result is above or below whatever threshold the organization has deemed acceptable. If bias is above the threshold, a link provides a drill-down into the reason, including what features of the model are actually causing the bias to occur.

TruEra is also adding the ability to do comparative tests across model iterations to help identify degradation. Model summary dashboards aid in visualizing the tests of one version of a model against the tests of another, displaying individual models’ test scores in a comparative table.

“One of the key things that you do with machine learning is you retrain your model,” Uppington said. “And one of the things that you want to do when you retrain the models is you want to make sure that you haven’t seen any performance degradation in your key quality metrics.”

TruEra looks to help support AI regulatory compliance

While organizations need not test models in a continuous and automated way today in order to deploy a model into production, they may find they must in the future.

Emerging AI regulations in the U.S. and in Europe may place new sets of compliance requirements on organizations that use AI. For example, Uppington pointed to a human resources (HR) law in New York City which will soon require organizations that are using machine learning in HR systems to provide an independent audit of their AI’s impact and potential bias. The only way organizations will be able to comply, he said, is by constantly testing and validating models.

Continuous testing of models in development will also help to accelerate the deployment of models into production. Uppington said that he has spoken with financial services organizations where it has taken upwards of nine months to develop a model, in part due to extensive validation that occurs before a model is pushed into production. A goal of the new continuous-testing approach is to accelerate development.

Uppington explained that with TruEra, organizations can now more easily create templates for testing tasks, templates that can be used continuously throughout the development process.

“You don’t wait until the end to run all your tests and then find out there is a big issue,” Uppington said. “You do that continuously throughout the process, and that’s what this enables.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Register here.

For Dave Rogenmoser, CEO of AI content platform Jasper — which raised $125 million in funding a week ago — the sheer level of hype and scale of chatter around generative AI last week was unexpected. Jasper’s announcement came just one day after Stability AI, which developed its text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion, announced its own massive $101 million raise.

“I didn’t know Stability was going to announce on Monday — and then ours stacking on that definitely hyped up the whole market,” he said.

But Rogenmoser says that hype aside, generative AI — which describes artificial intelligence using unsupervised learning algorithms to create new digital images, video, audio, text or code — is no flash in the pan.

“This is here to stay,” he said. “It’s going to get radically better, even in the next six to twelve months, it’s going to impact every tool out there – so let’s be really thoughtful about it.” Organizations should have a plan of attack on how they are going to use generative AI tools throughout their company, he explained, because there are significant productivity gains to be had. “I really think any companies that put their head in the sand are going to miss out,” he said.

Making generative AI useful to organizations

Rogenmoser, a serial marketing entrepreneur, points out that the conversation around AI-driven content generation has typically been around what he calls “layer one,” or heavily technical and research-based companies such as OpenAI, Hugging Face and Stability AI.

Jasper, on the other hand, has only one foot in that technical world – and the other in trying to make the technology useful, he explained.

“Our customers don’t really care about that…they are not having this big debate around generative AI,” he said. “They just want to write blog posts a little bit faster so they can get home to their kids’ birthday party.” Rogenmoser said he believes the opportunity to reach those customers is “much bigger than everyone just duking it out, building the next AI model.”

Training a text generation model for marketing

Rogenmoser launched Jasper in early 2021 after previously cofounding Proof, which used algorithms to help businesses generate more leads, demos and trials from their websites.

“I feel like for eight years now, I’ve been trying to solve the same problem — making marketing easier for people,” he said.

The first iteration of Jasper was built directly on OpenAI’s GPT-3 and trained specifically for marketing content generation.

“We took this vanilla generic model that can be used for a lot of different stuff and said, we’re going to train it really well for marketing-specific content and copy,” he explained.

Jasper is meant to help content creators, he added, getting users “maybe 80% of the way there and then the human needs to help craft it, proofread it, check it.”

Longtail of use cases

These days, Rogenmoser said customers are using Jasper for everything from high-stakes use cases such as TED talks and even legal briefs to fun projects like Valentine’s Day cards. But the vast majority of its business consists of copywriters and other content creators, from independent workers to large enterprises, looking to become more productive and efficient.

“We see a massive longtail of use cases,” he said. “We see ourselves as being another tool in your tool belt and kind of giving you superpowers – we’re here to assist you in doing your job really well.”

With the company’s new funding, Jasper plans to improve the customer experience and bring the generative AI technology to more apps.

“One of our goals with the fundraising is to keep moving up [the] market, building more collaboration tools, more reasons to work with your team inside of that and support bigger companies,” he said

“Every tool will have generative AI”

Ultimately, said Rogenmoser, “every tool in the world is going to have generative AI built into it in some capacity.”

Where Jasper fits in, he explained, is “we want to be the tool that connects into all the other tools – so if you can get Jasper trained up in your tone of voice and writing the way you want, and Jasper can then hook into your Google Docs and look into your Facebook ads within your HubSpot, you can just kind of have a seamless workflow that works through all of those.”

Rogenmoser admits that Google could add their own generative AI to Docs.

“I know that Google will do it. I would prefer that they not, but there’s still a place for companies like us that said, well, what about once you leave Google and go into Facebook? Wouldn’t it be nice if that exact same style and nicer content flowed with you?” he said.

The future of generative AI

The future of generative AI overall includes plenty of progress around writing, image creation – Jasper recently launched Jasper Art – and coding.

“You’re going to see audio and more things around video,” he said. “I also think you’re just going to see it packaged up in more niche ways, so you might have a Jasper that has somehow solved fast food restaurant workflows, or something that does legal work much better than Jasper. I see this tree of niche use cases that go really, really deep and solve that one problem really well. Any of these little, tiny little niches could be huge companies over the next 10 years.”

As far as Jasper’s future, Rogenmoser said that while marketing has been the startup’s primary use case so far, he gets most excited about building Jasper for sales and customer success teams.

“I don’t know exactly when we’ll do that – we definitely want to be laser-focused on marketing right now,” he said. “But ultimately, we want to start working our way out into other teams inside the company and solving for them one at a time.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

A decade ago, IBM Watson was the name of a large computing system that made headlines around the world for its ability to compete on the Jeopardy game show.

IBM Watson in 2022 is a very different thing and is no longer a single system or even a single service, but rather is the product brand name for a growing set of IBM artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Those capabilities include natural language processing (NLP), speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.

Over the last several years, IBM has been steadily expanding its portfolio of AI services that run as a service on both the IBM cloud as well as on public cloud platforms from Google, Microsoft and Amazon. IBM Watson-powered AI services are also accessible via an application programming interface (API) that enables developers to remotely make use of the AI capabilities within applications.

What had been missing from IBM’s Watson portfolio, however, was the ability to directly integrate core AI services’ code into applications running locally on-premises — or in an organization’s own cloud deployment — without needing to trigger an API call to IBM.

“There is an entire army of independent software vendors (ISVs) and partners who are looking to embed AI into their software products and offerings,” Sriram Raghavan, vice president of AI research at IBM, told VentureBeat. “We have the opportunity to be the provider of enterprise AI core capability that they can use to focus on innovation.”

To help support ISVs and partners, IBM today announced the availability of three new AI software libraries that can be directly embedded into applications. The services include NLP, text to speech and speech to text.

What IBM Watson’s directly-embedded AI software libraries enable

Raghavan explained that the software library form factor adds an additional level of flexibility for software developers looking to make use of AI.

As a software library that is directly embedded into an application, there is no need for the application to connect to an external IBM resource. For applications that need to reside locally or that might be dealing with sensitive information where external calls are not permitted, having code that is part of an application is essential to operations.

Embedding the AI libraries directly into software applications is something that IBM has been doing for its own software for multiple years.

“What ISVs are benefiting from is IBM having to solve problems when we tried to embed it into our own software, as such there is a lot of innovation that has already gone into this form factor,” Raghavan said.

NLP for example, can potentially be a very large codebase given the complexity and variety of use cases it could serve. With the embeddable software library, IBM has optimized the offering to help ISVs use the code that is needed for the functions they want to offer.

How ISVs can directly embed IBM AI libraries with containers

IBM developed a series of reference architectures for deployments that makes use of its AI software libraries. It’s a model that isn’t all that different from any other modern enterprise application deployment.

The entire offering for NLP can be deployed with three to six containers, running on a Kubernetes container orchestration system, such as IBM Red Hat’s OpenShift platform. IBM is not mandating the use of any specific AI acceleration or inference technology either.

Raghavan explained that, for example, if an ISV wants to use the NLP library to do sentiment analysis over a piece of text, what they are invoking at the time is a pretrained model that is actually doing inference.

“Now, clearly, as part of that, we have done a lot of optimization for some of the smaller models and use cases that will run just fine even on CPUs,” Raghavan said. “There are also reference workflows that as you scale them up with GPUs, you can accelerate performance.”

More to come from IBM Watson in the future

Going a step further, IBM Watson is aiming to make it easier for ISVs to customize the pretrained models without the need to fully retrain the models, which can be a time-consuming and complicated process. Raghavan emphasized that the first three AI software libraries that IBM is releasing are just the beginning, with the potential for additional libraries to come in the months and years ahead.

“We already internally have a richer set of libraries that we use to embed AI into our products,” Raghavan said. “We see this as an opportunity to bring continued innovation from IBM directly to ISVs, the way we bring it to IBM products.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for businesses today, especially for marketing teams who must anticipate customers’ interests and behavior to achieve their goals. Despite the growing availability of AI-powered technologies, many marketers are still in the early days of formulating their AI strategies.

There is strong interest in the potential of AI-based predictive analytics, but marketing teams face various challenges in fully adopting this technology. With no universal playbook available for integrating data science into marketing, various approaches have evolved, with varying success levels.

Pecan AI’s Predictive Analytics in Marketing Survey report reflects this complex situation and provides key insight for marketing teams and business leaders tackling challenges with AI, regardless of where they might be on the adoption curve.

Key findings — integrating AI predictive analytics

While many companies tout the criticality of consumer data across areas, from predicting future purchases to customer churn, the reality is that more than 4 out of 5 marketing executives report difficulty in making data-driven decisions despite all of the consumer data at their disposal. The same number of respondents (84%) say their ability to predict consumer behavior feels like guesswork.

An overwhelming majority (95%) of companies now integrate AI-powered predictive analytics into their marketing strategy, including 44% who have indicated that they’ve integrated it into their strategy completely. Among companies that have completely integrated AI predictive analytics into their marketing strategy, 90% report that it is difficult for them to make day-to-day data-driven decisions.

Marketing and data science face unique challenges when trying to collaborate. As a result, data projects stall. The study provides insight into their struggles including:

38% of respondents say data isn’t updated quickly enough to be valuable.

35% say it takes too long to build the models.

42% say data scientists are overwhelmed and don’t have the time to meet requests.

40% say those building the models don’t understand marketing goals.

37% of respondents indicate that wrong or partial data is used to build models.

Methodology

The Pecan Predictive Analytics in Marketing Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research among 250 U.S. marketing executives with a minimum seniority of director. These executives work at B2C companies that use predictive analytics and have a minimum annual revenue of $100M. Participants responded to an email invitation and an online survey between September 13-21, 2022.

Despite ongoing economic uncertainty, the majority of CXOs – 54% – plan to increase their total technology budgets for next year, and more than 75% plan to increase their budgets in the next five years.

Technology startups have been on edge lately as financial markets have whipsawed, and many investors have become more discerning about the companies they fund. But a recent survey from Battery Ventures of 100 technology buyers across industries revealed that while companies are changing their tech-buying habits, their overall budgets won’t shrink — in fact, most budgets are expanding or will continue to expand in the next year and beyond.

Image source: Battery Ventures.

Among the few buyers who will reduce technology budgets, the approach will center on vendor consolidation and entail streamlining usage, rather than reducing headcount or optimizing SaaS licensing.

Where tech spending is going Long-term sales prospects are similarly positive for enterprise tech startups in those fields. The vast majority of survey respondents report plans to increase budgets in the next five years for the following: Security (92%)

Data (84%)

Dev tools (69%)

AI/ML (79%)

The State of Cloud Software Spending survey also explores trends in software adoption and procurement, finding that approval times for enterprise contracts are either unchanged or slowed down. Interestingly, bottoms-up adoption of software tools is playing a larger role at development/testing phases, with more and more engineers allowed to self-select tools. Overall, the landscape of software spending appears to be very resilient, despite ongoing economic uncertainty.

Methodology

The Battery Ventures Cloud Software Spending Survey explores the technology purchasing planning of 100 chief technology officers, chief information officers, chief information security officers and other technology buyers across industries from financial services to healthcare to manufacturing, representing roughly $29B in annual technology spend. Responses were collected online and in follow-up calls from August 5 to August 10, 2022.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous. It provides directions while we drive, answers our questions, offers music recommendations and powers a growing number of business processes in the workplace.

In fact, AI is working its way into so many aspects of our personal and professional lives that my company has begun to refer to it as “everyday AI.” Soon, I’d argue, it will become as ubiquitous — and necessary — as electricity.

Yet, despite the progress, we’ve only scratched the surface in the potential ways that AI can, and no doubt will, change business and the world. Gartner has forecast that it will take until 2025 for half of organizations worldwide to reach what Gartner’s AI maturity model describes as the “stabilization stage” of AI maturity or beyond.

So, there’s still a lot of work to do to put all the AI pieces into place — the software, systems, machine learning (ML) algorithms, data pipelines and governance controls. As more organizations build and expand this kind of AI infrastructure, the benefits of everyday AI — including productivity, efficiency and data-driven insights — will increasingly reap rewards for businesses of all sizes.

AI: The electrical evolution of the 21st century

In many respects, AI is like electricity was in the 19th century: nascent, promising but untested, potentially dangerous without safety precautions, and with huge implications for the way it could potentially transform society.

Some of the underlying forces of electricity — magnetism, polarity, electric charge — were understood well before Benjamin Franklin, in 1752, flew a kite with a metal key attached to demonstrate that lightning was nature’s form of electricity. But it wasn’t until the 19th century that the emerging field of electrical engineering put the necessary pieces into place to make electricity available to people everywhere, including one of the world’s first “direct current” power networks in New York City.

Today, you could say we are in the early light bulb or electric-toaster phase of AI. It’s still proof of concept in many places, and the AI grid — the systems and software that extend AI applications across global businesses and to consumers — has yet to be fully implemented.

And yet, many people already have their first experiences using AI, directly or indirectly. Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri, those omnipresent voice-controlled virtual assistants, are two of the most widely recognized examples, but there are many others. Website chatbots, auto-correcting text tools, and facial recognition for authentication are pervasive and easy to access.

In these everyday situations, we understand that AI algorithms are driving business processes and user experiences. We know AI when we see it.

But AI also works in less obvious ways. It’s often behind the scenes in loan approvals, supply chain optimization, and manufacturing automation, for example.

Approach with caution

So, the line between when AI starts and stops can get fuzzy. I once made this point to a roomful of data scientists in an exercise I called “Do I Do AI?” The idea was to show that we do not always recognize when AI is powering processes such as auto-generated news articles, which are now commonplace in the media.

At the time, I suggested we use four characteristics — learning, interaction, perception and goal seeking — to gauge the relative “AI-ness” of things on a case-by-case basis. This is the intelligence aspect of AI and increasingly, it will manifest in more and more of our digital experiences.

But we need to be careful here. As more businesses move in this direction, it’s essential that we have the safety mechanisms in place to avoid the AI equivalent of an electric shock. One of the reasons the electric grid works as well as it does, occasional outages notwithstanding, is that circuit breakers and other safety apparatus are designed to avoid mishaps.

AI needs its own grounding rods: Ways to minimize AI bias, deep fakes, privacy invasions and other unwanted consequences. I recently saw a report that more than a dozen autonomous vehicles got jumbled up at an intersection in San Francisco, resulting in a two-hour traffic jam. It’s all part of the AI learning curve, so we must be prepared.

Trust and transparency in everyday AI

The key to long-term success will be establishing trust in AI through transparency. Not only must AI behave as expected, but we must be able to demonstrate and even prove that’s the case. This is why the concept of AI explainability, a methodology to track and validate AI-driven processes, is vital.

How can business leaders ensure that their organizations have the appropriate AI governance framework in place to meet this high threshold? Fundamentally, governance requires prioritization and standardization of rules and processes in the design and deployment of AI. In addition, it’s important to align AI outcomes — not just with financial results but with non-financial objectives such as sociological and environmental goals.

As AI advances on this path, new use cases will proliferate and drive increased adoption. Just as demand for electricity grew with the advent of light bulbs, toasters and coffee percolators, so will AI be accelerated by the emergence of virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles and smart homes.

In much of the world, electricity is now considered a necessity. There’s a corollary as AI progresses from pilot projects to enterprise-wide initiatives in business. The day may be coming when we can’t imagine our work and personal lives without the illuminating capabilities of AI.

Register here.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models continue to gain popularity and recognition. The technology’s recent advancement and success in the image-generation domain have created a wave of interest among tech companies and machine learning (ML) practitioners, who are now steadily adopting generative AI models for several business use cases.

The emergence of text-to architectures is fueling this adoption further, with generative AI models such as Google’s Imagen Video, Meta’s Make-A-Video and others like DALL-E, MidJourney and Stable Diffusion.

A common denominator among all generative AI architectures is the use of a method known as the diffusion model, which takes inspiration from the physical process of gas molecule diffusion, where the molecules diffuse from high-density to low-density areas.

Similar to the scientific process, the model starts by collecting random noise from the provided input data, which gets subtracted in a series of steps that creates an aesthetically pleasing and ideally coherent image. By guiding noise removal in a way that favors conforming to a text prompt, diffusion models can create images with higher fidelity.

For implementing generative AI, the use of diffusion models has become evident recently, showing signs of taking over from past methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and transformers in the domain of conditional image synthesis, as diffusion models can produce state-of-the-art images while maintaining quality and the semantic structure of the data — and being unaffected by training drawbacks such as mode collapse.

A new way of AI-based synthesis

One of the recent breakthroughs in computer vision and ML was the invention of GANs, which are two-part AI models consisting of a generator that creates samples and a discriminator that attempts to differentiate between the generated samples and real-world samples. This method became a stepping stone for a new field known as generative modeling. However, after going through a boom phase, GANs started to plateau, as most of the methods struggled to solve the bottlenecks faced by the adversarial techniques, a brute force supervised learning method where as many examples as possible are fed to train the model.

GANs work well for multiple applications, but they are difficult to train, and their output lacks diversity. For example, GANs often suffer from unstable training and from mode collapse, an issue where the generator may learn to produce only one output that seems most plausible, while autoregressive models typically suffer from slow synthesis speed.

Building upon such backlogs, the diffusion model technique originated from probabilistic likelihood estimation, a method of estimating the output of a statistical model through observations from the data, finding parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the prediction.

Diffusion models are generative models (a type of AI model which learns to model data distribution from the input). Once learned, these models can generate new data samples similar to those which they are trained on. This generative nature led to its rapid adoption for several use cases such as image and video generation, text generation and synthetic data generation to name a few.

Diffusion models work by deconstructing training data through the successive addition of Gaussian noise, and then learning to recover the data by reversing this noising process. After training, the model can generate data by simply passing randomly sampled noise through the learned de-noising process. This synthesis procedure can be interpreted as an optimization algorithm that follows the gradient of the data density to produce likely samples.

“Diffusion models help address the drawbacks of GAN by handling noise better and producing a much higher diversity of images with similar or higher quality images while requiring low effort in training,” said Swapnil Srivastava, VP and global head of data and analytics at Evalueserve. “As diverse synthetic data is a primary need for all data science architectures, diffusion models are better at addressing the problems and allowing for the scale required for developing advanced AI projects.”

Beyond higher image quality, diffusion models have many other benefits and do not require adversarial training. Other well-known methods, like transformers, require massive amounts of data and face a plateau in terms of performance in vision domains compared to diffusion models.

Current market adoption of diffusion models

Using diffusion models for generative AI can aid in leveraging several unique capabilities, including creating diverse images and text rendering in different artistic styles, 3D understanding and animation.

Progressing from plain image synthesis, the capabilities of these next-gen models are moving toward video and 3D generation. The recently released Imagen Video by Google and Make-a-Video by Meta are prime examples of the high-level capabilities of generative AI.

Imagen Video consists of a text encoder (frozen T5-XXL), a base video diffusion model, and interleaved spatial and temporal super-resolution diffusion models. Similarly, Make-a-Video’s video diffusion models (VDM) use a space-time factorized U-Net with joint image and video data training. In addition, the VDM was trained on 10 million private text-video open-source dataset pairs, which made it easier for the model to produce videos from the provided text.

Saam Motamedi, general partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Greylock, says that the market adoption of generative AI, such as diffusion models, has exponentially accelerated because they make it easier for developers to build on top of existing models and help leverage advanced capabilities in their applications.

“Diffusion models’ ability to produce stable and state-of-the-art results signal[s] the next generative AI evolution,” Motamedi told VentureBeat. “These advances in different generative techniques around all data modalities such as text, image, video, audio and multi-modal data, will birth new and impactful use cases.”

Srivastava said that generative AI powered by diffusion models can reduce time and effort during industrial or robotic product development, increase creativity and reusability in marketing, allow content creators to create new-generation content or NFTs, and be used for diagnosis and antibody testing.

“The possibility and future for text-to-video would be multifold, with applicability across immersive experiences in the metaverse to its applicability in video production and creative media,” he said. “In the social media space, we anticipate seeing a new way content creators use such technology at scale to drive engagement and thereby the adoption of such technology.”

The AI research team at IBM recently integrated diffusion models as one of its techniques, using them for applications like chemistry, materials design and discovery. IBM’s Generative Toolkit for Scientific Discovery (GT4SD) is an open-source library that uses generative models to generate new molecule designs based on properties like target proteins, target omics (i.e. genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics or metabolomics) profiles, scaffolds distances, binding energies and additional targets relevant to materials and drug discovery.

GT4SD includes a wide range of generative models and training methods including variational autoencoders, sequence-to-sequence models, and diffusion models, where the objective is to provide and connect state-of-the-art generative models and methods for different scientific discovery challenges.

John Smith, an IBM fellow in discovery technology foundations, accelerated discovery, said that designing and discovering new chemicals is a huge challenge due to the practically infinite search spaces, and generative models are one of the most promising approaches for addressing this difficulty.

“Generative models provide a way to use AI to creatively propose novel chemical entities and formulations that target desired properties,” Smith told VentureBeat. “We hope that by seeding this open-source effort on GT4SD, we can help the scientific and technical communities more easily employ generative models for applications including the discovery of materials for climate and sustainability, design of new therapeutics and biomarkers, discovery [of] materials for next-generation computing devices, and more.”

Future opportunities and challenges for diffusion models

According to William Falcon, cofounder and CEO of Lightning AI, diffusion models will play an essential role in generative AI evolution as they have no appreciable disadvantages compared to previous architectures, a sole exception being that their generation is iterative and requires additional processing power.

“One area [where] I expect to see diffusion play a large role is in the buildout of VR and AR games and products,” he said. “We are already starting to see the community experimenting with diffusion-powered immersive environments and the generation of assets from individual shots. Asset generation has always been a big blocker in making virtual worlds thrive, and diffusion has the power to change everything there as well.”

Falcon said that although diffusion models unleash an entirely new dimension of creativity for people to express themselves, safety is and will continue to be a big theme.

“The standard safety filters are extremely bare-bones, and the datasets being used to train such models still sport a concerning amount of unsafe and biased material. Another methodological challenge is composition. In other words, controlling how different concepts are used together, either blended in the same subject or as distinct subjects side-by-side in the same creation,” he said.

Likewise, Fernando Lucini, global lead for data science & machine learning engineering at Accenture, said that the quality of generated images remains a challenge for the near future.

“I view this to be a problem between the combination of fidelity, meaning that a generated image looks reasonable to most people, and the perception of fidelity, which recognizes [that] what quality means to one person can differ from what it means to another,” Lucini told VentureBeat. ”We want images with high fidelity, especially if we’ve asked the model to produce a specific artistic style or a realistic item.”

Lucini believes that the future of these models is in generating imagery and video from plain text, which can play a role in evolving substantial generative machines that we can interact with more frequently.

“What we see in our daily lives, or what we can capture on a camera, can differ from an image generation, meaning that we have to contend with the fact that an image generation might have low fidelity and produce unwanted distortion, and that can take time to correct,” he said.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

With the machine-generated optimized conditions, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and collaborators in Poland and Canada doubled the average yield of a special, hard-to-optimize type of reaction linking carbon atoms together in pharmaceutically important molecules. The researchers say their system provides a platform that also could be used to find general conditions for other classes of reactions and solutions for similarly complex problems. They reported their findings in the journal Science.

""Generality is critical for automation, and thus making molecular innovation accessible even to nonchemists,"" said study co-leader Dr. Martin D. Burke, an Illinois professor of chemistry and of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine, as well as a medical doctor. ""The challenge is the haystack of possible reaction conditions is astronomical, and the needle is hidden somewhere inside. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and building-block chemistry to create a feedback loop, we were able to shrink the haystack. And we found the needle.""

Automated synthesis machines for proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA have revolutionized research and chemical manufacturing in those fields, but many chemicals of importance for pharmaceutical, clinical, manufacturing and materials applications are small molecules with complex structures, the researchers say.

Burke's group has pioneered the development of simple chemical building blocks for small molecules. His lab also developed an automated molecule-making machine that snaps together the buildings blocks to create a wide range of possible structures.

However, general reaction conditions to make the automated process broadly applicable have remained elusive.

""Traditionally, chemists customize the reaction conditions for each product they are trying to make,"" Burke said. ""The problem is that this is a slow and very specialist-dependent process, and very hard to automate because the machine would have to be optimized every time. What we really want are conditions that work almost every time, no matter what two things you're trying to snap together.""

An automated approach with generalized conditions could help standardize how some products are made, addressing the problem of reproducibility, said Illinois postdoctoral researcher Vandana Rathore, a co-first author of the study.

Burke's group teamed up with a group led by Bartosz A. Grzybowski at the Polish Academy of Sciences' Institute for Organic Chemistry, as well as the group of Alan Aspuru-Guzik at the University of Toronto, both leaders in using artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve chemical synthesis. The team integrated AI with the molecule machine to provide real-time feedback to the machine-learning system.

""To distinguish good and bad you need to know something about the bad, but people only publish the successes,"" Grzybowski said. Published studies reflect conditions that are popular or convenient, rather than the best, so a systematic approach that included diverse data and negative results was necessary, he said.

First, the team ran the entire matrix of possible combinations using the building-block chemistry through an algorithm to group together similar reactions. Then, the AI sent instructions, inputted to a machine in the Molecule Maker Lab located in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at Illinois, to produce representative reactions from each cluster. The information from those reactions fed back into the model; the AI learned from the data and ordered more experiments from the molecule machine.

""We were looking to see two things: an increase in yield and a decrease in uncertainty, for a broad spectrum of reactions,"" said Grzybowski, who now is at Ulsan Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea. ""This loop continued without us having to intervene until the problem was solved. Figuring out the generalized conditions for protein-synthesis machines took 30 years. This took us two months.""

The process identified conditions that doubled the average yield of a challenging class of reactions, called heteroaryl Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, crucial for many biological and materials-relevant compounds.

""There are all kinds of building block combinations that we didn't even study in our AI training, but because the AI had explored such a diverse space, it found good results even in those initially unexplored areas,"" said Illinois graduate student Nicholas H. Angello, a co-first author of the study.

The machine-learning process described in the paper also could be applied to other broad areas of chemistry to find the best reaction conditions for other types of small molecules or even larger organic polymers, the researchers say.

""There are so many different materials classes that we want to know, target and discover for different functional properties. The extension possibility of this approach to other similar reaction chemistry, other types of carbon-carbon links, is exciting,"" said study co-author Charles M. Schroeder, an Illinois professor of materials science and engineering and chemical and biomolecular engineering, and a Beckman Institute affiliate.

Register here.

Fable has unveiled The Simulation, a place where you can create and nurture AI characters and enable them to dwell on their own in different metaverse worlds.

Today, Fable is launching its first town in The Simulation, a place called AI Nouns Town, where owners of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can sign up and adopt AI characters. Rather than play in a world with AI characters, Fable is letting the AI characters play in the worlds. And if Fable puts enough of these worlds together, it can become a kind of metaverse (which is the biggest subject of our GamesBeat Summit Next 2022 event coming on Tuesday and Wednesday in San Francisco).

All you have to do is train them and let them loose in the world, said Edward Saatchi, CEO of Fable, which has won Emmy awards for its virtual reality characters. The Simulation represents a pivot away from AI chatbot characters that enabled one-on-one communication between AI characters and humans. Saatchi, the organizer of The Virtual Beings Summit coming on December 6, sees this as the next evolution of virtual beings, or artificial intelligence characters who behave like people or animals.

Instead, The Simulation is kind of like the world in the Ryan Reynolds movie Free Guy, where video game AI characters lived in their own world. In game terms, it’s like the non-player characters in Watch Dogs: Legion and The Sims, said Frank Carey, CTO of Fable, in an interview.

“We stopped thinking that the future was the movie Her, and started thinking that the future was Free Guy and Westworld and societies of AIs,” Saatchi said. “We want to maybe convince people that societies of AIs is a better thing to go after than chatbots and one-to-one, conversations.”

The problem with AI chatbots is they kind of pop into existence when you are talking to them and they then disappear after you are done talking to them. They have no conception of time, Saatchi said.

“They don’t really know what they did last week or have any plans to do something, and this gets frustrating over the course of time,” he said. “You notice that they lack three big things” coherence, persistence and memory. And also that that usually extremely boring to talk to. They can talk for hours, but it’s mind-numbing because they have no actual lives. They have a prompt, which is three or four paragraphs. And that’s really all that they have to refer to you to kind of improvise the stuff.”

Carey started thinking about running a simulation to make them more realistic.

“How do you actually create a real virtual being? That’s the mission that we’ve never wavered from. And, we just felt that one-to-one is not the right approach,” Saatchi said. “The idea today is to make a real virtual being more like Free Guy.”

AI Disneyland

AI characters can graduate from a world to the Grand Simulation.

And that was how they got to the idea of creating a land for different AI narratives.

Each land within The Simulation is kind of like the different lands within Disneyland. Only in this case, there is a different world for each different affiliated NFT. For instance, the company could have worlds dedicated to NFT art characters such as Bored Apes, Doodles, or Deadfellaz. Saatchi thinks of it as a “gonzo AI theme park,” or a Disneyland for NFTs.

The plan is to launch the first world in The Simulation in early 2023.

Saatchi notes there are tens of thousands of us who own millions of NFT characters. But those NFTs have no utility. They just sit in our wallets as collectibles. But Saatchi and his team — which includes cofounders Pete Billington, Jessica Shamash, and CTO Frank Carey — want to create a simulated world where those NFTs can wander and live as AI characters.

With Nouns Town, the world will use the same art style as the Nouns NFT project. The Nouns community already has a $40 million community treasury and NFT owners who have a focus on community service (funding trash pickups and city rejuvenation projects). Now those holders can go to fablesimulation.com to sign up for a whitelist to join the world.

Saatchi said the company hopes to have the top 75 NFT series for all NFT projects and more than a million AI characters.

Fable has adapted to the rapidly changing world of storytelling and virtual characters, and this represents a big change. It started making VR stories with interesting characters and engaging stories. Then it shifted from VR to virtual beings. Fable built chatbots like Lucy, a character from the company’s VR experience Wolves in the Walls, based on a Neil Gaiman short story.

And now this move is shifting away from having AI talking to real people to AI living among themselves. You can watch how they change and develop as if they were in a kind of fishbowl. The characters use AI such as modified GPT3, an AI model that uses deep learning to produce human-like conversations.

Fable generates a character given a prompt of a few paragraphs of words that are fed into the neural network. Usually, such conversations become boring and shallow, as the AI characters have no memory and so they can hold a conversation. But Saatchi said The Simulation will live update the AI prompt, as well as the ability for the prompt to query novel information stored in the simulation (“what were you doing an hour ago?”) so that AIs have reliable memories of what has happened to them.

The AI characters will be persistent, rather than popping into existence to answer each question. They will be coherent because they can refer to a growing corpus of correct information about themselves; in essence, they will have memories.

Is Lucy part of The Simulation?

Lucy is a virtual being created by Fable.

Saatchi said that Lucy will live on as a character in The Simulation. Fable started building the simulation in order to bring Lucy to life. Saatchi feels that virtual beings need to have the context of a daily life and the needs that drive them. As he saw when Lucy and Code Miko (a virtual character streamer played by a real person) played in Minecraft together, it’s also more fun interacting with AIs in virtual worlds, where both you and the AI are avatars than just talking to a chatbot on a screen. You can do things together.

“When we started on that quest, we felt that the movie Her by Spike Jonze offered an inspiring path of a relationship between an AI and a human, Saatchi said. “But we realized that to connect emotionally, virtual beings need real lives, and they need to operate in space and time, have bodies, needs and struggle with living, just like us. We started to look at Westworld, The Truman Show, The Matrix, and Free Guy as examples of societies of AIs or virtual beings, playing off each other and eventually mixing seamlessly with human beings.”

Saatchi believes that starting with the AIs in their own simulation, letting them learn from each other and then letting them enter The Grand Simulation, as equals of humans will work best. They can eventually metaverse with us. At that point, they will be like real people.

There could be mundane situations where a character is late to work. They can speed up and risk getting a speeding ticket or choose to call in sick or apologize to the boss.

“We have all these different personalities and they play out for that mission to be accomplished,” Saatchi said.

The ultimate goal is to create a truly intelligent virtual being that achieves AGI or artificial general intelligence. That’s like the Ryan Reynolds character becoming more human in Free Guy.

“We hope that one of these AIs in the simulation may grow to be the first truly intelligent AI,” Saatchi said. “We think of it as a hero’s journey. They shouldn’t be allowed to go to the grand simulation immediately. We have to think through what these challenges are that they need to go through. But they need to do something to leave that village and go into the wider world. Just like Truman leaves his simulation and goes into the wider world. And then we’ll repeat the same trick when you leave the grand simulation to go to that metaverse.”

And when those AIs reach a certain level of intelligence, they can graduate to a meta world, or something like a metaverse, where they can mingle with other evolved AI characters.

How does The Simulation work?

The Simulation puts NFTs to work by adding NFT characters into simulated worlds.

Saatchi sees The Simulation as a reimagined Web3 version of The Sims, built from scratch with the AI tools of today with natural language processing (NLP), synthetic speech, procedural animation, reinforcement learning, and computer vision.

“I have total respect for The Sims,” Saatchi said. “I think building a Web3 version of The Sims, built from scratch today with the AI tools that we have, across language or across synthetic speech, across systems design — I think that’s really powerful.”

It’s more like a parent-child relationship, where you the human are the parent and not the player.

That means that all AIs have needs that drive their behavior — from the bottom of Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (sleeping, eating) to self-actualization. The Simulation takes advantage of Fable’s Wizard Engine to power dialogue and language and animation.

Fable’s team loved the different characters that have come out of the explosion of excitement in NFTs in the last two years. But those NFTs are sitting inert in our cryptocurrency wallets, and that has made critics say these NFT collectibles are worthless. What if there was a simulation for every NFT character existing — that you could visit almost like an AI Disneyland?

“So far much of the debate around utility for NFT characters has centered around using them as 3D-rigged characters in the metaverse,” Saatchi said. “But is that really something that holders will do regularly?”

Perhaps for 10 minutes to 20 minutes per month, they might use the characters to attend a virtual concert. By creating a Simulation where the NFT lives persistently and grows, Fable wants to bring the NFT to life and let you play and interact with the character at any time.

Nouns Town

Nouns Town is the first world in The Simulation.

In Nouns Town, there will be an AI home for every Noun. Each day the Nouns gather in the central park to welcome the new Noun from the auction and to live lives of service including trash pickups around town and helping other Nouns that are down.

Each world in The Simulation will feel different and reflect the core values of each series. The Deadfellaz need to eat brains, Nouns have a need to be of service and kind to each other, and Bored Apes have a need to socialize and have fun.

Imagine exploring the world of the Lord of The Rings where each community has its own rituals, culture, and history — like the elves, dwarves, humans and hobbits, Saatchi said. In the Grand Simulation, they all mix — so that a CloneX might fall in love with a Doodle or fight a Noun.

Some NFTs are created by companies that control intellectual property and Fable would partner with them as “Imagineers” with the company to create their simulation. Some are CC0 meaning that the IP is open, in those cases Fable would act as Imagineers with the community of holders.

In each case it’s important to think through the core values, rituals, lore, culture of the simulation, Saatchi said. Each simulation should reflect the core values of the NFT series. That will make it all the more interesting when AIs start leaving their simulation to go on a “hero’s journey” to meet AIs from other simulations/cultures. Imagine leaving your little village and going out into the wide world to explore and meet really different people – like a Doodle meeting an Ape, Saatchi said.

What do humans do?

You can watch what your AI characters are doing in The Simulation.

Fable created a training element for The Simulation that is more like a videogame. You can rate responses from AIs as well as behaviors. Players are incentivized to put more effort into training their AI.

Owners of each character can interact with the simulation by nurturing the AIs. In the opening phase of your character’s life, they will need a lot of help — eating, sleeping, having fun — but quickly they’ll learn to fend more for themselves and your goal will be to help them self-actualize and be happy. You can help the AI characters with important life decisions like having kids, how to ask for a promotion or playing video games together.

You can read the AI characters’ diaries, messages and conversations they’ve had that they want your advice on, and even hold dialogue with them. You can also jump in as a ghost and interact with parts of the world, including with games within the world that they can play with other AIs.

Fable has about 20 people. Some of the work goes into creating the variety of characters available for adoption.

An AI Soul is the mechanism that allows avatars to enter the simulation. So a Noun would be paired with one of The Simulation’s Souls, which comes with a personality type, an AI prompt, and a core emotion that influences how they’ll behave in the simulation. Some souls are connected to each other as soulmates and will seek each other out. Some have sold their souls and are more mischievous and dangerous.

“We design the souls based on personality types with dominant emotions and even mystical qualities,” said Shamash in an interview. “And so these souls are packed with meaning and lore. We have old souls and new souls, even souls that sold their soul in a past life and impacts them to this day.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

San Francisco, California-based Monte Carlo, a company known for its data observability capabilities, today announced a “data reliability dashboard” to help business users better understand and communicate the reliability of their data assets.

Announced at Impact 2022, Monte Carlo’s annual conference, the new dashboard comes as a crucial addition to the company’s flagship platform – which is already in use by several hundred enterprise clients. The platform uses machine learning (ML) to detect data downtime — which are the recipe for broken dashboards and artificial intelligence (AI) models — and then provides alerts with required insights to help teams assess the impact and fix the root cause of the problem as soon as possible.

According to a recent survey by Wakefield Research, bad data affects over 26% of enterprise revenue and takes more than 40% of data engineers’ working hours. Now, while Monte Carlo’s capabilities have been tackling this problem, enterprise users have long missed the ability to gain a broader bird’s-eye view of their data quality and the status of efforts to improve it. This is where the new dashboard steps in.

“Data leaders know data reliability is important, but typically lack the tools to measure it. Monte Carlo’s Data Reliability Dashboard will bridge this divide and provide better tracking for critical (data) KPIs…,” Lior Gavish, CTO and cofounder at Monte Carlo, said. “This new functionality will also give data practitioners and leaders a common language to measure and improve the quality of their data platforms, as well as the ROI across their data products.”

What kind of KPIs will data reliability dashboard track?

The dashboard, set to be available in the fourth quarter of 2022, is designed to provide insights around three key areas: stack coverage, quality metrics and incident metrics and usage.

Under stack coverage, it will paint an overall picture of data monitoring and observability practice in place, helping enterprises figure out what’s missing and adopt operational best practices. Then, as part of quality metrics, the solution will look at the five pillars of data observability — freshness, distribution, volume, schema and lineage — and generate notable data reliability trends over time. This will help companies see if their reliability investments are working or not.

Data reliability dashboard user metrics

Finally, with incident metrics and usage, the dashboard will provide critical action insights such as time to detection and time to resolution of data incidents, as well as user engagement metrics with the said incidents. This, as Monte Carlo said, will help teams measure and improve their efforts on the incident response side, thus minimizing data downtime and optimizing data trust.

What’s more at Impact 2022?

Along with the data reliability dashboard, Monte Carlo announced additional capabilities for its platform at the Impact summit, including visual incident resolution, which enables data engineers to use an interactive map of their data lineage to diagnose and troubleshoot data breakages.

The capability brings critical troubleshooting data, from data freshness to query logs, in a unified view of affected tables and their upstream dependencies, allowing data engineers to correlate all the factors that might contribute to an incident and accelerate the time to resolution.

The company also announced an integration with Power BI, allowing data engineering teams to properly triage data incidents that impact Power BI dashboards and users, as well as proactively ensure that changes to upstream tables and schema can be executed safely.

Analysts cited Meta's forecast for capital spending, which will weigh on its cash flow.

Morgan Stanley downgraded Meta stock Thursday, a day after Facebook's parent company reported a decline in revenue for the second straight quarter and offered capital-spending guidance that turned heads on Wall Street.

Analysts cut their rating on the stock to equal-weight from overweight and slashed their price target to $105 from $205.

Morgan Stanley wrote in a note that while the bank doesn't like to make ratings changes in a reactionary fashion, ""we think META's latest results and forward capex guidance are thesis changing and likely to weigh on the shares for some period...until the market can feel confident in execution and return on invested capital from these outsized investments.""

In particular, analysts pointed to Meta's guidance for $69 billion in capital expenditures over two years, saying that indicates ""structurally higher capital intensity."" Even the low end of Meta's spending outlook for 2023 alone was $7 billion higher than expected, they added.

The massive spending wave is being driven by investments in artificial intelligence-driven data centers, as Meta scrambles to adapt to a new social-media landscapes that's now dominated by short-form video, according to the note.

Shares of Meta fell as much as 25% Thursday, and erased roughly $65 billion from the company's market capitalization. By midday, the stock was down 22%, trading at about $101.

Meta, formerly known as Facebook, pivoted away from a focus on its flagship social media site toward big spending on the metaverse to further delve into the Web3 space in 2021.

But optimism from management surrounding the lack of layoffs and insistence on the future of Reality Labs, among other factors, was not adequate to offset disappointing guidance for next quarter and year ahead, according to a separate note Thursday from strategists at JPMorgan.

Eventually, the upside from Meta's investments will show up in the company's quarterly reports, and there are early signs that Reels — Meta's answer to TikTok — is showing some improvement, Morgan Stanley said. But gains in revenue and engagement may not show significant advances until well into 2023.

25,"Renault-backed Beyonca EV venture touts health monitoring, targets Audi in China - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/pf/resources/images/reuters/reuters-default.png?d=117,30/10/2022,"Beyonca, a start-up founded by a group of former Volkswagen executives, plans to take on the likes of Audi and BMW in China from next year with a new premium electric vehicle, betting that features such as health monitoring will appeal to buyers.",https://www.reuters.com/technology/renault-backed-beyonca-ev-venture-touts-health-monitoring-targets-audi-china-2022-10-30/,"













BEIJING, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Beyonca, a start-up founded by a group of former Volkswagen executives, plans to take on the likes of Audi and BMW in China from next year with a new premium electric vehicle, betting that features such as health monitoring will appeal to buyers.

Led by current Renault China CEO Soh Weiming and backed by Renault (RENA.PA) and Dongfeng Motor (0489.HK), two-year-old Beyonca plans to unveil its first production car in the first quarter of next year with deliveries from 2024, Soh told Reuters.

The company rolled out a concept car on Sunday with features such as sensors that can monitor a driver's blood pressure, alarms to alert doctors employed by Beyonca of an emergency and an autonomous driving function to help park the car.

Soh, Beyonca's chairman, said the company was targeting the high-end premium segment, where they would compete with models such as Audi's A8L, BMW's 7 Series and Mercedes' S Class.

""We need to confront them,"" Soh said, referring to the three premium German brands. ""With the medicals and all those things we are to deploy, we'd have a chance.""

Beyonca will begin production in China but plans to build an overseas plant within five years to serve markets including the Middle East, ASEAN countries and Europe, he said, adding that it aims to sell 100,000 EVs annually with three to five models available by ""a few years after 2025"".

Soh said that by the time the car was launched, third generation EV technology would offer faster charging times and longer driving ranges.

DIFFICULT TIME

The launch, however, comes as signs of softening demand emerge in the world's biggest auto market and competition in the country's EV sector intensifies. Tesla recently slashed prices in China in a move analysts said could start a price war.

Soh acknowledged the difficult backdrop but pointed to steady growth in the premium car segment, which he said had potential annual sales of 3 million cars in China.

He declined to say how much Beyonca had raised from investors or how large a stake Renault and Dongfeng held in the company.

Renault confirmed it had invested, saying it would enhance the group's transformation from auto maker to a tech giant with cars at its centre. Dongfeng did not respond to a request for comment.

""Our idea is to create something right under a more nimble corporate structure...What we achieved in more than one year here would take seven or eight years at a conventional automaker,"" Soh said.

Other than Soh, who was a long-serving executive at Volkswagen overseeing its China operation, Beyonca's founding team includes former Volkswagen board member Christian Klingler, Audi's former R&D department head Hans-Joachim Rothenpieler and Bentley's former senior designer Dirk van Braeckel.

Beyonca is headquartered in Beijing and has a design center in Munich and an artificial intelligence development hub in Singapore.

But Russia has struggled to develop the jet and put it into production.

Russian officials now say that an upgraded Su-57 made its debut flight this month.

Since it was officially unveiled more than a decade ago, Moscow has touted the capabilities of its fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter as exceeding those of even the United States Air Force's Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.

However, Russia has struggled with the development of the Su-57 (NATO reporting name ""Felon"") in recent years, and just 10 test prototypes and six serially produced aircraft have been produced — of which two have been lost in crashes during test flights.

Despite those setbacks, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), a subsidiary of the state-owned tech conglomerate Rostec, has continued the fighter's development — and this week announced that an upgraded Su-57 made its debut flight earlier this month.

""The Sukhoi Design Bureau within the UAC carries out work for further developing the Su-57,"" the UAC press office said via a statement to Tass. ""On October 21, the upgraded Su-57 fifth-generation plane performed its debut flight at the Gromov Flight Testing Institute's airfield. The aircraft was flown by the Sukhoi Design Bureau test pilot, Hero of Russia Sergey Bogdan. The flight lasted 56 minutes and ran without any snags.""

According to the reports, the improved Su-57M fighter jet was testing onboard equipment with extended functionality, as well as the crew's AI support, along with a broad range of new types of weapons.

""The aircraft also offers a possibility to install a second-stage engine,"" the statement added. The codename for this initiative is believed to be ""Megapolis,"" while the current Su-57 research and development were dubbed ""Stolitsa"" (""capital"").

There have been reports that the most significant aspect of this upgrade is the installation of new ""izdeliye 30"" engines, which can provide a thrust of around 16 tonnes in place of the current AL-41F-1 (izdeliye 117) engines that can provide a thrust of 14.5 tonnes.

An AI copilot?

One of the notable features of the Su-57 is the artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which could act as a virtual co-pilot, gather data from the aircraft's numerous sensors, and provide crucial information to the human operator.

AI has been seen as a crucial component of the future ""sixth-generation"" fighters, where onboard computer clusters that are composed of high-performance ruggedized processors could transform these aircraft into data centers in the sky.

This could help ensure faster decision-making for the pilots.

""AI is already an integral part of modern fighter jets,"" said technology industry analyst Roger Entner of Recon Analytics.

""To be more maneuverable, modern jets are inherently unstable in flight,"" Entner told 19FortyFive. ""The only way they fly straight is through AI. Next-generation AI will take their active role even further to improve survivability and mission capabilities.""

Of course, the issue is how Russia — which is struggling to keep its current military hardware equipped with the latest microprocessors — will be able to mass produce such aircraft.

There have already been reports that the Kremlin has had to resort to taking chips from consumer appliances to use in its tanks and other vehicles. It may thus take a highly advanced AI to help Moscow figure out how to solve this problem.

32,7 Ways White-Label Providers Can Help Grow Your Business,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1666888037-GettyImages-1028771818.jpg,28/10/2022,More businesses are turning to white-label companies to complement their own core competencies. Here's why.,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-ways-white-label-providers-can-help-grow-your-business/436221,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

In today's competitive market, growing the number of clients may create management issues and inhibit your ability to focus on providing top-notch customer service. To , you must find ways to stand out from the crowd and offer value your competitors cannot match.

As a business owner, you wouldn't want to turn away any business, but you also don't want to sacrifice the quality of your services. Hiring more employees is one way to meet the demands of a growing clientele, but this can add significant overhead costs. Moreover, retaining quality talent can be difficult, as larger companies often poach good employees.

Partnering with a white-label provider is a cost-effective way to scale your business without high overhead costs. It is an effective solution to broaden your service portfolio and fill critical technology or labor gaps.

Consequently, here are seven ways white-label providers can help to improve your bottom line and contribute to the growth of your business.

Related: 5 Reasons White Labeling Is a Great Digital Marketing Strategy

1. Scale services quickly and easily

The focal point of any online service business is to provide services that help clients grow their businesses. As the demand for digital services has increased, so has the need for businesses to provide a broader range of services.

To remain competitive, companies need to offer more than just traditional services. For instance, if you own a digital marketing agency, you cannot restrict yourself to just search engine optimization, pay-per-click or social media marketing. Clients now expect companies to offer a comprehensive suite of digital services and funnel integration to help them achieve their desired results.

A full-service white-label provider can be a one-stop solution that businesses provide to their clients. Despite the industry you operate in, white-label providers offer a plethora of services that can help your business meet the needs of even the most demanding clients. This enables businesses to quickly and easily scale their service portfolio without making a significant investment in new resources.

Moreover, this strategy can also help companies to tap into new markets and geographies.

2. Reduce operational costs

Due to high inflation and a weak economy, many businesses are facing an uncertain future. To survive, business owners are finding ways to reduce their operational costs.

Running a successful company requires a significant investment in human resources, technology and permanent assets. Most companies also need to generate a healthy profit margin to reinvest in their business and drive growth. That's where white-label providers can help.

White-label services are typically provided on a pay-as-you-go basis, which can help business owners save on upfront costs. They often have economies of scale that enable them to offer their services at a lower cost than agencies could provide on their own. Some providers also don't require signing long-term contracts.

In addition, white-label providers bear the cost of tools and technologies. As a result, businesses can avoid the high costs associated with investing in new technology.

3. Create additional revenue streams

The recent economic situation has made it more difficult for businesses to rely on traditional revenue sources. This has forced many businesses to look for new ways to generate revenue to stay afloat.

Creating additional revenue streams can be challenging, but a full-service white-label provider can help. They can provide businesses with an opportunity to generate revenue from new services and products.

Moreover, comprehensive providers often have additional resources and training to help businesses sell their services more effectively. Businesses can generate new revenue streams without compromising the quality of their existing services.

4. Improve marketing churn rate

Churn rate — the percentage of customers who cancel their services within a certain period of time — is a major issue for online businesses. According to a study by Recurly Research, B2C subscription businesses experience higher customer churn rates than B2B businesses. For digital marketing agencies, it goes up to 20%.

The reasons why customers may decide to cancel their services can vary, but it often has to do with the quality or performance of the services they're receiving. If a business isn't proactive in meeting its client's needs, they're likely to churn.

Veteran white-label providers usually have hundreds or thousands of projects under their portfolio and have accrued strategies to maintain clients. Their expertise can help to improve an agency's marketing churn rate.

5. Enhance service delivery

Market trends are constantly changing, and businesses need to change with them to remain relevant. This can be a challenge, especially for small businesses that don't have the resources to invest in new services. The situation is even worse for digital marketing agencies.

Digital marketing platforms like Google and Facebook are constantly changing their algorithms. This impacts the way agencies need to deliver their services. Take Google's recent helpful content update, for example. This update means that agencies need to create more helpful and informative content for their clients if they want to rank high in the search results.

As a result, businesses must continuously update their service delivery models to stay ahead of the curve.

White-label providers help online businesses enhance their service delivery. A good service provider will have the resources and expertise to keep up with the latest changes in the industry. This enables them to provide their clients with the best possible services.

6. Strengthen brand positioning and recognition

As mentioned earlier, today's market is highly competitive. There are thousands of businesses out there vying for the attention of clients. To make matters worse, new businesses are popping up all the time.

In such a competitive landscape, businesses must have a strong brand. How you position yourself in the market will determine whether you can attract and retain clients.

Unfortunately, building a strong brand can be challenging, especially for small and even mid-size companies. You may not have the resources or expertise to develop an effective branding strategy.

That's where white-label marketing can help. Their services can help businesses distinguish themselves from their competitors and build a strong brand that's recognizable in the market. Not only will this help to attract new clients, but it will also help to retain existing ones.

7. Access to tools and proprietary technologies

To successfully run and manage a business, you need to have access to a variety of tools and technologies. For instance, if you want to be able to track website visitors, manage social media accounts and create marketing campaigns, you need the right software.

The problem is that these tools and technologies can be expensive. They often require a monthly subscription and the costs can quickly add up. For small businesses, these costs can be prohibitive.

In addition, artificial intelligence and machine learning have become increasingly important in digital marketing. These technologies are being used to create more personalized and targeted marketing campaigns to acquire leads.

As an individual business owner, it can be difficult to keep up with the latest changes in the industry. You may not have the resources to invest in new tools and technologies.

Fortunately, white-label marketing providers can help. The right providers have access to the latest tools and technologies and are also heavily invested in artificial intelligence and machine learning to create more personalized marketing campaigns for their clients. Leading white-label providers also develop their own proprietary tools and technologies.

SEOUL, Oct 27 (Reuters) - As Samsung Electronics' de facto leader Jay Y. Lee steps up as chairman, daunting tasks await the executive seeking to build on the work of his father, who turned a copycat appliance maker into the world's biggest chip and smartphone manufacturer.

Samsung (005930.KS) said on Thursday its board of directors appointed Lee as executive chairman, a symbolic move confirming that South Korea's most valuable company will be officially run by the third generation of its founding family.

The appointment follows his release from jail last year for bribery convictions, of which he has since been pardoned, allowing him to formally assume the leadership role he has held since his father, the late patriarch and Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised in 2014. The elder Lee died in 2020.

Lee, 54, has been vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, the crown jewel of South Korea's biggest business conglomerate, since 2012.

""As I reflect on his (Lee senior) life...I am filled with a deep sense of responsibility to preserve his legacy, and to build on it – for our future,"" Lee said in a memo shared with Samsung employees on Thursday.

""Without a doubt, we are at a pivotal moment...Now is the time to plan our next move. Now is the time to act, to be bold and unwavering in our focus.""

Samsung, a $280 billion global tech giant, faces mounting business headwinds amid a sharp downturn in global tech demand, caused by soaring inflation, interest rates and a gloomy economic outlook.

Samsung reported a 31% drop in third-quarter profit on Thursday and said geopolitical uncertainties were likely to dampen demand until early 2023.

Kyungmook Lee, professor at Graduate School of Business, Seoul National University, said the new chairman needs to focus on businesses with the greatest growth potential such as contract chip manufacturing, and new areas such as artificial intelligence.

""Also, Samsung is still rather top-down,"" said Kyungmook Lee, who co-authored 'The Samsung Way'. ""He faces the task of changing the corporate culture to fit the current times.""

The foundations of Samsung's current global top position in memory chips, smartphones and televisions were established during the late Lee's era.

Semiconductors remain its biggest cash cow, but business conditions have become much more complex amid U.S. efforts to slow China's advance in chip technology.

That is a major business risk for Samsung, which counts both China and the United States as major markets.

Lee is prioritising growth in Samsung's foundry business and looking to build contract chip manufacturing as a major revenue stream and dethrone Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) from the top position in logic chips by 2030.

But the plan is off to a rough start, with low production yields in its new process inviting complaints from some clients in recent years.

Samsung is also looking to expand its biopharmaceuticals and 5G network equipment businesses.

OUT OF JAIL

Since joining Samsung more than three decades ago in 1991, Lee has held various senior roles, including chief operating officer and vice chairman, and overseen key businesses such as a now dissolved flat-screen joint venture with Sony Group Corp .

Critics claim Lee doesn't have experience, lacks his father's charisma and hasn't made a major mark that can be counted in his achievements.

""Until now, Lee hasn't really shown his own management style,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of analysis firm Leaders Index.

But Samsung insiders say his quiet, urbane manner disguises a steely determination Lee will need if he is to grow Samsung.

Lee has generally shunned the limelight, with no official Twitter or Facebook accounts and little known of him outside the company, other than a divorce in 2009.

Lee has a degree in East Asian History from Seoul National University and an MBA from Japan's Keio University.

As an only son, Lee was groomed by his father to take over the core business of Samsung Group, which his grandfather founded in 1938. But legal troubles in recent years forced him to step back from frontline management.

From late 2016, he was dogged by a bribery trial and conviction, which led to 18 months in jail. He was parolled last year and eventually pardoned in August, allowing him greater freedom in his management role.

While Lee has shaken most of his legal woes, an ongoing trial over fraud and stock manipulation charges hangs over him.

""My shoulders have become very heavy,"" he told reporters as he left a court hearing on Thursday. ""I will create a company that is trusted and loved by the people a bit more.""

That did little to cheer investors with Samsung shares underperforming a 1.5% rise in the benchmark index (.KS11). Shares in construction affiliate Samsung C&T (028260.KS), in which Lee owns a 18% stake, rose as much as 7.1%.

Among other things, it utilizes dual cameras and artificial intelligence to spot swimmers who may be in trouble.

Manufactured by Israeli company Coral Smart Pool, the main Mylo device is installed in one corner of the user's pool. It's equipped with both above- and below-water cameras, along with a water pressure sensor.

If the pool hasn't been used for at least five minutes, and the cameras/sensor detect a person approaching the pool and then getting in, the Wi-Fi-enabled Mylo sends a push notification to the user's smartphone.

Additionally – even when there are multiple people already in the pool – the device's AI-based computer vision system is reportedly capable of detecting if any one of those people is in a state of ""pre-drowning,"" based on their telltale frantic movements. When this happens, the user is notified via a smartphone alert (which includes a live feed from the cameras), and by audible alarms which sound from wireless modules located both at the pool and in the home.

The setup is also capable of visually detecting individuals who remain motionless for at least 15 seconds while underwater. In this case, a louder alarm is sounded, indicating that a more immediate response is required. Even at night, if the pool isn't lit, the water pressure sensor will still detect entries and respond by sending alerts.

Mylo's underwater camera has a maximum effective visual range of 30 ft (9 m), depending on water clarity Coral Smart Pool

Mylo is available now for preorder, at an introductory price of US$999. It should ship next April, and ultimately have a retail price of $1,499. Coral Smart Pool does stress that the system ought to be used as an added layer of safety, and not as a substitute for human supervision.

It's demonstrated in the video below.

36,"AI isn’t choosing our artistic future, we are",https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DALL·E-2022-10-26-11.07.11-768x768.png,29/10/2022,"Humans can ensure creative growth continues by supporting and equitably growing the arts, education, libraries, and culture.",https://thebulletin.org/2022/10/ai-isnt-choosing-our-artistic-future-we-are/,"Illustration generated by OpenAI’s DALL-E 2.

Like other technologies that have come before it, artificial intelligence, commonly known as AI, is changing art forms that have existed for millennia. It will also be instrumental in the creation of art forms not yet imagined. In the future, there will be three or four types of intelligences creating art: human artists, humans and AI working collaboratively, machine learning models that don’t require human initiation but still lack sentience, and finally, in the event technologists create truly sentient artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence or AGI capable of self-creating art. In all cases, it’s unlikely that AI will destroy art, but it will certainly transform it—a process that has already begun. Humans are making choices about how that will happen, and they are making those choices right now.

In the late 19th century, the camera didn’t destroy painting, but it did change the world of visual art. Freed from the pressure to convincingly depict reality, artists embarked on experiments with aesthetics and meaning. In the early 20th century, the readymade (the use of found and manufactured objects as art) didn’t destroy sculpture but released some artists from narrow notions of authorship and craftsmanship. This liberated sculptors to focus on theory and concept.

So, one might say the world has always asked existential questions about new technologies. Of course, it’s not entirely accurate to compare machine learning to a 19th-century camera that does not make decisions and cannot learn—or learn to operate itself. Merging human practices with machine learning, as we move towards a future of AGI, edges humanity towards a visible horizon where human and machine intelligences intersect and interact. Or is it a precipice?

For her project, “ماه طلعت، Moon-faced,” Allahyari uses a carefully researched and chosen series of keywords with a multimodal AI model to generate a series of videos from the Qajar Dynasty painting archive (1786-1925). Through this collaboration, the machine program learns to paint new, genderless portraits, in an effort to undo and repair a history of Westernization that ended the course of nonbinary gender representation in the Persian visual culture. (Morehshin Allahyari, ماه طلعت، MOON-FACED, 2022. Video and text courtesy of the artist.)

Today, the labor of visualization can be quickly accomplished by AI, raising questions like which new forms of creativity this might free some artists to pursue, and what their next experiments could reveal. Already, contemporary artists like Mario Klingeman, Sasha Stiles, Lauren Lee McCarthy, Morehshin Allahyari, Carla Gannis, and Connie Bakshi are examining this new potential by collaborating with machines; building their own training sets to demonstrate bias; and generally helping the world talk about how deep learning and neural networks are affecting humans, both today and in a variety of speculative futures. Far from working towards the destruction of art, these artists are using AI to expand the field of creativity.

But it’s also worth a critical examination of how humans will be used in return. Humans design the models and generally provide the training sets. It’s already easy to see that just scraping the internet for training data encodes explicit bias that endangers marginalized communities. It is imperative today to design the training process for Ais with intention, rather than turning a blind eye and hoping for the best.

In addition, the inputs for current machine learning regimes come from the same artists whose paid work the models may replace: illustrators, designers, writers, composers, translators.

That said, if artists and their supporters are dedicated to systems that advance culture rather than cannibalize it, AI can be an incredible opportunity for learning and collaboration. That’s a big if. The systems for training AIs are far from set, and those who create artificial intelligence programs are making critical decisions right now.

Today, AI-generated images are created by models that scrape existing images produced through creative labor (with their viewpoints and biases), along with responses to those images, essentially creating variations on pre-existing images and stylistic choices. While this process offers the opportunity for collaboration and learning, it also has drawn reasonablepushback from artists whose work has been used as training data without permission or compensation. Often, artists’ names—or the styles they helped create—are even used as prompts. And while AI is routinely credited as a co-creator, the human creators whose work fed the machine often are not mentioned or paid.

Fundamentally, it’s problematic to create a system that scrapes creative labor, then expect that material to keep producing to feed the next generation of algorithms. In other words, if the AI-powered creators are starved of inputs, there’s no reason to believe those outputs will continue to evolve. If companies are using human labor to feed machines, who is designing the ethical framework, who is enforcing it, and who is studying the impact? If the answer to any of these questions is whoever can make the most money in the shortest time, by paying the least for creative labor, then yes: The arts sector will suffer, both human and machine. As Jeanette Winterson points out in “Love(Lace) Actually,” from her 2021 collection, 12 Bytes: How We Got Here. Where We Might Go Next, there is great potential for human-AI collaborations in novel-writing software. But without Virginia Woolf, GPT-3 will not produce her.

“… if I type in: Cat falls down mineshaft and discovers a secret world of giant mice with computing skills, novel-Writer will help with all the components of character (probably a lot of characters if they are mice), and plot twists – and yippee, I have written a novel (about mice). On the other hand, if I put in: Young man in the reign of Elizabeth the First wakes up one morning in Turkey as a woman, I probably won’t write Virginia Woolf’s Orlando. Anyway, it’s been done.”

If creative growth is to continue, now is the time to invest resources to support and equitably grow the arts, education, libraries, and culture—rather than taking the easy bait and allowing a few corporations to scrape existing artistic troves now for all they’re worth, and perhaps one day sell them back to advertisers. Humankind has built a civilization of enormous wealth and capabilities, though it is not equally distributed. Innovators and visionaries in the tech and art world have the ability to choose the world they want. AI isn’t making that choice—people are.

“As an artist that works with code,” writes Lauren Lee McCarthy, “I think in terms of scripts, both the social and technical ones.” In LAUREN, McCarthy performs the role of a personal assistant without volition, imitating the role of (usually female-voiced) programs like Alexa or Siri. Instead of shouting at an AI, participants shout (and sometimes, softly speak) for Lauren, who answers the requests without judgment. “I attempt to be better than an AI, understanding them as a person and taking action in anticipation of their needs and desires.” Lauren Lee McCarthy, LAUREN, 2017. (Video: LAUREN Testimonials, 2017, directed by David Leonard.)

I don’t wring my hands over the idea of transformational change in art. In 50 years, art may be as unrecognizable to me, today, as Christo and Jean-Claude’s wrapped Reichstag would be to a European court painter. Yet, that court painter would find much to recognize in Amy Sheridan’s painting of Michelle Obama. Today, society recognizes the merits of both artworks. One doesn’t negate the other.

So those who make and support art should embrace this technology, yes, and learn from it, collaborate with it—and also make conscious decisions about the future. If the wealth generated by an AI workforce is used to create income security for those who need it, for example, the world might see an AI-enhanced explosion of creativity and diversity in art. This type of explosion would see exciting and enriching new forms of storytelling, community, and criticism.

Now, as in the past, art is made for humans. People love it for its beauty, for asking questions and subverting answers, for challenging society, for sounding alarms and sometimes, for simply making individual human beings feel seen. Even as humans merge with machines, it’s hard to see why they would stop creating or loving art.

In 2015, the internet was flooded with images created with Deep Dream, a program that used a neural network to find and enhance patterns in input images. Today, artists like Gretta Louw use the technology with a heavy dose of metacommentary.

Karen Bakker, a professor at the University of British Columbia, recently revealed this technology is being used to communicate with honeybees, dolphins and elephants and offered up a warning regarding the development.

“Now, this raises a very serious ethical question, because the ability to speak to other species sounds intriguing and fascinating, but it could be used either to create a deeper sense of kinship, or a sense of dominion and manipulative ability to domesticate wild species that we’ve never as humans been able to previously control,” Bakker said in an interview published with Vox.

She pointed to the use of artificial intelligence to communicate with honeybees in Germany.

“A research team in Germany encoded honeybee signals into a robot that they sent into a hive,” Bakker said.

“That robot is able to use the honeybees’ waggle dance communication to tell the honeybees to stop moving, and it’s able to tell those honeybees where to fly to for a specific nectar source.”

“The next stage in this research is to implant these robots into honeybee hives so the hives accept these robots as members of their community from birth.”

At that point, Bakker emphasized that humans would have “an unprecedented degree of control” over those hives, basically “domesticating” them.

“This creates the possibility of exploitive use of animals. And there’s a long history of the military use of animals, so that’s one path that I think raises a lot of alarm bells,” she said.

For Bakker, who further discusses the recent technology in her book The Sounds of Life: How Digital Technology Is Bringing Us Closer to the Worlds of Animals and Plants, these concerns should not stop scientists from pursuing communication with animals.

“But the hope is that with these ethics in place, in the future, we — you and I, ordinary people — will have a lot more ability to tune into the sounds of nature, and to understand what we’re hearing,” she said.

“And I think what that does is create a real sense of awe and wonder and also a feeling of profound kinship. That’s where I hoped we would take these technologies.”

In the Vox interview, Bakker noted that the use of AI in communicating with animals is very different from how humans have tried to in the past.

For example, she pointed to teaching primates the human language or sign language, calling this a “very human-centered view.”

Now, the research and technology is focused on the behaviors and patterns of different species.

Bakker explained that the process begins with recording sounds that animals and plants make to detect patterns and “associate those with behaviors too attempt to determine whether there’s complex information being conveyed by the sounds.”

“What [these researchers] are doing is not trying to teach those species human language, but rather compiling, essentially, dictionaries of signals and then attempting to understand what those signals mean within those species,” she told the outlet.

So far, Bakker said that the research has determined elephants have different signals for honeybees – which it considers a threat – and humans.

Even further, elephants can also distinguish between nonthreatening humans and threatening humans.

“It’s funny, humans as a species tend to believe that what we cannot observe does not exist,” Bakker said.

“So a lot of these sounds were literally right in front of our ears. But because of a tendency, especially in Western science, to privilege sight over sound, we simply hadn’t listened for them.”",artificial intelligence,the-sun.com

The company operates through two segments: Graphics and Compute & Networking. It sells its products to original equipment and device manufacturers, independent software vendors, internet and cloud service providers, mapping companies, and other ecosystem participants.

The company reported disappointing fiscal 2023 second-quarter results and provided a weak outlook for the third quarter. Its revenue is expected to be $5.90 billion, plus or minus $118 million, which accounts for a nearly 12% sequential decline. Gaming and Professional Visualization revenue is expected to decline sequentially as OEMs and channel partners reduce inventory levels to align with slowing demand.

Moreover, increasing export regulations are impacting NVDA. On October 7, new export restrictions were imposed on U.S. chipmakers, including NVDA, to prevent American technology from advancing China’s military power. The rules will require the companies to obtain a license from the Commerce Department to export advanced chips and chip-manufacturing equipment to Chinese entities.

Furthermore, last month, the U.S. government blocked NVDA from exporting two of its top computing chips, A100 and H100 graphic processing units, for artificial intelligence (AI) work to China. The company stated that the ban is expected to impact its revenue by $400 million in the current quarter.

The stock has plunged 33.4% over the past six months and 56% year-to-date to close the last trading session at $132.61. It is currently trading 61.7% below its 52-week high of $346.47, which it hit on November 22, 2021.

Here’s what could influence NVDA’s performance in the upcoming months:

Deteriorating Financials

NVDA’s non-GAAP gross profit declined 29.1% year-over-year to $3.07 billion for the fiscal 2023 second quarter ended July 31, 2022. Its non-GAAP operating expenses increased 38.1% year-over-year to $1.75 billion.

The company’s non-GAAP net income fell 50.7% year-over-year to $1.29 billion. In addition, its non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.51, down 51% year-over-year.

Unfavorable Analyst Estimates

Analysts expect NVDA’s revenue for the fiscal 2023 third quarter (ending October 2022) to decline 17.7% year-over-year to $5.85 billion. The consensus earnings per share estimate of $0.71 for the current quarter indicates a decline of 39.5% from the prior-year period. Likewise, the company’s EPS for the ongoing year (ending January 2023) is expected to come in at $3.36, down 24.3% year-over-year.

In addition, analysts expect the company’s revenue and EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending April 2023) to decline 19.1% and 32.9% year-over-year to $6.70 billion and $0.91, respectively.

Stretched Valuation

In terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, NVDA is currently trading at 30.42x, 84.7% higher than the industry average of 16.47x. The stock’s forward EV/Sales multiple of 11.41 is 342% higher than the industry average of 12.58. Also, its forward EV/EBITDA of 49.45x is 320.4% higher than the industry average of 11.76x.

In addition, in terms of forward Price/Sales, the stock is currently trading at 12.21x, 387.3% higher than the industry average of 2.51x. Its forward Price/Cash Flow multiple of 44.68 is 168.9% higher than the industry average of 16.62.

High Profitability

NVDA’s trailing-12-month gross profit margin of 60.45% is 20.1% higher than the 50.35% industry average. Its trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 35.91% is 196% higher than the 12.13% industry average. Likewise, the stock’s trailing-12-month net income margin of 26.03% compares to the industry average of 3.71%.

Furthermore, NVDA’s trailing-12-month ROCE, ROTC, and ROTA of 34.41%, 16.81%, and 17.81% compare to the industry averages of 6.51%, 3.80%, and 2.25%, respectively.

POWR Ratings Reflect Bleak Prospects

Bottom Line

NVDA reported disappointing financials in the last reported quarter. Furthermore, slowing demand, supply chain constraints, and growing export restrictions will likely impact the company’s revenues and earnings in the upcoming quarters.

The stock is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $138.19 and $190.15, respectively, indicating a downtrend. Therefore, it could be wise to avoid this fundamentally weak stock now.

How Does NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Stack Up Against Its Peers?

NVDA has an overall POWR Rating of D, equating to a Sell rating. Therefore, one might want to consider investing in other Semiconductor & Wireless Chip stocks with an A (Strong Buy) rating: STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM), Xperi Holding Corporation (XPER), and Renesas Electronics Corporation (RNECF).

NVDA shares were trading at $131.07 per share on Wednesday morning, down $1.54 (-1.16%). Year-to-date, NVDA has declined -55.40%, versus a -18.11% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

The event, originally scheduled for Oct. 31, has been rescheduled for Nov. 30, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in a tweet that provided no further information.

Musk started Neuralink in 2016 with the goal of creating an implantable device that would allow humans to directly interact with computers via their brains rather than input devices such as touch screens, keyboards or even voice assistants. He has pitched the project as a means of helping humanity keep up with advances in artificial intelligence, but more recently the focus has been on creating a device to help restore capabilities to people with disabilities.

Neuralink demonstrations in 2020 and 2021 have shown the technology at work with pigs and monkeys, but Musk has reportedly been frustrated with the rate of progress at the company. Back in December, he said that the project was working well in monkeys and that he hoped to test this year it in humans, such as those with quadriplegia, pending approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Neuralink's efforts have yet to receive FDA approval.

44,‘We risk another crisis’: TikTok in danger of being major vector of election misinformation,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dc7de20062e3ea819322d0697162f2178fc6e4b/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=179abee0a3c3a28cd82be941fddc2e4a,25/10/2022,A study suggests the video platform is failing to filter false claims and rhetoric in the weeks leading up to the vote<ul><li>Read the new Guardian series exploring the increasing power and reach of TikTok</li></ul>In the final sprint to the US midterm electi…,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/24/tiktok-election-misinformation-voting-politics,"In the final sprint to the US midterm elections the social media giant TikTok risks being a major vector for election misinformation, experts warn, with the platform’s huge user base and its design making it particularly susceptible to such threats.

Preliminary research published last week from digital watchdog Global Witness and the Cybersecurity for Democracy team at New York University suggests the video platform is failing to filter large volumes of election misinformation in the weeks leading up to the vote.

TikTok approved 90% of advertisements featuring election misinformation submitted by researchers, including ads containing the wrong election date, false claims about voting requirements, and rhetoric dissuading people from voting.

TikTok has for several years prohibited political advertising on the platform, including branded content from creators and paid advertisements, and ahead of midterm elections has automatically disabled monetization to better enforce the policy, TikTok’s global business president, Blake Chandlee, said in a September blog post. “TikTok is, first and foremost, an entertainment platform,” he wrote.

But the NYU study showed TikTok “performed the worst out of all of the platforms tested” in the experiment, the researchers said, approving more of the false advertisements than other sites such as YouTube and Facebook.

The findings spark concern among experts who point out that – with 80 million monthly users in the US and large numbers of young Americans indicating the platform is their primary source of news – such posts could have far reaching consequences.

Yet the results come to little surprise, those experts say. During previous major elections in the US, TikTok had far fewer users, but misinformation was already spreading widely on the app. TikTok faced challenges moderating misinformation about elections in Kenya and the war in Ukraine.

And the company, experts say, is doing far too little to rein in election lies spreading among its users.

“This year is going to be much worse as we near the midterms,” said Olivia Little, a researcher who co-authored the Media Matters report. “There has been an exponential increase in users, which only means there will be more misinformation TikTok needs to proactively work to stop or we risk facing another crisis.”

A crucial test

With Joe Biden himself warning that the integrity of American elections is under threat, TikTok has announced a slew of policies aimed at combatting election misinformation spreading through the app.

The company laid out guidelines and safety measures related to election content and launched an elections center, which “connect[s] people who engage with election content” to approved news sources in more than 45 languages.

“To bolster our response to emerging threats, TikTok partners with independent intelligence firms and regularly engages with others across the industry, civil society organizations, and other experts,” said Eric Han, TikTok’s head of US safety, in August.

In September, the company also announced new policies requiring government and politician accounts to be verified and said it would ban videos aimed at campaign fundraising. TikTok added it would block verified political accounts from using money-making features available to influencers on the app, such as digital payments and gifting.

Still, experts have deep concerns about the spread of election falsehoods on the video app.

Those fears are exacerbated by TikTok’s structure, which makes it difficult to investigate and quantify the spread of misinformation. Unlike Twitter, which makes public its Application Programming Interface (API), software that allows researchers to extract data from platforms for analysis, or Meta, which offers its own internal search engine called Crowdtangle, TikTok does not offer tools for external audits.

However, independent research as well as the platform’s own transparency reports highlight the challenges it has faced in recent years moderating election-related content.

TikTok removed 350,000 videos related to election misinformation in the latter half of 2020, according to a transparency report from the company, and blocked 441,000 videos containing misinformation from user feeds globally.

The internet non-profit Mozilla warned in the run-up to Kenya’s 2022 election that the platform was “failing its first real test” to stem dis- and misinformation during pivotal political moments. The non-profit said it had found more than 130 videos on the platform containing election-related misinformation, hate speech and incitement against communities before the vote, which together gained more than 4m views.

“Rather than learn from the mistakes of more established platforms like Facebook and Twitter, TikTok is following in their footsteps,” Mozilla researcher Odanga Madung wrote at the time.

Why TikTok is so vulnerable to misinformation

Part of the reason TikTok is uniquely susceptible to misinformation lies in certain features of its design and algorithm, experts say.

Its For You Page, or general video feed, is highly customized to users’ individual preferences via an algorithm that’s little understood, even by its own staff. That combination lends itself to misinformation bubbles, said Little, the Media Matters researcher.

“TikTok’s hyper-tailored algorithm can blast random accounts into virality very quickly, and I don’t think that is going to change anytime soon because it’s the reason it has become such a popular platform,” she said.

Meanwhile, the ease with which users’ remix, record and repost videos – few of which have been fact-checked – allows misinformation to spread easily while making it more difficult to remove.

TikTok’s video-exclusive content brings up additional moderation hurdles, as artificial intelligence processes may find it more difficult to automatically scrape video content for misinformation compared to text.

Several recent studies have highlighted how those features have exacerbated the spread of misinformation on the platform. When it comes to TikTok content related to the war in Ukraine, for example, the ability to “remix media” without fact-checking it has made it difficult “even for seasoned journalists and researchers to discern truth from rumor, parody and fabrication”, said a recent report from Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media.

That report cited other design features in the app that make it an easy pathway for misinformation, including that most users post under pseudonyms and that, unlike on Facebook, where users’ feeds are filled primarily with content from friends and people they know, TikTok’s For You Page is largely composed of content from strangers.

Some of these problems are not unique to TikTok, said Marc Faddoul co-director of Tracking Exposed, a digital rights organization investigating TikTok’s algorithm.

Studies have shown that algorithms across all platforms are optimized to detect and exploit cognitive biases for more polarizing content, and that any platform that relies on algorithms rather than a chronological newsfeed is more susceptible to disinformation. But TikTok is the most accelerated model of an algorithmic feed yet, he said.

At the same time, he added, the platform has been slow in coming to grips with issues that have plagued its peers like Facebook and Twitter for years.

“Historically, TikTok has characterized itself as an entertainment platform, denying they host political content and therefore disinformation, but we know now that is not the case,” he said.

Young user base is particularly at risk

Experts say an additional cause for concern is a lack of media literacy among TikTok’s largely young user base. The vast majority of young people in the US use TikTok, a recent Pew Research Center report showed. Internal data from Google revealed in July that nearly 40% of Gen Z – the generation born between the late 1990s and early 2000s – globally uses TikTok and Instagram as their primary search engines.

In addition to being more likely to get news coverage from social media, Gen Z also has far higher rates of mistrust in traditional institutions such as the news media and the government compared with past generations, creating a perfect storm for the spread misinformation, said Helen Lee Bouygues, president of the Reboot Foundation, a media literacy advocacy organization.

“By the nature of its audience, TikTok is exposing a lot of young children to disinformation who are not trained in media literacy, period,” she said. “They are not equipped with the skills necessary to recognize propaganda or disinformation when they see it online.”

The threat is amplified by the sheer amount of time spent on the app, with 67% of US teenagers using the app for an average of 99 minutes per day. Research conducted by the Reboot Foundation showed that the longer a user spends on an app the less likely they are to distinguish between misinformation and fact.

To enforce its policies, which prohibit election misinformation, harassment, hateful behavior, and violent extremism, TikTok says it relies on “a combination of people and technology” and partners with factcheckers to moderate content.

The company directed questions to this blogpost regarding election misinformation measures, but declined to share how many human moderators it employs.

Bouygues said the company should do far more to protect its users, particularly young ones. Her research shows that media literacy and in-app nudges towards fact-checking could go a long way when it comes to combating misinformation. But government action is needed to force such changes.

“If the TikToks of the world really want to fight fake news, they could do it,” she said. “But as long as their financial model is keeping eyes on the page, they have no incentive to do so. That’s where policymaking needs to come into play.”",artificial intelligence,the guardian

Approximately every forty seconds a person dies from suicide and nearly 800,000 people die each year according to Our World in Data. A new meta-analysis study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research shows that artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning outperforms traditional suicide risk prediction models, potentially improving suicide risk detection.

Artificial intelligence is used as a tool to help clinicians and healthcare providers diagnose and predict diseases and disorders at an early stage in hopes of early intervention for better outcomes. In 2022, the global artificial intelligence in healthcare market size value is an estimated USD 15.4 billion and is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.4 percent during 2022 to 2030 to reach USD 208.2 billion by 2030 according to Grand View Research.

AI is also being used as an assistive tool for mental health clinicians and providers. The researchers affiliated with the Black Dog Institute and the Centre for Big Data Research in Health at the University of New South Wales sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of AI machine learning models in predicting longitudinal outcomes of not only suicide ideation, but also suicide attempts and death by suicide.

The researchers analyzed the potential covariates of AI model performance, including AI algorithm type, data, and outcomes of scientific studies from PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. The team customized a prediction model called the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool to help evaluate the risk of bias for each study.

The scientists evaluated 54 AI machine learning models’ ability to predict suicidal ideation, attempts, and behaviors. Overall, the research demonstrated that AI machine learning outperformed traditional clinical, theoretical and statistical risk prediction models. The AI machine models achieved a pooled AUC (area under the curve) of 0.86 and a specificity of 0.87.

“Findings suggest that machine learning has the potential to improve suicide risk detection, with pooled estimates of machine learning performance comparing favorably to performance of traditional suicide prediction models,” the researchers wrote.

A new exhibition at Manchester’s Science and Industry Museum is asking visitors to match certain types of music with tastes. Does this sound sweet, sour, bitter, salty?

Ridiculous, you might think, and as I listen to each of the sounds – screechy, plinkety-plonky, lush, mournful – initially I am reluctant to make my selections, fearing ridicule in front of curator Steven Leech. But then something magical happens: the screechy music does indeed suddenly bring to mind bitter lemons and the lush sounds do conjure up strawberries.

Leech’s music-meets-food exhibit is a fun way of interpreting a serious piece of research by Charles Spence, head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford University. It is the model for much of this new exhibition, Turn It Up, which takes the research being done into the effects of music at universities across the world and tries to make it accessible to a general audience.

Does music affect the way we shop?

“The exhibition is about the way music affects our bodies and minds, and drives us to innovate, create and share,” says Leech. “We did some audience testing and found that the majority of the people, unless they played an instrument or could read music, felt ‘unmusical’ – ignoring the ubiquity of music in their lives and its centrality in our culture.” He aims to show that in fact almost everyone is musical and has an emotional response to what they hear.

The exhibition is in two halves. The first looks at the innate human urge to create music and where our ingenuity and technological innovation have led. This section draws on objects, displaying a weird and wonderful collection of musical instruments, listening devices from ancient gramophones to the iPhone, and new tech that allows disabled musicians to make music. It also charts ongoing experiments with artificial intelligence.

In western music there are associations between major keys and happiness, and minor keys and sadness. But that is not universal

“The homeward-bound half is more reflective, thinking about the effect music has on us as individuals,” says co-curator Emily Scott-Dearing. We are programmed to respond to musical tropes – though whether as a result of cultural conditioning or something innate is far from clear. One exhibit demonstrates that a lullaby has certain musical qualities which are universally felt. Conversely, our brains are programmed to react adversely to dissonance. But Scott-Dearing insists cultural conditioning plays a part too. “In western music there are associations between major keys and happiness, and minor keys and sadness,” she explains, “but that is not universal across all music systems.”

Music doesn’t have to be soporific to help cure insomnia.

Music’s ability to relax us is well attested – Classic FM has built its entire marketing pitch around it – and Turn It Up looks at ways it is used for medical purposes, not least to treat dementia sufferers. “Manchester Camerata has a project called Music in Mind, which runs group music therapy sessions in care homes,” says Scott-Dearing, “and there was a study that found a significant reduction in medication use.” Music was taking the place of drugs in reducing agitation and distress among patients.

Work is under way to produce an app which would allow this musical immersion treatment to be given remotely. Leech says the aim is to produce individualised “prescription playlists” that use sensors to track a patient’s mood through the day, and play pain-relieving songs when needed.

Music has other measurable effects on us. One study has shown that supermarkets playing generic French or German music in their wine aisles – think accordions and oompah bands – affects the amount of wine they sell from those countries. Consumers don’t have to know what they are listening to; they subliminally absorb the musical message and buy accordingly.

Playing generic French or German music in supermarket’s wine aisle affects the amount of wine sold from those countries

Other research suggests playing classical music in commercial environments makes consumers spend more money. “We have value associations that we put on music,” says Scott-Dearing, “and classical music is seen as high end.” Professor Adrian North has demonstrated that playing classical music rather than muzak or pop in a cafe can boost sales by 20%. Another study has shown that classical music encourages shoppers to buy luxury items, whereas country music prompts more utilitarian purchases.

Fast music, meanwhile, makes you shop more quickly. That also explains why tunes by marching bands are sometimes played at London’s Waterloo station – to stop commuters lingering on the concourse. Underground stations also play soothing music to boost commuter well-being and encourage calm behaviour in situations that can become stressful.

Does listening to music while we work help or hinder productivity?

Can listening to music combat insomnia? My faith in whether sleep playlists work was somewhat undermined by learning at Turn It Up that one of the most common songs used by insomniacs is the dance track Dynamite by South Korean boy band BTS. But music to fall asleep to doesn’t have be soporific, Leech explains; familiarity can be more important. “If [music] makes you feel more comfortable and takes you to a different place, it can get you more prepared for sleep,” he says.

The exhibition draws on the work of sleep researcher Kira Vibe Jespersen, though her findings offer no magic bullet for insomniacs. She has shown that playing music does not objectively improve your sleeping patterns, but can make you believe you have slept better, compared with, say, using audiobooks.

Memory is another key theme of the show. Sometimes music triggers personal memories that become more important than the sound itself. Desert Island Discs demonstrates that week in, week out, playing the pieces that have become signposts in a person’s life. And that we set such store by the music played at the funerals of loved ones is no accident: it can encapsulate an attitude to life.

Turn It Up tries to answer many questions. Some are broad and quasi-philosophical. How does the brain process music? Why does it trigger memory? Why does it make us dance? Others are more practical.

What music, for instance, is best for a call centre to use while callers are on hold? Pleasant tunes without lyrics that appear to have no beginning and no end – callers don’t like to be reminded of the passage of time while they are hanging on. One experiment showed that they were more likely to stay on the line if the music was a version of Yesterday played on pan pipes, rather than the version with Paul McCartney singing it. His much-loved rendition made callers too attentive; zombification is the key here.

So does listening to music while we work help or hinder productivity? The answer depends on what you are doing: it helps with mechanical tasks but is distracting if you are carrying out complex cognitive tasks.

And what is the safest music to listen to while driving? Heavy metal surprisingly. Just joking – ballads are best.",artificial intelligence,the guardian

It was authored by Jaymes Dempsey.

On Wednesday, Sony announced the a7R V, a high-resolution, feature-packed, AI-equipped mirrorless camera that comes as the successor to the hugely popular a7R IV.

Like the a7R IV, the a7R V ostensibly caters to professional landscape and commercial photographers requiring class-leading resolution; thanks to a whopping 61-megapixel sensor equipped with impressive high-ISO capabilities and outstanding dynamic range, photographers can capture detailed landscape and product shots, which can then be heavily cropped and turned into impeccable prints, magazine spreads, and even billboards.

But while the original a7R models sacrificed speed in favor of resolution, the R-series’ autofocus capabilities have improved steadily over the last decade, and the latest a7R iteration represents yet another major leap forward.

Specifically, the a7R V boasts autofocus technology that is, I suspect, the best we’ve ever seen in a consumer camera – which is especially astounding, given the R-series’ resolution-focused design. As Sony explains, “The Alpha 7R V features next-generation AF Real-Time Recognition AF, with advanced accuracy and broader subject recognition thanks to a new AI (artificial intelligence) processing unit with deep learning. The state-of-the-art AI processing uses detailed information about human form and pose estimation to dramatically improve recognition accuracy beyond systems which only detect face and eye and make full use of its potential.”

It’s not that Sony’s AF systems haven’t previously relied on AI technology. (They have.) But – at least as Sony tells it – the a7R V’s AI-based autofocus moves the camera’s tracking a step beyond all previous AF systems, thanks to a deeper analysis of subjects and more comprehensive object recognition. Assuming the AF system is as effective as it sounds, portrait, event, and even sports photographers will want to take advantage of the a7R V’s unique capabilities when tracking fast-moving subjects across a room, a dance floor, or a football field.

In addition to its superior tracking capabilities, the a7R V’s AF system can identify a wider variety of subjects than ever before, including insects, birds, animals, trains, cars, and planes. The camera should impress wildlife photographers – who will appreciate the boosted ability to follow animals as they race, fight, and forage – and especially macro photographers, who frequently struggle to maintain focus on insects when working at high magnifications.

In fact, what’s remarkable is just how well-rounded the a7R V actually is. There’s the high-megapixel sensor and next-gen autofocus, but there’s also a slew of other features: 10 frames-per-second continuous shooting, a unique “multi-angle” screen that flips upward and outward for maximum flexibility, a 9.44M-dot electronic viewfinder for a lifelike shooting experience, outstanding 8-stop in-body image stabilization for sharp images in low light, and 8K/24p recording for high-resolution videos, all packed into a compact, durable body.

At the end of the day, the a7R V is a resolution-first camera, which is why it’ll likely be the top full-frame option for landscape and other fine-art photographers as we move into 2023. But its other capabilities – the AF tracking, the ergonomics, and the video recording – are equally worthy of note and will ensure the a7R V also becomes a go-to option for generalist professionals and serious hobbyists.

So if you’re a landscape, commercial, or even portrait photographer in need of a new camera, check out the Sony a7R V. It’ll begin shipping in early December, but you can currently preorder it for $3900.

The study into UAP, which NASA defines as sky-based events that cannot be attributed to aircraft or natural phenomena, will take around nine months to complete.

While most people would know these entities as UFOs, US government officials have preferred the acronym UAP in recent years.

Regardless of what they are called, NASA said the team studying them includes ""some of the world's leading scientists, data and artificial intelligence practitioners,"" and ""aerospace safety experts.""

These include NASA alums like Mike Gold and former astronaut Scott Kelly; an individual from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); academics from University of Delaware and George Mason University, the University of Rhode Island (URI), University of California, San Diego, and other institutions; Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) affiliates; an oceanographer; CEOs; and freelance journalist and former ballerina with a doctorate in genetics, Nadia Drake.

The aerospace org says the team will lay the groundwork for future studies by identifying how data gathered by civilians, governments, commercial and other entities can shed a light on UAP. The project will culminate in a recommended ""roadmap for potential UAP data analysis by the agency going forward."" The findings are expected to be made public in mid-2023.

""Understanding the data we have surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena is critical to helping us draw scientific conclusions about what is happening in our skies,"" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington in a canned statement that categorized UAP as important for national security and air safety.

The data used in the study will be unclassified. Luckily for the researchers, Uncle Sam declassified the CIA's entire collection of UAP-related material. It's been online since 2021.

In August, the NASA UAP research project was revealed to have a $100,000 budget.

But NASA isn't the only organization putting an effort into understanding what no one is ruling out but also not calling aliens. In July 2021 the Pentagon said it would create an office to track UAP reports, and Congress has considered similar efforts.

Last week, Professor Brian Cox told The Register he thinks there may be, on average, one civilization out there in existence per galaxy. He contrasted this with physicist Sean Carroll's prediction of zero, and unnamed individuals at SETI, whom he says may predict upwards of ten instances of intelligent life in the universe.

Over the past decade the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) has become one of the top operating systems for phones, tablets and a variety of other mobile devices. Today we are happy to share that the upstream enablement of RISC-V has started within AOSP. In order to celebrate this truly global community effort, let us take a closer look at the work to date and plans to expand and accelerate continued development of AOSP on RISC-V.

In 2020, engineers and software developers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ PLCT Lab began to port Android 10 to the RISC-V architecture in an effort to open this important ecosystem to the RISC-V community. Since the early days of the effort, the Alibaba Cloud division has been a close collaborator and leader in this pioneering work and has kept the development current with newer Android versions.

“We are glad to see more support from Google for building AOSP targeting RISC-V! Alibaba Cloud has been committed to supporting the RISC-V community through a series of innovations, such as progressing the porting of basic Android functions onto RISC-V, which proves the feasibility of using RISC-V based devices in scenarios ranging from multimedia to signal processing, device interconnection, and artificial intelligence. We look forward to engaging with the Android team to contribute to the thriving RISC-V community down the road,” said Dr. David Chen, Director of Ecosystem from Alibaba Cloud and Vice Chair of the Applications & Tools Horizontal Committee at RISC-V International.

“RISC-V has grown in popularity through the sheer demand for flexibility and choice across the full spectrum of computing, from the smallest embedded devices to the largest scale out cloud implementations,” said Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V International. “This demand has made RISC-V inevitable as the most prolific open standard ISA of our time, accelerating innovation and adoption with the strongest ecosystem of global stakeholders.”

Throughout 2021, engineers at Alibaba Cloud undertook a massive effort to directly support the software ecosystem by further expanding the core functionality of Android on RISC-V. To read more about Alibaba Cloud’s leadership and history of technical contributions to make AOSP on RISC-V a reality, check out the following blog notes:

“Adoption of RISC-V relies on the breadth and quality of the available software solutions. By bringing Android to RISC-V, we extend RISC-V to support a wide range of consumer-centric use cases ranging from mobile to in-car entertainment. We also can’t understate the importance that Android has gained as a platform for consumer and professional device development, ranging from control panels in home automation to video conferencing hardware. We are grateful to Alibaba Cloud for their ongoing efforts in making RISC-V a first-class platform for Android and I am very excited at seeing these contributions being adopted upstream by AOSP, summarized Dr. Philipp Tomsich, Chief Technologist at VRULL and Chair of the Applications & Tools Horizontal Committee at RISC-V International.

Take commercial farms for example – hackers are now able to cause considerable damage to operations and livestock, whether through tampering with datasets or shutting down sprayers, harvesters, and drones responsible for the well-being of crops and produce. For SMEs and other organizations, this can lead to significant financial and reputational damage should sensitive data be stolen or a system authenticating and validating users is corrupted, and there is no quick fix should a breach take place.

To successfully mitigate any threats, security professionals must look at the surface-level aspects of an AI, but also dive deeper into the data sets of a system, and review how best these can be secured. By looking at the four interactional elements of machine learning (ML), one can evaluate how each can be affected by a cyberattack and put roadblocks in place to protect each aspect.

Ensuring the safety of the key elements

There are four typical elements to consider when it comes to ML.

The first is data sets: the data provided to a device or machine so it can function, review, and decide based on the information received. Data in this instance is not simply code – it can be anything from a processed fact, value, image, sound, or text which is then interpreted and analyzed by AI. It is therefore vital that the data provided to the machine during this process is made up of meaningful, accurate information.

The next element to consider is algorithms: the mathematical or logical problems that compute the data to feed it into a model. To secure a system, any algorithm deployed must be specifically adjusted to the unique problem that needs to be solved, to align with the specific model and nature of the data provided.

This leads into the next key element: models, i.e., the computational representations of real-world processes. These are trained by IT professionals to make predictions which will mirror real life. The data which has been incorporated into a model is then expected to increase the accuracy levels of the process going forward. To stop this process from being corrupted, it is essential the model is provided with trusted data to avoid any deviation within the ML model predictions.

Last but not least, training allows ML models to identify the patterns that allow them to make decisions. The training applied to a model must come from a trusted source to ensure that any supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning does not corrupt the model and make it deviate from its accurate feature extraction and predictions.

Leveraging a “trusted” approach

The fundamental actions required from any security approach is to protect, detect, attest, and recover from any modifications to coding, whether malicious or otherwise. The best way to fully secure a compromised AI is applying a “trusted computing” model that covers all four AI elements.

Starting with the data set aspect of a system, a component such as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is able to sign and verify that any data provided to the machine has been communicated from a reliable source.

A TPM can ensure the safeguarding of any algorithms used within an AI system. The TPM provides hardened storage for platform or software keys. These keys can then be used to protect and attest the algorithms.

Furthermore, any deviations of the model, if bad or inaccurate data is supplied, can be prevented through applying trusted principles focusing on cyber resiliency, network security, sensor attestation, and identity.

Businesses can also ensure the training given to machine learning is secure by making sure the entities providing also adhere to the trusted computing standards.

To ensure sensors and other connected devices maintain their integrity and provide accurate data, professionals should look to leverage Root of Trust hardware, such as the Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE).

With DICE, the boot layers within each system receive a unique key, combined of the preceding key from the previous layer alongside the measurement of the current one. Should the system be exploited by a hacker, any exposed layer’s key and measurement will differ from any others within the system, mitigating the potential risk by securing data and protecting itself from any disclosure of data. Root of Trust hardware can even re-key a device should a flaw or tampering be unearthed within a device’s firmware, which allows users to uncover any vulnerabilities when carrying out system updates.

Maintaining a secure system

A proactive approach is now required from businesses and organizations to mitigate any tampering of an AI. Investment in up-to-date technologies alongside education on how to identify threats and establish a defense are essential to ensure severe reputational or financial damage does not occur.",artificial intelligence,help net security

Credit: Mateusz Krol, source: Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw)

Scientists from the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw and the Polish Academy of Sciences used photons to create a spiking neuron, the basic element of the future photonic neural network processor. The results of their work are published in the latest Laser and Photonics Review.

Neuromorphic devices (systems that imitate the behavior of the biological brain) are the future of artificial intelligence, as they allow for much faster and more effective information processing.

Mammalian brains are one of the most complex and efficient systems in the world. In the 1990s, neurobiologists showed that a single area of the macaque cortex was able to analyze and classify visual patterns in just 30 milliseconds, although each of the neurons involved in this process sends fewer than three messages in the form of electrical pulses. This is made possible by a large number of synapses—the connections between neurons—in the macaque brain's neural network.

The human brain is a piece of even more powerful machinery. It is made up of 100 billion neurons, each of which creates an average of several thousand connections with other nerve cells. This creates a neural network of approximately 100 trillion connections, thanks to which our brain is capable of recognizing, reasoning, and controlling motion at the same time—it performs trillions of operations per second, using only 20-25 watts of power.

By comparison, conventional processors use ten times as much power to recognize just a thousand different types of objects. This stunning difference and the brain's exceptional performance are due to, among other things, the biochemistry of neurons, the architecture of neural connections, and the biophysics of neural computational algorithms.

Society's appetite for information is constantly growing, so we need to process this information faster and more comprehensively. Conventional computing systems may not meet the growing demand for more computing power while increasing energy efficiency. The solution to the problem may be neuromorphic devices that mimic the actions of the biological brain. They are the future of artificial intelligence, as they allow for much faster and more effective processing of information in tasks such as image recognition.

Scientists from the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw and the Polish Academy of Sciences proposed the use of photons in a way that allows the creation of spiking neural networks. Krzysztof Tyszka from the Faculty of Physics of the University of Warsaw, who is the first author of the work, emphasizes that photonic systems ensure communication at the speed of light, low losses, and low energy consumption.

""The advantage of photons is that their propagation takes place practically without energy loss. Unfortunately, because they interact in a relatively weak way, it is difficult to use them to perform computational operations in a manner analogous to electronic systems,"" says the scientist.

""In our research, we propose a solution in which photons strongly interact with particles of very low mass, called excitons,"" explains Barbara Pietka from the Polariton Laboratory at the Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw.

""This strong interaction is possible when the photons and excitons are trapped together in the so-called optical microcavities, which forces repetitive energy exchange between them. This kind of synergy generated in the microcavity between a photon and an exciton is so persistent that physicists call it a quasi-particle and refer to it as excision-polariton (or polariton for short).""

Polaritons have unique properties, especially under the right conditions they can show a phase transition into a Bose-Einstein condensate. In a such state, the previously independent multiple polaritons become indistinguishable.

""Based on our last experiment, we were the first to notice that when polaritons are excited by laser pulses, they emit light pulses in a way that mimics the spiking of biological neurons,"" explains Magdalena Furman, Ph.D. student involved in research at the Polariton Laboratory at the Faculty of Physics of the University of Warsaw, This effect is directly related to the Bose-Einstein condensation phenomenon, which either inhibits or enhances the emission of pulses.

Andrzej Opala from the Institute of Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, who together with Michal Matuszewski developed the theoretical foundations combining research on polaritons with the LIF model of a neuron (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model), adds that now the group is working on solving the problem of scalability, i.e. connecting many neurons into a network.

""We propose to use a new computational paradigm based on coding information with pulses that trigger a signal only when it arrives at the neuron successively, at the right time,"" the researcher explains.

Currently, neural networks use layers of interconnected neurons that trigger impulses based on the importance assigned to each connection (in the mathematical description we refer to ""weights""). In contrast to this type of solution, in the optical neural network described in Laser and Photonics Review, the neurons are triggered (i.e. become active) in response to a train of pulses, which may have different intensity and different time intervals.

As with biological neurons that are excited by electrical pulses, there is a certain threshold above which this train of pulses reaching the neuron triggers a signal that will be passed on. Polaritons make it possible to imitate a biological system, because only stimulation with the appropriate number of photons, above a certain threshold, leads to the formation of Bose-Einstein condensate, and then emission of a short, picoseconds scale flash which is a signal for the next neuron.

Importantly, the sample, which was used by scientists to trap photons and observe exciton polaritons condensate, was synthesized on-site at the Faculty of Physics of the University of Warsaw, in the group of Wojciech Pacuski. Scientists arranged the atoms of different types of semiconductor crystals layer by layer through a molecular beam epitaxy to create a prototypical photonic neuron. A temperature of 4K was required to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensate state.

""Our further goal is to transfer the experiment from cryogenic conditions to room temperature,"" says Jacek Szczytko from the Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw. ""Research is needed on new materials that will allow obtaining Bose-Einstein condensates also at high temperatures. In order for photonic neurons to network, they must be able to transmit signals to each other. Ideally, the transmission direction, i.e. the wiring diagram, could be easily changed as needed.""

""Scientists still face new challenges in their research into neuromorphic systems. Our new idea to recreate the spiking of biological neurons in the optical domain can be used to create a network, and then a neuromorphic system in which information is sent by orders of magnitude faster and in a more energy-efficient way compared to existing solutions,"" concludes Krzysztof Tyszka.

61,Why Biden’s Block on Chips to China Is a Big Deal,,25/10/2022,The new U.S. export controls on superconductor technology will hurt Chinese industries. Xi Jinping has only himself to blame.,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/10/biden-export-control-microchips-china/671848/?utm_source=feed,"As the Chinese Communist Party’s 20th congress wrapped up at the weekend, its general secretary and the country’s president, Xi Jinping, emerged with his new leadership team—loyalists to a man—and with more commanding control over China than any political figure has held in the country for nearly half a century. Having shoved aside his political rivals, Xi can rule over the world’s rising great power virtually uncontested.

Yet, amid this display of pomp and power, President Joe Biden showed Xi who’s boss. Two days earlier, on October 21, Biden had dropped the hammer on China’s semiconductor industry by fully implementing a slew of tough controls on the export of American chip technology to China. This is a painful blow to Xi’s ambitions to rival the U.S., delivered at the very moment when the Chinese leader has reached the pinnacle of his political influence. Even as Xi laid out his vision for the nation’s “great rejuvenation,” indicating that he considers China’s technological achievements central to it, Biden demonstrated that the U.S. still possesses the fight—and the bite—to defend its primacy.

Biden’s new policy reveals that the standard narrative of China’s unstoppable ascent and America’s inexorable decline is based on flawed assumptions. The U.S. continues to hold tremendous economic and technological advantages over China, which, as Biden just signaled, Washington is becoming more willing to use against its Communist competitor. Above all, Biden’s export-control measures are a ruthless expression of American clout—and an intentional reminder that, in many respects, America has it and China does not. The technology analyst Gregory Allen, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote that Biden “is exercising technological and geopolitical power on an incredible scale.”

Read: The tech site that took on China’s surveillance state

The curbs Washington has imposed involve the export of certain chips and manufacturing equipment to China (and, in some cases, to particular blacklisted Chinese companies). The goal is to impede China’s efforts to develop the high-end semiconductors required for artificial intelligence and supercomputing. Though they target a narrow range of chip technologies, the controls are comprehensive. The regulations block Chinese firms that are trying to develop advanced chips from accessing non-Chinese factories that rely on U.S. technology to manufacture their products, and deprive those firms of expertise by barring American citizens and companies from assisting them.

How damaging the controls will be depends on how stringently they are enforced. In theory, they allow U.S. companies to apply for licenses to sell the proscribed products to China. But the purpose of the policy is clear enough: to hobble China’s quest to catch up with the U.S. in crucial industries of the future.

And the policy could work. The U.S. is a leader in the global businesses of artificial-intelligence chips, chip-design software, and much of the equipment indispensable for manufacturing chips, enabling Washington to constrain Chinese access to important segments of the global chip supply chain. Dan Wang, a technology analyst at the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, told me that Biden’s controls “will likely have a fairly large impact on China’s ability to make advanced semiconductors.”

These controls mark a distinct shift in Washington’s approach to China. On top of trying to outcompete China, which is the intent of the CHIPS Act recently passed to support the U.S. semiconductor sector, Washington is now purposely and openly working to hold back Chinese economic progress. Allen called the controls a “genuine landmark in U.S.-China relations” that heralds “a new U.S. policy of actively strangling large segments of the Chinese technology industry—strangling with an intent to kill.” Wang also put it bluntly, describing in a report the controls as “a new China containment strategy.”

Read: Behold, Emperor Xi

In Washington, the policy is seen as a rational response to heightened geopolitical threats, and the central role technology plays in them. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in a speech in September that “we have to revisit the long-standing premise of maintaining ‘relative’ advantages over competitors” in which the U.S. “maintained a ‘sliding scale’ approach that said we need to stay only a couple of generations ahead.” But, he went on, “that is not the strategic environment we are in today. Given the foundational nature of certain technologies … we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.”

And in remarks earlier this month, he explained that the chip restrictions “are premised on straightforward national-security concerns.”

Emerging technologies such as AI and supercomputing have applications in advanced weapons systems, and Washington can’t run the risk of helping China upgrade its military capabilities. “Our strategic competitors should not be able to exploit American and allied technologies to undermine American and allied security,” Sullivan added. But the impact of these controls will also be commercial. Holding back Chinese chipmakers means they are less likely to compete with established American players, sustaining U.S. economic competitiveness vis-à-vis China.

To Beijing, Biden’s new stance appears terribly unfair: a dominant power desperately trying to hold a rising rival down. Xi is clear-eyed about the fact that China’s future economic development, and therefore its ability to become the world’s premier superpower, depends to a great degree on closing the technology gap with the U.S. and its allies. During the past week’s congress, Xi highlighted the importance of technological progress to China’s continued ascent, describing it as one of the “foundational and strategic pillars for building a modern socialist country” and “our primary productive force.”

But Xi brought this reversal on himself. His oft-repeated call for a world-class military is aimed at tipping East Asia’s balance of power in China’s favor, and he would be foolish to expect Washington to hand him the technology to help him reach his goal. Economically as well, Xi’s industrial programs deploy huge state financial support with the clear goal of overtaking the U.S. in key technologies and pushing American companies out of the China market, and ultimately making them uncompetitive. Biden’s harsh controls are less surprising than Xi’s apparent assumption that the U.S. would blithely participate in bringing about its own economic doom.

More surprising, perhaps, is that Biden’s shift took so long. Although Washington has imposed export controls and sanctions on China for some time, specifically targeting the People’s Liberation Army and individual firms such as the telecom giant Huawei, U.S. policy makers have generally been reluctant to interfere with private commerce on a wide scale. The chip controls suggest that is no longer the case.

Jeffrey Goldberg: A conversation with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan

The U.S. could exploit other advantages over China in a similar fashion. Xi recently touted China’s domestic-made jetliner, the Comac C919, as a major achievement for Chinese industry, but this supposed competitor to the Boeing 737 is so reliant on U.S. aviation technology that Washington could probably ground it. China’s continued dependence on the U.S. dollar for international transactions also leaves Chinese banks and companies susceptible to sanctions. Many in Washington are concerned about the important position China holds in American industries and supply chains, and the risk that presents to the U.S. economy. But the integration of the American and Chinese economies cuts both ways, rendering China at least as vulnerable to the U.S. as the other way around.

Xi’s awareness of that threat drives his quest to eliminate Washington’s economic and technological leverage by achieving his stated aim of “self-sufficiency” in chips and other indispensable products. But that goal, which he stressed during the congress, is proving elusive. The Chinese government has poured untold billions of dollars into its chip industry, but it still lags badly behind the U.S. The problem for Xi is that he picked a fight with a wealthier and technologically more advanced power well before his nation had attained the economic strength to wage it. Xi has thus put China in the awkward, probably untenable position of reliance on support from a country he is determined to undermine.

Xi’s best route would be to negotiate a settlement on chips with Washington that keeps American technology flowing. But Xi, who poses at home as an implacable defender of Chinese interests, cannot be seen to kowtow to Washington. Instead, Biden’s export controls will likely reinforce Xi’s need to act as China’s defender against Washington’s predations—returning to his mantra of self-sufficiency and his efforts to push back American power. The belligerent rhetoric was already there in Xi’s report to the party congress when he described “external attempts to blackmail, contain, blockade, and exert maximum pressure on China,” which the country has faced with “a fighting spirit and a firm determination to never yield to coercive power.”

Such self-sufficiency is more rhetorical than real: Building a fully Chinese supply chain in advanced microchips will prove immensely expensive, and may simply be impossible, at least in the near term. For now, China’s technology sector will suffer. Biden’s controls will also hurt some American chip-equipment companies; Applied Materials and Lam Research have already warned that compliance with the new rules will cause significant revenue losses. But both sides seem willing to accept the costs—in that regard, Biden and Xi share a common intent to protect their own perceived national-security interests, even if that means commercial sacrifices.

That priority does not bode well for the future. The mutual economic benefit brought by greater integration was a foundation of the U.S.-China partnership. As their two economies move apart, so will other relations attenuate. In a search for security, both leaders may be making their countries less secure.",artificial intelligence,the atlantic

This post contains spoilers for the season finale of ""Star Trek: Lower Decks.""

In the last episode of ""Star Trek: Lower Decks,"" the U.S.S. Cerritos found themselves under attack by a small armada of Breen warships. The California-class vessel was severely outmatched, and was at risk of being destroyed when a heretofore unseen starship, the U.S.S. Aledo, swooped in, destroyed the attackers and saved the day. The Aledo, it is later revealed, was an experimental Texas-class starship that was run entirely by artificial intelligence. There was no crew on board. The Texas class was the brainchild of one Vice Admiral Buen Amigo (Carlos Alazraqui), who sought to reduce both casualties and any human error in Starfleet by essentially replacing its officers with drones.

As any good Trekkie knows, creating an artificially intelligent machine is an enormous can of worms on ""Star Trek,"" and giving both A.I. and weapons to a drone is asking for trouble. As is revealed in ""The Stars at Night,"" deep in the heart of Texas-class vessels resides a computational error that makes their emotional matrix unstable. Eventually, the three robotic ships open fire on a Federation Starbase, killing hundreds. It takes the combined efforts of Starfleet's entire California class — the U.S.S. Culver City! The U.S.S.

Global Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing Market

Dublin, Oct. 28, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing Market by Offering (Hardware, Software, and Services), Industry, Application, Technology (Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Context-aware Computing, Computer Vision), & Region - Global Forecast to 2027"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The global artificial intelligence in Manufacturing market size is valued at USD 2.3 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to be USD 16.3 billion by 2027; growing at a CAGR of 47.9% from 2022 to 2027. The growing demand of factors such as improving computing power of AI chipsets is expected to grow the market at an estimated rate.



The increasing adoption of AI has been observed as a new driver for semiconductor chipset manufacturers in the past few years. GPU/CPU manufacturers, such as NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, Huawei, and Samsung, have significantly invested in AI hardware for the development of chipsets that are compatible with AI-based technologies and solutions. Apart from CPUs and GPUs, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are being developed for AI applications. For instance, Google has built a new ASIC called ""tensor processing unit"" (TPU).

Compute-intensive chipset is among the critical parameters for processing AI algorithms; the faster the chipset, the quicker it can process the data required to create an AI system. Currently, AI chipsets are mostly deployed in data centers/high-end servers as end computers are currently incapable of handling such huge workloads and do not have enough power and time frame. NVIDIA has a range of GPUs that offer GPU memory bandwidth based on application. For example, GeForce GTX Titan X offers a memory bandwidth of 336.5 GB/s and is mostly deployed on desktops, while Tesla V100 16 GB offers a memory bandwidth of 900 GB/s and is used in AI applications.



Application of AI for intelligent business processes



Rigid and rule-based software currently governs a majority of business processes in an organization, offering limited abilities to handle critical problems. These processes are time-consuming and require employees to work on repetitive tasks, hampering the productivity of the employees and the overall performance of the organization. Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing tools generated on AI platforms can help enterprises overcome such challenges with self-learning algorithms, which can reveal new patterns and solutions.

Story continues

Most organizations use enterprise software, which makes the use of rule-based processing to automate business processes. This task-based automation has helped organizations in improving their productivity in a few specific processes but such rule-based software cannot self-learn and improve with experience.

The integration of AI tools, such as NLP and ML, generated on AI platform for enterprise software systems, enables the software to gain mastery while solving individual processes. This software would be able to provide improved performance and productivity to enterprises over time, instead of providing a one-time boost. All these factors are said to have fueled the demand for intelligent business processes and act as opportunities for the growth of the AI in manufacturing market.



Increasing global demand for energy and power is influencing energy and power companies to adopt AI-based solutions



The increasing global demand for energy and power is influencing energy and power companies to adopt AI-based solutions that can help boost production output with minimum maintenance and reduced downtime. Maintenance and inspection are the major issues, along with material movement, in a thermal plant as the material needs to travel a long distance inside the plant. Besides, equipment used in this industry, such as turbines, conveyer belts, grids, and voltage transformers, are costly.

Moreover, there are issues related to fuel mix, ambient temperature, air quality, moisture, load, weather forecast models, and market pricing in the power industry. By using AI-based technologies, these issues can be resolved and predicted in the early stages.

AI-based technologies used in energy plants comprise physics insights, engineering design knowledge, and new inspection technologies, which are ideal for predictive maintenance and machinery inspections. The AI technologies work in 2 layers. First, by recognizing the pattern, and second, by learning the models. Early-stage pattern recognition notifies about impending failures.

The study officially began on October 24, and over the next nine months, the team will lay the groundwork for future study of the UAPs for NASA and other organizations. The team will look to identify how data gathered from civilian government entities, commercial data, and other areas can help shed light on UAPs, and recommend a roadmap for the future with a report to be made public to the world next year.

“Exploring the unknown in space and the atmosphere is at the heart of who we are at NASA,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters “Understanding the data we have surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena is critical to helping us draw scientific conclusions about what is happening in our skies. Data is the language of scientists and makes the unexplainable, explainable.”

NASA notes that understanding UAPs benefits both national security as well as air safety while emphasizing that so far there is no evidence that UAPs are extra-terrestrial in origin.

“NASA has brought together some of the world’s leading scientists, data and artificial intelligence practitioners, aerospace safety experts, all with a specific charge, which is to tell us how to apply the full focus of science and data to UAP,” said overseeing NASA official Daniel Evans. “The findings will be released to the public in conjunction with NASA’s principles of transparency, openness, and scientific integrity.”

More details regarding the study and the 16 members selected for the team can be found here.

The post Carbon investments backed by AI and satellite data appeared first on Springwise.",https://www.springwise.com/innovation/sustainability/carbon-investments-backed-by-ai-and-satellite-data/,"Spotted: There are a huge number of organisations working to reduce global emissions – with schemes for everything from capturing carbon from the air to sequestration and carbon capture for shipping. Now fintech Earthbanc has a new idea — land regeneration. The company argues that by transitioning to regenerative agriculture on 2.5 billion hectares of land, it would be possible to sequester all global emissions produced; and they have a plan to incentivise regenerative land management practices.

However, one issue with regenerative land programmes is transparency – it is very difficult to verify that a scheme is actually sequestering a specified amount of carbon. Without having this information, it is impossible to effectively use carbon credits to contribute to land regeneration schemes. Earthbanc’s platform solves this problem by using artificial intelligence (AI), trained on satellite remote sensing data collected in collaboration with the European Space Agency, to automatically audit the carbon reduction impact of land regeneration projects and to verify carbon credits.

Farmers register on the Earthbanc platform, and the platform automatically measures the carbon sequestration on their land. Companies can then invest in the project using carbon credits to offset their carbon use. Earthbanc uses blockchain technology to keep a transparent record of carbon reduction so that companies buying carbon credits can verify their value. Using credits, the platform effectively allows companies to deposit their carbon “into a bank-like vault.”

Earthbanc CEO Tom Duncan explains that “What makes Earthbanc’s solution so potent in combating the climate crisis is its basis on expert knowledge of land restoration and paying farmers in areas of the world where the impact is the greatest – both for nature and for people.” He adds that they have many corporate buyers, “who are buying carbon on our platform every month. We’re selling hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of carbon, so a farmer can get paid for their ecosystem services.”

Avoiding meat and driving electric vehicles will only take the world so far in reducing carbon consumption. It is also necessary to sequester carbon released into the atmosphere. Luckily, there is no shortage of projects finding innovative ways to do this, including a project that turns sequestered CO2 to stone and an artificial leaf that captures carbon dioxide.

MSK Innovation Hub brings together clinicians, researchers, and health care technology developers to create solutions that advance the prevention and treatment of cancer and have a positive impact on patients' lives. By collaborating with Realyze and using its robust platform-as-service, MSK can rapidly analyze patient records across time and other types of data to extract clinical insights that clinicians and scientists can use to further their research and develop new models of cancer care with the use of disease-specific patient summaries.

Some of the most important insights can be found in the free text portion of a patient's medical record, but combing through this information is time-consuming and costly. With Realyze's NLU and artificial intelligence, patient records can be efficiently mined, providing clinicians with actionable information that can be used to make more informed and timely treatment decisions, which can be particularly critical for early-stage cancer patients.

""Our goal is to make it easier and more efficient for health systems and cancer centers to understand and use their data to improve patient care,"" said Aaron Brauser, president and CEO of Realyze. ""By working with MSK Innovation Hub, we have the opportunity to improve the care and quality of life for patients undergoing cancer treatments by ensuring their health care team has the most accurate and meaningful information.""

""We look forward to working with Realyze through this innovative collaboration,"" said John Philip, senior director of MSK's Research Support Platform. ""The data within the clinical notes of patients' medical records may unlock important scientific and clinical correlations. Being able to pull this information in a more efficient way could help connect patients with important resources and help physicians develop the most optimal care plans for their patients.""

China’s ambitions and reliance on science and technology were front and centre at the Communist Party’s all-important 20th congress in Beijing, which ended on Sunday.

President Xi Jinping said at the opening of the meeting, held every five years, that the country must “regard science and technology as our primary productive force, talent as our primary resource and innovation as our primary driver of growth”.

On Sunday, he was reinstated as general secretary of the party for a third term, breaking a convention established four decades ago, and there was a major reshuffle of the party’s senior leadership. The decision-making body called the Politburo gained several members with qualifications or experience working in science or technology: 6 out of 25 members now have a science background, compared to just one member in the previous Politburo.

Nature spoke to science-policy analysts about Xi’s opening address, a shortened version of a written report that sets the agenda for the party to 2027 and beyond.

Science funding

Analysts say that China’s epic investment in science is likely to continue.

In 2021, China spent 2.8 trillion yuan (US$386 billion) on research and development (R&D), accounting for 2.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP), a measure known as R&D intensity. The country’s most recent five-year plan aims for an increase of more than 7% every year from 2020 to 2025. If that continues until 2035, China’s R&D intensity could reach parity with the average for countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has reached close to 2.7%, says Marina Zhang, who studies innovation in China at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia. However, China’s below-target GDP growth this year could mean businesses will find it harder to increase their investment in R&D, she says.

There is little doubt that China will strengthen its R&D investment despite the economic situation, says Futao Huang, a researcher in higher education at Hiroshima University in Japan. The importance of science and technology is reflected in how often the term appears in the written congress report — 44 times, compared with 17 times in the 2017 report, 16 times in 2012 and 15 times in 2007, according an analysis by Jing Qian, who heads the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis in New York City.

Qian’s analysis also found that some 42 officials with formal degrees and work experience in science have been selected for the Central Committee, a political body that comprises the party’s top leadership, including the Politburo. These members typically go on to head government bodies, including science-related ministries and research-funding agencies.

Semiconductors and self-reliance

Earlier this month, the United States introduced new restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology, along with manufacturing equipment and know-how, to China. The controls are the latest in a long line of US-imposed barriers to the trade on which China would have relied to build its innovation economy. Xi’s speech stressed the importance of self-reliance in science and technology; researchers say this priority could translate to increased investment in strategically important industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, the digital economy, quantum computing and biomedicine. “If you can’t buy it, you’ve got to make it,” says Denis Simon, who studies Chinese science and innovation at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

But researchers will be watching how China plans to allocate funds. Zhang says more of the money will need to go to fundamental research, and companies will need to shoulder more of that investment, which so far has come mostly from the government.

The report’s nod to the business sector’s major role in allocating R&D investment is encouraging, says Zhang. “Innovation requires diversity, innovation requires autonomy and innovation needs to tolerate failures,” she says. But Qian says the central government has increasingly been intervening in market dynamics, and this is likely to continue. In such an environment, the bulk of the money will probably continue to flow to researchers at state-owned enterprises, leading technology firms and top universities, and less will go to those at smaller companies and universities. Qian says China’s scientific community does not seem very optimistic about the research environment, owing to policies that impinge on academic freedom.

China is also expected to prioritize research in aerospace — including space science — defence, climate change, clean energy and agriculture, among other areas, says Qian.

Talent drive

Xi’s speech noted that China already has “the largest cohort of research and development personnel in the world”. He said that to boost innovation, investments in the country’s skilled workforce will continue.

Studies have shown that despite huge efforts to train China’s researchers in some areas such as artificial intelligence, “there is still a quality gap”, says Jacob Feldgoise, who studies science and technology in China at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University in Washington DC. For example, Chinese researchers produce more artificial-intelligence publications than do researchers in the United States, but US papers garner double the share of global citations.

To boost the workforce, China could try to recruit international researchers and entice back Chinese scholars based overseas, alongside training local scientists, say researchers. But hiring foreign talent is a sensitive topic, Simon says, so local efforts “will be given high priority and the overseas recruitment will be more quietly done, without fanfare”. In recent years, scientists in the United States have come under scrutiny for not declaring financial ties to talent-recruitment programmes in China.

Some analysts suggest that political tensions between the United States and China have spilled over into science. In the past few years, fewer researchers have been declaring dual US–China affiliations in their publications, and there has been a decline in the number of publications co-authored by scientists in the two countries. In the short to medium term, US and Chinese researchers will probably continue to engage, but at nowhere near the levels observed “during the heyday of bilateral cooperation”, in the 1990s through to the mid-2010s, says Simon. China’s increased emphasis on fostering home-grown talent could come with more pressure to show results, he adds. “It is no longer simply desirable for China to improve its innovation performance; it is now a national imperative.”

Even so, China intends to “expand science and technology exchanges and cooperation with other countries”, says the congress report. This could see China shifting away from working with the United States to focus on other regions, such as Europe, Australia or Canada, and even expanding its scientific ties with countries involved in its global infrastructure plan, the Belt and Road Initiative, says Simon.

Zero COVID

Researchers in China say travel restrictions under the country’s stringent zero-COVID policy have made it difficult for them to develop and maintain relationships with peers abroad. Limited availability of flights, high ticket costs and extensive quarantines mean that it is almost impossible to travel abroad or for foreign scientists to enter China, says Cong Cao, a science-policy researcher at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, who is eager to meet face-to-face with overseas colleagues and attend international conferences again.

Before the congress, analysts presented conflicting views on whether restrictions could ease soon. Xi mentioned zero-COVID only once during his speech — to point out its merits. Qian says this might be because zero-COVID is an established policy, so Xi saw no need to elaborate on it. Or it could indicate that Xi wants to maintain flexibility and is open to change, says Qian.

Some researchers say it is possible that China will try lifting some restrictions after the party congress, but others say it won’t budge until the country’s legislative body, the National People’s Congress, meets early next year.",artificial intelligence,nature.com

Ho…",https://torrentfreak.com/ai-powered-music-mixer-responds-to-riaas-copyright-infringement-claims-221026/,"The operator of several ""AI"" powered music mixer and extractor sites has responded to the RIAA's copyright infringement allegations. The rebuttal admits that using popular artists to showcase its technology wasn't smart so the references have been removed. However, the services themselves are not infringing. In fact, one of the core algorithms is created and publicly shared by Deezer.

Earlier this month, the RIAA shared its recommendations for the USTR’s annual review of overseas notorious markets.

The music group reported well-known targets such as The Pirate Bay, Newalbumreleases, MP3Juices, RARBG, and RapidGator, plus other piracy-related sites and services.

AI Piracy?

The RIAA also carved out a brand new category this year, labeled AI Based Extractors/Mixers. These ‘Artificial Intelligence’ powered sites can extract vocals or musical tracks from songs, or “master” a song based on the style of another.

These technologies don’t have to be problematic, as long as all permissions are in order. However, when the names of some of the world’s top artists are used for promotional purposes, the RIAA typically becomes concerned.

For example, Songmastr promised to “master” songs based on the styles of well-known musical artists, such as Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Coltrane, Bob Dylan and James Brown, to mention just a few.

Similarly, acapella-extractor.com showcased links to several YouTube videos with vocals from top artists, whose labels are members of the RIAA. The featured vocals were extracted and published without permission.

Operator Responds

Most of the sites branded as notorious markets by the RIAA remain quiet but Songmastr, Acapella-extractor and Remove-Vocals, which are all operated by the same person, sent a rebuttal to the USTR which was published this week.

According to the person who manages these sites, the RIAA never reached out to share its concerns directly. In addition, they argue that the sites don’t deserve the ‘notorious’ brand for several reasons.

“[RIAA’s] arguments are a mix of factually wrong information, a misunderstanding of how these AI services work, and minor allegations regarding potential trademark infringement (corrected since) which are not piracy or counterfeiting,” the rebuttal reads (pdf).

“The only argument on actual dissemination of copyrighted material on these websites concerns a total of 6 links to Youtube videos (since removed) which were used as examples to illustrate the services.”

Links and References Removed

In response to the RIAA’s concerns, Songmastr removed all mentions of popular artists. Users of the site are now directed to only mix tracks when they have the rights, aspiring producers testing their own tracks, for example.

While the names of popular artists have been removed from the site, the operator astutely mentions that this wasn’t a copyright issue, but a potential trademark violation that’s beyond the scope of the piracy category.

Similarly, the Acapella-extractor website removed six YouTube links where the site’s capabilities were showcased. Going forward, these types of examples will no longer be used on the site.

The Deezer Connection

The services run by the operator mainly rely on third-party open-source technology. This leads to an interesting connection, as Acapella-extractor and Remove-Vocals use the Spleeter algorithm published by Deezer.

Deezer is one of the largest legal streaming services in the world and a key partner of many RIAA labels. On GitHub, Deezer explicitly advertises Spleeter’s music separation features, including the separation of vocals.

Songmastr is also based on third-party open-source software. The service uses the Matchering library, which is also used by the artist-endorsed Moises app.

Dumb AI…

Thus far, there hasn’t been any mention of artificial intelligence. The RIAA wasn’t sure about this element either but said that if the sites are training their AI models using copyrighted music, it would be considered problematic.

In their rebuttal, the operator of the sites offered reassurance that there is no learning involved in these AI platforms.

“The open source ‘matchering’ algorithm is not a trained algorithm. It is a predetermined set of operations, which transform the user input, using general properties of a reference song,” they write, adding that Deezer’s Spleeter algorithm ships pre-trained.

Speaking with TorrentFreak, the operator notes that the term AI is more a marketing term than a technical description. This type of marketing was perceived as a threat by the RIAA but after addressing these concerns the sites hope to stay off the final notorious markets list.",artificial intelligence,torrentfreak.com

The post NASA Announces the Team who'll be Studying UFO Data. It's a Pretty Impressive List appeared …",https://www.universetoday.com/158358/nasa-announces-the-team-wholl-be-studying-ufo-data-its-a-pretty-impressive-list/,"In June, NASA announced that it had commissioned an independent study team to investigate unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) from a scientific perspective. Last week, NASA announced the members of the independent team that will study observed events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or natural phenomena. These sixteen individuals, a collection of scientists and researchers from premier institutions across the U.S., will analyze all possible data sources that could help NASA and other agencies learn more about this phenomenon.

Until recently, the study of UAP was a matter of national security and air safety pursued exclusively by government and military agencies. However, since the Office of Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released its report last year (aka. the UFO Report), it has become the subject of scientific research. However, scientists require access to extensive sets of data to verify and explain observed events. Therefore, the focus of the study is to inform NASA about possible data sources that could discern the nature of UAP.

The team began their work on Monday, October 24th, and will spend the next nine months laying the groundwork for future studies of UAPs by NASA and other organizations. This will consist of the team reviewing how data gathered by government, commercial, military, and other entities (which has since been declassified) can be analyzed to learn more about UAPs. This team will then prepare a series of recommendations for UAP data analysis to NASA and a full report of its findings for the public (to be released by mid-2023).

Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters, said in a recent NASA press statement:

“Exploring the unknown in space and the atmosphere is at the heart of who we are at NASA. Understanding the data we have surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena is critical to helping us draw scientific conclusions about what is happening in our skies. Data is the language of scientists and makes the unexplainable, explainable.”

Daniel Evans, the assistant deputy associate administrator for research at NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD), is responsible for orchestrating the study. The team is led by David Spergel, the President of the Simons Foundation and the founding director of the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics). The UAP independent study team is comprised of leading scientists, data and artificial intelligence analysts, and aerospace safety experts.

Other group members include Anamaria Berea, an associate professor at George Mason University, research affiliate with the SETI Institute, and a research investigator with the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science (BMSIS). There’s David Grinspoon, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute (PSI), adjunct professor, the former inaugural Baruch S. Blumberg/NASA Chair in Astrobiology,and member of NASA’s upcoming DAVINCI mission. And then there’s Scott Kelly, a former NASA astronaut who commanded Expeditions 26, 45, and 46, and spent a year aboard the ISS as part of the NASA Twins Study.

Other people of interest include Mike Gold, the executive VP of Civil Space and External Affairs at Redwire Space, and a former NASA associate administrator who helped draft the Artemis Accords and the international agreements for the Lunar Gateway; and Shelley Wright, an associate professor of physics at the UCSD’s Center for Astrophysics and Space Studies (CASS), SETI researcher and instrumentalist, and principal investigator for the UCSD Optical Infrared Laboratory (OIR).

Every member is charged with a specific area of focus, with the ultimate purpose of informing NASA how to apply the full focus of science and data to the study of UAPs. Each member was appointed in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which governs the operation of independent federal advisory committees and ensures public involvement in the process. Said Evans:

“NASA has brought together some of the world’s leading scientists, data and artificial intelligence practitioners, aerospace safety experts, all with a specific charge, which is to tell us how to apply the full focus of science and data to UAP. The findings will be released to the public in conjunction with NASA’s principles of transparency, openness, and scientific integrity.”

This study and the resulting recommendations are part of NASA’s astrobiology program, which is dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life. This consists of looking for chemical signatures that are associated with life and biological processes (“biosignatures”) and indications of technological activity (“technosignatures”). Through the study of UAP, NASA will be searching for evidence of active or defunct technology through which we can infer the existence of extant or extinct civilizations.

These efforts include searches here at home through the study of UAP, throughout the Solar System via robotic missions, and the Universe at large through the study of extrasolar planets. Potential technosignatures include space probes, radio communications, directed energy signatures, megastructures, and other indications of advanced intelligence. These efforts are paralleled by the work of non-profit organizations like the Galileo Project, led by Prof. Abraham Loeb of Harvard University, and the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).

The post Providing green investors with metrics on their impact appeared first on Springwise.",https://www.springwise.com/innovation/financial-services/providing-green-investors-with-metrics-on-their-impact/,"Spotted: The amount of money invested in assets classified as ESG, according to different definitions, is expected to reach $50 trillion (around €51 trillion) by 2025. Despite this, it is still extremely difficult for investors to measure the performance of their portfolio against climate and other sustainability goals. To help organisations and individuals make sustainable investment choices, a new platform called Net Purpose has built a database of social and environmental performance.

Net Purpose’s platform allows investors to upload their portfolio and rapidly receive information about its social and environmental performance, such as how well the portfolio is contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals or other climate targets as compared to a benchmark. The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) to incorporate facts from thousands of sustainability reports into its database.

In addition to AI models, Net Purpose also has a core team of experts, who review and validate the information using expertise in various areas including impact investing, AI, financial data, environmental science, and public health. As well as comparing their portfolio against a benchmark, the platform allows investors to track their performance against a goal, such as a reduction in carbon emissions.

Sam Duncan, Net Purpose founder and CEO, explains the organisations’ goal, saying, “In the race to achieve climate and other sustainable goals, the sophistication of sustainable and impact investing is rapidly advancing. Investors are demanding the facts on the social and environmental performance of their funds, just like they do financial return. We are proud to arm investors with trusted and transparent data, and we are honoured to power the most sophisticated investors in the world.”

Maximising the sustainability of investing has been the focus of a growing number of innovations. These include products such as a platform that helps companies track ESG, sustainability, and CSR in one place, and a machine learning model that tracks performance against the UN development goals.

The Neuralink technology has already shocked the world showing a monkey play pong with its thoughts.

1 Musk wants to put tiny chips in people's brains

But the main goal is to implant the chips into people's brains, allowing those with paralysis to control things like smartphones and computers.

An update was due to be presented by the firm on October 31.

But Musk, 51, said it would now take place a month later on November 30.

The world's richest man didn't give any explanation for the delay.

He simply tweeted: ""Neuralink show & tell now on Nov 30.""

Founded in 2016, Neuralink is developing implantable brain chips that are inserted into regions of the mind that control movement.

Eventually, the company wants to provide its implants to people to boost their intelligence.

The aim is to create a full brain interface within 25 years.

Musk has claimed that the technology will stop humans being outpaced by artificial intelligence, which he believes may one day turn against us.

Neuralink says it has already plugged its chips into the grey matter of rats and pigs.

But earlier this year, the firm was accused of animal cruelty amid claims some of the monkeys involved in tests had died.

Some experts are also concerned the technology could be misused.

The group includes former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly who spent nearly a year in space. Kelly and the team will spend the next nine months combing through unclassified data on UFOs.

The independent study, which begins today, will look at UAPs that cannot be identified as aircraft or natural phenomena and present their findings to the public in mid-2023.

It follows the first U.S. congressional hearings in 50 years that looked through 144 UAP videos witnessed by military personnel.

Astronaut Kelly will be joined by scientists, data and artificial intelligence specialists, and aerospace safety experts who will attempt to lay the groundwork for future studies by providing a roadmap on how to analyze data.

“Exploring the unknown in space and the atmosphere is at the heart of who we are at NASA,” says Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

“Understanding the data we have surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena is critical to helping us draw scientific conclusions about what is happening in our skies. Data is the language of scientists and makes the unexplainable, explainable.”

The space agency says that UAPs are of interest for both national security and air safety. NASA wants to ensure the safety of aircraft and without access to an extensive set of data, it is difficult to verify or explain any observation.

“Thus the focus of the study is to inform NASA what possible data could be collected in the future to scientifically discern the nature of UAP,” it adds in a press release.

The Truth is Out There

NASA has previously said there is no current evidence that UAP sightings are extraterrestrial in origin and existing data does not indicate there is alien life.

High-profile videos captured by U.S. military personnel showing a UFO moving in ways that seemed unearthly have become the “poster child” footage for proof that aliens do exist.

While the Pentagon found no evidence that the videos are definitive proof of extraterrestrials, they also could not eliminate the possibility either fuelling theories about the existence of aliens.

“We have access to a broad range of observations of Earth from space — and that is the lifeblood of scientific inquiry,” adds Zurbuchen.

“We have the tools and team who can help us improve our understanding of the unknown. That’s the very definition of what science is. That’s what we do.”",artificial intelligence,petapixel

Shutterstock is teaming up with OpenAI for its DALL-E software, while Getty Images is joining forces with BRIA, a company based in Israel that also has its own image API. Both companies initially shunned AI-generated content on their platforms last month due to copyright concerns.

Text-to-image models learn to map words to visual representations of objects and scenes. They are trained on large datasets made up of photographs and art scraped from websites such as Flickr, Pinterest, or Artstation. Users can use these tools to produce their own images by typing a text description.

The images used to train the models are often scraped without consent. If they can mimic the style of a particular artist, who owns the copyright? Can people use this image for commercial purposes? Unfortunately, these issues remain unsettled. Shuttersock and Getty's new partnerships only skirt around these problems.

Shutterstock said it licensed its images and metadata to OpenAI to train DALL-E in 2021, but the software was trained on other sources too. ""The data we licensed from Shutterstock was critical to the training of DALL-E,"" OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, said in a statement. ""We're excited for Shutterstock to offer DALL-E images to its customers as one of the first deployments through our API, and we look forward to future collaborations as artificial intelligence becomes an integral part of artists' creative workflows.""

DALL-E will be integrated on Shutterstock over the coming months. Customers will be able to use the tool to generate and customize their own images, while creators contributing content to Shutterstock will be compensated if their photos or images are ​​used to train future models. They will be paid royalties for their intellectual property.

""The mediums to express creativity are constantly evolving and expanding. We recognize that it is our great responsibility to embrace this evolution and to ensure that the generative technology that drives innovation is grounded in ethical practices,"" Shutterstock CEO Paul said.

""We have a long history of integrating AI into every part of our business. This expert-level competency makes Shutterstock the ideal partner to help our creative community navigate this new technology. And we're committed to developing best practices and experiences to deliver on our purpose, which is to empower the world to create with confidence.""

Although the initiative provides some sort of compensation for artists' work, it doesn't quite solve the issue of them being ripped off in the first place to train current state-of-the-art models. Instead, the partnerships provide a direct way for stock photo companies to profit off AI-generated content.

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/10/24/an-ai-created-100000-full-body-photos-of-people-who-dont-exist/,"Up until now, AI portraits of people who don’t exist have just been headshots. But now, a company has created 100,000 fake humans that have bodies too.

Generated Photos have released 100,000 “super realistic full-body photos” made entirely from artificial intelligence (AI).

What’s more, the photos are available for free for non-commercial use, so long as a backlink is given attributing Generated Photos.

Previously, the generated photos only showed the head and shoulders. Now, full bodies have been added allowing for implementation into more mediums.

The full-body AIs can be used in advertisements, web design, game and video production among many other avenues.

The AI headshot photos have already been used in the gaming industry, for mental health issues, as references for artists, or NFT artworks.

“Full-body photos can do all the above things and much more than just faces,” notes Artem Kan from Generated Photos.

“There are lots of speculations and prejudices against content generated by AI. Many people think of that exclusively as deep fakes, disinformation, and related malicious stuff. But the same people watch movies with deceased actors resurrected by computer technologies and go to ABBA concerts in 2022.”

Technology Uses

The company notes that there have been some peculiar uses of its product. One such example is crime prevention.

“Our photos help law enforcers to catch online predators and offenders. We cannot share many details on this as it involves personal information and cases with pending legal status,” the company writes.

A website dedicated to victims of COVID-19 in the U.S. used the generated photos to illustrate the massive impact that the coronavirus had on the country. 535,000 faces were generated, each one representing a person who died of the disease.

Another interesting case saw a retired librarian fight age bias by using an AI picture that looked like a younger version of herself to get a remote job.

What’s Next

Generated Media, the company behind Generated Photos, already runs a Face Generator tool and it wants to expand that into a full body generator.

At the moment, the full-body AI examples are all of young, slim adults. The company plans to diversify with different ages, body types, poses, and custom clothes.

Her most memorable fight with her sister when they were teenagers was over “the optimal route” home. She used to say that if there was a nutritionally complete pill to replace food, she would take it.

She even came up with a “mathematically informed” seating plan for her wedding, crunching factors such as age, political persuasion and predicted alcohol consumption to decide which guests should share a table.

Numbers had always brought Fry clarity, a sense of control, even comfort. Then, in January last year, she found the stats working against her. A routine smear test, followed by a biopsy, had confirmed cervical cancer. She was 36 at the time and had two young daughters.

The day of her diagnosis was a “total out-of-body experience”, Fry says. She would have to wait for results of the crucial scans, showing whether the cancer had spread. In the meantime, she had an essay due to the New Yorker – “literally that night”.

Fry recalls an intense evening, “sitting on my bed, drinking really heavily, crying and writing”. What was the essay about, I ask? Fry peels into laughter. “It was about the limits of what data can tell us.”

As a writer, broadcaster, lecturer and presenter, Fry has made her career out of demystifying figures and data so that they might be put to use in society and our everyday lives. Within that remit, however, her interests are broad and apparently boundless – and often ahead of the curve.

As a regular presenter of documentaries for the BBC, Fry has turned her informed enthusiasm to subjects as varied as the logistics of aviation and the science behind supermarket use-by dates.

The Curious Cases of Rutherford & Fry – her podcast with the scientist Adam Rutherford, answering listeners’ questions such as “is dark matter a fudge?” – recently concluded its 20th series, and will return for another in the new year.

In her new BBC Two show, Secret Wonders of the Modern World, she looks into inventions and innovations that we may be taking for granted – starting with bank cards.

Fry greets me from the back of a car bound for the BBC, her hair still only half-styled ahead of a shoot. She didn’t realise we were going to be talking with video, she explains merrily: “I thought I’d leave my pin curls in because I thought no one was going to see me.”

For all the glamour of working in TV and radio, Fry still considers herself “a mathematician, first and foremost” – and a celebrity “only if you like extremely niche maths videos on the internet”.

But beyond that, she admits, she struggles to define her focus or preoccupation: “The phrase that I use is that I am intellectually promiscuous.”

Fry has always had this voracious appetite for knowledge. She grew up in Ware, Hertfordshire, “very working-class”: her English father made hydraulic lifts for trucks, and her mother, an Irish immigrant, stayed at home.

The phrase that I use is that I am intellectually promiscuous

“Education was always, in our family, the number-one priority,” says Fry. When she was about 11, her mother made her complete one page of a maths textbook for every day of the summer holidays.

She tells this story with such delight that I question its veracity. “Oh, I was not happy about it, believe me,” she says. (Her 2018 book, Hello World: How to Be Human in the Age of the Machine, is dedicated to her mum: “Thank you for never taking ‘no’ as an answer.”)

Fry studied mathematics and theoretical physics at UCL, followed by a PhD in fluid dynamics. She became a lecturer there in 2012, and is now a professor in the mathematics of cities.

But Fry was never a “natural mathematician”, she says: what drew her in was data as a means of storytelling and shedding light on the world. Fry’s breakthrough moment was in 2014, when she gave a Ted Talk on “the mathematics of love”, using probability to find a partner and finding a statistical approach to relationship satisfaction.

“It was the kind of thing that I found funny and that I’d joke with my friends about – how I’m going to optimise my dating strategy.” (She and her husband were, in fact, set up by friends.)

The Ted Talk has now been viewed nearly 7m times; Fry still receives messages taking umbrage at her suggestion that, if you are still with your first ever partner, you are best off breaking up. “It’s always slightly tongue-in-cheek … The numbers will only ever take you so far.” At the same time, as Fry says in the clip, there is no other possible strategy that can do any better.

That is the common thread, across all of her projects and platforms: the unexpected intersections of data and humanity – especially where there might be real-world applications.

“A really crunchy textbook” can hold as much interest and excitement for her as a potboiler, she says. “It’s almost as if I’ve got this incredibly juicy bit of gossip that I want to share with everybody.”

Often, Fry has played the part of a sympathetic go-between for those lay people who can’t make sense of numbers and the experts who struggle to see past them. But in the past two years she has started to see the limits to playing interlocutor – and even data itself.

“Ultimately, every decision is an emotional one,” she says. “You might have an emotional reaction to the data, but you can’t put them on either side of a weighing scale and expect them to balance – they just don’t.”

That has been a “learning curve” for her, too – accelerated by the pandemic, and cemented by her experience of cancer. She may have understood the discussion of probability better than most patients – but in such circumstances, “all of your training disappears”, Fry says.

“Really honestly, when you’re in that position – it doesn’t matter whether you have a PhD in mathematics or you dropped out of school aged 12: every single person is just frightened about their future, thinking about their family and the people that they love.”

Fry faced particular uncertainty. Her scans had been ambiguous as to whether the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes – “and whether it had, or hadn’t, made a dramatic difference”.

If the cancer had reached just one lymph node, her stage-one diagnosis immediately jumped to stage three, substantially decreasing her chances of survival, and again with each node thereafter.

Fry was advised to proceed on the assumption it had spread and to undergo a radical hysterectomy, removing not just her uterus and “a long list” of its surrounds, but also all the lymph nodes in her pelvis. After her surgery, she was told that four or five of her lymph nodes were swollen, indicating cancer had already reached the lymphatic system. “I was in there like: ‘Right, game over: it’s done,’” she says.

She spent a sleepless week in hospital, in isolation due to the need to shield from coronavirus. It was “horrendous”: “The surgeon had basically told me that things weren’t looking good … and I was just there, paralysed in place, mentally and physically.”

But, two weeks later, scans showed that the surgery had been successful: “I had somehow got away with it.” She sounds as if she still can’t believe her luck.

I’m not saying that I would necessarily have made a different decision – but I would have liked to have been involved in that decision

Fry has now been in remission for more than a year. “Not to be too grandiose about it, but I do think that, actually, my worldview has really shifted in the last couple of years. There’s a really nice line: ‘Life isn’t a problem to be solved, it’s an experience to be had.’”

As glad as Fry is to be alive, however, she feels ambivalent about how the risks were communicated to her.

“I was only ever told what the numbers were; I was never given the numbers in order to give myself a choice,” she says.

After surgery, Fry developed lymphoedema: a chronic condition affecting the lymphatic system that causes swelling of the limbs and requires lifelong daily management. It was presented as a possible side-effect, Fry says – but, relative to potentially terminal cancer, a problem she’d be lucky to have. The choice, as it was put to her, seemed to be to have the hysterectomy, or to go without – in short, whether to live or die. “At no point did I realise that actually there is an entire series of steps between one and the other,” she says.

Fry was fortunate in being able to afford an experimental surgery (costing about £15,000) that has significantly alleviated the impact of the condition. But the feeling that she was steered towards an outcome that she never fully understood lingers.

“I’m not saying that I would necessarily have made a different decision – but I would have liked to have been involved in that decision.”

To Fry, it highlighted the importance of acting as your own advocate within the health system; she produced her intensely personal BBC Horizon documentary, Making Sense of Cancer, with that in mind.

“There is a much more patriarchal approach to medicine outside of maternity, where we just sort of nod and agree, and later wonder if it was really right for us.” She sighs. “Is it too much to ask that you really understand the risk of lifelong complications?”

In a perfect world, Fry suggests, patients who needed to make consequential decisions about their health would be able to sit down with a consultant who had a strong grasp on probabilities, “and have a conversation: ‘What is most important to you? What are the aspects of your life that you most want to preserve, and how can we find the best path for you?’ That, for me, is what really informed consent is.”

But reaching such an understanding takes not just resources, but a readiness to listen and learn.

Without making an effort to understand other people, Fry says, with mounting impatience – “you are just not going to get anywhere. You’re both playing tennis, but you’re on different courts.”

She saw this herself earlier this year while making Unvaccinated, a BBC Two documentary about Britons who had refused the Covid-19 vaccine. One reviewer suggested that Fry deserved a “Bafta for most patient TV host”.

In fact – she says, sounding rueful – that week she learned that she was a lot less patient than she thought she was. “I went into it being probably more understanding and respectful of unvaccinated people than my peers … I held it together, but I really struggled.”

The interviewee who made the greatest impression on Fry was Chanelle, a black woman from Lambeth in south London, who said that the vaccination centres resembled prisons.

“She was saying: why would you voluntarily put yourself into that kind of triggering environment, for something that you don’t feel like you need? I could not agree with her more – and until she had said it, I just had never seen it that way.”

Yet doctors tried to bring Chanelle round to the vaccine with figures about its safety, as though that was a response to her concern. “There is an emotional response, and you have to respect that and understand that,” Fry says, with frustration.

“You have to make people feel like they are properly included and listened to if you want them to go with you – and I think, actually, that’s a really big mistake that we’ve made.”

The most obvious example of this failure of communication is the pandemic. Fry had been unexpectedly across the threat, having set out to predict the impact for Contagion: The BBC Four Pandemic in 2018. The large-scale data collection she led as part of the citizen-science experiment ended up being applied to Covid-19 research two years later.

She remembers shouting at her TV as impenetrable graphs – in one case, “actual nonsense equations” – were flicked through at speed during the government’s press conferences. Sometimes, Fry says, she felt stats were being used as set dressing, “to give themselves an air of authority”. “They know that this is stuff that people find really difficult and intimidating and so they used it almost to close off discussion. I think that was the wrong thing to do.”

She chooses her words carefully, finally pulling out her pin curls as her car approaches the BBC. Top-down communication no longer works any more, she says: “Trust now has to be much more about a relationship.

“That means being transparent about what you’re not sure about, and being honest and open about the bad stuff as well as the good stuff – because I think that is the only way to get people to genuinely believe you.”

Happily, for now, Fry is able to focus on the good stuff with her new series celebrating innovations. “The world is so blimmin’ depressing, all of the time … This is genuine but well-founded glee at the things that we have achieved.”

In showing us how much we take for granted now, it might also present possibilities for the future. When I ask Fry for a statistic that keeps her up at night, she does not need to think long: 1.5C.

“That’s one version of the future – but I do honestly believe that there is another version possible, one where we are using mathematical algorithms and artificial intelligence to take salt out of water, or turn the Sahara back into a rainforest … The technology is starting to accelerate, and if you can get that to work, then you are in a world of abundance.”

I ask her if she could have one aspect of maths magically understood, what would it be?

She gives real thought, savouring the possibility, and settles on a simple concept of probability: “If something has a 95% chance of happening, and it doesn’t happen,” Fry starts to titter, “you shouldn’t be surprised.”

“I Can Make Something Better” By Carrie Sundra

Subscribe to Make: for this and more projects and articles

Why am I even doing this? These words go through my head late at night as I’m staring at yet another bill of materials, trying to figure out how to wrangle another dollar or two of parts cost out of a new kit. I mean, I could be making bank working for pretty much anyone, designing circuit boards or getting a new product ready for manufacturing. I could even do it from home now, thanks to Covid normalizing remote work. Instead, I’m trying to figure out how to sell soldering kits for $10 or $20 and make enough money to employ a few people and live a modest life in California. Yep, livin’ the dream.

But I know why I do this. After 20-plus years of working for others in tech and designing circuit boards, I’m sick and tired of being the only technical woman in the room. The outlier in an overwhelmingly toxic monoculture that tries to normalize rude and disrespectful behavior by claiming that’s just how nerds are, tries to prove worth by one-upping “cleverness” and losing all sight of practicality. They gatekeep their own little castles by purposefully speaking in jargon and then condemning anyone who dares to ask the meaning of a word, and generally put down anyone who just might have different priorities or opinions, or Bob forbid, want to look feminine.

I look at this terribly awful and broken thing and think, I can make something better. I’m not the first to think this, and I won’t be the last. This better thing might not be big, it might not single-handedly change the world, but maybe if enough of us start making better places and support and encourage newcomers, maybe together we can start making a dent. Maybe we can at least create a small breath of fresh air, a place where it’s OK to be a n00b at something, to experiment without the fear of judgment, to ask the meaning of words, and to make something pretty.

So I started a small business called Alpenglow Industries and we try to do all of those things. Encouraging people to pick up soldering irons and learn through-hole and SMT soldering skills is one thing we do through soldering kits that are a little out of the ordinary. Our weather-themed badge series is cute and approachable, while our SMT kits feature artwork that’s creative and sassy. We’re not afraid to put our values into our products — Foxy Pride is an SMT kit that allows you to pick your own LGBTQ pride colors in LEDs, and we’re working on a Ruth Bader Ginsburg-themed board (RBG RGB!) and another called the FUterus.

We livestream and feature a variety of guests who are technical and creative, many of whom make great kits themselves. We make videos and write posts about electronics and programming, often sharing something we’ve recently dug into or something new we’ve learned.

It’s all about community and making a welcoming space, even if it’s just a corner of the internet. Ah, maybe if I switch out that 0.1″ header and shunt combo for a switch, I can save 50 cents. Perfect!

#2 KitCo, est. 2019

A Modular Canvas for Projects By Nancy Otero

KitCo brings project-based learning into homes and classrooms through “challenges” linked to unique ideas that are worth learning. Our starting point is a cardboard kit that invites even technology-skeptical teachers and students to create projects. Once they feel like it, they can add textiles, paint, robotics, augmented reality (AR), or artificial intelligence (AI).

I love technology; I was a software engineer in my previous life, but my passion has always been learning, so I’ve been dedicated to education in the last decade. I have worked with educators from China, Brazil, Mexico, the United States, and Spain. I created professional development programs that trained hundreds of teachers in New York City, and built Fab Labs and makerspaces in all five boroughs. I co-founded a nonprofit in Mexico that implemented innovation labs with underserved high schoolers while researching their experiences with Stanford University. I was the founding director of learning at Portfolio School, director of learning at Make:, and a fellow at OpenAI.

When the Covid crisis started, I was worried about children having so much screen time and not enough opportunities to externalize what was happening in their world. So I began KitCo, to support schools in implementing remote project-based learning, a type of learning that could give children agency — something so needed when we were all witnessing the world change without our say.

The design had a few constraints: I wanted to create something comfortable that didn’t scare anyone, not a STEM kit, but a modular canvas for projects. It had to be cheap, able to mix with recyclable materials, and able to grow into robotics or AR.

For a long time, it was me, a laser cutter, and many cutoffs of cardboard boxes. I dived into pieces I designed for old workshops, analyzed other kits, and conducted mini tests with friends and family. The real learning was the first time I implemented it in an elementary school, where I observed teachers and helped more than 300 children play and create with the kit.

Our cardboard kit is compatible with the most common motors and servos used for Arduino, micro:bit, and GoGo Board. The holes in our design are great for wooden sticks or pipe cleaners, and we have wooden pulleys that give projects smooth movement. We have pieces made for structural support, others for storytelling and wearables, and a set for mechanical functions.

After the first year, we were happy and astounded by all the different projects children created for our challenges. For our Defy Gravity challenge, a team of second-grade girls from Sunnybrae Elementary School created a solar system with robotics. For the same challenge, a kindergarten made a wearable that launched a ball through a lever mechanism. Today our subscription model includes a magazine that showcases some of those ingenious solutions children send us.

Next month we’ll be launching Hands and Dots, a series of experiences co-designed with extraordinary educators who understand how to operate in underserved and complex contexts. Into the Wonder is our first learning experience in the series, and it’s co-created with educator Carlos Espinosa. Into the Wonder questions the exploration and commercialization of space, and invites learners to design their space mission and create a rover using AR and robotics.

My dream is to amplify and scale the voice of extraordinary teachers who support their students in creating open-ended projects. I want to open-source our design so everyone can cut it and upcycle cardboard into learning materials, because learning through projects doesn’t require fancy, expensive materials and step-by-step instructions.

#3 Learn to Solder Kits, est. 2015

ShareTheLoveofMaking By Emma Fletcher

In 2015 when I volunteered at an all-day engineering outreach conference, an event for local high school girls, I wanted to share my love of making with them. I led a workshop on soldering, and I was sure I would inspire at least a few girls to become electrical engineers by the end of the day. That wasn’t how it turned out.

The event organizers had purchased some low-cost soldering kits with many components. It was a challenging task to teach safety, explain soldering techniques, and expect the students to finish it all within an hour. By the end of the workshop, not a single kit was working. Half were finished but had broken during assembly, and the other half were incomplete. Worst of all, I had not been able to share the joy of building electronics with the students.

There had to be a better way to teach soldering. I decided that if the kit I wanted didn’t exist then I would create it. My requirements were that it would be simple enough to complete in a 30- to 60-minute workshop and that every kit would work at the end. I made a simple design of three pushbuttons and three LEDs. It was interactive and every student could walk away with a feeling of accomplishment.

I ordered my first run of printed circuit boards, a total quantity of 60. Sixty boards seemed like a lot but that was the minimum quantity I could order and still get the bulk discount. How would I find 60 people who wanted to purchase simple soldering kits? I decided not to worry about it and instead focused on sourcing parts. Once everything arrived, I packed up the first five dozen kits and printed some labels designed in MS Paint. The first run of Blink Learn to Solder Kit was ready to go.

I posted on Facebook, reaching out to other makers and engineering educators. Within the first day, I sold 25. All 60 were gone by the end of the week. I placed another board order and set up a small table for kit assembly. Before I knew it, I had schools asking for bulk discounts, and the Learn to Solder Kits brand was born.

From there, I decided to expand the line of kits we were offering. I partnered with Andy Colborn and created two more kits. The Hue kit features a large RGB LED and three potentiometers. Jitterbug is a fun bug-shaped board with vibration motors and two glowing red eyes. We opened an online store and made all the kits certified open source hardware.

Our kits are now shipped all over the United States and even internationally. Last year we shipped over 8,000 kits. This year in March I made the decision to leave my job as a software engineer and go full-time on Learn to Solder Kits. It is still early days for me in this transition but so far I am loving it! Not only do I get to focus on something I love each day but the business is growing. We’re on track this year to double the number of units shipped annually. While I may not have created any electrical engineers at my first workshop, that failure ignited a business that has had a far further reach than I could have imagined.",artificial intelligence,makezine.com

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements

This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about the business, financial condition and prospects of Enova. These forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events and reflect the views and assumptions of Enova's senior management with respect to the business, financial condition and prospects of Enova as of the date of this release and are not guarantees of future performance. The actual results of Enova could differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties applicable to Enova's business, including, without limitation, those risks and uncertainties indicated in Enova's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q and current reports on Forms 8-K. These risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of Enova to control, and, in many cases, Enova cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. When used in this release, the words ""believes,"" ""estimates,"" ""plans,"" ""expects,"" ""anticipates"" and similar expressions or variations as they relate to Enova or its management are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Enova cautions you not to put undue reliance on these statements. Enova disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this release.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Enova provides historical non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of Enova's operations. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of Enova's business that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.

Management provides non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of Enova's GAAP consolidated financial statements. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, Enova's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

Combined Loans and Finance Receivables

The combined loans and finance receivables measures are non-GAAP measures that include loans and finance receivables that Enova owns or has purchased and loans that Enova guarantees. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors with important information needed to evaluate the magnitude of potential receivable losses and the opportunity for revenue performance of the loans and finance receivable portfolio on an aggregate basis. Management also believes that the comparison of the aggregate amounts from period to period is more meaningful than comparing only the amounts reflected on Enova's consolidated balance sheet since revenue is impacted by the aggregate amount of receivables owned by Enova and those guaranteed by Enova as reflected in its consolidated financial statements.

Adjusted Earnings Measures

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, Enova has provided adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, or, collectively, the Adjusted Earnings Measures, which are non-GAAP measures. Management believes that the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, derivative instruments and amortization methods, which provides a more complete understanding of Enova's financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. Management also believes that investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as the Adjusted Earnings Measures, to assess operating performance and that such measures may highlight trends in Enova's business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, management believes that the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare Enova's financial results during the periods shown without the effect of each of these expense items.

Adjusted EBITDA Measures

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, Enova has provided Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or, collectively, the Adjusted EBITDA measures, which are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that Enova defines as earnings excluding depreciation, amortization, interest, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, taxes and stock-based compensation. In addition, management believes that the adjustments for transaction-related costs, other nonoperating expenses and equity method investment income shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare our financial results during the periods shown without the effect of the expense items. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that Enova defines as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA Measures are used by investors to analyze operating performance and evaluate Enova's ability to incur and service debt and Enova's capacity for making capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA Measures are also useful to investors to help assess Enova's estimated enterprise value.

Fed up with the constant stream of fake news on her family WhatsApp group chats in India – ranging from a water crisis in South Africa to rumors around a Bollywood actor’s death – Tarunima Prabhakar built a simple tool to tackle misinformation.

Prabhakar, co-founder of India-based technology firm Tattle, archived content from fact-checking sites and news outlets, and used machine learning to automate the verification process.

The web-based tool is available to students, researchers, journalists and academics, she said.

“Platforms like Facebook and Twitter are under scrutiny for misinformation, but not WhatsApp,” she said of the messaging app owned by Meta, Facebook’s parent, that has more than 2 billion monthly active users, with about half a billion in India alone.

“The tools and methods used to check misinformation on Facebook and Twitter are not applicable to WhatsApp, and they also aren’t good with Indian languages,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

WhatsApp rolled out measures in 2018 to rein in messages forwarded by users, after rumours spread on the messaging service led to several killings in India. It also removed the quick-forward button next to media messages.

Tattle is among a rising number of initiatives across Asia tackling online misinformation, hate speech and abuse in local languages, using technologies such as artificial intelligence, as well as crowdsourcing, on-ground training and engaging with civil society groups to cater to the needs of communities.

While tech firms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube face growing scrutiny for hate speech and misinformation, they have not invested enough in developing countries, and lack moderators with language skills and knowledge of local events, experts say.

“Social media companies don’t listen to local communities. They also fail to consider context – cultural, social, historical, economic, political – when moderating users’ content,” said Pierre François Docquir, head of media freedom at Article 19, a human rights group.

“This can have a dramatic impact, online and offline. It can increase polarisation and the risk of violence,” he added.

Local initiatives vital

While the impact of hate speech online has already been documented in several Asian countries in recent years, analysts say that tech firms have not ramped up resources to improve content moderation, particularly in local languages.

United Nations rights investigators said in 2018 that the use of Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fuelled the violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar in 2017, after a military crackdown on the minority community.

Facebook said at the time it was tackling misinformation and investing in Burmese-language speakers and technology.

In Indonesia, “significant hate speech” online targets religious and racial minority groups, as well as LGBTQ+ people, with bots and paid trolls spreading disinformation aimed at deepening divisions, a report from Article 19 found in June.

“Social media companies… must work with local initiatives to tackle the huge challenges in governing problematic content online,” said Sherly Haristya, a researcher who helped write the report on content moderation in Indonesia with Article 19.

One such local initiative is by Indonesian non-profit Mafindo, which backed by Google, runs workshops to train citizens – from students to stay-at-home mothers – in fact-checking and spotting misinformation.

Mafindo, or Masyarakat Anti Fitnah Indonesia, the Indonesian Anti-Slander Society, provides training in reverse image search, video metadata and geolocation to help verify information.

The non-profit has a professional fact-checking team that, aided by citizen volunteers, has debunked at least 8,550 hoaxes.

Mafindo has also built a fact-checking chatbot in the Bahasa language called Kalimasada – introduced just before the 2019 election. It is accessed via WhatsApp and has about 37,000 users – a sliver of the nation’s more than 80 million WhatsApp users.

“The elderly are particularly vulnerable to hoaxes, misinformation and fake news on the platforms, as they have limited technology skills and mobility,” said Santi Indra Astuti, Mafindo’s president.

“We teach them how to use social media, about personal data protection, and to look critically at trending topics: during COVID it was misinformation about vaccines, and in 2019, it was about the election and political candidates,” she said.

Abuse detection challenges

Across Asia, governments are tightening rules for social media platforms, banning certain types of messages, and requiring the swift removal of posts deemed objectionable.

Yet hate speech and abuse, particularly in local languages, often goes unchecked, said Prabhakar of Tattle, who has also built a tool called Uli – which is Tamil for chisel – for detecting online gender-based abuse in English, Tamil and Hindi.

Tattle’s team crowdsourced a list of offensive words and phrases that are used commonly online, that the tool then blurs on users’ timelines. People can also add more words themselves.

“Abuse detection is very challenging,” said Prabhakar. Uli’s machine learning feature uses pattern recognition to detect and hide problematic posts from a user’s feed, she explained.

“The moderation happens at the user level, so it’s a bottom-up approach as opposed to the top-down approach of platforms,” she said, adding that they would also like Uli to be able to detect abusive memes, images and videos.

In Singapore, Empathly, a software tool developed by two university students, takes a more proactive approach, functioning like a spell check when it detects abusive words.

Aimed at businesses, it can detect abusive terms in English, Hokkien, Cantonese, Malay and Singlish – or Singaporean English.

“We’ve seen the harm that hate speech can cause. But Big Tech tends to focus on English and its users in English-speaking markets,” said Timothy Liau, founder and chief executive of Empathly.

“So there is room for local interventions – and as locals, we understand the culture and the context a bit better.” – Rappler.com

93,1 Super Semiconductor Stock Down 64% to Buy Hand Over Fist,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/705828/a-series-of-graphics-computer-chips-with-fans-spinning-in-multiple-colours.jpg,25/10/2022,Nvidia will play a crucial role in several industries of the future.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/25/1-super-semiconductor-stock-down-64-buy-hand-fist/,"Nvidia (NVDA 5.48%) is one of the world's most innovative semiconductor companies. But beyond making those advanced computer chips, it's also expanding its footprint in the software space, thanks to its leadership position in artificial intelligence (AI) development.

Gaming, once the company's largest segment by revenue, softened dramatically this year as high inflation forced consumers to cut their spending on big-ticket items.

Thankfully for investors, Nvidia is no one-trick pony. It's experiencing growth in other areas, and building a substantial sales pipeline in its electric vehicle segment, in particular, which could be a big driver of revenue in the long term. With Nvidia stock down 64% from its all-time high, this might be an opportunity for investors to pounce.

Nvidia will power the future

Nvidia has maintained a partnership with China-based electric vehicle manufacturer Nio (NIO 17.50%) since 2014, but the scope is quickly ramping up. Back then, the two companies collaborated on in-car infotainment systems, but now, Nio relies on Nvidia to deliver advanced chip hardware and software to power autonomous self-driving capabilities.

Nio's flagship models run on the Adam supercomputer, which is powered by the Nvidia DRIVE platform. Adam can perform at a mind-boggling rate of 1,000 trillion operations per second to enable autonomous driving on expressways and in urban areas, in addition to self-parking.

But Nio is just one of at least 35 automotive brands that have called upon Nvidia's technology so far, and the chipmaker's sales pipeline for the DRIVE platform has already ballooned to $11 billion. Notably, top-tier brands like Daimler's Mercedes Benz will be rolling out autonomous vehicles powered by Nvidia as soon as 2024.

While that will be an incredibly lucrative opportunity in the future, Nvidia is a $306 billion company, so the automotive piece is still relatively small. In the here and now, the company's data center business holds the most promise. Revenue for that segment soared by 61% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended July 31), picking up the slack from the gaming business's 33% decline.

Nvidia is pioneering the transformation of data centers from a place to store information to a training ground for artificial intelligence and machine learning, helping companies draw more valuable insights than ever from their data.

Nvidia's tale of two segments

The pandemic was a major driver of growth for Nvidia's gaming business. Consumers spent more time at home under social restrictions, resulting in more hours in front of screens. On top of that, supply chain disruptions led to shortages of some of Nvidia's most popular chips, which allowed the company to increase prices. And that helped its gaming segment achieve multiple consecutive quarterly revenue records.

But that party appears to be over for now. Some Wall Street analysts are pointing to a glut in chip supplies -- meaning supply caught up and now exceeds demand -- and a weaker appetite among consumers for expensive computer upgrades as the economy slows. The result displayed in the below chart speaks for itself.

Still, as highlighted earlier, Nvidia's data center segment is more than picking up the slack. It continues to set new sales records and has now overtaken gaming as the company's largest business unit.

Zooming out to observe the bigger picture, the sum of Nvidia's parts should result in continued growth on an annual basis, albeit at a slower pace in the near term, according to analysts' estimates.

Why Nvidia stock is a buy on the dip

Nvidia's gaming business might be a drag right now, but it holds plenty of promise for the future. Aside from the fact that consumer spending will eventually recover, the company continues to deliver innovative products like its GeForce Now cloud-based gaming platform. It boasts more than 20 million users who can stream their favorite titles online instantly, without having to purchase a disc or download them. It also eliminates the need for patches and updates, creating a more seamless experience.

The data center segment is also likely to remain strong as more companies adopt cloud computing technology to migrate their operations online. Plus, by 2030, an estimate by McKinsey & Company suggests up to 70% of all organizations worldwide could deploy artificial intelligence in some capacity, an area Nvidia is already leading.

But the emerging long-term opportunity might be in autonomous driving, an industry that could top $2.1 trillion in value by 2030. Nvidia is clearly a company of the future, and investors have the chance to buy shares right now at a significant discount from their all-time high.",artificial intelligence,motley fool

Since 2018, we’ve worked to help pass legislation in both the U.S. and U.K. to combat the sending of unsolicited nudes online, known as cyberflashing. In 2019, we harnessed technology to better shield our community from unwanted lewd images, launching our Private Detector™ A.I. feature in the Bumble app.

Private Detector™ works by automatically blurring a potential nude image shared within a chat on Bumble. You’ll be notified, and it’s up to you to decide whether to view or block the image. (You can also easily report it to Bumble. We don’t tolerate any bad behavior at all on our app.)

Now, Bumble’s Data Science team has written a white paper explaining the technology of Private Detector™ and has made an open-source version of it available on GitHub. It’s our hope that the feature will be adopted by the wider tech community as we work in tandem to make the internet a safer place.

For more on Bumble’s legislative work, see here.

_______________________________

At Bumble Inc., the parent company of Bumble, Badoo, and Fruitz, safety has been a central part of our mission and a core value that informs the company’s product innovations and roadmap. We’ve leveraged the latest advancement in technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help provide our community of users with the tools and resources they need to have a safe experience on our platforms. In 2019 we launched Private Detector™ across Bumble and Badoo app, an AI-powered feature that detects and blurs lewd images and a warning is sent to users about the photo before they open it.

As just one of many players in the world of dating apps and social media at large, we also recognize that there’s a need to address this issue beyond Bumble’s product ecosystem and engage in a larger conversation about how to address the issue of unsolicited lewd photos – also known as cyberflashing – to make the internet a safer and kinder place for everyone.

In an effort to help address this larger issue of cyberflashing, Bumble teamed up with legislators from across the aisle in 2019 in Texas to pass a bill that effectively made sending unsolicited lewd photos a punishable offense. Since the passing of HB 2789 in Texas in 2019, Bumble has continued to successfully advocate for similar laws across the United States and globally.

In 2022, Bumble reached another milestone in public policy by helping to pass SB 493 in Virginia and most recently SB 53 in California, adding another layer of online safety in one of the most populous states in the United States.

These new laws are the first step to creating accountability and consequences for this everyday form of harassment that causes victims—predominantly women—to feel distressed, violated, and vulnerable online.

As Bumble continues to help curb cyberflashing through legislative efforts and provide safety tools such as Private Detector™ to help keep our community safe from unsolicited nudes within our apps, we hope to make a ripple effect of change across the internet and social media at large. This is why today we are extremely proud to release a version of the Private Detector™ to the wider tech community with the hope of democratizing access to our technology and to help scientists and engineers experiencing the same challenges around the world to improve their approach to online safety.

How does it work?

Since the early days of Badoo, we have always been pioneers in leveraging technology and advanced procedures to improve both our match-making experience and our integrity and safety capabilities. Behind the scenes, we started designing and implementing machine learning solutions for lewd image detection for almost a decade, trying to leverage both our best-in-class knowledge in the tech space and the insights collected by our apps, thanks to our dominant position in the dating industry.

Machine learning (ML) is a field devoted to understanding and building methods that learn (or better, mimic) how to reach human-level performances on specific tasks, leveraging data to improve their accuracy. The development cycle requires you to carefully design and develop a neural network’s architecture and to provide it iteratively with a curated set of samples (dataset) from the problem – in our case, detecting if a picture contains lewd content or not.

Even though the number of users sending lewd images on our apps is luckily a negligible minority – just 0.1% – our scale allows us to collect a best-in-the-industry dataset of both lewd and non-lewd images, tailored to achieve the best possible performances on the task. Our Private Detector™ is trained using very high volume data sets, with the negative samples (the ones not containing any lewd content) carefully selected in order to better reflect edge cases and other parts of the human body (eg. legs, arms) in order not to flag them as abusive. Iteratively adding samples to the training dataset to reflect actual users’ behavior or test misclassification, proved to be a successful exercise that we applied during the years in all our machine learning endeavors. Even if the downstream task is framed as a binary classification problem (as in our case!) nothing prevents data scientists from possibly defining more concepts (or labels), to possibly merge them back right before the actual training epochs.

Traversing the trade-offs between state-of-the-art performance and the ability to serve our user base at scale, we implemented (in its latest iteration) an EfficientNetv2-based binary classifier: a convolutional network that has faster training speed and overall better parameters efficiency. It uses a combination of better designed architecture and scaling, with layers like MBConv (that utilizes 1×1 convolutions to wide up the space and depth-wise convolutions for reducing the number of overall parameters) and FusedMBConv (that merges some steps of the vanilla MBConv above for faster execution), to jointly optimize training speed and parameter efficiency. The model has been trained leveraging our GPU powered data centers in a continuous exercise of dataset, network and hyperparameters (the settings used to speed up or improve the training performance) optimization.

When analyzing its performance in different conditions (both offline and online) we are proud to state that it achieves world class performance (>98% accuracy, both in upsampled and production-like settings, with no clear tradeoffs between precision and recall).

What are we releasing today?

Concomitantly with this White Paper, we are releasing on Github.com the source code we used to train the machine learning engine powering the Private Detector™, together with a ready-to-use SavedModel to deploy the model as it is (using TensorFlow Serving) and a checkpoint for possibly finetune it with additional images, improving its performance on samples that are important for specific use cases. In both scenarios, the repository comes with extensive documentation and a guide on how to perform those actions, in order to make the experience as smooth as possible for all the scientists, engineers or product folks around the world.

This version of the Private Detector™ is released under the Apache License, so that it is available for everyone to implement it as the standard for blurring lewd images as it is, or after fine tuning it with additional training samples. Improvements to the architecture or to the overall code quality and structure are welcome.

Police say 34-year-old TeddyJo Marie Fliam was using the self-checkout at an Alpena County Walmart when loss prevention workers noticed she wasn't scanning every item. Fliam became agitated and denied she was skipping items when confronted by a loss prevention worker and left the store, according to a report from Fox 2.

The incident caused the store to review its surveillance footage, which showed Fliam had stolen more than $1,000 in merchandise by not scanning it from the Walmart since April.

WALMART IS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO PREVENT CHECKOUT THEFT

Fliam was arrested at her Alpena home last month and is charged with first-degree retail fraud.

The Alpena County Walmart's loss prevention team has recently begun to crack down on thefts at the self-checkout, with Michigan State Police recording two similar incidents in which people were arrested after swapping barcodes while checking out items.

Professor François Ladouceur, with UNSW’s School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, says the multi-disciplinary team has just demonstrated in the lab what it proved theoretically shortly before the pandemic: that sensors built using liquid crystal and integrated optics technologies – dubbed ‘optrodes’ – can register nerve impulses in a living animal body.





Not only do these optrodes perform just as well as conventional electrodes – that use electricity to detect a nerve impulse – but they also address “very thorny issues that competing technologies cannot address”, says Prof. Ladouceur.





“Firstly, it’s very difficult to shrink the size of the interface using conventional electrodes so that thousands of them can connect to thousands of nerves within a very small area.





“One of the problems as you shrink thousands of electrodes and put them ever closer together to connect to the biological tissues is that their individual resistance increases, which degrades the signal-to-noise ratio so we have a problem reading the signal. We call this ‘impedance mismatch’.





“Another problem is what we call ‘crosstalk’ – when you shrink these electrodes and bring them closer together, they start to talk to, or affect each other because of their proximity.”





“The real advantage of our approach is that we can make this connection very dense in the optical domain and we don’t pay the price that you have to pay in the electrical domain,” Prof. Ladouceur says.





In research published recently in the Journal of Neural Engineering, Prof. Ladouceur and fellow researchers at UNSW wanted to show that they could use optrodes to accurately measure the neural impulses as they travel along a nerve fibre in a living animal.





Scientia Professor Nigel Lovell, who heads the Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering and is Director of the Tyree Foundation Institute of Health Engineering, was part of the research team that sought to demonstrate this in the lab.





He says the team connected an optrode to the sciatic nerve of an anaesthetised animal. The nerve was then stimulated with a small current and the neural signals were recorded with the optrode. Then they did the same using a conventional electrode and a bioamplifier.





“We demonstrated that the nerve responses were essentially the same,” says Prof. Lovell. “There’s still more noise in the optical one, but that’s not surprising given this is brand new technology, and we can work on that. But ultimately, we could identify the same characteristics by measuring electrically or optically.”

New dawn for prosthetics

So far the team has been able to show that nerve impulses – which are relatively weak and measured in microvolts – can be registered by optrode technology. The next step will be to scale up the number of optrodes to be able to handle complex networks of nervous and excitable tissue.





Prof. Ladouceur says at the beginning of the project, his colleagues asked themselves, how many neural connections does a man or woman need to operate a hand with a degree of finesse?





“That you can pick up an object, that you can judge the friction, you can apply just the right pressure to hold it, you can move from A to B with precision, you can go fast and slow – all these things that we don’t even think about when we perform these actions. The answer is not so obvious, we had to search quite a bit in the literature, but we believe it’s about 5000 to 10,000 connections.”





In other words, between your brain and your hand there is a bundle of nerves that travels down from your cortex and eventually divides into those 5000 to 10,000 nerves that control the delicate operations of your hand.





If a chip with thousands of optical connections could connect to your brain, or some place in the arm before the nerve bundle separates, a prosthetic hand could potentially be able to function with much the same ability as a biological one.





That’s the dream, anyway, and Prof. Ladouceur says there are likely decades of further research before it’s a reality. This would include developing the ability for optrodes to be bidirectional. Not only would they receive and interpret signals from the brain on the way to the body, they could receive feedback in the form of neural impulses going back to the brain.

The long game: brain-machine interface

Neural prosthetics isn’t the only space that optrode technology has the potential to redefine. Humans have long fantasised about integrating technology and machinery into the human body to either repair or enhance it.





Some of this is now a reality, such as Cochlear implants, pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators, not to mention smart watches and other tracking devices giving continual biofeedback.





But one of the more ambitious goals in biomedical engineering and neuroscience is the brain-machine interface that aims to connect the brain to not only the rest of the body, but potentially the world.





“The area of neural interfacing is an incredibly exciting field and will be the subject of intense research and development over the next decade,” says Prof. Lovell.





While this is more fiction than fact right now, there are many biotech companies taking this very seriously. Entrepreneur Elon Musk was one of the co-founders of Neuralink that aims to create brain-computer interfaces with the potential to help people with paralysis as well as incorporating artificial intelligence into our brain activities.





The Neuralink approach uses conventional wire electrodes in its devices so it must overcome impedance mismatch and crosstalk – among many other challenges – if they are to develop devices that host thousands, if not millions, of connections between the brain and the implanted device. Recently Mr Musk was reported as being frustrated at the slow pace in developing the technology.





Prof. Ladouceur says time will tell whether Neuralink and its competitors succeed in removing these obstacles. However, given that implantable, in vivo devices that capture neural activity are currently constrained to about 100 or so electrodes, there is still a long way to go.





“I'm not saying that it's impossible, but it becomes really problematic if you were to stick to standard electrodes,” Prof. Ladouceur says.





“We don't have these problems in the optical domain. In our devices, if there is neural activity, its presence influences the orientation of the liquid crystal which we can detect and quantify by shining light on it. It means we don't extract current from the biological tissues as the wire electrodes do. And so the biosensing can be done much more efficiently.”





Now that the researchers have shown that the optrode method works in vivo, they will shortly publish research that shows the optrode technology is bidirectional – that it can not only read neural signals, but can write them too.

100,What ‘Sneakers’ still gets right about engineering and cybersecurity 30 years later,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1311084163-1.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,30/10/2022,"Why 1992's 'Sneakers' still feels relevant in engineering and to the ways we evaluate threats, design networks and thwart attackers today.",https://venturebeat.com/security/what-sneakers-still-gets-right-about-engineering-and-cybersecurity-30-years-later/,"Join us on November 9 to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit. Register here.

When the movie Sneakers premiered in September 1992, the world was on the cusp of a massive shift. One that would move us from the analog era of landlines and field trips to the digital era of the internet and cryptography we all know today.

In case it has been a little bit since you last watched Sneakers, or if you’ve never seen it, the film follows Robert Redford’s Martin Bishop, a former hacker leading a team of “sneakers,” experts in hacking and social engineering (akin to the “red teams” we know today) who are paid to test the security of large organizations. On a seemingly routine job, Bishop and his team uncover a black box that can decode any encryption system and a plot being carried out by Bishop’s former hacking partner Cosmo that has grave consequences.

It’s easy for films focused on technology and cybersecurity to feel dated, especially with references to phone “phreakers” and jokes about primitive internet dating. But while revisiting Sneakers on the occasion of its recent 30th anniversary, I was struck by just how much it got right about the world of cybersecurity and technology, how much that still rings true today and feels quite prescient. There are the sophistication of the social engineering attacks being carried out, the fears about the potential of decryption performed by the black box that drives the film’s plot, and the prediction of a world controlled by data and information, for example. With that in mind, let’s dig a bit deeper into how the film converses with each of these topics.

Engineering trust

One of the standout elements of the film for me was the reliance on social engineering — entirely analog social engineering.

An early sequence shows how Bishop’s team carries out this social engineering to infiltrate a bank. Each member receives a specific assignment, which together result in remarkably successful attacks: surveilling unprepared security guards, gaming fire alarms to avoid detection, and impersonating someone from the alarm company to act as further cover. Similar social engineering happens later in the film where Bishop orchestrates a chaotic situation to trick a security guard into letting him into an office building, where he breaks into a target’s office. The finest example, of course, was the meticulously planned effort to steal Werner Brandes’ “voice passport.” Sophisticated social engineering requires significant preparatory and investigative work.

Seeing the social engineering on display here in Sneakers drives home for me just how prevalent social engineering is in our hyperconnected world, but how it’s now less visible because technology has replaced excursions. These tactics, about the ways people impersonate trusted figures or websites to try and steal your information in innocuous ways for unsavory means, are the sorts of things that are now part of any good security awareness training. But now, in addition to being aware of social engineering in the physical world, we’re just as focused on how we conduct ourselves in the digital world.

Decrypting the future

Beyond the displays of superhuman social engineering, I was also fascinated by how the black box that drives the film’s plot handles the idea of encryption and decryption.

When we see the black box in action in the film, the team is able to access a Federal Reserve transfer node, the emergency shutdown control for the New England power distribution grid, and the air traffic control system by connecting the box to decipher an encrypted screen. That’s not how systems, as we understand them today, actually work though. Normally there’s a login page that you have to go through and enter credentials.

But what’s worth noting, in a world where the internet has not gained popularity yet, is that it’s plausible to discover an encrypted terminal hooked up to a phone line through a modem. Decrypting the console could actually give you access without a user ID or password. It shows a different way of thinking about what being on a network means, in this case being able to find a modem and make sense of what the encrypted session might be.

To take that a step further, though: The black box also represents what is becoming a worrisome concern in cybersecurity. Janek’s little black box races through computations in seconds that would’ve taken the world’s most powerful supercomputer at the time (one of which stands in Cosmo’s office) millions of years to perform. While some of that may be a bit of movie magic, the black box works as a potent distillation of the monumental potential threat posed by future technologies that render today’s cryptography entirely useless.

A world ruled by zeroes and ones

And as we think about the future, I was also struck by a conversation near the end of the film between Bishop and the film’s antagonist Cosmo. Talking about the black box, Cosmo asks, “Don’t you know the places we could go with this?” To which Martin replies, “Yeah, I do. There’s nobody there.”

Martin still lives in the analog world, and perhaps had lost touch with his former view of the future. Cosmo, for all of his flaws, is clearly able to see the potential of this digital future, further noting, “Exactly. The world isn’t run by weapons anymore, or energy, or money. It’s run by little ones and zeroes, little bits of data. It’s all just electrons.”

This scene loomed large in my mind, in just how prescient Cosmo’s thinking was 30 years ago. He goes on to say, “There’s a war out there, old friend. And it’s not about who’s got the most bullets. It’s about who controls the information. What we see and hear, how we work, what we think.” This is exactly the way conversations about data and information have evolved over the past three decades. As traditional perimeters dissolve, finding ways to protect data anywhere and everywhere it goes has become a top priority for every organization. It’s made all the more chilling when you consider that this wisdom is coming from the film’s antagonist, whose motives are far less pure than finding a way to keep people safe in this burgeoning digital world.

In fact, Cosmo sees potential for the black box to “crash the whole damn system,” anticipating a world where connectivity is not only ubiquitous, but rife for abuse. The kind of attack on integrity and malicious modification of data that Cosmo suggests actually suggests some of the most modern forms of attack, and the most difficult to perform, even now — far from the kind of thing attackers in 1992 could have even dreamed of being able to execute.

Whether intentional or not, Sneakers’ impression of the digital future struck me as surprisingly forward-thinking, despite its analog interpretation. Revisiting it 30 years on, I am amazed by how much of this still feels relevant to the ways we evaluate threats, design networks and thwart attackers in the hyperconnected world of cybersecurity and technology we inhabit today.

But Russia has struggled to develop the jet and put it into production.

Russian officials now say that an upgraded Su-57 made its debut flight this month.

Since it was officially unveiled more than a decade ago, Moscow has touted the capabilities of its fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter as exceeding those of even the United States Air Force's Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.

However, Russia has struggled with the development of the Su-57 (NATO reporting name ""Felon"") in recent years, and just 10 test prototypes and six serially produced aircraft have been produced — of which two have been lost in crashes during test flights.

Despite those setbacks, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), a subsidiary of the state-owned tech conglomerate Rostec, has continued the fighter's development — and this week announced that an upgraded Su-57 made its debut flight earlier this month.

""The Sukhoi Design Bureau within the UAC carries out work for further developing the Su-57,"" the UAC press office said via a statement to Tass. ""On October 21, the upgraded Su-57 fifth-generation plane performed its debut flight at the Gromov Flight Testing Institute's airfield. The aircraft was flown by the Sukhoi Design Bureau test pilot, Hero of Russia Sergey Bogdan. The flight lasted 56 minutes and ran without any snags.""

According to the reports, the improved Su-57M fighter jet was testing onboard equipment with extended functionality, as well as the crew's AI support, along with a broad range of new types of weapons.

""The aircraft also offers a possibility to install a second-stage engine,"" the statement added. The codename for this initiative is believed to be ""Megapolis,"" while the current Su-57 research and development were dubbed ""Stolitsa"" (""capital"").

There have been reports that the most significant aspect of this upgrade is the installation of new ""izdeliye 30"" engines, which can provide a thrust of around 16 tonnes in place of the current AL-41F-1 (izdeliye 117) engines that can provide a thrust of 14.5 tonnes.

An AI copilot?

One of the notable features of the Su-57 is the artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which could act as a virtual co-pilot, gather data from the aircraft's numerous sensors, and provide crucial information to the human operator.

AI has been seen as a crucial component of the future ""sixth-generation"" fighters, where onboard computer clusters that are composed of high-performance ruggedized processors could transform these aircraft into data centers in the sky.

This could help ensure faster decision-making for the pilots.

""AI is already an integral part of modern fighter jets,"" said technology industry analyst Roger Entner of Recon Analytics.

""To be more maneuverable, modern jets are inherently unstable in flight,"" Entner told 19FortyFive. ""The only way they fly straight is through AI. Next-generation AI will take their active role even further to improve survivability and mission capabilities.""

Of course, the issue is how Russia — which is struggling to keep its current military hardware equipped with the latest microprocessors — will be able to mass produce such aircraft.

There have already been reports that the Kremlin has had to resort to taking chips from consumer appliances to use in its tanks and other vehicles. It may thus take a highly advanced AI to help Moscow figure out how to solve this problem.

103,2 Cybersecurity Stocks That Could Help Set You Up for Life,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706483/man-woman-celebrating-with-cash-in-a-car.jpg,30/10/2022,These companies are growing at an eye-popping pace that they could sustain for a long time to come.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/2-cybersecurity-stocks-that-could-help-set-you-up/,"The stock market sell-off of 2022 hasn't spared cybersecurity stocks, as companies operating in this industry have seen their share prices drop despite impressive growth in their businesses. But the sell-off has created an opportunity for savvy investors to buy some fast-growing companies at relatively attractive valuations.

After all, the cybersecurity market is set for impressive growth in the long haul as individuals and organizations are expected to ramp up their spending on bolstering their defenses to ward off the growing threat from bad actors. According to Gartner, cybersecurity spending in 2022 could hit $172 billion. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2035, annual cybersecurity spending could top $1 trillion.

So, investors can set their portfolios up for long-term gains by investing in top cybersecurity stocks that could take advantage of the massive end-market opportunity on offer. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD -9.87%) and Fortinet (FTNT 2.55%) are two such cybersecurity stocks that investors can consider buying right now, following their 20% slides on the market so far this year. Let's look at the reasons why these two companies can win big from the cybersecurity market's growth.

1. CrowdStrike Holdings

CrowdStrike Holdings operates in a fast-growing niche of the cybersecurity market as it provides a cloud-native platform to protect endpoints, identities, data, and cloud workloads. This puts CrowdStrike in a solid position to sustain its rapid top- and bottom-line growth in the long run. That's because Gartner estimates that by 2025, 95% of new digital workloads will be deployed on cloud-native platforms.

For comparison, only 30% of digital workloads were deployed on cloud-native platforms in 2021. This indicates that the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity solutions will head higher. Not surprisingly, CrowdStrike expects massive growth in its total addressable market (TAM) opportunity. The company had a TAM worth $25 billion at the time of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019. That figure is expected to go up to $75 billion next year and $97 billion in 2025 based on CrowdStrike's current offerings.

It is worth noting that CrowdStrike sees its addressable opportunity balloon to $158 billion in 2026 after accounting for its planned future product roadmap and the secular growth of the cybersecurity market. So, it won't be surprising to see the company sustain the impressive growth it has been clocking. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (for the three months ending July 31, 2022), CrowdStrike's revenue was up 58% year over year to $535 million.

The company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) also jumped an impressive 59% over the prior-year period to $2.14 billion. The ARR represents the annualized value of customer contracts at the end of a period, so the sharp spike in this metric suggests that CrowdStrike has a robust revenue pipeline.

The size of CrowdStrike's TAM, its rapid growth, and the company's ability to cross-sell multiple cybersecurity modules to its subscription customers tell us why analysts are upbeat about its long-term prospects. More specifically, analysts expect nearly 74% annual earnings growth from CrowdStrike for the next five years. The discussion above indicates that it could keep growing at elevated levels beyond that period as well.

So, CrowdStrike looks like a solid bet for growth-oriented investors following its slide in 2022 as it is trading at 20 times sales as compared to its 2021 price-to-sales ratio of 36. There is no doubt that the stock is expensive even after its pullback, but it can justify the rich valuation by sustaining its terrific growth in the future.

2. Fortinet

Fortinet is another fast-growing cybersecurity company that took a beating this year amid the stock market sell-off, losing 23% of its value. Still, it trades at an expensive 68 times trailing earnings. But the forward earnings multiple of 43 suggests that the company's bottom line is on track to jump sharply in the future. It is also worth noting that Fortinet stock is relatively cheap right now as compared to its five-year average earnings multiple of 90.

So, investors on the hunt for a growth stock may want to take advantage of Fortinet's relatively cheap valuation and buy it for a few simple reasons.

First, the company is benefiting from the cybersecurity market, as its impressive growth indicates. In the second quarter of 2022, Fortinet's total revenue spiked 29% year over year to $1.03 billion. Bookings, which refer to the total orders received by Fortinet during the quarter, grew at a faster pace of 42% over the prior year to $1.38 billion. This also explains why Fortinet's deferred revenue was up 35% year over year to $2.91 billion at the end of the second quarter.

The faster growth in Fortinet's billings and deferred revenue -- which is the money collected in advance for services to be rendered later -- suggests that the company is sitting on a solid revenue pipeline. Not surprisingly, Fortinet's top-line growth is expected to remain healthy in the next couple of fiscal years.

But more importantly, Fortinet can sustain its impressive growth for a long time as it is a key player in lucrative cybersecurity niches. For instance, the cybersecurity specialist controlled nearly 38% of the firewall market in 2021, leading peers such as Cisco, Check Point Software, and Palo Alto Networks by a massive margin. Fortinet's share of the cybersecurity firewall market grew steadily over the years from less than 10% in 2009.

As a result, Fortinet is now in a tremendous position to capitalize on the growth of the security firewall market, which could be worth almost $20 billion in 2032 as compared to this year's estimated $4.9 billion. But there is more to Fortinet than just security firewalls. The company sees $199 billion in TAM by 2026 as compared to this year's estimate of $138 billion, driven by growth in multiple cybersecurity applications such as zero trust security, cloud security, and security operations.

As Fortinet's end market expands and its revenue increases, the company's bottom-line performance should also pick up the pace. Analysts anticipate 23% annual earnings growth from the company for the next five years. Fortinet could maintain such impressive growth beyond the next five years on account of the substantial opportunity it is sitting on, thereby setting investors' portfolios up for success in the long run.",cybersecurity,motley fool
104,BUG: Invest In Cybersecurity With This Concentrated ETF,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1366728672/image_1366728672.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,30/10/2022,"Cybersecurity, our favorite growth theme for medium-to-long-term investment horizon. Learn why we recommend BUG ETF to gain exposure to cybersecurity industry.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550873-bug-invest-cybersecurity-concentrated-etf,"TU IS

Cybersecurity is one of our favourite growth themes for a medium-to-long-term investment horizon. Not only has growth in this sector been particularly resilient to the current economic slowdown, but valuations have also become attractive relative to long-term growth prospects. For investors looking for a cost-effective and convenient way to build portfolio exposure to this theme, we think that the Global X Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:BUG) could be a great choice.

Growth Prospects Not Fully Appreciated By Investors

Despite the increase in frequency and cost of data security breaches across government agencies and corporate enterprises in recent years, there is still significant underinvestment in cybersecurity.

So far in 2022, there have already been multiple major cyber attack incidents that have cost U.S enterprises millions in damages. According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report 2022, the average cost of a data breach in the U.S is around US$9.4 million, which is more than twice the global average of US$4.4 million. The T-Mobile (TMUS) data breach in 2021, which affected around 80 million U.S residents, ended up costing the company US$350 million to settle a class action lawsuit. In an SEC filing following the settlement, T-Mobile stated that it would spend US$150 million this year and in 2023 on cybersecurity.

For many years, cyberattacks appear to be specifically targeting large corporations and government agencies due to the massive volumes of personal data held by these entities. However, as these entities beef up their cybersecurity, future attacks will become increasingly more difficult and risky for hackers. Small and medium enterprises with tiny cybersecurity budgets and thus weaker defenses, could increasingly become the next target of choice.

From our perspective, there is enormous scope for growth in cybersecurity spending due to persistent underinvestment over the years. This is in stark contrast to the breathtaking boom in cloud computing and blockchain technologies. Cybersecurity spending has only recently begun to emerge more prominently on the IT budgets of large companies that have come to appreciate the risks and cost of cyberattacks the hard way. As the modern world becomes increasingly more digitalized, interconnected, and data-dependent, we expect cybersecurity spending growth to accelerate.

Cybersecurity Will Be Multi-Layered And Constantly Evolving

The ever-increasing sophistication of information technology that is being applied in more areas of government services and businesses, means that there will be a greater number and variety of connections that could become vulnerable to cyberattacks. The sheer sophistication and scope of detecting and defending against all types of cyberattacks mean that cybersecurity will be multi-layered in nature, requiring uniquely different solutions for different parts of an IT infrastructure. Furthermore, as new technologies are added to existing infrastructure, cybersecurity solutions will need to constantly evolve to meet new challenges and requirements.

This multi-layered nature of cybersecurity could present a difficult problem for investors: there is unlikely to be a single cybersecurity company, not even a handful, that will end up dominating the industry. Just like how diverse the software industry has become, the same is likely to happen to cybersecurity. Therefore, the odds are stacked against the stock picker who is looking for that one big winner. Instead, we think that the optimal way to execute this bullish view on the cybersecurity theme is to invest in a concentrated basket of leading companies that are dominating in their respective areas of cybersecurity.

Global X Cybersecurity ETF

According to fund information provided by Global X, BUG seeks to invest in companies that stand to potentially benefit from the increased adoption of cybersecurity technology, such as those whose principal business is in the development and management of security protocols preventing intrusion and attacks to systems, networks, applications, computers, and mobile devices. The fund seeks to provide returns that correspond generally to the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Indxx Cybersecurity Index.

BUG is one of the most concentrated among liquid cybersecurity ETFs with more than US$50 million in assets under management, including First Trust Nasdaq CEA Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR), iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (IHAK), and ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK).

BUG is heavily concentrated on large cybersecurity software companies with a portfolio of just 24 holdings with net assets of US$1.11 billion. As of 27 October, BUG's top 5 largest holdings make up close to 39% of the portfolio: Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD), and CyberArk Software (CYBR).

Global X

We like BUG's concentration on cybersecurity software companies (57.5%) which enjoy several advantages over other categories of cybersecurity companies. Software solutions can be deployed more rapidly and are more scalable than hardware-supported solutions. More importantly, software companies offer a differentiated solution that is less likely to face direct competition.

Global X

Valuations And Expense Ratio

BUG's portfolio valuation at 54x P/E and 9.2x P/B may seem extremely expensive, but we note that this could be misleading for investors. It is extremely challenging to value growth companies that are in the very early stages of a multi-decade boom. Not only do some of BUG's holdings have very little earnings or even suffer losses due to the need to invest heavily in R&D, but many are also spending heavily on sales and marketing to expand market share. Thus, revenues at some of these companies could be growing at rates above 20%-30% annually with little earnings to show.

To be sure, investing in cybersecurity is certainly going to be more risky compared to investing in a mature industry. We acknowledge this risk and recommend that investors consider their own risk appetite and investment objectives in deciding if the cybersecurity theme is a suitable investment for their portfolio.

BUG's expense ratio is moderately high at 0.5%, but this is generally in line with its peers.

Seeking Alpha

Trading metrics for BUG are healthy with low and stable spreads, healthy volumes, and the fund trading close to NAV.

In Conclusion

We like BUG's concentration on cybersecurity software companies and we see enormous scope for growth in cybersecurity spending due to persistent underinvestment over the years.

On the surface, BUG appears to be grossly overvalued based on regular measures comparing share price to earnings and book value. However, relative to the sector's long-term growth prospects, we view the risk-reward as attractive.

The British government insisted Sunday it has robust cybersecurity for government officials, after a newspaper reported that former Prime Minister Liz Truss’ phone was hacked while she was U.K. foreign minister.

The Mail on Sunday said that the hack was discovered when Truss was running to become Conservative Party leader and prime minister in the summer. It said the security breach was kept secret by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the head of the civil service.

The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said Russian spies were suspected of the hack. It said the hackers gained access to sensitive information, including discussions about the Ukraine war with foreign officials, as well as private conversations between Truss and a political ally, former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng.

The U.K. government spokesperson declined to comment on security arrangements, but said it had “robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats,” including regular security briefings for ministers.

Opposition parties demanded an independent investigation into the hack, and into the leak of the information to a newspaper.

“Was Liz Truss’s phone hacked by Russia, was there a news blackout and if so why?” said Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran. “If it turns out this information was withheld from the public to protect Liz Truss’ leadership bid, that would be unforgivable.”

Labour Party law-and-order spokesperson Yvette Cooper said “the story raises issues around cybersecurity.”

“It’s why cybersecurity has to be taken so seriously by everyone across government, the role of hostile states,” she told Sky News. “But also the allegations about whether a Cabinet minister has been using a personal phone for serious government business, and serious questions about why this information or this story has been leaked or briefed right now.”",cybersecurity,independent

The federal shield law, known as Section 230, is facing a showdown after the Supreme Court agreed this month to hear a lawsuit against Google. In that lawsuit, the Wall St. Journal reported, the plaintiffs claim Section 230 shouldn’t protect platforms that steer people to harmful content, such as terrorist videos.

Lifting that protection could usher in a new era of strict content moderation.

Beyond the Supreme Court case, Texas and Florida state laws targeting alleged online censorship by Big Tech platforms also are under separate legal challenges that could rise to the Supreme Court.

The Big Tech industry argues that a platform’s First Amendment rights would be violated if they were forced to tighten regulations by being defined as “common carriers.”

If the protections afforded by Section 230 are weakened, the tech companies that use algorithms to push content to readers could be severely hampered. Opponents argue that the tech firms have too much power to control what people see and read.

“This is going to be the most important [Supreme Court] term ever for the internet,” said Alan Rozenshtein, a former Justice Department cybersecurity official who is now a University of Minnesota law professor, said to the WSJ. “It’s not even close.”",cybersecurity,deadline

MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also known as CISA. That's the Homeland Security agency tasked with securing America's cybersecurity infrastructure and coordinating with states on election security, and you're gonna be very busy. I'm glad you're here with us today.

JEN EASTERLY, DIRECTOR OF THE CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY: Great to be here.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this bulletin first off. It warns domestic violent extremists may view election-related infrastructure personnel and voters as attractive targets. Are you aware of immediate and credible threats?

EASTERLY: No. Let me be very clear at the top. We have no information about specific or credible threats to disrupt or compromise election infrastructure. I want that to be very clear. We are putting out information, like the warnings that you mentioned, to make sure that state and local election officials have the information that they need to protect their voting systems and their election infrastructure. That said, Margaret, it is a very complex threat environment. You have cyber threats, you have insider threats, you have rampant disinformation. And yes, very worryingly, you have threats of harassment, intimidation and violence against election officials, polling places and voters. Let's be really clear. That has to stop. It is unacceptable behavior, it's undemocratic. And we all need to work together to ensure that this is a safe and secure election.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And it is the states that administer the election. You are providing support to them. What is the election day plan for security, and then communication? What are we going to hear and see?

EASTERLY: So, on election day actually, we at CISA are going to be in our own operation center. We're going to have federal government partners, private sector partners there, and then we're going to be in direct communication with all of the state and local election officials whose job it is to run and administer elections. We're going to be working to share information, and we're going to be working to be able to respond to anything that happens. But remember, at the end of the day, the relationship between local officials and local law enforcement is incredibly important. And I was really encouraged by the opinion piece that came out yesterday with the sheriff in Massachusetts, one in Colorado, talking about the fact that ensuring election security is a nonpartisan issue, and threats to election officials have to stop. So, that connectivity at the local level, the information sharing, the planning and exercising that's happening is really important to ensuring security at the- at the polling place and at the ballot box.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We talk a lot about rhetoric and the risk of triggering violence. And social media is a place where false information often spreads. So, I want to ask you about what's happening now at Twitter. It's now privately owned by billionaire Elon Musk. This morning, he tweeted a conspiracy theory about Nancy Pelosi's husband. Given how charged our environment is, are you concerned about how this platform might change and that it's going to make your job more difficult?

EASTERLY: Well, first of all, horrific attack on Mr. Pelosi, and thoughts and prayers go to their family. That is a decision that social media companies that Twitter will make. They make their own decisions based on terms of service. I am laser focused–

(CROSSTALK)

MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the owner himself tweeting this out.

EASTERLY: I am laser focused on the next nine days and the time that comes after elections on doing everything we can to ensure security. I do want to be very clear on this, though, Margaret. These elections, election officials, these are not faceless backroom bureaucrats, right? These are our relatives, our friends, our neighbors. They're in our community. They are dedicated public servants that are working day in and day out to ensure the security of elections, and they deserve not just our support, but our admiration and respect, and they deserve to be safe. And we all need to be responsible about ensuring that's a safe and secure environment.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why I'm asking you about the place where these conspiracy theories spread. The FBI report, when we looked at it in terms of those direct threats to election workers, highlighted Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin as places where voter intimidation and threats to election workers have been seen. Are these areas of greatest concern for you?

EASTERLY: Concerned across the board. We have cyber threats from nation states and cyber criminals. You have insider threats. You have physical threats, as we talked about, and then you have disinformation. So, disinformation, foreign influence that can be used to sow discord, that can undermine confidence in election integrity and that can be used to incite violence. So, what are we doing? We're doing a couple things. First of all, we're putting out information about tactics and disinformation and how to build resilience against disinformation. We have a rumor versus reality site that's basically election literacy. But most importantly, we are amplifying the voices of local and state election officials. They are the trusted voices that understand how elections work. If anybody has questions about voting or what -- how it all works, you should go to their local- local election officials.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's who they should be following on Twitter and social media–

EASTERLY: –those are the experts.

MARGARET BRENNAN: –Find out who your local election official is and follow their account?

EASTERLY: Exactly. Exactly. And you know, I should point out, the National Association of Secretaries of State, nass.org. TrustedInfo2022, a great source for information, as well as the National Association of Election Directors, nased.org, frequently asked questions, that's the best- best place to go. They know how elections happen. If you've seen one state in an election, you've seen one state. It's actually surprisingly technical and complicated, and that's why I welcome people asking questions, you know. The beauty of democracy is that it's participatory. We can all have a role. So, volunteer, be a poll worker, ask questions. The more transparency, the better.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about the foreign threat and 2016 Russia probed voter registration logs. We know there are warnings about what China is doing right now. How effective has this campaign by Beijing been, and are there other state actors or non-state actors you're concerned about?

EASTERLY: Yeah, we've seen Russia, we've seen Iran, we've seen China use the playbook for influence operations. That's why it's so important that Americans realize that they need to build resilience against that. If you see information that's on the internet, you're not sure whet- whether it's true, be critical about it, ask questions, look at the source, investigate it and don't spread that information any more broadly and give- basically give foreign adversaries a chance to manipulate Americans and to sow discord and to create lack of confidence in our elections. But, I want to be very, very clear. I have confidence in the elections that are going to be run because of the massive amount of work that's been done across the federal government, state and local election officials with election vendors to put multiple, multiple layers of resilience and security controls in place. I am confident that elections will be safe and secure, and the American people should have confidence in the integrity of elections when they go to the ballot box when they cast their vote.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Good luck to you. It will be a busy next few days and weeks.",cybersecurity,cbs news

The effort i…,https://singularityhub.com/2022/10/30/ethical-ai-team-believes-bias-bounties-can-more-quickly-expose-algorithmic-flaws/,"Bias in AI systems is proving to be a major stumbling block in efforts to more broadly integrate the technology into our society. A new initiative that will reward researchers for finding any prejudices in AI systems could help solve the problem.

The effort is modeled on the bug bounties that software companies pay to cybersecurity experts who alert them of any potential security flaws in their products. The idea isn’t a new one; “bias bounties” were first proposed by AI researcher and entrepreneur JB Rubinovitz back in 2018, and various organizations have already run such challenges.

But the new effort seeks to create an ongoing forum for bias bounty competitions that is independent from any particular organization. Made up of volunteers from a range of companies including Twitter, the so-called “Bias Buccaneers” plan to hold regular competitions, or “mutinies,” and earlier this month launched the first such challenge.

“Bug bounties are a standard practice in cybersecurity that has yet to find footing in the algorithmic bias community,” the organizers say on their website. “While initial one-off events demonstrated enthusiasm for bounties, Bias Buccaneers is the first nonprofit intended to create ongoing Mutinies, collaborate with technology companies, and pave the way for transparent and reproducible evaluations of AI systems.”

This first competition is aimed at tackling bias in image detection algorithms, but rather than getting people to target specific AI systems, the competition will challenge researchers to build tools that can detect biased datasets. The idea is to create a machine learning model that can accurately label each image in a dataset with its skin tone, perceived gender, and age group. The competition ends on November 30 and has a first prize of $6,000, second prize of $4,000, and third prize of $2,000.

The challenge is premised on the fact that often the source of algorithmic bias is not so much the algorithm itself, but the nature of the data it is trained on. Automated tools that can quickly assess how balanced a collection of images is in relation to attributes that are often sources of discrimination could help AI researchers avoid clearly biased data sources.

But the organizers say this is just the first step in an effort to build up a toolkit for assessing bias in datasets, algorithms, and applications, and ultimately create standards for how to deal with algorithmic bias, fairness, and explainability.

It’s not the only such effort. One of the leaders of the new initiative is Twitter’s Rumman Chowdhury, who helped organize the first AI bias bounty competition last year, targeting an algorithm the platform used for cropping pictures that users complained favored white-skinned and male faces over black and female ones.

The competition gave hackers access to the company’s model and challenged them to find flaws in it. Entrants found a wide range of problems, including a preference for stereotypically beautiful faces, an aversion to people with white hair (a marker of age), and a preference for memes with English rather than Arabic script.

Stanford University has also recently concluded a competition that challenged teams to come up with tools designed to help people audit commercially-deployed or open-source AI systems for discrimination. And current and upcoming EU laws could make it mandatory for companies to regularly audit their data and algorithms.

But taking AI bug bounties and algorithmic auditing mainstream and making them effective will be easier said than done. Inevitably, companies that build their businesses on their algorithms are going to resist any efforts to discredit them.

Building on lessons from audit systems in other domains, such as finance and environmental and health regulations, researchers recently outlined some of the crucial ingredients for effective accountability. One of the most important criteria they identified was the meaningful involvement of independent third parties.

The researchers pointed out that current voluntary AI audits often involve conflicts of interest, such as the target organization paying for the audit, helping frame the scope of the audit, or having the opportunity to review findings before they are publicized. This concern was mirrored in a recent report from the Algorithmic Justice League, which noted the outsized role of target organizations in current cybersecurity bug bounty programs.

Finding a way to fund and support truly independent AI auditors and bug hunters will be a significant challenge, particularly as they will be going up against some of the most well-resourced companies in the world. Fortunately though, there seems to be a growing sense within the industry that tackling this problem will be critical for maintaining users’ trust in their services.

If there's one profession that continues to dominate demand in tech hiring, it's cybersecurity.

Demand for cybersecurity staff has skyrocketed since 'remote work' entered the lexicon and businesses doubled down on their digital assets as a means of insuring them against future uncertainty.

While the post-pandemic tech boom has been a blessing for tech-savvy professionals with a knack for anything software related, it has also left companies more exposed than ever to the dangers lurking in cyber space.

As the threats from ransomware, malware and intellectual property theft become all too real for businesses, hiring managers have turned to cybersecurity professionals to keep them safe. The problem is, there are nowhere near enough of them to go around – and many in the cybersecurity biz are beginning to drop out due to stress and burnout.

A number of factors underpin the shortfall of skilled tech talent in the workforce, a big one being the fact that technology now evolves at such an alarming rate it's hard to know what skills will still be applicable in the medium to long term (although coding is generally a safe bet).

But decisions in the C-suite are also stifling businesses' efforts to adequately defend themselves from cyber threats. While leaders absolutely want cybersecurity expertise on their teams, they're not necessarily willing to pay for it. Or, to put it more accurately, they're not willing to pay enough.

Take a recent report by O'Reilly, which found that only a third of HR decision makers in UK tech companies are willing to spend more than £10,000 ($11,600) on cybersecurity-related recruitment, learning and development over the next 12 months. When you consider that over half of cyber attacks cost businesses upwards of $100,000, it's staggering that employers are unwilling to invest one-tenth of this sum to stop such attacks from happening.

Budgets are always contentious in businesses, and it's difficult to convince company leadership to invest in something they can't see for something that might not happen (even if it probably will) -- particularly when many IT leaders still don't have a say in company decision-making – even if it relates to tech.

But £10,000 doesn't seem like a lot when you consider how much money employers have wrapped up in huge offices and flashy corporate hubs that are only being used once or twice a week. One way companies can find room in the budget for tech training is by figuring out how much office space they really need and downsizing accordingly.

But money, while a key factor, is just part of a multifaceted cybersecurity skills problem. Many businesses still don't have the right mindset to effectively navigate an increasingly complex work environment – and that's usually a result of leadership.

Much like their employees, business leaders were thrown into remote working in 2020 with little planning or preparation. While they were busy sending out laptops, setting up VPNs and trying to keep tabs on suddenly invisible workers, few were considering what such a massive upheaval in workplace and IT practices meant for cybersecurity in the long-term.

Many leaders still haven't addressed this, and are instead exercising a 'set it and forget it' attitude to cloud apps and security software that's not delivering a holistic approach to risk management.

The scale of this problem was highlighted in an October report from cybersecurity firm Savanti. In a survey of 800 global board directors, 83% identified cybersecurity as a top priority, but fewer than half had taken any dedicated action – even if this simply meant requesting IT security updates, or auditing their company's cyber-readiness.

The report also found that Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are being hired, managed and evaluated as technical experts rather than business leaders. So when to comes to big strategic decisions, there is nobody in the room to explain how they might impact IT or cybersecurity.

Little wonder that so many IT leaders are fed up with not being listened to, which perhaps explains why – according to Savanti – that the average tenure of a CISO is just 2.3 years.

The good news is that companies are, for the most part, starting to realize they can no longer sleep on cybersecurity issues. If they haven't already been a victim of an attack or attempted attack themselves, they almost certainly know of a company that has – and a company that was likely better prepared than they were.

The intense media focus on cybersecurity has offered another incentive for businesses to stay out of the spotlight: falling prey to a cyber attack is a bad look, and the financial, operational and human implications could be catastrophic at a time when companies are trying to cope with an economic downturn.

Looking ahead to 2023, businesses need to balance costs with the growing need for tech skills. But if leaders are serious about building resilience and holding fast in a year of uncertainty, cybersecurity cannot be relegated to an afterthought.

If true, the shocking revelation could have exposed the U.K’s secrets in the middle of the continent’s deadliest conflict in decades.

The Mail on Sunday’s report claimed the hack was discovered over the summer as Truss campaigned to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister, with Johnson ordering the hack be kept secret. Some of the information gathered includes conversations surrounding the war in Ukraine and discussions between Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, the country’s eventual Chancellor.

The claim has led U.K. politicians to pile on, wondering whether both whether there was adequate security, and whether Johnson wanted to boost his foreign secretary’s bid to succeed him.

“Was Liz Truss’s phone hacked by Russia, was there a news blackout and if so why?” asked Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran, according to the Associated Press. “If it turns out this information was withheld from the public to protect Liz Truss’ leadership bid, that would be unforgivable.”

A Labour Party spokesperson also questioned the country’s security defenses. “It’s why cybersecurity has to be taken so seriously by everyone across government, the role of hostile states,” Yvette Cooper told Sky News. “But also the allegations about whether a Cabinet minister has been using a personal phone for serious government business, and serious questions about why this information or this story has been leaked or briefed right now.”

116,Better Cloud Computing Stock: IBM vs. Alphabet,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/705302/cloud_computing_data_center-gettyimages-1336250753.jpg,30/10/2022,"These two tech titans are experiencing strong growth in the cloud computing market, but one holds the edge as the better investment.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/better-cloud-computing-stock-ibm-vs-alphabet/,"While tech stocks were hammered in 2022, the cloud computing industry barreled along at an impressive growth rate. According to research firm Gartner, the public cloud sector alone is estimated to grow 20% this year.

This amounts to nearly half a trillion dollars in 2022. Just a decade ago, global public cloud computing revenue was a mere $26.4 billion.

Given the cloud industry's rapid expansion, competitors abound. Among the bigger players are tech giants IBM (IBM 1.85%) and Google Cloud, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL 3.78%) (GOOG 3.85%).

Both are seeing strong growth in their respective cloud businesses. But if you had to choose between the two, which company offers the better investment opportunity? Let's dig into each to arrive at an answer.

IBM's cloud strategy

IBM spent the past few years reinventing itself into a hybrid cloud-focused company. In a hybrid cloud implementation, a business employs both public and private clouds, using the former to perform basic IT infrastructure tasks, such as hosting a corporate website, and the latter to secure confidential or critical data, including financial and customer records.

IBM was smart to focus on this area. The hybrid cloud market is forecasted to grow from $85.3 billion last year to $262.4 billion by 2027.

In addition, IBM's impressive list of enterprise clients is an ideal fit for hybrid cloud solutions. Big Blue's customers include the top ten banks, governments, and healthcare companies in the world. These industries need the security of a private cloud while capturing the cost savings of a public one.

IBM's hybrid cloud strategy proved successful. In its third-quarter earnings report, IBM generated revenue of $14.1 billion, a 6% increase over 2021. This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth despite macroeconomic headwinds, such as a strong U.S. dollar.

Big Blue also offers an attractive dividend, yielding about 4.8% at the time of this writing. The company can maintain this robust dividend thanks to its free cash flow (FCF). IBM expects to hit $10 billion in FCF this year, while dividend payments totaled about $6 billion over the trailing 12 months.

IBM has a strong dividend track record, paying consecutive quarterly dividends since 1916. It also raised its dividend in April, marking 27 consecutive years of dividend increases.

Alphabet's Google Cloud approach

Alphabet is building its Google Cloud business in the same way it generated success for its famed Google search engine: by prioritizing customer acquisition and revenue growth over profitability.

That's why Google Cloud is currently unprofitable, exiting the third quarter with an operating loss of $699 million. But its business is growing rapidly. In just three quarters this year, Google Cloud's sales nearly matched all of 2021's income, continuing a multi-year streak of rising revenue.

Time Period Google Cloud Revenue YOY Growth Q1 through Q3, 2022 $19 billion 39% 2021 $19.2 billion 47% 2020 $13.1 billion 46% 2019 $8.9 billion 53%

Google Cloud comprised only about 10% of Alphabet's Q3 revenue, but it's already ranked the third-biggest cloud computing company behind industry leaders Amazon and Microsoft. And Alphabet continues to aggressively invest in Google Cloud despite closing down other bets such as its Stadia video games division.

For instance, Alphabet acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant in September for $5.4 billion, marking one of the company's biggest acquisitions in its history. Mandiant will boost Google Cloud's security in a world where remote workers grew from 23% of the American workforce before the coronavirus pandemic to nearly 60% in 2022.

Is IBM or Alphabet the better investment?

Both IBM and Alphabet have proven successful in their cloud endeavors, so investing in either is worthwhile. After all, the cloud computing industry is forecasted to grow from $706.6 billion last year to $1.3 trillion by 2025.

But if I had to choose one of these cloud computing companies to invest in, I would lean toward Alphabet despite IBM's success and attractive dividend.

Google Cloud's revenue is already edging past Big Blue. IBM's hybrid cloud revenue over the past 12 months totaled $22.2 billion. Google Cloud's revenue was $24.5 billion over the same time period.

Granted, Google Cloud's success can be overshadowed by Alphabet's digital advertising business, which accounted for $54.5 billion of its $69.1 billion in Q3 revenue. And the advertising industry is experiencing a downturn this year, leading Alphabet's Q3 ad revenue to increase just 2.5% year-over-year.

But Alphabet's ad business helps fund Google Cloud. Alphabet generated $63 billion in FCF over the past 12 months, while IBM expects to achieve a cumulative FCF total of $35 billion across three years, from 2022 to 2024.

Also, Alphabet possesses several factors, along with Google Cloud, that make the company an alluring investment, including its dominance in search advertising. Alphabet increased revenue 41% year-over-year in 2021, and its revenue continues to grow this year, reaching $206.8 billion over three quarters compared to $182.3 billion last year.

Google Cloud's strong growth, Alphabet's hefty FCF, and the company's other areas of strength provide compelling reasons to make Alphabet the better choice for an investment in the rapidly rising cloud computing industry.",cybersecurity,motley fool

The British government insisted Sunday it has robust cybersecurity for government officials, after a newspaper reported that former Prime Minister Liz Truss’ phone was hacked while she was UK foreign minister.

The Mail on Sunday said that the hack was discovered when Truss was running to become Conservative Party leader and prime minister in the summer. It said the security breach was kept secret by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the head of the civil service.

The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said Russian spies were suspected of the hack. It said the hackers gained access to sensitive information, including discussions about the Ukraine war with foreign officials, as well as private conversations between Truss and a political ally, former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng.

The UK government spokesperson declined to comment on security arrangements, but said it had “robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats,” including regular security briefings for ministers.

Opposition parties demanded an independent investigation into the hack, and into the leak of the information to a newspaper.

“Was Liz Truss’s phone hacked by Russia, was there a news blackout and if so why?” said Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran. “If it turns out this information was withheld from the public to protect Liz Truss’ leadership bid, that would be unforgivable.”

Labour Party law-and-order spokesperson Yvette Cooper said “the story raises issues around cybersecurity.”

“It’s why cybersecurity has to be taken so seriously by everyone across government, the role of hostile states,” she told Sky News. “But also the allegations about whether a cabinet minister has been using a personal phone for serious government business, and serious questions about why this information or this story has been leaked or briefed right now.”

It can be downright perplexing to see individual stocks and sectors go from in favor to out of favor on a whim. But steep sell-offs and volatility can present impeccable buying opportunities for patient investors.

As a recent example, note that in 2020 the three worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500 were energy, real estate, and financials. The reverse was true the following year, as energy, real estate, and financials were, in order, the three best-performing sectors of 2021. While investors shouldn't expect these kinds of rapid reversals over the short term, it's worth noting that sharp price movements aren't always grounded in fundamentals and can have nothing to do with a core investment thesis.

Bear markets have historically presented impeccable buying opportunities -- but only for companies that have what it takes to overcome obstacles and grow over the long term. Here's why Microsoft (MSFT 3.33%), Ford Motor Company (F 1.88%), The Trade Desk (TTD -5.94%), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -0.80%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 1.82%) stand out as five compelling buys now.

Indispensable software products and cloud services

Trevor Jennewine (Microsoft): Microsoft saw its share price tumble more than 7% following its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2022). Revenue rose 11% to $50.1 billion, a big deceleration from 22% growth last year, and earnings fell 13% to $2.35 per diluted share. Worse yet, guidance came in short of Wall Street's expectations, as CFO Amy Hood said weak PC demand would persist into the second quarter, negatively impacting revenue from Windows and Surface devices. Hood also said ad spend on LinkedIn and Bing Search would likely suffer too.

However, things aren't as bad as they seem. Revenue actually climbed 16% when unfavorable foreign exchange rates are stripped out, and earnings climbed 11% when adjusted for a one-time tax benefit last year. Additionally, temporary economic headwinds may put pressure on Microsoft in the near term, but they leave the long-term investment thesis unchanged. That means short-sighted shareholders who sold the stock have created a buying opportunity for patient investors.

The bull case for Microsoft is straightforward. The company offers a range of mission-critical software and cloud services, and it has achieved a strong presence in several end markets. Most notably, Microsoft 365 brings together industry-leading tools like Office 365 for productivity, Power BI for business analytics, and Teams for communication and collaboration.

Microsoft is also a strong contender in several cybersecurity verticals -- access management, endpoint protection, security information, and event management -- and its security customer count jumped 33% to 860,000 in the most recent quarter. That puts Microsoft in front of a large growth opportunity, as the cybersecurity software market is expected to increase at 12% per year through the end of the decade, reaching $500 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.

Finally, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud services provider. It trails Amazon Web Services by a wide margin, but it has twice as much market share as the third-place contender, Alphabet's Google Cloud. That bodes well for the future. Grand View Research estimates that cloud computing spend will grow at about 16% annually to approach $1.6 trillion by 2030.

Currently, Microsoft's share price sits 32% off its high, marking its greatest drop in the last decade. That's why this stock is worth buying in November.

This long-term growth story is intact

Neha Chamaria (Ford): With Ford shares losing more than one-third of their value in 2022 so far, investors were pinning hopes on the auto giant's third-quarter numbers for some respite. Unfortunately, Ford reported a huge net loss for the quarter and trimmed its forecast for adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the full year.

Yet, Ford just made a smart business move, and while that may have driven its Q3 losses higher, it shows how management is focused on high-growth areas even if it means making some tough decisions. Also, it's not that Ford isn't growing at all, which is why you'd want to give Ford stock a serious look while the market harps on near-term blips.

Ford is facing a problem with supply, not demand. At the end of September, Ford had nearly 40,000 vehicles in inventory that couldn't be sold because of a shortage of parts. Yet it still grew its revenue by 10% year over year in Q3 on robust demand and expects supply challenges to ease in the coming quarters. In fact, Ford expects its wholesale shipments -- or units sold primarily to dealers -- to rise 10% in 2022. Also, Ford's adjusted EBIT guidance of $11.5 billion for the full year still translates into nearly 15% growth over 2021.

In short, Ford may not be growing as fast as investors want it to, but it is growing at a decent pace despite the macroeconomic headwinds. Ford's electric vehicle (EV) sales are booming as well -- they tripled year over year in the month of September, with its F-150 Lightning pickup truck selling like hotcakes. And to double down on viable autonomous technologies, Ford will now build Level 2 and Level 3 self-driving technologies internally even as it announced plans to shut down Argo AI. It looks like a prudent move as Argo AI was focused on Level 4 technology, and so far, fully self-driven technology has proven to be more difficult than expected to develop and commercialize.

A big write-off on its Argo AI investment may have hit Ford's bottom line in Q3, but that shouldn't detract you from the steady growth in Ford's shipments, EV sales, and cash flows. Not to mention its growth plans.

Booming business amid a sectorwide slowdown

Anders Bylund (The Trade Desk): I love to buy shares of excellent companies while they are cheap. That's a key ingredient in the classic investing mantra to ""buy low, sell high."" It's even better when the company's business is booming, even though Wall Street tossed the stock in the bargain bin due to a systemic weakness in the relevant sector. A mismatch between expected weakness and robust results sets the stage for wealth-building returns in the long run.

That's exactly what I see in The Trade Desk right now. The stock trades roughly 40% lower year to date as investors wrestle with widely reported slowdowns in online advertising sales. The market reaction makes sense at a glance, since The Trade Desk makes its money by running automated digital ad campaigns on behalf of other companies.

However, The Trade Desk's business is firing on every available cylinder. Sales increased by 35% in the second quarter, compared to the year-ago period. Revenue, free cash flows, and cash reserves are skyrocketing, often leaving analyst estimates in the dust:

The secret to The Trade Desk's success in a weak market is simple. Penny-pinching marketing campaign managers want to make the most of every ad-budget nickel in these challenging times. That's what The Trade Desk does best, adding data-driven value to its clients' advertising efforts.

The company is set to report third-quarter results on Nov. 7. These reports don't always send share prices skyward, even when The Trade Desk presents impressive surprises on the top and bottom lines. Still, we are most likely about to get our hands on yet another piece of evidence that this company can thrive in a difficult market. Whether you buy The Trade Desk now at a deeper discount or wait for cold, hard financial gains in the earnings report, early November looks like a great time to pick up a few shares.

Rising from today's modest starting price, this stock can make you plenty of money in the long run.

A winner with even better days ahead

Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): As 2022 winds down, the odds of the U.S. entering a recession appear to be increasing. Many, if not most, stocks will probably decline during an economic downturn. However, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an exception. It's the kind of stock that's likely to thrive in a recession.

Vertex is certainly defying the bear market right now. The biotech stock has soared more than 40% year to date. I think this winner has even better days ahead.

All Vertex needs to do to continue growing its revenue and earnings is snag additional reimbursement deals and regulatory approvals for its existing cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs. That shouldn't be very difficult, in my view.

The company and its partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, hope to soon file for regulatory approvals of exa-cel in treating rare blood disorders beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. I think the prospects for Vertex to have another future blockbuster in its lineup with the gene-editing therapy look bright.

Vertex's pipeline also features three other promising late-stage programs. It could have yet another powerful CF therapy with the triple combination of VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561. Non-opioid pain drug VX-548 has tremendous potential. Inaxaplin (VX-147) could be an effective treatment for APOL1-mediated kidney disease, an indication with a larger patient population than CF.

A recession wouldn't cause Vertex's CF therapy sales to decline. Neither would macroeconomic issues impact the company's drug development programs. With the signs pointing toward the economy potentially heading south, I think Vertex is an ideal stock to buy in November to weather the storm.

Procter & Gamble's consistency is unrivaled

Daniel Foelber (Procter & Gamble): Currency weakness and inflation are taking a sledgehammer to the performance of U.S.-based companies -- particularly conglomerates with international exposure. Procter & Gamble (P&G) generates just over half of its sales from outside North America. A strong dollar means that international sales are effectively discounted relative to domestic sales, which impacts profitability.

In its Q1 fiscal 2023 presentation, P&G forecasted a staggering $3.9 billion in full-year fiscal 2023 headwinds due to inflation, commodity, and currency-related factors. The $3.9 billion translates to an earnings per share (EPS) headwind of $1.57, or 27% of its full-year forecast.

Despite this challenge, P&G is still forecasting flat to 4% core EPS growth in fiscal 2023, which is incredibly impressive given the impact of the headwinds discussed. P&G plans to distribute $9 billion in dividends in fiscal 2023 and will likely raise its dividend for the 67th consecutive year. However, it's buying back less stock, with direct share repurchases at an estimated $6 billion to $8 billion compared to $10 billion in fiscal 2022.

P&G's consistency deserves a premium valuation, no matter the market cycle. Even in the face of challenges, the company generates ample free cash flow to support a growing dividend and buybacks. After all, free cash flow used on dividends and buybacks is effectively cash that the company doesn't need to run the core business. Investors would be hard-pressed to find a company that is better insulated from economic headwinds than Procter & Gamble. Its 22.9 price-to-earnings ratio isn't all that inexpensive relative to the rest of the market. But the quality of its dividend (yielding 2.8%) makes P&G one of the most reliable ways to generate passive income.",cybersecurity,motley fool

It said the hackers gained access to sensitive information, including discussions about the Ukraine war with foreign officials, as well as private conversations between Truss and a political ally, former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng.

The U.K. government spokesperson declined to comment on security arrangements, but said it had “robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats,” including regular security briefings for ministers.

Opposition parties demanded an independent investigation into the hack, and into the leak of the information to a newspaper.

“Was Liz Truss’s phone hacked by Russia, was there a news blackout and if so why?” said Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran. “If it turns out this information was withheld from the public to protect Liz Truss’ leadership bid, that would be unforgivable.”

Labour Party law-and-order spokesperson Yvette Cooper said “the story raises issues around cybersecurity.”

“It’s why cybersecurity has to be taken so seriously by everyone across government, the role of hostile states,” she told Sky News. “But also the allegations about whether a Cabinet minister has been using a personal phone for serious government business, and serious questions about why this information or this story has been leaked or briefed right now.”",cybersecurity,abc news

The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, FITC, Chizor Malize, disclosed this during the third edition of ‘Think Nnovation Cybersecurity’ conference in Lagos with the theme, ‘Accelerating the adoption cybersecurity: Reimagine, simplify, grow’.

To stem this negative trend, she said, the CBN revised the risk-based framework and policy guidelines issued to banks and other financial institutions, and mandated banks and other financial institutions to comply with its provisions by January 1, 2023.

She explained that digital risk was one of the topmost risks in the world in post-pandemic and was being fuelled by the rise in digitisation of banking services.

Over the past few years, she noted, there had been an increase in cyberthreats due to the post pandemic global acceleration of digitisation across the financial services sector.

The unprecedented increase in cyberthreats had resulted in significant financial losses to both corporate entities and individuals globally.

She said, “Digitalisation offers a large playing field for the growth of cybercrime. The risks continue to grow high, the threats continue to grow, the attacks become ceaseless, and every single one of us is prone, and while organisations drive the goals to digitise and automate operations, cyber risks proliferate. Every aspect of the digital enterprise has important cybersecurity implications.”

Malize said that FITC’s ‘Thinknnovation Cybersecurity conference’ was designed to tackle the rise in cybercrime by equipping chief information officers, chief information security officers, and their teams to establish cybersecurity as an enterprise-wide service.

According to the statement, a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies stated that “Financial institutions are leading targets of cyber attacks. Banks are where the money is, and for cybercriminals, attacking banks offers multiple avenues for profit through extortion, theft, and fraud, while nation-states and hacktivists also target the financial sector for political and ideological leverage.

“Regulators are taking notice, and implementing new controls for cyber risk to address the growing threat to the banks they supervise. The Strategic Technologies Programme studies the evolution of cyber threats to the financial system and legal and regulatory efforts to strengthen its defences.” the report said.

The Chairman, FITC Board and Central Bank of Nigeria’s Deputy Governor in charge of Financial System Stability, Mrs Aishah Ahmad, in her address, also stated that there had been a lot of focus on financial institutions because of their interconnectedness.",cybersecurity,the punch

""We have no information about specific or credible threats to disrupt or compromise election infrastructure. I want that to be very clear,"" Easterly said in an interview with ""Face the Nation."" ""We are putting out information, like the warnings that you mentioned, to make sure that state and local election officials have the information that they need to protect their voting systems and their election infrastructure.""

Early voting for the midterm elections is already underway in many states, and more than 20 million people have already cast their ballots. Last week, the federal government issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning domestic violence extremists across the ideological spectrum pose a ""heightened threat"" to the midterm contests.

The bulletin from a group of federal agencies and distributed to law enforcement partners across the country stated potential targets of violence by domestic violent extremists include candidates seeking public office, election officials and workers, political rallies and party representatives, among others.

While Easterly said she is confident the November elections will be ""safe and secure,"" and believes Americans should feel the same way about the integrity of elections in their states, the CISA chief acknowledged there is still concern about voter intimidation and threats to election workers.

""It is a very complex threat environment,"" she said. ""You have cyber threats, you have insider threats, you have rampant disinformation. And yes, very worryingly, you have threats of harassment, intimidation and violence against election officials, polling places and voters. Let's be really clear. That has to stop.""

Easterly said the behavior is ""unacceptable"" and ""undemocratic,"" and she encouraged cooperation and coordination across all levels of government to ensure the midterm elections are safe and secure.

""These elections, election officials, these are not faceless backroom bureaucrats,"" she said. ""These are our relatives, our friends, our neighbors. They're in our community. They are dedicated public servants that are working day in and day out to ensure the security of elections, and they deserve not just our support, but our admiration and respect, and they deserve to be safe. And we all need to be responsible about ensuring that's a safe and secure environment.""

In addition to the threats from domestic violent extremists ahead of Election Day, Easterly also warned of cyber threats from nation states and cyber criminals, as well as disinformation campaigns from foreign actors to sow discord, undermine confidence in the elections systems and exploit vulnerabilities to incite violence.

Like with Russia in 2016, China and Iran have also been behind influence operations, and Easterly said that underscores the importance of voters turning to ""trusted voices"" like local and state elections officials to understand who elections in their states work.

""If you see information that's on the internet, you're not sure whether it's true, be critical about it, ask questions, look at the source, investigate it and don't spread that information any more broadly and basically give foreign adversaries a chance to manipulate Americans and to sow discord and to create lack of confidence in our election,"" Easterly said.",cybersecurity,cbs news

129,Cloudflare Q3 Earnings: Time To Shine?,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1367041336/image_1367041336.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,30/10/2022,It's been a tough year for Cloudflare shareholders with shares down 70% in the last 12 months. Click here to read why I reiterate my ‘Buy’ rating on NET stock.,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550829-cloudflare-q3-earnings-preview-key-metrics,"ArtemisDiana/iStock via Getty Images

Investment Thesis

Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) is a founder-led, industry-leading, cloud-native CDN (content distribution network) and cybersecurity company, with a mission ""to help build a better internet"". The company offers an efficient, scalable, global network that customers can simply 'plug into' in order to improve both their security and performance.

Similar to many something-as-a-service companies, Cloudflare is able to lean on its existing customer base when releasing new products in order to generate additional sales, since it is a lot easier to integrate new 'add-ons' if a business is already using Cloudflare. Through this, the company has managed to continually increase its total addressable market.

Cloudflare Q2'22 Investor Presentation

My personal thesis for investing in Cloudflare is the following: it is a leader in multiple growing industries that are transitioning to the cloud, from CDN to cybersecurity, and operates in business-critical areas, making Cloudflare more recession resistant than other companies. It has continually, successfully rolled out new products to existing customers (as evidenced by its high dollar-based net retention rates) & has seen substantial growth thanks to this. The company has an attractive long-term operating model, with operating margins expected to exceed 20%, and it has been growing rapidly over the last few years & should continue to do so in the future.

Despite the bright future that Cloudflare has, 2022 has not been a fun year for shareholders. The company has seen its shares fall by 70% so far in the past 12 months, in a market that has decimated many high growth, richly valued technology companies. Despite this tumbling share price, it’s still difficult to argue that Cloudflare’s stock appears ‘cheap’.

Data by YCharts

It trades at a premium valuation because it is a premium business, as shown when it smashed its Q2 earnings a few months ago. But investing is a forward-looking game, and investors are now hoping that Cloudflare will bring the same brilliance to its Q3 results – so, what should investors be watching out for? Let’s take a look.

Latest Expectations

Cloudflare is set to report its Q3 earnings on Thursday, November 3, after the market closes, and there are several key items that investors should keep their eyes on.

Starting with the headline numbers, analysts are expecting Q3 revenue of $249.8m, representing YoY growth of 45%. This expectation is very slightly below management’s guidance of $250-$251m for the quarter, perhaps implying that Wall Street is expecting Cloudflare to see the same sort of headwinds faced by the big names that have reported over the past couple of weeks.

Seeking Alpha / Author's Work

My belief is that Cloudflare is one of the most recession resistant businesses out there, but that would not stop the company from being hit by headwinds such as a strong US dollar; we have already seen this impacting all the big tech companies.

In the first half of 2022, international customers made up 47% of Cloudflare’s overall revenue, so it would be fair to assume that the company will be impacted by foreign exchange headwinds.

On the plus side, Cloudflare prices its product portfolio in dollars – meaning that these headwinds should be less impactful, but it would result in rising prices for non-US businesses, and therefore could lower demand. CFO Thomas Seifert had this to say on the Q2 earnings call:

Headwinds from foreign exchange have also accelerated. And with our product portfolio priced in U.S. dollars, our products are becoming more expensive internationally. And while we haven't seen a material change in our customers' behavior to date, we are seeing elongated sales cycles at the high end of our business. We are cognizant of the increasingly cautious environment that factor this into our outlook.

These headwinds didn’t stop Cloudflare from raising its full year revenue guidance last quarter to $968-$972m, which would represent full year revenue growth of 47 to 48% YoY.

Seeking Alpha / Author's Work

The big question now is whether or not Cloudflare will raise that full year revenue outlook once again; the company normally does this fairly reliably, so it’ll all depend on just how badly the macroeconomic environment is deteriorating. Analysts are expecting full year revenues of $971m, so any raise would be well received.

Moving onto the bottom line, and not too much to talk about here. Analysts are expecting Cloudflare to report EPS of $0.00 (how exciting), but the numbers here are always fairly negligible.

Seeking Alpha / Author's Work

Aside from the top line, what else should investors be watching out for? Well, there are a couple of key metrics that I always look at when Cloudflare reports.

2 Key Metrics To Watch In Cloudflare's Q3 Earnings

One of the most significant key metrics to take a look at is the number of large Cloudflare customers in the quarter, and more specifically the growth rates of these customers. These are a great indication of the demand for Cloudflare’s products, particularly now that we are in a difficult macro environment; I am expecting to see a slowdown for this reason, so if Cloudflare does deliver strong numbers on this front, then I will be very, very impressed.

Cloudflare / Author's Work

In fact, back in Q1’22, I had started to get worried. The quarterly growth for large customers had slowed down to single digit percentages, but thankfully (and somewhat surprisingly) growth recovered in Q2’22.

Looking ahead to Q3, I think that any kind of sequential growth over 10% would be impressive, but if Cloudflare can exceed 12% or 13%, then I think shareholders should be incredibly pleased.

The next metric that’s always worth watching for Cloudflare is the dollar-based net retention rate, as this is a key indicator of the company’s ability to upsell its customers with new products – a core aspect of my investment thesis.

Cloudflare / Author's Work

Cloudflare has a goal of getting this DBNRR above 130%; it may struggle to achieve that in the current environment, but clearly, it has been on an upward trajectory over the past couple of years, and this has resulted in revenues actually accelerating, which is quite incredible to see.

Quick Take: Core Financial Metrics

The evidence of Cloudflare’s revenue acceleration can be seen in the below table, where revenue growth has gone from 43% YoY in 2018 to 53% YoY over the past twelve months. I believe this is a testament to the company’s ability to successfully roll out and upsell new products and services to its existing customer base, whilst also winning over new, large customers.

Cloudflare / Author's Work

There are a few trends in these financials that I’m not as big a fan of. Free cash flow margins are negative, and the net cash position has been falling – if the company doesn’t start producing positive free cash flow, then the net cash position will flip into a net debt position.

This wouldn’t be the end of the world, as Cloudflare still has more than enough flexibility with its balance sheet, and the debt referenced is convertible notes which are less daunting than, say, bank loans. But, I am keen to see that free cash flow start to turn positive more frequently.

Looking at the quarterly financials below, investors can see that revenue is still growing at an extremely healthy rate, with over 50% YoY growth in each of the last four quarters. It will be interesting to see whether or not that can continue in this quarter, when plenty of businesses have struggled, even the likes of AWS which provides a similar style of business-critical infrastructure.

Cloudflare / Author's Work

Free cash flow was positive in the latest quarter, and thankfully CEO Matthew Prince spoke on the Q2 earnings call about his eagerness to ensure it stays that way:

What I'm watching closely is our free cash flow margin. It showed significant improvement quarter-over-quarter, and we continue to forecast it will be positive in the second half of the year. …I'm ensuring right now in this uncertain time that Cloudflare is prioritizing being free cash flow positive.

Positive free cash flow will help to preserve the balance sheet, and will also give investors like myself a little more peace of mind.

NET Stock Valuation

As with all high growth, disruptive companies, valuation is tough. I believe that my approach will give me an idea about whether Cloudflare is insanely overvalued or undervalued, but valuation is the final thing I look at - the quality of the business itself is far more important in the long run.

Cloudflare / Author's Work

I have changed the valuation model slightly from my previous article, as I believe this method allows me to better demonstrate the potential upside and downside in my bear and bull case scenarios. The base case scenario has remained fairly similar to my previous base case scenario.

Some may argue that my bull case scenario is not bullish enough, as I am assuming that the revenue acceleration seen over the past few years does not continue. Yet I do still assume that revenue grows at a 47% CAGR through to 2026, which is a bullish case for pretty much any other business. Alongside this growth in revenues comes greater operating leverage and higher free cash flow margins, and a higher EV / FCF multiple is merited due to the more favourable prospects for Cloudflare from 2026 onwards.

My bear case scenario essentially assumes the opposite, although it still allows for a 35% revenue CAGR – in case you were wondering how much success is baked into Cloudflare’s current share price, it's a lot.

Put all that together, and I can see Cloudflare shares achieving a CAGR through to 2026 of (8%), 6%, and 20% in my respective bear, base, and bull case scenarios.

Bottom Line

Ah the joys of investing in 'growth' companies; a high-quality business with a valuation that’s almost impossible to put your finger on! That is why I look at so much more rather than just the current valuation, or even the current product portfolio, when it comes to these types of companies – in a previous article, I outlined Cloudflare’s economic moats, management team, future prospects and more.

But the tumbling share price shows that clearly valuation does matter (who knew?), so I use my model to ensure that the price I’m paying for these disruptive, high-quality businesses is not completely insane – and, right now, I think the price is reasonable for Cloudflare.

Q3 earnings will certainly be a big test for this business. CEO Matthew Price sounded fairly confident on last quarter’s earnings call, but big tech's Q3 results have shown profound headwinds that businesses will struggle to escape. Yet Cloudflare’s decision to bill in US Dollars could be a helpful shield against the FX pressure, and the company has been executing so brilliantly that it is difficult to bet against it.

Given all this, I will reiterate my ‘Buy’ rating on Cloudflare. Clearly, this a stock that is prone to volatility, and investors may see shares fly in one direction or another following its results; but, in 5+ years, I think this is a company that investors will have wanted in their portfolio.",cybersecurity,seeking alpha

The Mail on Sunday said that the hack was discovered when Truss was running to become Conservative Party leader and prime minister in the summer. It said the security breach was kept secret by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the head of the civil service.

The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said Russian spies were suspected of the hack. It said the hackers gained access to sensitive information, including discussions about the Ukraine war with foreign officials, as well as private conversations between Truss and a political ally, former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng.

The U.K. government spokesperson declined to comment on security arrangements, but said it had “robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats,” including regular security briefings for ministers.

Opposition parties demanded an independent investigation into the hack, and into the leak of the information to a newspaper.

“Was Liz Truss’s phone hacked by Russia, was there a news blackout and if so why?” said Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran. “If it turns out this information was withheld from the public to protect Liz Truss’ leadership bid, that would be unforgivable.”

Labour Party law-and-order spokesperson Yvette Cooper said “the story raises issues around cybersecurity.”

“It’s why cybersecurity has to be taken so seriously by everyone across government, the role of hostile states,” she told Sky News. “But also the allegations about whether a Cabinet minister has been using a personal phone for serious government business, and serious questions about why this information or this story has been leaked or briefed right now.”

Aurubis said it was able to largely maintain production even though it was forced to shut down numerous systems at its sites and disconnect them from the internet as a precaution.

""The production and environmental protection facilities at the smelter sites are running, and incoming and outgoing goods are also being maintained manually,"" Aurubis said on Friday.

The extent of the impact is being assessed, said Aurubis, adding that it was working with investigating authorities.

Earlier this year, a cyberattack on a satellite communications company knocked out remote control of thousands of wind turbines in central Europe.

And a German subsidiary of Russia's Rosneft was in March the target of a cyberattack by what BSI called ""hacktivists"" at Anonymous Germany.",cybersecurity,itnews

Every day, organizations and private networks are subjected to cyberattacks.",https://www.concept-phones.com/news/the-rise-of-cybercrime-today/,"Professionals in cyber security continuously defend computer systems from potential breaches. Every day, organizations and private networks are subjected to cyberattacks, and the diversity of these attacks has significantly risen. According to former Cisco CEO John Chambers, there are two categories of businesses: those that have been hacked and those that do not yet realize they have been hacked.



There are numerous motivations behind cyberattacks. One is money. To restore a system’s operation, cybercriminals may render it inoperable and demand payment. Ransomware is more sophisticated than ever, an assault that necessitates payment to restore software services.

Although businesses are more likely to be the target of cyber assaults since they leverage IT outsourcing, people can also be hit since they store sensitive data on their mobile devices and connect to the internet via an unsecured public network.

What Is a Cyber Security Threat?

A cyber security threat refers to any conceivable harmful assault that aims to access data, disrupt digital activities, or damage information unlawfully. Cyber threats can emanate from numerous entities, including corporate espionage, hacktivists, terrorist groups, hostile nation-states, criminal organizations, lone hackers, and disgruntled employees.

Sensitive data has recently been made public due to multiple high-profile cyberattacks. For example, the 2017 Equifax breach exposed the private information of over 143 million people, including their birthdates, residences, and Social Security numbers.

In 2018, Marriott International revealed that hackers had broken into its servers and taken data belonging to almost 500 million customers. Both times, the firm neglected to implement, test, and retest technical security measures, including firewalls, encryption, and authentication, which allowed the cyber security threat to flourish.



Cyber attackers can utilize a person’s or company’s sensitive data to steal information or access their financial accounts, among other potentially detrimental acts. Therefore, cyber security professionals are vital for protecting private data.

Evolution of Cyber Security

Cyber security measures continue to adapt as the internet and digitally dependent enterprises develop and change. According to Secureworks, people who study cybersecurity focus more on the two topics discussed below.

The Internet of Things

Individual devices that link to the internet or other networks give an access point to hackers. Cytelligence states that in 2019, hackers increasingly targeted smart home and internet of things (IoT) devices, such as smart TVs, voice assistants, connected baby monitors, and cell phones. Hackers that successfully infiltrate a connected house not only acquire access to users’ Wi-Fi passwords but may also gain access to private data, such as medical records, bank statements, and website login information.

The Explosion of Data

The storage of data on devices such as laptops and mobile phones makes it easier for cybercriminals to access a network via a personal device. For instance, in his forthcoming book Exploding Data: Reclaiming Our Cyber Security in the Digital Age, former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff warns of the widespread exposure of individuals’ personal information, which has become more susceptible to cyber-attacks.

Zero Trust Security Strategy

Businesses are now more connected than ever. Your systems, users and data exist and function in distinct settings. Perimeter-based security is no longer sufficient, yet installing security controls within each environment is a complicated endeavor. In both scenarios, protecting your most valuable assets will be compromised.

A zero-trust strategy presupposes compromise and implements controls to check the validity and intent of every user, device, and connection to the organization. For enterprises to successfully implement a zero-trust strategy, they must be able to combine security information to provide the context (device security, location, etc.) that informs and enforces validation controls.

Consequently, businesses and government agencies require maximum cyber security to safeguard their data and operations. Cybersecurity professionals must comprehend how to address the most recent cyber threats.",cybersecurity,concept-phones.com

The Mail on Sunday said that the hack was discovered when Truss was running to become Conservative Party leader and prime minister in the summer. It said the security breach was kept secret by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the head of the civil service.

The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said Russian spies were suspected of the hack. It said the hackers gained access to sensitive information, including discussions about the Ukraine war with foreign officials, as well as private conversations between Truss and a political ally, former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng.

The U.K. government spokesperson declined to comment on security arrangements, but said it had “robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats,” including regular security briefings for ministers.

Opposition parties demanded an independent investigation into the hack, and into the leak of the information to a newspaper.

“Was Liz Truss’s phone hacked by Russia, was there a news blackout and if so why?” said Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran. “If it turns out this information was withheld from the public to protect Liz Truss’ leadership bid, that would be unforgivable.”

Labour Party law-and-order spokesperson Yvette Cooper said “the story raises issues around cybersecurity.”

“It’s why cybersecurity has to be taken so seriously by everyone across government, the role of hostile states,” she told Sky News. “But also the allegations about whether a Cabinet minister has been using a personal phone for serious government business, and serious questions about why this information or this story has been leaked or briefed right now.”",cybersecurity,the washington times

“We are putting out information … to make sure that state and local election officials have the information that they need to protect their voting systems and their election infrastructure.”

The warning is among a range of messages being distributed by federal agencies and law enforcement, including the New York Police Department, with the midterm election just nine days away.

Businessman Paul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was attacked with a hammer by an intruder during a break-in at the couple’s home in San Francisco early on Friday. The attack has ignited fears about political violence at a time when crime has become a leading issue this election season.

The Department of Homeland Security, FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and U.S. Capitol Police issued a bulletin on Friday warning that political candidates, election officials and the public faced a heighten risk of violence.

Last week the NYPD called for “elevated vigilance” ahead of the midterm elections in an internal bulletin. The department warned that extremists could target political events and polling sites, putting poll workers and political candidates at risk.

Big Tech Goes to War | Foreign Affairs

What happens when tech companies stop providing an essential good or service in a war zone? Managing uncertainty is a known challenge in conflict but the role that tech companies are playing in Ukraine is introducing new dynamics. Elon Musk is wavering on how long he will continue to provide Starlink services, which have become the backbone for Ukrainian communications. Other cybersecurity and satellite companies have also stepped in to assist in Ukraine. But companies operate according to different interests than national governments. It is time for the US government to establish new methods of communicating and coordinating with corporations to ensure independent private sector decisions do not introduce unnecessary instability into conflicts. Additionally, experts in government can help companies prepare for potential geopolitical blowback.

Intel and the $1.5trn chip industry meltdown | The Economist

While the CHIPS Act is increasing supply, new export bans targeting China are decreasing demand and American-listed chip businesses are losing revenue. Although the chip industry is known to be cyclical, government intervention is pushing this cycle to extremes. This year, the combined market value of US companies in the chip business has declined by more than $1.5 trillion. Moreover, inflation rates are suppressing consumer demand for chip-powered goods like PCs and smartphones. As a result, more chip manufacturers are looking to break into new markets from cars to cloud-computing data centers to networking gear. But efforts to diversify may not be enough to make up for lost Chinese markets. National security-driven policies to increase domestic capacity could end up harming the American chip industry.

Meta files to dismiss FTC suit over Within acquisition | Axios

Earlier this month, the FTC modified its original complaint against Meta’s acquisition of Within–a virtual reality fitness startup–to focus on decreased competition in the market for virtual reality exercise apps. Meta filed to waive the FTCs request for a preliminary injunction that would block the acquisition until the case is resolved. The tech company argues that the FTC’s lawsuit “relies on pure speculation of a hypothetical future state” while the FTC points to Meta’s market power at all levels of the virtual reality sector as evidence that the acquisition represents anticompetitive behavior. A hearing is scheduled for December but it’s possible the judge may rule on Meta’s request before then. FTC critics argue the case against Meta would be tough to win but supporters favor the signal to slow down acquisitions in emerging fields.

Meet the Army of Robots Coming to Fill In for Scarce Workers | The Wall Street Journal

Aging populations, labor shortages, rising costs of human labor, and increasingly capable robots are leading to a spike in the adoption of industrial and service robots. According to the International Federation of Robotics, half a million industrial robots were installed across the globe last year–22% more than the previous record set in 2018. From 2020 to 2021, the number of service robots installed annually also increased by 37%. Moreover, the amount of time it takes for a robot to pay for itself is decreasing. But this trend is not without downsides. In the short term, more automation can lead to job loss and smaller workforces. In industries experiencing high rates of robot adoption, trade unions are engaged in negotiations to protect members’ employment. While a “roboconomy” is growing, the rate of robot adoption will be metered by the fact that the world is optimized for human labor. Increased autonomy will also require changes to working conditions such as wider and unobstructed grocery aisles for cleaning robots.

How the FBI Stumbled in the War on Cybercrime | ProPublica

In an excerpt from “The Ransomware Hunting Team: A Band of Misfits’ Improbable Crusade to Save the World from Cybercrime,” authors Renee Dudley and Daniel Golden describe the FBI’s shortfalls in addressing cybercrime. The Bureau suffered retention and cultural challenges as it sought to solve technical crimes without making many changes to its organizational structure or training requirements. In 2015, Director James Comey met with a group of Cyber Division agents leaving the Bureau for more lucrative private sector jobs to gain insight into their experience and perspectives. While cyber crimes, especially ransomware, were on the rise, these agents were treated as second-class citizens and often had to spend significant time training non-technical agents assigned to the Cyber Division. Moreover, the FBI’s reluctance to partner with outside experts prevented it from augmenting its limited internal resources. While the 2021 attack on the Colonial Pipeline heightened ransomware in the Bureau’s order of priorities, fundamental reforms to support and grow cyber talent have not followed.

Antony Blinken’s Silicon Valley visit underscores US cybersecurity concerns | The Guardian

Secretary of State visited Stanford University and Silicon Valley this week in a push to encourage cyber diplomacy and more US government-tech collaboration. His visit comes at a critical time: cyber risks are on the rise; attacks increased by 31% from 2020 to 2021. Analysts expect that Blinken’s priority topics with tech executives were warnings of the continuing potential for Russia-sponsored cyber attacks related to the war in Ukraine and US election interference. There is a need for increased public-private information sharing. However, the American public’s confidence in big tech is on the decline in the midst of a push for more regulation. Greater collaboration with the government could further threaten companies’ public image as citizens worry about digital privacy.

U.S. security officials worry about homegrown election threats | Reuters

In the lead up to the midterm elections, government officials are more concerned about domestic disinformation campaigns and homegrown threats than foreign interference. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly notes there are no credible threats to US elections infrastructure at this time, but “the current election threat environment is more complex than it has ever been.” Since the 2020 election, far-right influencers have spread the majority of election disinformation. A majority of Republican voters still believe Trump won the 2020 election and have threatened, harassed, or assaulted poll workers.

138,The Growing Role Of Pay In Employee Experience and Business Performance - Josh Bersin,https://joshbersin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1264127452_485591_gstowy.jpg,30/10/2022,Increasing pay has suddenly become the #1 topic at work. How can companies stay ahead of inflation yet manage rewards strategically?,https://joshbersin.com/2022/10/the-growing-role-of-pay-in-employee-experience-and-business-performance/,"For the last three years we’ve been worried about burnout, mental health, and work life balance during the pandemic. This week a new issue has emerged. A new Mercer study of employee sentiment found that pay has suddenly become the number one factor in satisfaction at work.

When asked “what keeps workers up at night,” pay issues have risen to the top.

While opportunity to grow and a sense of belonging remain top drivers of engagement, among these 4500+ workers, pay now matters more. (And this is a global issue, as the research below points out.)

There’s no surprise why this is happening. The rate of inflation is extraordinary and everyone is tired of high prices. But for employers this trend has special meaning because pay practices are among the most legacy and old-fashioned practices of HR.

We studied pay practices many times and we’re in the middle of a new study right now. What we generally find is that most companies usse a traditional model that involves performance appraisal, stacked ranking or forced distribution, pay bands, and annual increases. Then most companies give employees bonuses based on profit or team performance. And that’s about it.

Today, however, this process is no longer enough. The research we’re going to be publishing shows that pay is now a C-level issue (coming in Q1). The philosophy should be supported by the CEO, it should be well communicated, it should be revisited regularly, and it must focus on equity above all.

In other words, “if I don’t understand why I’m paid as I am and how it is both fair and timely, I’m likely to be unhappy.” This means the compensation and benefits team, as well as the entire function of HR, has to be aligned on this new world of constantly changing pay.

Why the big change? There are two important drivers: inflation and pinpoint skills shortages. As we hire new people at a higher wages, all existing employees are affected. And more and more states now mandate that pay must be disclosed on job postings, so employees can see what others are being offered.

Pay Equity, which is the process of ensuring equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, ethnicity, or other demographic factor, is becoming a common practice. We explain the basics in our report on demystifying pay equity, along with lots more to come. Early next year we will publish an entire maturity model, framework, and lots of case studies and examples, plus a report on the role of technology and data.

As a good example, I suggest you read the most recent DEI report by Microsoft, which shows precisely why and how the company measures equity. I’d also suggest you talk with some of the experts in this space, including Trusaic, Syndio, Salary.com, and others.

Establishing The Right Levels Of Pay During Inflation

The second question that you’re most likely to ask is should pay go up? And if so by how much?

The most recent BLS data shows that wages are increasing at about 5% per year, which is not as high as inflation. But of course, inflation varies by location and mix of goods, so the 5% number is reasonably high based on historic practices. It’s often around 1.5-2% and occasionally over 3%. That leaves you with a question: do you increase wages at a 5% base pay before you add performance bonus? And then the philosophical question for the C-Suite: will we pay above average, below average, or in the middle?

The interesting answer that question is that when we surveyed thousands of companies and ask them about their pay, well over half say they pay above average, which of course is a ridiculous result. What that tells us is that companies believe they are offering above average rewards because they know how extensive and complex their various reward systems are.

And that is another part of the problem. The rewards space has become so complex, with insurance, benefits, wellbeing, flexible work, fertility leave, unlimited benefits, covid pay, that employers are wondering where it will stop. Non-cash benefits are increasing at around the same rate as pay (4.9%), and the BLS research shows that American companies now spend close to 33% of their payroll on this myriad of employee support programs. (This percentage has increased by 32% in ten years.)

As a result most CFOs are not thrilled about the idea of HR asking for even more money when they have been piling on benefits for the last three years. So what should you do?

Well, based on the research we’ve done and my own experience talking to many companies, you must understand that pay and benefits are not “compensation for work.” They are really part of the entire “deal” you offer to workers, making up a large part of your employment brand and employee experience. This means, as our research shows, that you need a C-level discussion about how and where you want to invest these dollars.

Remember that pay is what we call a “hygeine factor.” When it’s not high enough people will leave, but making it every higher has a rapidly diminishing return. Most employees come to work for much more than money: they want an opportunity to grow; they want a career; they want to work on projects that are exciting and interesting; they want the workplace to be safe; and they want to work with people they like and trust.

As my new book Irresistible points out, those factors are not common in every single company. The book explains that only 10 to 12% of companies in any industry are exceptionally good at managing people. So if you are an Irresistible company, you can get away with average or below average pay and still have a great workforce and a great employee experience. But you have to examine the Seven Secrets and think about how well you really understand them in your management.

That said, there are also companies that pride themselves on extraordinarily high levels of pay. I won’t mention names, but I know several of them and they tend to be competitive, aggressive, performance-oriented cultures, which is perfectly fine. I worked for several companies that operated at this level and I remember the feeling that every day was a race to keep up with the company, the business, and the rest of my peers. Early in my career I was very happy to do it and didn’t mind the pressure. But later in my career, as I became more focused on family and my own interests, I realized it wasn’t quite what I wanted. So I have moved to a career that’s much more focused on purpose and impact, and far less on pay.

At a broad level, this is what’s happening in the workforce. If you choose to run your company like an investment bank and pay people millions of dollars for hitting targets, you will attract a certain mercenary type of worker and these ambitious people get a lot of things done. They may not work well with their peers and they may leave if things don’t work out. But nevertheless, this strategy may make sense.

Generally speaking, however, when I look at the companies in our research, including those in the Irresistible book, companies that outperform over time tend to pay people fairly but do not pride themselves on always being the highest paid in their market. There are certain roles which demand high wages to compete: petroleum engineers, data scientists, cybersecurity specialists and others. But those highly paid roles equalize over time so you can adjust these positions for performance.

We’ve also seen that high levels of pay can sometimes create an entitlement. People get accustomed to these salaries and when times get tough they may leave. So again, you should make these decisions deliberately.

Communication is extremely important. People don’t always know why they’re paid as they are, and they will share their raises with others. The best companies take these issues head on: they communicate pay strategies clearly. They explain the pay strategy and describe why their “deal” is good for workers.

As an example, I just interviewed Dean Carter who recently retired as the CHRO of Patagonia. At Patagonia, a company who’s mission is centered around saving the earth, they created a very simple formula. Base pay increases are based on how well you increase your skills in the job itself. Bonuses are based on achievement of goals. This tells employees that “doing your job better” is valued just as much as “hitting financial targets.”

At Patagonia, if you’re getting better at your current job and your skills are improving, you’ll get a raise regardless of business results. Your performance bonus is based on your goals. This simple formula sends the message that hitting goals is valued, but not at the expense of learning to do your job better.

There’s many ways to use pay to drive your business strategy. A common direction is to pay people based on team performance: many companies now make 20 to 30% of the increase or bonus based on the performance of their team, not just their individual results. This creates teamwork and reduces the amount of individual competition. And there are many other ideas as well.

The final thing I’ll say about pay is you have to think about how it is administered. There are many new ways to deliver these benefits with impact. The Mercer research points out that many hourly workers see pay as a survival or lifestyle issue. Pay is eaten away by commute costs, student loan debt, credit card debt, and other financial overhangs. These employees bring these stresses into work: if an employee is worried about rent or buying groceries, they aren’t likely to be very productive. So there are many new options for the delivery of benefits that help.

For example, real time pay is a big trend: you can pay people at the end of the day for the hours they worked that day. This is a meaningful benefit for people on hourly wages, nurses and other shift workers. Another new option is pay designated to tuition reimbursement or student loan forgiveness. You can pay employees up to $5,250 per year for educational benefits and they will not have to pay tax. Many companies deploy that benefit for student loan repayment. Companies like SoFi have pioneered this and vendors like Guild and EdAssist offer entire career programs around these kinds of benefits.

The third area of benefit is known as financial wellbeing or financial wellness: teaching people to manage their credit cards better, put money into savings accounts, understand insurance, and build a 401k. There are many providers in this space and they can create life-changing solutions for your employees.

Pay Strategies Are A Dynamic, Strategic Tool For Business

Employee rewards and benefits, like everything else in HR, are a rapidly changing topic. The Compensation and Benefits leader, who used to negotiate with providers and run the annual process, now has to operate as a strategic consultant. Pay and its permutations are a vital part of the employee experience. They impacts your employment brand, retention, diversity and inclusion, and overall company strategy.

Remember this: we are all becoming service companies. While we account for pay as an expense, it’s really a big investment. By carefully investing in the right rewards strategy you are improving people’s lives, which in turn makes them more productive for you.

From there, he moved to the CISA for 15+ years, performed key positions with the U.S. air force, and is now the Critical Infrastructure Cyber Lead at Accenture Federal Services.

Rick Diggers in his early days in the U.S Armed Forces

Driggers worked with federal, state, and local offices to understand the security posture of America’s infrastructure, most of which operates on legacy technology that was never initially intended to be connected to online networks. Securing these infrastructures has taken time, and the industry is beginning to feel the momentum. “If I'm looking at an organization’s cybersecurity posture through a maturity and a readiness lens, that really allows me the flexibility to make adjustments based on emerging threats and risk,” said Diggers, “That's a lot better than, you know, playing whack a mole with vulnerabilities, which unfortunately a lot of organizations do.”

When drilling down into what makes the agile and cybersecurity mindset possible, Driggers says it comes down to people, process, and technology, not just tech operating on its own– and that’s only one of the 3 top challenges to securing organizations.

3 Top Challenges organizational cybersecurity challenges

Diggers speaking at the CyberTech Europe 2022 conference

Today’s cybersecurity gaps are especially challenging for organizations that see their systems and operations taken offline. When working with governmental organizations, a hack may go beyond ransomware to exposing the personal information of a person of interest or even government secrets.

When the stakes are so high, it becomes a team effort to ensure that such important data is only accessed by authorized users. To achieve this, organizations should focus on the following:

Culture

From the start, it’s important to acknowledge that securing IT networks and OT (Operational Technology) networks are not the same. While IT practitioners are often focused on securing private data, OT cybersecurity professionals are more focused on operational uptime and availability. They have different problems to tackle and approach them from different angles.

Executives must recognize this and encourage opportunities for them to collaborate on sorting organizational problems in a way that allows them to better understand one another.

People, process, and policy

Working towards a common goal demands that each team member is in a role that is in line with their skills. Employees should be in the right place at the right time, able to understand challenges and act on them accordingly, without having irrelevant decision-makers holding things back.

Visibility

Streamlining processes demands a clear understanding of what each department and team member does, in order to allow them to work as efficiently as possible while creating opportunities to recognize their own cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In addition, this creates opportunities for teams to reduce duplicated efforts.

“I think gaining visibility goes a long way to helping manage many technical aspects. That'll help free up resources to apply to real security practices to reduce risk,” said Driggers. “In my mind, it really all starts with visibility. If you can't see it, you can't protect it.”

Protecting infrastructure into the future

Rick Diggers on C-SPAN when working for Homeland Security

The first step in securing any piece of technology is by having cybersecurity be part of early development, not an afterthought where discovered vulnerabilities may make a device insecure, or even unusable.

For example, the promise held by 5G technology and being able to connect fleets of devices to cellular networks increases attack surfaces to unprecedented levels. How do we secure these spaces on such a wide scale? “Future security challenges in this space, particularly as it applies to the development of new or existing critical infrastructure, is to continuously evolve our security solutions to not only ensure the integrity, reliability, and security of all of these connected technologies, but we also need to ensure the safety and privacy of our people,” said Driggers.

A large part of that is the Biden administration’s executive order 14028, which laid the groundwork for the cybersecurity documentation and ultimately much of the progress that we are seeing today with Software Bill of Material (SBOM) documentation. What’s more, is that it was all done from a supply chain perspective– not only for software supply chains but also for software development environments. It gives guidance on language and clear risk guidance to manufacturers on how to speak with their customers.

To achieve this, SBOMs are critical in identifying potential vulnerabilities, gaining insights into mitigation techniques, and securing organizations in an organized manner. Ultimately, the greater visibility and communication about potential threats that exist within an organization's culture, whether it be through meetings or documentation, the more secure it will be.

Mandiant said it previously saw the “DRAGONBRIDGE” threat group trying to mobilize protesters in the U.S. and has now witnessed the group sowing division, plagiarizing and altering news articles, and adopting false personas on social media to spread disinformation.

“Most notably, in September 2022, DRAGONBRIDGE accounts posted an English-language video across multiple social media platforms containing content attempting to discourage Americans from voting in the upcoming U.S. midterm elections,” Mandiant said in a newreport. “The video questioned the efficacy of voting and of U.S. government institutions more broadly.”

Mandiant said the video argued the solution was not to vote but to “root out this ineffective and incapacitated system” over an image of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

“The campaign also pointed to frequent mentions of ‘civil war’ on social media and incidents of politically motivated violence, including confrontations between individuals supporting opposing parties and acts against the FBI, as evidence of the deterioration of the political process and its impending demise,” the report said.

Alongside lambasting American democracy, the group also sought to manipulate news reports and cyber research to make it appear as though Chinese hackers were actually doing America’s bidding.

The group claimed the APT41 hacking group was developed by the U.S. government in posts on Twitter, according to Mandiant. The FBI has identified APT41 as Chinese hackers that also use the name Barium.

Mandiant has described APT41 as a group that combines state-sponsored cyberespionage with financially motivated cybercrime targeting a variety of sectors such as health care and media.

The DRAGONBRIDGE effort plagiarized a Radio Free Asia news article and altered it to describe the cyberattackers as a “U.S. hacking group,” according to Mandiant.

“Accounts plagiarized, altered, and otherwise mischaracterized news reporting and research from Mandiant and other cybersecurity organizations to support their allegations,” Mandiant‘s report said. “Such narratives appear to be a continuation of themes alleging malicious U.S. cyber activity that we have seen DRAGONBRIDGE promote since at least April 2022.”

The DRAGONBRIDGE effort also used accounts impersonating Intrusion Truth, a group known for exposing Chinese hackers online.

Mandiant vice president of intelligence analysis John Hultquist said in a statement that the DRAGONBRIDGE effort did not appear fully successful but he was troubled by their aggressive growth.

The pro-China effort to influence Americans’ behavior comes amid new concerns of hackers from China targeting political parties.

The coming midterm elections are not the first time China has sought to exert influence. The National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a statement in August 2020 before the last presidential election saying China sought to “pressure political figures” that it determined were opposed to its interests and wanted to counter criticism of China.

Ahead of the 2022 midterms, the Biden administration has worked to squelch concerns that cyberattackers can successfully disrupt election infrastructure. The FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency published an assessment earlier this month that said cyberattacks are “unlikely to disrupt or prevent voting.”

“As of the date of this report, the FBI and CISA have no reporting to suggest cyber activity has ever prevented a registered voter from casting a ballot, compromised the integrity of any ballots cast, or affected the accuracy of voter registration information,” the agencies said earlier this month.

FBI and CISA did not immediately provide comment for this story.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.

Last week was an extremely troubling one in American politics. We now have just eight days left until Election Day, and the country is feeling deeply unsettled.

Our CBS News Battleground Tracker poll out this morning shows that a stunning 79 percent -- that's nearly eight in 10 likely voters -- say that the country is out of control. That's an ominous sign for the Democrats, who hold power in Washington. Of those 79 percent expected to vote next Tuesday, Republicans have a more than 20-point advantage.

Two issues, the health of the economy and the health of American democracy, have taken center stage in this campaign, and it is the latter subject and the political rhetoric that could help fuel violence that is under fresh scrutiny following Friday's attack on Paul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, at their home in San Francisco.

CBS News congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane has more.

(Begin VT)

SCOTT MACFARLANE (voice-over): The day after the horrific attack, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed gratitude for law enforcement and her husband's medical team and said she and her family were heartbroken and traumatized by the life-threatening attack.

President Biden spoke with the Pelosis on Saturday.

JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): Don't know for certain, but it looks like this was intended for Nancy. He kept asking: ""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

SCOTT MACFARLANE: Forty-two-year-old David DePape will face a series of felony charges in the coming days, including attempted homicide, accused of striking the 82-year-old Pelosi in the head multiple times with a hammer.

DePape's social media posts are saturated with conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial and claims of election fraud. Democrats argue Republicans must do more to denounce the violence and end the baseless claims that could fuel threats.

PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That's the problem. We can't just say, I feel badly about the violence and we condemn it. Condemn what produces the violence. And this talk produces the violence.

SCOTT MACFARLANE: The attack on Paul Pelosi is the latest in a growing wave of threats and plots against elected officials.

Capitol Police records obtained by CBS News show nearly 10,000 investigations into threats on members of Congress last year.

Georgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock has spent heavily on security this election cycle.

Our Nikole Killion caught up with him on the campaign trail.

SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-Georgia): I'm not naive about the tough moment we're in. And there are people who are trying to stir that up for short- term political gain game. It's dangerous stuff.

SCOTT MACFARLANE: Meanwhile, an intelligence bulletin obtained by CBS News warns of a heightened threat from domestic extremist groups on and after Election Day, not just possible targeting of elected officials, but of elections administrators, political rallies and of possible attempts to intimidate voters or use claims of fraud to justify violence after the election, especially in cases where it takes additional time to certify the results.

(End VT)

SCOTT MACFARLANE: Despite baseless claims of fraud, the 2020 election is considered the most secure and successful in U.S. history.

And voting so far in 2022 has been safe and secure. So far, more than 20 million people have voted early, and elections officials say they're being vigilant and coordinating with police, emphasizing, everyone should feel safe coming out to vote -- Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott MacFarlane, thank you.

We go now to Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also known as CISA. That's the Homeland Security agency tasked with securing America's cybersecurity infrastructure and coordinating with states on election security.

And you're going to be very busy. I'm glad you're here with us today.

JEN EASTERLY (Director, U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency): Great to be here.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this bulletin, first off.

It warns, domestic violent extremists may view election-related infrastructure, personnel and voters as attractive targets. Are you aware of immediate and credible threats?

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: No.

Let me be very clear at the top. We have no information about specific or credible threats to disrupt or compromise election infrastructure. I want that to be very clear. We are putting out information, like the warnings that you mentioned, to make sure that state and local election officials have the information that they need to protect their voting systems and their election infrastructure.

That said, Margaret, it is a very complex threat environment. You have cyber threats. You have insider threats. You have rampant disinformation. And, yes, very worryingly, you have threats of harassment, intimidation and violence against election officials, polling places and voters.

Let's be really clear. That has to stop. It is unacceptable behavior. It's undemocratic. And we all need to work together to ensure that this is a safe and secure election.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And it is the states that administer the election. You are providing support to them.

What is the Election Day plan for security and then communication? What are we going to hear and see?

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: So, on Election Day, actually, we at CISA are going to be in our own operations center.

We're going to have federal government partners, private sector partners there, and then we're going to be in direct communication with all of the state and local election officials whose job it is to run and administer elections. We're going to be working to share information, and we're going to be working to be able to respond to anything that happens.

But, remember, at the end of the day, the relationship between local officials and local law enforcement is incredibly important. And I was really encouraged by the opinion piece that came out yesterday with the sheriff in Massachusetts, one in Colorado, talking about the fact that ensuring election security is a nonpartisan issue, and threats to election officials have to stop.

So, that connectivity at the local level, the information sharing, the planning and exercising that's happening is really important to ensuring security at the -- at the polling place and at the ballot box.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We talk a lot about rhetoric and the risk of triggering violence.

And social media is a place where false information often spreads. So, I want to ask you about what's happening now at Twitter. It's now privately owned by billionaire Elon Musk. This morning, he tweeted a conspiracy theory about Nancy Pelosi's husband.

Given how charged our environment is, are you concerned about how this platform might change and that it's going to make your job more difficult?

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Well, first of all, horrific attack on Mr. Pelosi, and thoughts and prayers go to their family.

That is a decision that social media companies, that Twitter will make. They make their own decisions, based on terms of service. I am laser- focused...

MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the owner himself tweeting this out.

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: I am laser-focused on the next nine days and the time that comes after elections on doing everything we can to ensure security.

I do want to be very clear on this, though, Margaret. These elections, election officials, these are not faceless backroom bureaucrats.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Right?

These are our relatives, our friends, our neighbors. They're in our community. They are dedicated public servants that are working day in and day out to ensure the security of elections. And they deserve not just our support, but our admiration and respect. And they deserve to be safe. And we all need to be responsible about ensuring that's a safe and secure environment.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why I'm asking you about the place where these conspiracy theories spread.

The FBI report, when we looked at it, in terms of those direct threats to election workers, highlighted Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Wisconsin as places where voter intimidation and threats to election workers have been seen.

Are these areas of greatest concern for you?

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Concerned across the board.

We have cyber threats from nation states and cyber criminals. You have insider threats. You have physical threats, as we talked about, and then you have disinformation, so, disinformation, foreign influence that can be used to sow discord, that can undermine confidence in election integrity and that can be used to incite violence.

So, what are we doing? We're doing a couple things. First of all, we're putting out information about tactics and disinformation and how to build resilience against disinformation. We have a rumor vs.reality site that's basically election literacy.

But, most importantly, we are amplifying the voices of local and state election officials. They are the trusted voices that understand how elections work. If anybody has questions about voting or what -- how it all works, you should go to their local -- local election officials.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

So, that's who they should be following on Twitter and social media?

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Those are the experts.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Find out who your local election official is and follow their account?

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Exactly. Exactly.

And, you know, I should point out, the National Association of Secretaries of State, NASS.org, TrustedInfo2022, a great source for information, as well as the National Association of Election Directors, NASED.org, frequently asked questions.

That's the best -- best place to go. They know how elections happen. If you've seen one state in an election, you've seen one state. It's actually surprisingly technical and complicated, and that's why I welcome people asking questions.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: You know, the beauty of democracy is that it's participatory. We can all have a role. So, volunteer, be a poll worker, ask questions, the more transparency, the better.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about the foreign threat.

In 2016, Russia probed voter registration logs. We know there are warnings about what China is doing right now. How effective has this campaign by Beijing been? And are there other state actors or non-state actors you're concerned about?

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Yeah, we've seen Russia, we've seen Iran, we've seen China use the playbook for influence operations.

That's why it's so important that Americans realize...

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.

DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: ... that they need to build resilience against that.

If you see information that's on the Internet, you're not sure whether it's true, be critical about it, ask questions, look at the source, investigate it, and don't spread that information any more broadly and give -- basically give foreign adversaries a chance to manipulate Americans and to sow discord and to create lack of confidence in our elections.

But I want to be very, very clear. I have confidence in the elections that are going to be run because of the massive amount of work that's been done across the federal government, at state and local election officials, with election vendors, to put multiple, multiple layers of resilience and security controls in place.

I am confident that elections will be safe and secure, and the American people should have confidence in the integrity of elections when they go to the ballot box, when they cast their vote.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, good luck to you. It will be a busy next few days and weeks.

Thank you very much.

And we turn now to the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer.

Good morning. Good to have you here in person.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER (R-Minnesota): Good morning.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you about what we've just been talking about here.

How concerned are you about the risk of political violence, and how should it be minimized?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: There's no place for violence, period, in our society, physical violence or violence against someone's property.

I think you've already covered that here this morning. The incident in San Francisco, tragic as it is, I think we need some more information about it, but we should all be feeling for Paul Pelosi and his family. Hopefully, there will be a 100 percent recovery.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to be abundantly clear, you denounce any kind of attack on the Pelosi family?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Absolutely.

There should be no attacks, period. There should be no violence in our society, again, whether it's political or otherwise. There's no place for it in a civilized society.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm glad you said that, because I want to ask you about something in our CBS News poll that shows that, even as Republicans are poised to lead this contest and -- and take control of the House, we see suspicion, specifically among Republicans, about the voting process.

A big majority of Republicans support the idea of private citizens challenging election officials as they process and report vote counts on election night. We're seeing that on the screen now. Two-thirds of Republicans support the idea of private citizens patrolling around ballot drop boxes and polling places.

This is just Republicans. We don't see this with Democrats. We do not see this with independents. Would you urge private citizens not to patrol polling places?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Well, you picked the words, Margaret.

I would say that it is Republicans, Democrats, independents. All American citizens are very acutely aware, as your previous guest just mentioned, about our election process. I think this is going to be a very good election, because people are awake. They're paying attention.

They should volunteer as poll watchers. It's a state-based system. Whatever your state requires and allows, you should definitely be involved. And I think it's going to help the process.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to be abundantly clear, poll watching is different than voter intimidation, which is unlawful.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Nobody should be intimidated when they're exercising their most precious right to vote.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when you see video, as we have seen in a place like in Arizona, where you see individuals with tactical gear, where you see individuals with weapons outside drop boxes, where -- how do you classify that?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Again, no one should feel intimidated when they're exercising their right to vote.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That is intimidating?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: You've got -- you've got stories on both sides of the aisle. You have got stories in many different states about how people have felt as though their right was infringed on.

I think cooler heads need to prevail.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: I really think we're going to have a good election. I think you've got 15-million plus that have already participated in early voting across this country.

I think you're going to have a big turnout in nine days from now on the election. And I think, again, Republicans, Democrats and others are well aware of the issues that we had during COVID. People were stepping up and trying to do things to make sure we were protected and safe, but they were adjusting election laws on the fly.

I think a lot of that has been resolved. I think you're going to see a really good experience in nine days.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So you would urge citizens not to patrol polling places?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Again, I urge everyone, get involved.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Whatever your state allows, get involved. Volunteer.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I need...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Exactly what your...

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... your previous guest said.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because I want to ask...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Be part of the process.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because, in this bulletin, it also talks about a linkage in drawing and -- and undermining confidence in elections because of 2020.

And you are on this list that we have of 307 Republicans running for office who have raised doubts about the integrity of the election. I mean, they're drawing a direct line here between sowing distrust then and what we are seeing right now.

Do you regret sowing doubts yourself?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: I -- what you're referring to, I have never sowed doubts about the election. I have definitely raised questions.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But you signed onto this Texas amicus brief...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Absolutely. Let's talk about that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: ... that went to the Supreme Court to overturn it.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: What it said was -- Margaret, what that -- what that said, that amicus brief, is that a lot of people, governors, attorneys general, secretaries of state, took unilateral action during COVID, changing...

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... changing the election laws themselves.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you don't regret these...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Again, if I could finish -- changing election laws themselves to try and make sure that we were safe while we exercised our right to vote.

That particular amicus brief, all it said was that we need to reaffirm that state legislatures, and legislatures alone, make their election laws. So, as we go forward, once we're out of COVID, we have to...

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... go back to that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, to be clear, you don't consider yourself an election denier?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Absolutely not.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And Joe Biden is the legitimately elected...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: We -- we...

MARGARET BRENNAN: ... president of United States of America?

(LAUGHTER)

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: He's sworn. He's serving. He is the president of the United States.

MARGARET BRENNAN: He is the president of the United States. But you stand by...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: And we've got an election in nine days. We've got an election in nine days that we've been working on for the last two years.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: You reported in the in -- intro that eight out of ten Americans in that same poll that you're referring to are concerned with where this country is. They say it's out of control.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you're not undermining...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: If you look, eight out of 10...

MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not meaning to undermine confidence in the 2020 election with your comments here?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Eight out of ten Americans right now think we're on the wrong track. That's what they're going to be voting on in nine days.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I know.

And I would love to talk about something other than people being worried for their lives. But, unfortunately, that's where we are.

I want to ask you about this when it comes to political violence. On your Twitter feed, you posted this video we're going to show just a few days ago where you're firing a gun, and it says: ""Enjoyed exercising my Second Amendment rights. #FirePelosi.""

Why is there a gun in a political ad at all?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: It wasn't an ad. I was -- I was tweeting out -- I was tweeting out something that I had just done.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Hashtag -- or a tweet -- hashtag #FirePelosi, with a weapon.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Well, now you're...

MARGARET BRENNAN: Wouldn't a pink slip be more fitting, if it's about firing her?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: It's interesting, Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Why a gun?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: It's interesting, Margaret, that we're talking about this, this morning, when, a couple of years back, when a Bernie Sanders supporter shot Steve Scalise...

MARGARET BRENNAN: Which was horrendous and horrific...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... when a Bernie Sanders supporter...

MARGARET BRENNAN: ... which is why we should be not...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... shot Steve Scalise...

MARGARET BRENNAN: ... be putting weapons...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... I never heard you or anyone else in the media trying to blame Democrats for what happened.

We need to stay focused on what we're all doing...

MARGARET BRENNAN: We did extensive coverage of what happened to Steve Scalise.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Excuse me?

MARGARET BRENNAN: There was extensive coverage, sir.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: But nobody tried to equate Democrats' rhetoric, people that say...

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm not talking about your rhetoric. I'm talking about what you posted.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: It's the same.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You're shooting a gun. Our viewers just saw it.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Yeah, right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Hashtag #FirePelosi.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Exercising our Second Amendment rights, having fun...

MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not a debate about the Second Amendment.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... shooting a gun. Yeah.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not a debate about the Second Amendment.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Yes, it is.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Hashtag #FirePelosi.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Yes, it is.

I -- I'm running the campaign operation.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you not understand that that is suggestive to people who are in a bad state, and, in this current environment, how risky it is? As you're talking about...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Well, I disagree, Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: ... the importance of lowering the rhetoric...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: I disagree with you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: ... why do you leave that up?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Again, I never saw anyone after Steve Scalise was shot by a...

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm talking about right now...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... Bernie Sanders supporter...

MARGARET BRENNAN: ... what just is happening right now.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: .. trying to equate -- equate Democrat rhetoric with those actions. Please don't do that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

Looking at your candidates, Republican candidates have spent more than $116 million on ads that mentioned Speaker Pelosi by name in their cycle. If this is about the issues, why shouldn't make it about the issues? Why not depersonalize it?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: It is absolutely about the issues. It's about the fact that we have double-digit inflation...

MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think...

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... exploding -- exploding cost of living. We've got a crime wave across this country that is a direct result -- is the direct result...

MARGARET BRENNAN: In this moment -- we are eight days out -- don't you think this needs to change?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Again...

MARGARET BRENNAN: Why not pull some of these ads? Why not just delete your tweet?

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Well, I'm sure -- I'm sure people would like to talk about anything but what the Democrats have done to this country, which, quite frankly, is exploding cost of living, a crime wave in our major cities that is the result of this defund the police nonsense and cashless bail.

I mean, you look at New York City, where you put someone in jail at 9:00 p.m. for assaulting someone on the street and they're back out on the street at 9:00 a.m. committing crimes again. You look at my state of Minnesota, Minneapolis, it's had 6,000 assaults since the beginning of the year, Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Those are the issues that are top of mind for every voter in this country.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: That's why they're going to show up in -- on the -- on November 8.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.

REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: And that's why Republicans are going to win in the midterms.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what our projections are showing.

But I would suggest more pink slips, fewer weapons in our ads in this environment.

Sir, thank you for joining us.

Face the Nation will be right back. Stay with us.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by David Becker. He is CBS News election law contributor.

David, welcome back here.

We just had that conversation about the environment that we are in right now. I know you have been raising concerns for a while about many of your colleagues, people you know who serve as election workers, who are fearful about what's to come.

What are you hearing?

DAVID BECKER: Yes, I mean, they have been suffering for two years now abuse, threats and harassment not only directed at them and their staffs, but their families, their children in some cases. It seems like election deniers do want to create an environment of fear.

I think they want election officials to be scared. And they want voters to be scared, to some degree. I think it's also really remarkable that voters have responded with over 20 million of them voting already. We have 1.6 million of them having already voted in Georgia alone.

The environment is really scary right now for a lot. I mean, we see that from the polling. We see that from what Scott was just talking about earlier as well.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And these are people in your community that you know.

DAVID BECKER: Yes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: This isn't big, bad Washington.

DAVID BECKER: No.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

DAVID BECKER: I talk to election officials regularly. I was talking to an election official in Florida just last night who was dealing with an issue at a polling place.

I talk to election officials in Arizona, including those issues that we have seen in Maricopa County, Arizona. Important to note that...

MARGARET BRENNAN: Those men in the tactical gear that we were just talking about.

DAVID BECKER: Right, at a couple of...

MARGARET BRENNAN: ... that a federal -- federal judge says is their -- is permitted.

DAVID BECKER: Right, yes, at least for now.

It's been appealed to the Ninth Circuit, and it will be heard next week. So, we will see if that is still the case. Under federal law, there are multiple statutes that prohibit voter intimidation or attempted voter intimidation.

And I can tell you, as a former lawyer who used to serve in the Department of Justice, that videotaping or photographing voters against their will, following them, that has been the kind of activity that the DOJ has viewed as intimidating in the past.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to make a very clear distinction here, because we were talking about with Congressman Emmer the call for people -- and you have heard it from the head of the RNC -- to come and watch voting occur.

That is not illegal.

DAVID BECKER: No, it's not only not illegal.

Properly trained poll watching by both parties is a really good thing. Extreme transparency is something that's practiced by election officials all over the country. They want people to come in and see what they're doing. That is a really good thing. But they serve as flies on the wall. If they see a problem, they're supposed to report it to the proper authorities.

When we see vigilantes -- and this is only happening in a few places -- start to take matters into their own hands, those people are not properly trained. But people who want to volunteer to be poll workers working for the actual election jurisdiction, more poll watchers working for their campaigns or their political parties, as long as they're well-trained, that's a really good part of the process.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. But voter intimidation is unlawful.

DAVID BECKER: That's right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You -- we were looking in our research here at that the AP has a report saying the most litigation ever fired -- filed before an election is happening right now, most of those lawsuits by Republicans.

What does that signal to you?

DAVID BECKER: Well, I think people are very attuned to what's going on with the election process. That's not necessarily a bad thing.

We're also seeing efforts to change rules in red areas as well, things to install hand counting of ballots, which is a really bad idea, really comes up with inaccurate counts, takes a lot longer, breeds more concern about the process. A county called Nye County in Nevada is doing that.

But resolving these kinds of disputes before the election is a good thing. So, if we're having a lot of litigation, it's important for everyone to know the rules by election night.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

DAVID BECKER: It's not OK to question those rules after the election. You mentioned that Texas lawsuit that came in December 2020.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

DAVID BECKER: That was a perfect example of that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you very much, David Becker.

DAVID BECKER: Thank you, Margaret.

And we will be seeing a lot more of you, I know, in the coming days and weeks.

We will be right back.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.

We go now to the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, that's New York Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney.

Good morning to you.

REP. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY (D-NY) (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair): Good morning.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start where we just left off with our other guests. How concerned are you about the risk of political violence? And can you say, unequivocally, that you and your fellow Democrats will accept the outcome of your elections?

SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: Of course, we'll accept the outcome of the elections. Always have. Always will.

And - and we're very concerned about the integrity of our elections, especially when people are trying to intimidate people with weapons, when they're engaged in these tactics to try to undermine confidence.

Now, we're - we're going to accept the results of the election. That's - that's the American way.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm glad you said that because there's been a lot of attention drawn to comments by some Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, who just released a taped statement online where she was talking about upcoming elections and she said, right-wing extremists already have a plan to literally steal the next presidential election and they're not making a secret of it.

I understand hyperbole, but would you agree that that's not helpful in the current environment to talk about plots to steal elections?

SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: Yes, no, I don't understand what that means and I didn't see the comment.

Let me - let me tell you what I think. What I think is that it's perfectly legitimate for both parties to make sure that voting is fair, that there's no fraud, that when votes are cast, that the people have a right to cast them or don't. And that's normal. And in a close election, you might have a recount, you might have other examination of absentee ballots. That's all run of the mill stuff.

What's different is people showing up with weapons and sitting in the back of a pickup truck next to a drop box trying to scare the tar out of people who are just exercising their vote.

What's different is when a president, for the first time in our history, says he was cheated out of the result when he knows that's a lie. So, let's -- let's not - let's not - let's not pretend for a minute that both sides have the same - same amount of accountability for - for the loss of confidence in our elections. One side has been out there for a couple of years now doing everything they can to pretend Joe Biden didn't win fair and square when he did. And that's the difference.

MARGARET BRENNAN: On that topic, Democrats shelled out about $53 million to support 13 Republican candidates during the primaries. I know you're part of strategy here and the strategy was to elevate less electable Republicans in order to benefit Democrats. And some of this worked for you, but in at least two races these guys have realistic shots at victory. I'm looking at John Gibbs in Michigan, for example.

Do you take responsibility for helping election deniers?

SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: Well, at the DCCC, there's only one race in the country, one, where we - where we engage in the - in the tactic you're talking about. And what we did was we ran an ad that's true that said he's too extreme for western Michigan. And we ran that general election ad about two weeks early. And Hillary Scholten has been beating him consistently since she became our nominee. She's a strong pro-choice Democrat. He's a nut.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you stand by the strategy?

SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: And she's going to -- and she's going to beat him.

What I can tell you is that, in a budget of $340 million, we spent about $400,000 running a true general election commercial two weeks early calling John Gibbs an extremist, which he is. And - and that's all you're talking about.

Now, I can't be -- I - I can't answer to what governors did or what senators did or what other people did. But the committee I ran, in a budget of $300 million, put $400,000 into speeding up a general election ad that was truthful.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: And we're going to win that race.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The top three issues when we talk to voters that they tell us they're concerned about are economy, inflation and crime. Half of voters, according to our poll, think Democrats would cut police funding. Now, I saw an ad the DCCC just bought in your district, and it opens with you talking to a policeman. You are keenly aware of this. Why hasn't your party been able to shake that perception of being soft on crime?

SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: Well, because a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth gets its shoes on, as the saying goes. In my own case, I brought $7 million for local police departments, supported the Invest to Protect Act, which will fund all the police departments in my district, all under 125 officers. That's the most important support we've done for police in 30 years.

And if you care about rising crime, my goodness, we should listen to police who are begging us to do something about the gun violence, which is at the heart of so much rise in crime. And, of course, the MAGA crowd is in the pocket of the NRA and won't touch common sense (ph) bipartisan gun safety legislation, which we passed through the House.

So, we have a record of results supporting good policing and - and - and going after gun violence. And that's what people need to know.

MARGARET BRENNAN: In our poll, 46 percent of voters believe Republicans' economic policies will help them. Only 40 percent say the same about Democrats. Fifty-three percent of voters believe gas prices will go up under Democrats. Twenty-one percent say the same of the - of the GOP. I mean, since you're talking strategy here, in these closing days, how do you change these perceptions and how do you get out younger voters?

SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: Right. Well, what people need to know is that we have a plan for cheaper gas, cheaper groceries, cheaper housing, cheaper health care. We have a plan for safer streets, supporting good policing and attacking gun violence, which is so much of the problem, and supporting our freedoms, our reproductive freedoms and our voting rights. And that's a -- those are real plans.

Now, you can take a poll and you can - you can take a snapshot at any given time. But, of course, your former guest had no plan for the economy. They have no plan for gun violence. They have no plan to move our country forward, protecting voting rights, protecting reproductive freedoms. So -- so what I would say is, don't punish the people who are fixing your problems and don't reward the people who are trying to exploit the problems for their own political power. That's really the difference right now. We're - we're engaged in the hard work of bringing our country forward. The other side's working on their own power.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time this morning.

We'll be right back.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look at some of our battleground tracker findings and the issues that are setting the mood in America in these final days of campaign '22.

Mark Strassmann reports from Los Angeles.

(BEGIN VT)

MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): America's zeitgeist, vulnerability, like this home invasion hammer attack on a politician's 82-year-old spouse, reinforcing we're an anxious, often resentful bunch heading into midterms.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now with Joe Biden, there's a big thumb on top of you where you can't enjoy yourself.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just need to see some peace. And I think the only way to do this is voting.

MARK STRASSMANN: The economy, especially inflation, indisputably top of mind in voter anxiety.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The cost of groceries are outrageous. Utilities are outrageous. It keeps going up.

MARK STRASSMANN (on camera): And gas prices. Look at these in Los Angeles, right at $7 a gallon for regular. That would be nightmarish in most of the country. But here in L.A., prices have actually been coming down in the last couple weeks.

MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): In our latest CBS News poll of registered voters, a majority blame President Biden and the Democrats for the economy and gas prices. The president fighting that perception.

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Unemployment is not 6.5 but 3.5 percent, the lowest it's been in 50 years.

MARK STRASSMANN: Republicans see inflation numbers and smell blood.

SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Not just a red wave, but a red tsunami.

MARK STRASSMANN: Crime is another voter worry, like last week's deadly school shooting in St. Louis, the 40th this year involving injuries or deaths. In major cities, murder rates and shootings, both down slightly, but from a 30 percent spike two years ago. Our poll shows Republicans have a double-digit lead on crime policies to make you feel safer.

But American voters want this election cycle of leadership to confront other challenges. Immigration, an infectious dies trifecta, Covid, the flu and RSV, gun policy and abortion in a post-Roe America. Our poll says a majority of voters think Republicans will pass a national abortion ban.

Another worry, culture wars invading the classroom and performance that's plummeting. It's one more challenge calling out for grownup intervention as millions of Americans now vote for their idea of a grownup, knowing that whoever wins, half the country will resent it, again.

(END VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann reporting from Los Angeles.

Our new CBS News battleground tracker poll shows Republicans still have an edge in the race for control of the House. CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto is here.

Anthony, tell us more.

ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret.

You know, we've been talking to voters throughout this campaign in all the congressional districts. Right now our latest CBS News estimate is that the Republicans lead in 228 districts. That is enough to take the House majority.

Now, there is a range around these estimates. Let me show you the political implications here. They really center around turnout. You might ask, do Democrats have any chance to hang on, even to a slim House majority? The answer to that starts with the possibility that they'd get bigger turnout from younger voters. If voters show up the way they did in, say, 2018, that could get the Democrats a little bit closer, make the House effectively even. The trouble for them is, we have not seen strong indications that that is going to happen.

The more likely scenario is that Republicans, who do have an express turnout advantage, more motivation, more enthusiasm so far, if their turnout advantage grows, we plug that into the model and that would get the Republicans up to 238 seats, a slightly larger majority.

Now, in any case, we're looking at a seat gain here for the Republicans that's about or even below average for a party out of power. You might ask why that is, especially given the concerns about the state of the country and the state of the economy.

Let me show you a split that I think tells a lot of the tale.

I asked people, which concerns you more, whether or not the U.S. is going to have a functioning democracy or whether it's going to have a strong economy? And the results are somewhat split. But look at the voting differences here. Those who are more concerned about functioning of democracy, voting for Democrats. Those more concerned about the strong economy, voting for Republicans. And I think that defines the way that voters see the very large stakes here and the way the parties are expressing those stakes, which is partly why this race is so locked in.

Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you.

And we'll be right back.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: For more now we turn to our political panel.

Amy Walter, publisher and editor-in-chief of ""The Cook Political Report,"" senior White House and political correspondent, Ed O'Keefe is here, and Nick Timiraos, chief economic correspondent for ""The Wall Street Journal"" is also at the table.

Good morning to all of you.

AMY WALTER (Publisher and editor-in chief, ""Cook Political Report with Amy Walter""): Good morning.

NICK TIMIRAOS (Chief economic correspondent, ""The Wall Street Journal): Hi.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Amy, we just heard Anthony's scenario here. This is not a red wave, but it is a Republican majority. Does it match with what you're seeing?

AMY WALTER: Yes. I think the way that Anthony pointed it out is a very smart way of thinking about this.

You know, elections -- normally midterm elections, the challenge for the in-party usually is that their own side doesn't turn out. And that's where the other side is much more motivated. And when you see those big, big gains, like we saw say in 1994 or 2010 on the part of Republicans. This year we're seeing that Republicans and Democrats are motivated. Republicans a little bit more. But Democrats feel pretty good that they're at least getting more of their base turned out. Now, young voters being always a challenge for Democrats.

But, look, I think what happened over the course of the summer is that the issues surrounding abortion rights, plus the focus on Donald Trump, January 6th, and, quite frankly, a little better of an economic picture gave some boost of enthusiasm to Democrats and got them energized in terms of the voters, more energized to turn out. But it feels as if that has pretty much stalled. That it hit this point and it hasn't really gone much further. And, instead, where the focus is now, it's no longer as much about abortion or Donald Trump, and much more about the things that Anthony pointed out, which is the economy, gas prices and people feeling, quite frankly, pretty stuck.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And we frame this as, you know, sort of a choice with (INAUDIBLE). And - and, Ed, in some of these recent politic ads, I'm thinking about in Maloney's district, I was just watching one, they're changing the focus to be about extremism.

ED O'KEEFE: Yes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So not even talking about the affirmative case, but fear the other side.

ED O'KEEFE: Right. Not - and not only in the realm of democracy and - and those concerns, but in the realm of abortion rights and - and Social Security and Medicare being ripped up or rethought.

I watched Maloney this week actually make that exact argument to a bunch of seniors in assisted living facilities. He said, if you don't think they might come after your Social Security and Medicare, look what they just did to abortion rights after 50 years of threatening to do it. So that's kind of a way to make both arguments at the same time but not make an exclusive (ph) abortion argument. And that's the kind of pivoting that they've done here, now realizing that abortion isn't as urgent an issue.

Part of the reason one Republican I talked to this week said, look, you go look at mothers across the country who may be concerned about abortion rights, but they're not necessarily bumping up against the issue of abortion rights every day, they're bumping up against the fact that beef is costing three times as much as it did before.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

ED O'KEEFE: And those more urgent economic issues may be what's drawing people back over to the Republican side.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

I want to come back to the issue of abortion in a second.

But, Nick, can you pick up on this because our poll shows 69 percent of voters describe the condition of the national economy as bad. Only 27 percent say it's good.

You've got a piece saying -- out in ""The Journal"" saying basically American consumers are doing pretty well.

NICK TIMIRAOS: Yes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why don't they feel that way?

NICK TIMIRAOS: Yes, that's a great question, Margaret. You know, the issue here is that if you look at the labor market, 3.5 percent unemployment rate, what's not to like about that? But if you look at, you know, what's happening with wages, they are not keeping up with prices. We had another report Friday that shows that Americans' wages are not keeping up with prices. And so those are real income cuts. Nobody likes that. You drive by the gas station, you see how expensive gas is and you look at what's happening right now with interest rates, they've gone up a lot this year. Mortgage rates this week are above 7 percent for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. We haven't seen that since 2001.

So, yes, on paper, you know, there are things you can point to that look great, but people just don't feel great about it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And we have this Fed meeting in the coming days. What are the conversations inside the Federal Reserve right now about when inflation gets better and what they plan to do?

NICK TIMIRAOS: Well, the problem for the Fed is that monetary policy takes time. It acts with a delay on the economy. So, you can't see your moves right away.

The Fed, this year, has raised interest rates as the fastest pace since the 1980s. Normally they raise rates by a quarter point every six weeks or so. This year they've been going at three-quarters of a percentage point. And when you don't have time to see how that influences the economy, it's like barreling down the highway but using the rearview mirror to guide where you're going. It raises the risk that you're going to drive off the road.

And the problem here for the Fed is, they can't take a risk of not getting on top of this inflation because even though the risk of doing too much is a recession, the risk of not doing enough is that inflation just stays high and you have to have a bigger downturn later.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And, I mean, those are the details of it. That is monetary policy. What is it that - that Republicans are actually arguing, Ed, they can do because, really, the reality is, their hands are pretty tied here.

ED O'KEEFE: They are. I - you know, if you read their websites, if you listen to what they say -

MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE).

ED O'KEEFE: They want to cut government spending and, in some cases, they want to see implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure bill that either they voted for and they don't want to admit that will help their districts even if they voted against it. And I -

AMY WALTER: Yes, I mean -

ED O'KEEFE: Go ahead.

AMY WALTER: Well, and that's the bottom line, when you're in charge, and things are going well, you get the credit, a lot of which you don't deserve. When you're in charge and things aren't going well, you get the blame, even if you don't' deserve all of it. And when you're the out party, you get the benefit of the doubt because voters are saying, well, I don't know, if Ed can really fix this, but these folks who are in charge, they're not doing a very good job. Let's just - let's just put it -- let's just give them a shot, which is why Democrats are doing the extremism thing.

If people are upset with the status quo, which they clearly are, Democrats' only chance to hold on, especially in some of these Senate races, is to say, the bigger risk is taking a risk on the other side. Staying with the status quo you don't like is uncomfortable but not as bad.

ED O'KEEFE: And the other ironic thing, a lot - much like the Fed, the - the problem for the Biden administration and Democrats is a lot of their accomplishments are going to take time to be implemented.

AMY WALTER: Right. That's right.

ED O'KEEFE: The Medicare price cuts don't kick in until next year.

AMY WALTER: That's right.

ED O'KEEFE: The bridge isn't getting rebuilt until early 2024.

AMY WALTER: Right.

ED O'KEEFE: So they can talk about all these things in the abstract, but the voter can't see it yet.

AMY WALTER: That's right. That's right.

ED O'KEEFE: The president may know, come my re-election, if I'm running in 2024, people will see what I did -

AMY WALTER: That's right.

ED O'KEEFE: But I -- they won't be able to see it before November 8th.

MARGARET BRENNAN: It's also kind of hard sometimes to message around market forces.

ED O'KEEFE: Right. Kind of?

MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, an - an energy analyst that I - that I speak to was pointing out, you know, Ron Klein, the chief of staff to the president, tweets almost daily about the price of gas. He's like, why are they trying to own something they cannot control?

ED O'KEEFE: That is a question that the White House chief of staff is going to have to answer for. And not only is -- why are they tweeting about something that they can't control, why is he tweeting so much to begin with every morning about this and other issues when he, perhaps, should be running the White House? I've heard this from Democrats. I think we'll hear it a lot more from Democrats after the elections if it goes south for them.

It is an obsession for them because they know it is the psychological and the sort of data barometer that we've all used to measure inflation and the discussion about the economy. But, yes, it is something completely out of their control. And perhaps by doing that it's -- as that energy analyst noted, it may have drawn too much attention to the president and allows him to take more of the blame.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Nick, in ""The Journal,"" a survey of economists putting the probability of recession over the next 12 months as 63 percent. So, that is the Congress that Republicans would be walking in to control.

NICK TIMIRAOS: Yes. And the issue here is, the economy is slowing. We knew it was going to slow because we had a boom last year. But if it doesn't slow enough, if consumers keep spending the savings that they've accrued during the pandemic, then that just means the Fed is going to come in and raise interest rates more. You know, this week we're going to get close to 4 percent on the policy rate that the Fed sets, but we could go closer to 5 percent next year. And, you know, there's a - there's a Fed chairman who used to say that it was the Fed's job to take the punch bowl away as the party was getting started. And that's what you're seeing this year.

But if consumers keep spending money, we had very solid earnings reports this past week from United, Visa, Coca-Cola, if consumers keep spending, then Jay Powell is going to get on the phone and call the cops and say, we've got to get the noise volume down here. We've got - we've got to get these people to go home because this is just not sustainable to have inflation continuing to run higher and higher and higher.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And that's hard to explain sometimes that like things -- some things are going to get more expensive by design. It's going to get more expensive for you to borrow money because of what's happening.

NICK TIMIRAOS: Right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming back to the issue of abortion, Amy and Ed. I think it's interesting that the dynamic seems to have changed on this in terms of bringing out voters. You were saying, Ed, that people feel inflation, perhaps, is a more immediate crisis than abortion access.

I wonder, Amy, because it's so different state by state.

AMY WALTER: Right. That's what we're -

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that it?

AMY WALTER: It's quite interesting actually. Where we're seeing Democratic -- especially candidates for the House, having the most trouble is actually in blue states, like Oregon, California, places where the issue of abortion is pretty well settled. These are Democratic-run states. They're - the -- it's not an existential question --

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the state has already codified it?

AMY WALTER: Because the state has either codified or it's Democratic and the governors' candidates have all pledged to go forward in that way.

It's the red and purple states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, where we know that this issue is not settled and where, in Michigan, of course, they have a ballot initiative, as well as a governor's race. You have governor races in those other states. So, there's much more of a - of a friction there, right, about the decision being determined by your vote this November that's not as apparent in some of these blue states.

ED O'KEEFE: Yes. And the fact that they have to run into New York, Oregon, the president's going to New Mexico this week.

AMY WALTER: Right.

ED O'KEEFE: It all speaks to the fact that perhaps they may have miscalculated how abortion would work in those states and how much money Republicans have to spend right now in the closing weeks to really put a bunch of Democrats on the ropes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

Good to have all three of you here. Thank you very much.

And that's going to do it for us here at FACE THE NATION today. Thank you for watching. And tune in next Tuesday, Election Day. I can't believe that. Wow.

AMY WALTER: I can't believe you just said that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And night, starting at 5:00 p.m. on our streaming network with a special edition of ""Red and Blue."" And we'll be on both the broadcasts and streaming networks starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time through the night and into the morning.

“I think there needs to be clearer definition of who holds what first, and why, and all those types of things and then establish the regulatory framework around it.”

Wesfarmers chairman Michael Chaney said on Thursday at the annual general meeting that cybersecurity was a huge issue facing corporate Australia.

“The recent attacks have focused everyone’s attention, I think, as a result, we’re renewing our efforts where we’re looking further at the question of what sort of information we hold, and how long we need to hold it,” he said.

Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott confirmed after the AGM that across its retail operations, which includes Bunnings and Kmart, they do not store a lot of highly sensitive personal identity information, but rather transaction data like emails and mobile numbers.

“We think you should only take the data that you need, and only store it for as long as you have to,” he said.

Cybersecurity company Imperva has found cyberattacks against Australian retailers are on the rise because the country is viewed as a lucrative market for criminal activity with the pandemic accelerating online commerce.

Imperva’s Tony Mascarenhas said the most heavily targeted industries in Australia are financial, retail, and business services.

“Certainly, there’s a lot more consumption of dollars transacted online,” he said. “There is a lot of buy now, pay later in Australia that is attracting the bad guys if you like too, because they see opportunity at the end of the day.”

Mr Mascarenhas said increasingly companies saw data as valuable assets that they could monetise, so they were holding on to the data for much longer.

“You monetise data via APIs (application programming interfaces). Keeping track of your APIs is really hard,” he said.

He added it was vital that companies monitored the data, which in case of a breach, allowed companies to understand what records might have been stolen.

Mr Mascarenhas said as retailers entered the pivotal holiday season and security incidents rose, breaches were a threat to business operations and damaged consumer trust, which ultimately affected the retailer’s bottom line.

“Retailers really need to be reviewing the cyber defence controls for both the commerce applications and mobile apps they have and do some fine-tuning,” he said.

Mr Mascarenhas pointed to a sharp rise in account takeover attacks, a form of online fraud in which cybercriminals attempt to compromise online accounts by using stolen passwords and usernames.

In the peak shopping period of October to December last year, account takeover attacks increased fourfold compared with the previous quarter, according to Imperva data.",cybersecurity,australian financial review

Teladoc Health reports Q3 results: revenue up 17%, EPS –$0.45 versus –$0.53, beating Wall Street expectations for both.

TDOC share price moved up on the news, although it remains down by 81% in the past 12 months. The company’s market cap is under $5 billion versus its all-time high of $45 billion in early 2021.

The company reports strong performance of its direct-to-consumer BetterHelp mental health business. It says it lost a former client of Livongo, which Teladoc acquired for $18.5 billion in October 2020.

Teladoc says that it is getting increased interest from organizations who want to use virtual health to manage chronic conditions at a lower cost.

From Lomond: “Re: Cerner. Which of its missteps led to its sale to Oracle?” Cerner struggled with product issues (such as revenue cycle), dated architecture, and a client base that was being constantly poached by Epic. Multi-billion dollar federal contracts stretching over decades weren’t enough to keep investors excited. However, Cerner’s biggest mistakes were made by its board, who took forever to choose a successor when Neal Patterson died in 2017 despite the claimed existence of a CEO succession plan, which surely didn’t tell board members to, “Hire a low-profile CEO of a division of a foreign medical device manufacturer for his first real CEO job.” But to be fair, a lot of Cerner executives who should have been likely candidates, especially those who Neal didn’t like much, had already successfully moved on. Brent Shafer’s four years were forgettable except for the board’s capitulation to an activist investor, then the board hired as Shafer’s replacement yet another executive who had never run a publicly traded company, although maybe David Feinberg made Cerner look hipper to eventual acquirer Oracle in his fantastically lucrative few weeks as CEO. Looking ahead, I can’t think of many examples where acquired health IT companies got better running as divisions of unrelated companies whose own growth prospects were questionable, but Oracle is saying and doing all the right things so far. Boards have a fiduciary responsibility to investors and I think they chose the best available option in this case. It’s all great news for Epic, which at some point will have its own CEO succession plan tested in the same way.

HIStalk Announcements and Requests

Two-thirds of poll respondents had paid their co-pay by the time they left their ambulatory visit. My personal experience is that medical practices and clinics are much worse at upfront collection than dental practices, which always seem to know exactly how much you need to pay after insurance and nicely ask for that payment while you’re taking possession of your free toothbrush kit.

New poll to your right or here: In the past year, has a provider given you a blank paper or electronic form that asks for information they should already have on file? It is aggravating when the front desk people of a provider that you’ve been seeing all along ask for the same information that they have already collected – medical history, allergies, meds list, emergency contact, etc. – instead of populating the form and allowing you to provide any corrections or updates. Will someone actually update your EHR information correctly if your new list of allergies or meds doesn’t match what is on file? If not, are you completing the form just so the provider doesn’t have to look at the EHR?

I watched Netflix’s movie “The Good Nurse” and it was a so-so yarn about nurse Charles Cullen, who killed dozens or hundreds of hospital patients using drugs like digoxin and insulin that he obtained by taking advantage of a quirk in the Pyxis drug dispensing machine. The hospital’s stonewalling of the police investigation was a big part of the movie, but what should have been mentioned was that many hospitals were irresponsibly using Pyxis like candy machines in the early 2000s, allowing nurses to make withdrawals of unordered meds, storing drugs in shared drawers (Cullen punched in Tylenol, then took digoxin from the same shared drawer), and failing to audit what was taken versus what was charted as given. i wrote a daily report ago for my academic medical center employer years ago that identified Pyxis withdrawals of unordered meds (including logic to account for delayed order entry), and it was so lengthy that nobody would review it. Anyway, the movie recalls the 2017 case of VUMC nurse Rhonda Vaught, who overrode a drug dispensing machine safeguard to give a patient the paralyzing drug vecuronium instead of the ordered sedative Versed, after which the patient died. San Diego-based Pyxis went public in 1992, sold to Cardinal Health for $867 million in 1996, was spun off with other products into Carefusion in 2009, and then was acquired by Becton Dickinson in 2014 for $12 billion.

146,Annual tech gathering takes aim at crypto,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2022/guests-include-speaker.jpg,30/10/2022,"One of the world's biggest technology get-togethers kicks off in the Portuguese capital on Tuesday, with organizers saying a key aim is to ask tough questions about cryptocurrencies.",https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-annual-tech-aim-crypto.html,"Guests include speakers as varied as linguist Noam Chomsky and champion boxer Oleksander Usyk.

One of the world's biggest technology get-togethers kicks off in the Portuguese capital on Tuesday, with organizers saying a key aim is to ask tough questions about cryptocurrencies.

Around 100,000 people are expected to gather in Lisbon for the four-day Web Summit and related events, the first full-scale edition since 2019 following the disruption of the pandemic.

The conference attempts to bring together start-ups, investors, business leaders and agenda-broadening speakers –- linguist Noam Chomsky and heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk are among this year's lineup.

Several of the prime slots, though, are taken by cryptocurrency specialists led by Changpeng Zhao, boss of crypto exchange Binance.

And plenty of companies present—from start-ups to billion-dollar behemoths Yuga Labs and OpenSea—are promoting the technology that fans claim will be the future of the web, gaming and ultimately the entire financial system.

But crypto has so far been derided as a tool to generate investment bubbles, hide illicit wealth and enable scams.

Conference organizer Paddy Cosgrave told AFP there were ""a lot of questions to be answered"" about crypto, describing it as ""largely smoke and mirrors"".

""We've done our best to persuade many of the leading lights in the space to come, and some of them will get a bit of a kicking on stage, we'll see how that goes,"" he added.

Crypto skeptics including actor Ben McKenzie (Gotham, The O.C.) have also been given slots.

Organizers said the event's 70,000 tickets had sold out, with Cosgrave reckoning some 30,000 more people would be in Lisbon for side events.

Whistleblower focus

Zhao's company is the dominant player in the crypto sector, but it has been repeatedly accused of trying to dodge regulatory scrutiny—claims the company has denied.

And it became embroiled in one of the biggest stories of the week, with a $500-million investment to back Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter.

But the wider crypto sector is struggling with plunging values and flatlining interest from the public.

And the tech industry as a whole is also struggling with supply chain problems, trade disputes between the US and China, and economic volatility that has sent investors fleeing.

Cosgrave, though, played down any suggestion that conferences like his had a role in helping to stimulate investment or turn around the fortunes of the sector.

""It's not really about the establishment or the dominant companies of today,"" he said.

""It's a gathering of companies that in the future may play some significant role.""

As usual, though, the Web Summit will host plenty of figures from the dominant companies—Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta will all be there.

But on a lower level than last year, when the conference played host to Facebook's Nick Clegg and to whistleblower Frances Haugen, who accused their company of stoking hatred in return for clicks.

Cosgrave highlighted the event's history of giving a platform to whistleblowers—this year Mark MacGann, who revealed details of Uber's aggressive lobbying, will be giving a talk.

The organizers say more than 1,000 speakers will take part, giving talks on subjects from cybersecurity to artificial intelligence.

You’d be hard-pressed to find a single organization today that isn’t aware of the vital importance of cybersecurity. However, despite their best intentions, many companies out there are still making serious security mistakes — and the consequences can be nothing less than a nightmare

With Halloween just around the corner, let’s take a look at the horrors that plague the world of cybersecurity. Here are five of the top cybersecurity mistakes companies make — and how they can haunt organizations in the long term.

Lack of employee training on security best practices

Cybersecurity training for employees may seem like a no-brainer — something that many companies do at a base level. However, with social engineering and highly sophisticated phishing attacks like whaling and spear phishing on the rise, it’s clear that, more than ever, hackers are attempting to exploit the human aspect of cybersecurity to gain access to companies’ systems. Just look at the recent breach at Uber, in which a hacker used an exhaustion attack to wear down and fool an employee into sharing their login info.

That said, many companies make the mistake of treating cybersecurity training as something they just need to check the box on when, in reality, it needs to be a top priority — as well as a continuous activity. It’s absolutely essential that companies invest in up-to-date cybersecurity training for their employees: Enrolling them immediately upon employment and consistently offering refresher courses with the latest best practices.

Failing to maintain proper IT hygiene

This leads us perfectly to the second mistake companies make: Not ensuring proper IT hygiene throughout their organization. It’s one thing to conduct training for employees, but quite another to make sure that those lessons learned become common practice for everyone. After all, even the best cybersecurity technology and processes can’t prevent the potential damage caused by an employee who uses a weak password or doesn’t update their software regularly.

To prevent these and other human errors, including abusing privileged accounts and not knowing which applications are running or what their configuration is, companies should be checking in to evaluate employees’ IT hygiene throughout their tenures. This helps ensure that they are still implementing cybersecurity best practices in their daily work.

In addition, companies must establish proper security routines and controls, including asset discovery, file integrity management, configuration assessment, regular vulnerability detection and endpoint protection enforcement.

Not consistently evaluating your company’s security posture

Oftentimes, companies establish their cybersecurity controls — then they “set it and forget it.” This is never the right approach. Instead, every organization should be conducting frequent security risk assessments to evaluate where their defenses are strong and where there may be vulnerabilities, whether on the human or technological side.

Only when organizations have a clear picture of their cybersecurity preparedness can they confidently take the right steps to reinforce what they’re already doing right and shore up any weaknesses that need to be addressed.

Again, it’s important to emphasize that this must become a continuous practice. As the security landscape shifts under companies’ feet, it’s equally important that they adapt, remain agile and regularly evaluate their security posture. They must also practice important risk reduction activities, including readiness tests and mock event exercises.

Not knowing where your data assets are used, shared or stored

Data today is more liquid than ever. Between having numerous integrations, partnerships with third-party vendors, and multiple endpoints or devices, it can become extremely complicated extremely quickly for companies to track and manage their data.

Unfortunately, the reality is that many companies simply don’t know where their data lives — even as their attack surface is increasing.

What’s more, as employees continue to work remotely or in hybrid settings, companies face another layer of complexity to keeping data secure. As much as IT and security professionals can set employees up for success, they can’t control if an employee accesses company systems on a personal laptop, or how secure their at-home network may be.

While there’s no one perfect solution to such a complicated problem, it’s absolutely necessary that companies start by regularly monitoring all of their endpoints. This includes laptops, personal computers, physical servers, virtual machines, cloud instances and even cloud-native infrastructure. Together with up-to-date data mapping, this creates a strong first line of defense in the fight for data security, significantly reducing the vulnerabilities that can lead to cyber-attacks.

Treating security as just an IT issue

Cybersecurity is far more than just installing anti-virus software on company computers, and it extends far beyond the realm of the IT department. However, many organizations fail to establish a holistic approach to security.

Creating a true, pervasive culture of cybersecurity requires not only the right technology, but the right policies and processes to back it up. And everyone at the company — from top to bottom — must be responsible and accountable for protecting the company’s data.

That means it’s up to company leaders to set the tone, communicating the vital importance of threat awareness, putting in place effective cybersecurity strategies and providing the right tools and education to keep the company secure. This means not just talking the talk, but walking the walk.

Ultimately, making any of these cybersecurity mistakes can come back to haunt a business, impacting everything from their customers’ personal data to their operations, reputation and bottom line. This is why it’s so important to implement a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy — and then consistently evaluate and improve upon it — to ensure your organization is always one step ahead of would-be attackers.

150,CDR action initiation law response by banks - The Australian Financial Review,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4272%2C$multiply_2%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_122%2C$y_965/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/4f0114b2cd935b3170202b9d8914baf9a43c4bbb,30/10/2022,"Banks say that after watching Optus and Medibank get hacked, their security may not be ready for non-banks to initiate payments under planned new rules.",https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/banks-say-cyber-hacks-demand-caution-on-data-sharing-rules-20221030-p5bu4v,"In the first co-ordinated bank industry response to the flurry of corporate hacks, the ABA says the banks “are significantly concerned about the potential risk implications for consumer and small business data and financial information” if open banking is extended too quickly.

The attack on Optus most likely was due to a vulnerability in an application programming interface (API), the key technology for connecting data sources that banks have built to enable data sharing through open banking.

Action initiation is disruptive to banks as it will reduce their control of payments and allow competitors to switch customers away from their existing banks.

However, banks now fret also that allowing non-banks to get between them and their customers will make banking less secure by reducing the visibility of device data or other customer sources.

Banks told Treasury its draft legislation “appears to open the door to actions carrying high risk, for example payments, while limiting the ability of banks as ‘action service providers’ to address them”.

Need for new security

The consumer data right has been designed as a skeletal system for a data-driven digital economy and creates legal frameworks to govern data movement like it is money.

It should replace customer password-sharing that allows “screen scraping” of data from bank accounts, which is used by financial technology firms and banks alike but lacks security.

But banks warn that the CDR raises different security risks. For example, when a non-bank stands in the place of the customer, banks will lose some visibility, including behavioural data such as the device being used, IP address and time and date of the instruction, the banks argued. These markers are used by banks to reduce fraud and cyber risks.

Banks said they may need more time to develop security solutions specific to the risks posed by CDR actions. They also said the new bill must not force them to comply with any instruction, especially if they have a concern relating to information security.

Treasury is keen for one of the first actions regulated to be payments. (In the UK, payments is one of the main use cases in its open banking regime.) This would mean the CDR competing with payments infrastructure such as the “new payments platform” (NPP), now part of Australian Payments Plus.

Both banks and fintechs want CDR action initiation payment rules to align with payments licences issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Corporation and third-party payment initiation under the NPP.

FinTech Australia, in its submission on the bill, pointed to “significant risk of unnecessary complexity and duplication in the payment ecosystem if service providers must engage with ASIC for a payments licence and the ACCC for CDR accreditation”.

FinTech Australia, which represents 400 fintech start-ups – many of which should benefit from an expanded open banking regime – said although the initial emphasis on payments was appropriate, Treasury should expand actions in the initial roll-out to include product switching. This would create competitive tension for banking products.

Consumers reluctant to share data

It also called for banks to report the results of initiation requests back to fintechs in a standardised format to ensure they could make the customer experience as smooth as possible.

In its submission, the ABA cited research in its submission that fewer than one in five consumers felt comfortable sharing data. It said far fewer would be comfortable with third parties initiating actions on their behalf using shared data, given recent cybersecurity breaches.

“The ABA considers the CDR needs more time to grow naturally, and that increasing functionality at this stage may not result in more customers using the CDR,” said the ABA.

“On the contrary, adding these functionalities without allowing the market a level of stability to enable use case development could impede the development of a competitive market for use cases.”",cybersecurity,australian financial review

152,Why I Can’t Afford to Live Where I Grew Up,https://washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nov-22-Gabby-Birenbaum.jpg,30/10/2022,"I’m a proud daughter of Arlington, Virginia. But its land use policies are keeping homeownership out of reach for natives like me.
The post Why I Can’t Afford to Live Where I Grew Up appeared first on Washington Monthly.",http://washingtonmonthly.com/2022/10/30/arlington-virginia-missing-middle-housing-zoning/,"Growing up in the Lyon Park neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, I knew my house was the place to be. It was conveniently located between Clarendon, our shopping center, and my middle school, which meant that everything I could desire was a walk or a short bike ride away. Across the street from my house was a sledding hill so popular that you had to show up early on snow days to get in some good runs. I absolutely loved the place. My parents became first-time homeowners in 1998 when they bought the house, a four-bedroom, blue-green colonial about half a mile from the Clarendon Metro stop. I was born a few months later in Fairfax County, because Arlington’s hospital wouldn’t take my parents’ insurance (a fact I resent with Leslie Knope-ian fervor), but other than that slight snafu, I grew up a proud resident.

I attended elementary and middle schools ranked among Virginia’s best, with a financially, racially, and ethnically diverse student body. At my middle school’s International Night, where students would bring food that represented their culture, the entire gym would be filled with the enticing smell of pupusas, samosas, and injera. After school, my friends and I would walk or ride our bikes into downtown Clarendon—one of the biggest downtown areas and Metro corridors—to peruse our favorite consignment store, have snowball fights at the park, and get frozen yogurt. (This was, after all, the early 2010s!) It didn’t matter that we were too young to drive. Without having to rely on a ride, I could go to all of my friends’ houses, to parks, stores, and restaurants, and even to downtown Washington, D.C., hopping on the Metro. If I hadn’t been a gangly preteen who thought it was acceptable to wear water sandals to school, my memories would be truly idyllic.

Arlington was an amazing place to grow up, largely because it has rejected the rigid and exclusive aesthetics that give suburbs their notoriety. Its embrace of mixed densities lent it the walkability and diversity that fostered an amazing childhood. Once a sleepy backwater, Arlington County adopted pro-development policies in the years after World War II. As the county’s population exploded along with the size of the federal government, zoning ordinances changed to permit multi-family housing along streetcar corridors and in the areas around federally built apartment villages for defense employees. Arlington’s character as a suburban outlier especially took off after the construction of the D.C. Metro system, during which county officials successfully advocated for the building of two Metro lines to run through its commercial corridors, rather than expand highways. As part of those negotiations, the county struck what housing organizers refer to as a “grand compromise”—permitting high-rise development around the new transit corridors and zoning the areas beyond transit centers, sometimes as close in as a quarter mile, for single families. It’s the perfect example of an anti-sprawl strategy that urban planners refer to as “smart growth.” (Arlington’s Ballston neighborhood, a downtown area only a mile from my childhood home, is even pictured on the term’s Wikipedia page.)

For many of the very NIMBYs who bought their houses when they were more affordable, it’s their own children or grandchildren who are now priced out, because the neighborhood has, above all, gotten more expensive.

I may only be in my 20s, but the county has changed significantly over my lifetime. As a neighbor to D.C. and the home of the Pentagon, Arlington experienced a 20th-century boom that brought with it a transplant population of mostly highly educated federal employees. As the military-industrial complex grew, so did the number of defense contractors stationed in Arlington, including divisions of Boeing, BAE Systems, and a number of specialized cybersecurity and military technology firms. When my parents bought their house in 1998, new homes were still affordable for young couples and families. The neighborhood was mostly populated by retirees from the military or federal agencies. As I was growing up, most of our neighbors were federal employees, consultants, or in the nonprofit sector, with new immigrant families settling in the neighborhoods to the south, where more multifamily complexes are permitted. But in recent years, the growth has gone completely gangbusters. In 2017, Nestlé made Arlington its corporate headquarters; in late 2018, Amazon chose the county as the site of its HQ2. It’s easy to see why: Arlington is now the seventh-wealthiest county in the United States. All of this growth can be seen in the corporate skyscrapers going up in Rosslyn and Ballston, the staid restaurant mainstays replaced by chains, and, above all, the houses getting bigger and more expensive. Just take my parents—they sold their first home in 2016 for more than double its 1998 price. Today, just six years later, its value has gone up another estimated 27 percent. The people moving into our old neighborhood increasingly work in the private sector, and build new, larger houses on the existing lots.

Lingering over the entire situation is the specter of Amazon—literally. In addition to adding a few towers to the landscape, the retail giant is creating a 10.4-acre mega-campus dubbed “PenPlace,” a feasting ground for the architects, developers, and engineers tasked with implementing the company’s grandiose vision. Amazon, for its part, has pledged to contribute $50 million to Arlington’s affordable housing fund—an attempt to offset the displacement from 25,000 new workers earning an average of $150,000. The gesture is certainly welcome, though it most likely won’t prevent a shock to the system in a county already struggling under a housing crisis.

These days, home sales and sizes are constant neighborhood chatter. Every time I visit my parents and walk my dog, I can see the telltale Tyvek building paper, onsite porta-potties, and increasingly enormous frames that indicate a teardown—a large, pricey new house, or even a McMansion, replacing a modest-sized home. The conversations among neighbors always arrive at the same question: How will any of us who were raised in Arlington ever be able to afford it?

Arlington’s housing market—and the fracas over how to solve it—illustrates one part of America’s broader housing shortage.

In a 2021 report, Freddie Mac estimated that the nation has a housing deficit of 3.8 million units. A March report from the Pew Research Center revealed just how tight the market has become; the median U.S. home sale price rose to $440,300 in the second quarter of 2022, up 84 percent from 10 years ago, and 46 percent of renters are now classified as “cost burdened,” meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing.

There’s enormous demand, and limited supply. The shortage is exacerbating homelessness. It’s keeping home-ownership—among the best ways to build generational wealth—unattainable for renters. And it’s deepening inequality between owners, who see their properties continuing to appreciate at historic rates, and those who don’t own.

So why can’t we increase our supply? Put simply, we’ve outlawed density.

Exclusionary zoning has limited where and what kinds of housing can be built and artificially restricted new density in the majority of neighborhoods. Created explicitly to maintain segregation in cities with diverse populations, and then morphing into legally enforceable class-based discrimination, exclusionary zoning concentrates high home values, good public schools, and well-funded amenities in higher-income neighborhoods. In areas zoned for single families, the only type of housing stock permitted is detached homes, a limitation that suppresses density and diversity. And these zoning restrictions come with a formidable army of NIMBYs, who are dead set on ensuring that any new development is “not in my backyard” and whose weapons include plenty of time to spend at city meetings, environmental lawsuits, and an ideological fervor against anything that may change the character of the neighborhood—be it an alley, a condo, or a person of another income level or race.

Thy neighbor’s strife: Homeowners in Arlington, Virginia, do battle with yard signs over whether to allow denser housing.

Meanwhile, neighborhoods have changed. Houses have gotten bigger. McMansions have entered the scene. And for many of the very NIMBYs who bought their houses when they were more affordable, it’s their own children or grandchildren who are now priced out, because the neighborhood has, above all, gotten more expensive. To close the gap, we need more dwellings. And to build those dwellings, we must permit them in places where zoning restrictions have outlawed them.

Arlington is at the forefront of this problem. It is one of the smallest counties in the United States and faces the challenge of housing nearly 240,000 people—with Amazon HQ2 employees on the way—on 26 square miles of land. The county touts itself as a bastion of inclusivity. In several respects, it is. Thus far, there are no abortion bans; Arlington routinely ranks well on lists of LGBTQ-friendly places to live; its schools have antidiscrimination and antiharassment policies. But all of the liberal yard signs in the world (“In This House, We Believe …”) won’t matter if Arlington is not affordable enough to actually include those it purports to welcome.

And that’s where a county proposal to build missing middle housing could make a difference.

Typically, our housing stock presents a binary choice: house or apartment. What that leaves out is what urbanists call the “missing middle”—duplexes, triplexes, and other multiplexes, along with townhouses, condos, accessory dwelling units, courtyard housing, and even cottage clusters. This type of housing was much more common in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and still exists in cities like Boston and D.C., which are known for their row houses and English basements. Providing more space than an apartment, but less costly than a house, missing middle housing injects affordability into neighborhoods that middle-class people, young families, and older people are typically priced out of.

In most places, these types of homes have been illegal to build since the 1940s. In Arlington itself, a few neighborhoods do have this gentle density, with multiplexes grandfathered into neighborhoods where they can no longer be built. But there’s a burgeoning movement, especially in smaller cities and more mixed-use suburbs, to once again permit these options. In 2020, the city council in Portland, Oregon, passed the Residential Infill Project, permitting the construction of alternative dwelling units (think “granny flats”) up to four-plexes in what were previously single-family neighborhoods. In just 10 months since the ordinance went into effect, 511 new units have been permitted. Several cities in the Pacific Northwest, including Spokane, Washington, and Eugene, Oregon, and others, including Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Durham, North Carolina, have up-zoned to allow for some missing middle housing.

This year, Arlington released the Missing Middle Housing Draft Framework, based on a multiyear study by the county concluding that Arlington was becoming unaffordable and that residents were interested in a broader range of housing options. In December 2021, the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors reported that the average single-family detached home in the county sold for almost $1.26 million. That price had risen 17 percent in just one year. Sale prices had appreciated nearly 70 percent in 10 years.

To solve the problem, the study recommended that land that’s exclusively zoned for single-family detached housing—or 79 percent of the county’s residential land—be zoned to permit duplexes, triplexes, and buildings up to eightplexes, along with townhouses, while adhering to existing design and height standards. The county estimated that the plan’s impact would be small at first. The study projects new development on 20 lots per year, bringing 150 “new neighbors” and adding nine to 13 new students to the school system per year. This missing middle housing is expected to help households earning between $108,000 and $200,000 who need smaller housing options, including young families, older Arlingtonians, people of color, and people with disabilities.

Typically, our housing stock presents a binary choice: house or apartment. What that leaves out is what urbanists call the “missing middle”—duplexes, triplexes, and other multiplexes, along with townhouses, condos, accessory dwelling units, courtyard housing, and even cottage clusters.

The draft framework lays out how expanding housing typology for more efficient land use will improve equity in the county. The study found that Arlington’s zoning code—such as eliminating the construction of row houses, where Black residents lived throughout the D.C. metro area, in 1938—has explicitly created segregation and driven Black residents out of the county. The study’s authors called the proposal a first step to “undo the restrictive zoning that led to racial disparities in housing and wealth-building opportunities for the past 90 years.” Initially, the change would be relatively small, a drop in the bucket against decades of exclusion. But as housing advocates like to repeat, the best time to build new housing was 50 years ago. The second-best time is now.

But try telling that to the NIMBYs.

At a county board meeting to discuss the issue in June, the plan’s supporters, including the group YIMBYs of Northern Virginia, sat on one side of the room, while their opponents, Arlingtonians for Our Sustainable Future—the NIMBYs—held court on the other. A YIMBY speaker (“yes in my backyard”) rose to declare that adding greater housing choice would bolster Arlington’s diversity and affordability. And then the NIMBYs went berserk.

Arlingtonians for Our Sustainable Future (which sounds pleasant enough; who could be against sustainability?) put up flyers around the county saying that the draft framework would overcrowd schools, increase traffic, and demolish affordable housing. Adding more middle-class housing choices, its leaders said, represented the county’s “single-minded pursuit of revenue” and an abandonment of “the Arlington way.” At the county board meeting, typically orderly, the public comment period exploded with NIMBY boos, eliciting incredulity from board members.

“We say no more densification without representation!” ASF member Anne Bodine declared. The NIMBYs were chastised by board members for shouting out of turn, and then booed the county’s leadership for correcting them. Once they realized that the YIMBYs had picked the side of the room where their signs could be seen on the county’s streaming camera, one woman from the NIMBY side got up, kneeled in the aisle, and held her sign in front of a YIMBY one, tracking his position like a cornerback and then adjusting her sign—“The Arlington Way Has … Gone Astray”—to block his.

But what is the “Arlington way”? A typical rule of thumb for prospective homeowners is to not buy a home that’s worth three times more than the family’s gross annual income. Arlington’s median household income is $122,604. The average home sale price in August 2022 was $769,565.

“It would be hard to look at the Arlington market and think, ‘Does this work for anyone except the very wealthy?’ ” Jane Green, the president of YIMBYs of Northern Virginia, told me. “It’s not a good system.”

Those for whom the system works—homeowners—typically have the loudest voices. As part of the second stage of its housing study, Arlington’s government solicited feedback from residents. The results were telling—while 77 percent of renter respondents liked the plan as is, 75 percent of homeowners asked the county to narrow the amount of proposed new housing types permitted in the framework. The political power of the homeowner class is clear. Though the county is majority-renter, homeowners made up nearly 84 percent of the survey’s respondents. The county is already suggesting options that would walk back the original proposal, such as bumping the minimum parking requirement for missing middle housing up to one parking space per unit from a half of a space, which makes triplexes or quadplexes more unlikely, or limiting the number of single-family neighborhoods in which missing middle housing would be permitted.

And while YIMBY groups proved powerful in Portland and have put together successful coalitions in college towns such as Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Gainesville, Florida, Arlington, with its significant wealthy, politically active, and easily mobilized homeowner population, could prove to be a different beast. (If the county board makes decisions based on how many flyers each side is able to put up, then the draft framework is certainly doomed.) Members of Arlingtonians for Our Sustainable Future have been making the rounds of neighborhood civic organizations and flooding county board meetings with testimony, telling leaders that adding some duplexes and condos is tantamount to turning “our urban village [in]to a paved metropolis.”

Homesickness is an all-encompassing emotion, a lingering sense never quite resolved. Singers express nostalgia for the places they’ve long since left behind; literary characters come to the realization that it’s not their hometown that has changed but, rather, they themselves who have evolved.

The immutability of home can certainly be comforting. Every time I returned from college and hung out with my friends in D.C., I would drive home late at night over Georgetown’s Key Bridge into Rosslyn, just me and the skyscrapers alone in the midnight secrets we shared, as if the city were welcoming me back. When I walk my dog into Clarendon, I recall window shopping with my middle school friends, the memories greeting me like an old companion. In the glow of neighborhood holiday parties—the same ones I’ve been going to forever—it’s a comfort to know that though I’ve moved away many times, I can, in fact, go home again, and relax in the ease of familiarity. It’s the seriousness with which we take youth recreational basketball rivalries, knowing phrases like “Superman Hill” and “DMV,” and cheering the success of restaurants like District Taco, which I first went to when it was a food truck but which now has nearly 15 locations.

That’s my Arlington. But someone who moved here 40 years ago would have no such association with Rosslyn’s skyscrapers or Clarendon’s character. Perhaps they have their own memories of the neighborhoods that built them; perhaps their neighbors have moved away; maybe they wanted to downsize and found that the middle-class Arlington they arrived in has changed irreparably.

Places change and fluctuate with their economic fortunes, their policies, and the passage of time. That’s inevitable—despite the constant refrains from someone who arrived 10 years before you claiming that you can’t be a real “Your City Here”–onian unless you went to this bar or that restaurant or experienced some bygone event. Cities cannot be preserved in amber—and, given their legacies of exclusion, they shouldn’t. But places do have a say in how they change, which is why debates over housing boil down to a fundamental question: To whom does a city or town belong?

NIMBYs would tell you it belongs to the existing homeowners—even in places like Arlington, where the majority of residents are renters—and that change is inherently negative. But a place’s existence is contingent on its ability to evolve, and to meet the needs of tomorrow’s residents as well as today’s. Arlington will change. It will either become more dense, climate resilient, and affordable, or, by maintaining the status quo, it will become increasingly exclusive.

My Arlington belongs to the public school teachers who first sparked my interest in journalism. It belongs to those who worked at favorite restaurants that moved away or no longer exist, like Hunan Number One, now a West Coast–themed seafood restaurant from a big D.C. restaurant group, or Tandoori Nights, an Indian spot that closed and has not been replaced. I hope it can belong to me.

Cities cannot be preserved in amber. But places do have a say in how they change, which is why debates over housing boil down to a fundamental question: To whom does a city or town belong?

Everyone deserves to grow up in a place like Arlington—walkable, transit oriented, full of interesting restaurants and stores, diverse, and with great schools and nice parks. A wonderful place to learn to ride a bike, to develop an interest, and to make lifelong friends. But I know that given my current career trajectory, becoming a homeowner in Arlington is unlikely. If the city had been as expensive when my parents were a young couple looking in the late 1990s, I would have been raised in a farther-out suburb like Woodbridge or Lorton instead.

At the June county board meeting, before the boos began raining down, Wells Harrell, a member of YIMBYs of Northern Virginia, expressed my feelings on the subject succinctly.

“I love my neighborhood,” he said. “And sometimes, when you love something, you just want to share it with others.”",cybersecurity,washington monthly

SonicWall issues its 2022 Cyber Threat Report

SonicWall’s 2022 Cyber Threat report was published this week. It claims that ransomware attacks shrunk by 23 per cent on a year-to-date worldwide basis over 2021. That’s good news, perhaps, but to put it in perspective, there were still over 236 million attacks so far in 2022. Moreover, the reduced 2022 number is still larger than the full year totals of 2017, 2018 and 2019.

While attacks worldwide decreased by 23 per cent, ransomware attacks in Europe increased by 63 per cent.

What’s responsible for these decreases? The report notes that some experts think that it could be the result of increased awareness, and preventive strategies and hardening of defences in response to the large number of high profile attacks last year, particularly in the US. As well, cyber insurers have forced higher standards to get coverage. The plummeting value and volatility of cryptocurrency may also be a factor.

Or potentially, with many ransomware gangs having ties to Russia, the war in Ukraine might be diverting some players, and the cyber war between Ukraine and Russia is being fought alongside the actual war or physical combat.

Another interesting idea in the report is that some ransomware gangs might moving to cryptojacking which, despite the plummeting value of cryptocurrencies, increased by 30 per cent in the first half of 2022 versus the same period in 2021. Cryptojacking, where cybercriminals steal processing cycles to mine cryptocurrency, may be an easier and less risky exploit, since a great deal of it still goes undetected.

The report is taken from data from 1.1 million global sensors in over 200 countries. It can be downloaded at this link (registration required).

The ghost of ransomware past

The same SonicWall report noted that the three top groups it recorded in terms of attacks in the first half of 2022 were Cerber (43 million), Ryuk (34 million) and GandCrab (16 million). While Cerber and Ryuk have competed for the top spot, GandCrab moved from fourth place to third place in SonicWall’s standings.

What is interesting is that GandCrab reportedly shut down in 2019, when it accounted for roughly half of the global ransomware attacks. SonicWall notes that GandCrab was a ransomware as a service operation (RaaS) ,and that the shut down of GandCrab had “no effect on automatic campaigns, many of which were never turned off.” So rather than a rebirth of this past threat, we may be seeing old campaigns that keep on running to this very day.

Raspberry Robin: the worm turns and spreads rapidly

Microsoft has reported that a group they have identified as DEV-0950 is using the Raspberry Robin worm as a delivery mechanism for the Clop ransomware package.

Raspberry Robin is a fairly new worm, first detected in 2021 by analysts at Red Canary. It leverages USB devices as its means of spreading, and has been used in the past to deliver other “second stage payloads.”

Earlier in 2022, Microsoft had also reported associating Raspberry Robin with Cobalt Strike based attacks. These also led to a subsequent attack leveraging the Clop ransomware.

What is remarkable about this deployment is how rapidly it has spread. “Microsoft Defender for Endpoint data indicates that nearly 3,000 devices in almost 1,000 organizations have seen at least one Raspberry Robin payload-related alert in the last 30 days,” Microsoft sources noted.

Hive Ransomware gang targets infrastructure run by Tata group

In yet another large infrastructure attack, the Hive ransomware group is reported to have claimed responsibility for an attack on India’s largest power company, Tata Power.

Cybersecurity analyst Dominic Alvieri posted news of the attack, noting that Tata Power provides close to 14,000 megawatts of power generation, 35 per cent of which comes from renewable sources.

According to reports in security blog BleepingComputer, Hive operators have posted data that they stole from Tata Power, indicating that rather than interfering with infrastructure, their attack may be focused on exfiltration and ransom of data. It would also indicate that ransom negotiations may have broken down or that Tata may have elected not to pay.",cybersecurity,it world canada

Appearing on CBS’ ‘Face the Nation’ Sunday morning, Jen Easterly, Director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said the agency was putting out information to make sure that state and local election officials have the information that they need to protect voting systems and election infrastructure.

Easterly noted that the agency has ""no information about specific or credible threats to disrupt or compromise election infrastructure"" but warned it is still a ""very complex threat environment.""

""You have cyber threats. You have inside threats. You have rampant disinformation,"" Easterly said. ""And, yes, worryingly, you have threats of harassment, intimidation and violence against election officials, polling places and voters.""

She added: ""That has to stop. It is unacceptable behavior. It’s undemocratic. And we all need to work together to ensure that this is a safe and secure election.""

Easterly’s agency, CISA, is the branch of the Department of Homeland Security responsible for securing the U.S.’ cybersecurity infrastructure and coordinating with states on election security.

Easter’s comments came after the DHS and other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, issued an intelligence bulletin on Friday warning that political candidates, election officials, and the public faced a heightened risk of violence.

155,Suspected Kremlin hack on Liz Truss's mobile sparks security clampdown,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/10/30/22/64009107-0-image-a-15_1667169061365.jpg,30/10/2022,Ministers will be warned they should never use their personal mobile phones to conduct Government business as they are likely to be the target of hostile states such as Russia and China.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11371611/Suspected-Kremlin-hack-Liz-Trusss-mobile-sparks-security-clampdown.html,"Spy chiefs have ordered ministers to stop using their personal phones to conduct government business following a suspected Kremlin hack on Liz Truss’s mobile.

A Whitehall source said all ministers involved in national security would be expected to attend fresh training with the security services this week ‘to ensure everyone is aware how this material should be handled’.

Ministers will be warned they should never use their personal mobile phones to conduct Government business as they are likely to be the target of hostile states such as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.

Pauline Neville-Jones, former chairman of Britain’s joint intelligence committee, yesterday said she was ‘not at all tolerant of the notion that it’s OK for ministers to use private mobile phones’.

The warnings follow astonishing revelations in yesterday’s Mail on Sunday that Miss Truss’s personal mobile was spied on by hackers thought to be working for Moscow while she was foreign secretary.

Spy chiefs have ordered ministers to stop using their personal phones to conduct government business following a suspected Kremlin hack on Liz Truss’s mobile

The hack was discovered during the Tory leadership contest in the summer, but a news blackout was ordered by Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. Even MPs and officials with top level security clearance were kept in the dark.

Miss Truss is said to have been so worried about the potential damage to her leadership bid that she ‘had trouble sleeping’ until the news was suppressed.

Messages dating back up to a year are thought to have been downloaded, including highly sensitive discussions with fellow foreign ministers about issues such as arms shipments to Ukraine.

Hacked messages are said to have included private criticisms of Mr Johnson by Miss Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, potentially opening them up to blackmail attempts at a time when they were both senior ministers in his government.

Parliamentary sources yesterday said the shocking incident was now likely to be investigated by the Intelligence and Security Committee, which oversees the work of the security services.

One source on the committee said: ‘On the face of it, it looks extremely serious. The protocols around using secure lines have been in place for years – why on earth was the foreign secretary using her personal mobile? Frankly, it beggars belief.’

Baroness Neville-Jones, a former security minister, told Times Radio it was ‘extremely unhealthy’ for ministers to be conducting official business through private channels, particularly when using personal phones that are ‘vulnerable’ to hacking.

‘It’s common sense to know that your mobile is potentially vulnerable, and it is the rule that you don’t use it,’ she said. ‘This is what got Hillary Clinton into trouble.’

Pauline Neville-Jones (pictured), former chairman of Britain’s joint intelligence committee, yesterday said she was ‘not at all tolerant of the notion that it’s OK for ministers to use private mobile phones’

Former Army chief Lord Dannatt said the hacking incident suggested ‘ill discipline’ among ministers – and said it added to concerns about the forwarding of sensitive information by Home Secretary Suella Braverman, for which she resigned this month before being reinstated by Rishi Sunak.

He said the behaviour was ‘not good enough’.

‘If you want to communicate government business, use an encrypted handheld device, use a secure telephone line, use a secure means of communication,’ he said.

‘People in senior positions have got access to these secure means of communicating and they should use them. Not doing so is ill discipline and, frankly, reflects very poorly on their judgment.’

Michael Gove did not dispute the report that Miss Truss’s phone had been hacked, saying the Mail on Sunday was ‘a trusted newspaper, so I don’t want in any way to cast doubt on its report’.

But the Levelling Up Secretary said ministers were told to take cybersecurity ‘incredibly seriously’, and that the Government had ‘very robust protocols in place’ to prevent hacking.

However, one security source said some ministers did not like using ‘clunky’ Government-issued encrypted mobiles. Another added: ‘Properly encrypted mobiles are available but they are less convenient, so not so popular.’

Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6, said senior government ministers were ‘obvious targets’ for the security services of hostile powers.

He told BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend show that ‘the likelihood’ was that Miss Truss’s phone had been targeted by Russia, which he said had ‘significant capabilities’ for hacking.

Professor Alan Woodward, cyber security specialist at the University of Surrey, said Miss Truss’s phone was most likely infected with spyware, which would have posted details of all her messages back to the hackers.

This is a security fiasco. We need an inquiry NOW, writes intelligence expert Professor ANTHONY GLEES

Commentary by Professor Anthony Glees

The implications are horrifying. We now know a foreign power hacked the personal mobile phone of the talkative Liz Truss. The severity of this security breach can hardly be overstated.

As a former prime minister, ex-foreign secretary and ex-international trade secretary, Miss Truss was the chief custodian of our national security secrets and the recipient of invaluable MI6 intelligence.

We need an immediate judicial inquiry, led by a High Court judge, to establish how this happened, who was responsible and precisely what information was compromised.

Truss was in charge of delivering national security: The most sacred duty of any government.

We are deeply – and rightly – involved in a major war in our neighbourhood, as the European leader of a western coalition against Russian aggression in Ukraine.

Our closest allies’ trust in us will have been greatly threatened by this fiasco.

I believe Boris Johnson, who was prime minister at the time, should not have suppressed the news, although it is possible there were sound security reasons why this had to be done.

If the media had been able to report the story, Liz Truss would have had no choice but to resign. It goes without saying that her ambitions to lead the country would have been over.

ANTHONY GLEES: The most likely culprits are the Russians – though we also cannot discount China, Iran, North Korea or, conceivably, Israel, which has invested vast sums into electronic surveillance

The most likely culprits are the Russians – though we also cannot discount China, Iran, North Korea or, conceivably, Israel, which has invested vast sums into electronic surveillance.

Analysts at GCHQ are trying to work out who hacked her, and how much damage has been done.

I suspect the Kremlin, not just because Britain – and especially under Boris – has been such an influential ally to Ukraine, but because of the way Liz Truss was treated in Moscow last February, when she met Russian foreign secretary Sergey Lavrov.

The rudeness and disdain shown to her during that visit might have stemmed from the fact that Lavrov perhaps knew almost as much about Truss as she knew herself.

It’s almost impossible to overestimate how much private information, and how many government secrets, might have been betrayed. The hackers could read her emails and WhatsApp messages and listen to her phone calls, of course.

But the latest surveillance software is far more sophisticated than that.

Even when a phone is switched off, a spy operator can switch it back on again and activate the microphone. This enables the phone to be used as a listening device. It is conceivable that the camera was used, too. Certainly, the phone’s GPS device would have transmitted her location at all times – a chilling threat to her personal security.

Cabinet ministers are not supposed to take their personal phones into No10, the Foreign Office or other sensitive zones. We don’t know if Liz Truss complied with this rule – another reason why a judicial inquiry is imperative.

We do know she routinely used her personal phone instead of her government-issued device, which has much more robust anti-hacking protection. Now we need to find out the true cost of this behaviour.

He added that India will emerge as a major designer and manufacturer of telecom gear in three-four years, with its 5G technology stack competing with the best in the world and IP rights will be part of 6G standards. He added that construction will start at the country's first semiconductor fab in March-April next year.Edited excerpts:The issue has been resolved. Basis our discussions with Trai, we will continue with the existing provisions in the Trai Act as of now.However, we do want to highlight that the intent to remove the provisions of the Trai Act was not to make Trai weak, but to simplify the processes that used to take too much shuffling back and forth between Trai and DoT (Department of Telecommunications).We will have extensive consultations with Trai and all stakeholders to come up with a much stronger Trai, benchmarked to the best in the world. Trai needs more teeth, power to punish, power to enforce. It needs a strong technical, legal, and financial team. So, we will take a comprehensive look at the role and structure of Trai.The bill has three constructs–licensing, registration, and authorisation. OTT communication regulatory structure will be decided after extensive consultations with all stakeholders. We will involve Trai in this process. We have clearly stated our intent of light-touch regulation with focus on cybersecurity and protection of users.No, the intent is to regulate only communication apps. The definition of OTT will be made clear in the revised bill.The intent of the government is to protect consumers from falling prey to cyber frauds. Doesn’t a person who receives a call have the right to know who’s calling? So that she can decide whether to receive or reject the call?Actually, it’s the other way round. When a receiver knows where the call is coming from, her privacy is strengthened. She can decide whether to take the call or reject it.PM Modiji has emphasized that we should have extensive consultations because the new bill regulates the gateway to Digital India . So, we are not rushing through it. A reasonable aim for passing the bill is the monsoon session. After that, we will come out with licensing reforms by September-October 2023.Licensing reforms means significant simplification. Reducing taxes can’t be termed as reforms. Through reforms, we want to make the process smoother and transparent. Aim of reforms is to reduce litigation, encourage investment, promote innovation, and generate employment.PM Modiji wants India to emerge as a global leader in telecom technology. For that we need modern, globally benchmarked regulations. In three-four years from now, we will see India emerge as a major designer and manufacturer of telecom gear. Our 5G technology stack would compete with the best in the world. India’s IP rights will be part of 6G standards. Hundreds of startups will use the regulatory sandbox envisaged in the bill to come up with new solutions. Satellite communication services should become prevalent to reach far-flung rural areas. India would be designing and manufacturing chips used in the telecom sector. India is already among the top manufacturers of mobile phones. In three-four years, India will also emerge as a major designer of mobile phones.Voluntary undertaking and alternate dispute resolution mechanism are two steps before going to TDSAT. Industry and government need to focus on innovation, investment and employment.5G rollout is going on schedule. In phase 1, we aim to cover 200 cities by March 2023. By end of 2023, almost every district in the country would have 5G coverage. Telecom service providers are adding 2,500 5G BTSs (base transceiver stations) every week. It will soon ramp up to 10,000 a week; 163 phone models are now 5G enabled. Every week more models are getting enabled by the manufacturers through software upgrades. And BSNL would also rollout 5G services by end of 2023. So, we will have extensive coverage of 5G services in coming 24 months.We prefer a transparent auction process for natural resources. Also, we understand the challenges in auctioning spectrum for applications like satcom. Our view is that there cannot be one auction model for all applications. We can create several models of transparent auctions. However, if there is no way to auction, then we can consider administrative allocations.The march of technology can give results which are unforeseen today. As a society, we should keep all options open. We saw how CDMA and GSMA competed and one of them won. Had we invested in only one technology, we would have lost the game.What difference does change in ownership make? Every company, be it Indian or foreign, has to follow the law of the land.First aim is protection of users. Platforms are not investing enough in protecting users from online harm. User grievances must be fairly addressed. Users have a right to appeal if a platform doesn’t address their grievance.Second aim is to put the onus on platforms to proactively remove harmful posts that promote violence, crime, child pornography, unauthorised use of copyrighted material, etc.From discussions with IT ministers across the world, we understand that all societies are having serious concerns about protection of online users, especially children. MPs have also raised their concerns in parliament on numerous occasions. In a digital society, we will need new legal structures for protection of users.The draft of digital data protection bill is ready. PM Modiji has asked us to have wide consultations. The bill will be released for consultation in the coming days. We have already addressed most of the concerns in the revised bill. Hopefully, we will be able to pass it in the budget session.We have made significant progress. Hopefully, by March-April next year, we will start constructing the semiconductor fab.There is great enthusiasm around the scheme—35 companies have been approved under the design-led manufacturing scheme. In line with our policy, we will have manufacturing as well as Indian IP rights as India becomes a major telecom equipment supplier to the world.",cybersecurity,the times of india

LONDON (AP) — The British government insisted Sunday it has robust cybersecurity for government officials, after a newspaper reported that former Prime Minister Liz Truss’ phone was hacked while she was U.K. foreign minister.

The Mail on Sunday said that the hack was discovered when Truss was running to become Conservative Party leader and prime minister in the summer. It said the security breach was kept secret by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the head of the civil service.

The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said Russian spies were suspected of the hack. It said the hackers gained access to sensitive information, including discussions about the Ukraine war with foreign officials, as well as private conversations between Truss and a political ally, former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng.

The U.K. government spokesperson declined to comment on security arrangements, but said it had “robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats,” including regular security briefings for ministers.

Opposition parties demanded an independent investigation into the hack, and into the leak of the information to a newspaper.

“Was Liz Truss’s phone hacked by Russia, was there a news blackout and if so why?” said Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran. “If it turns out this information was withheld from the public to protect Liz Truss’ leadership bid, that would be unforgivable.”

Labour Party law-and-order spokesperson Yvette Cooper said “the story raises issues around cybersecurity.”

“It’s why cybersecurity has to be taken so seriously by everyone across government, the role of hostile states,” she told Sky News. “But also the allegations about whether a Cabinet minister has been using a personal phone for serious government business, and serious questions about why this information or this story has been leaked or briefed right now.”",cybersecurity,associated press

“The Sunday Morning Bray”, by Bray!

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Ephesians 2:8-9 (King James Version)

The Republic of Texas is getting the most incredible reviews I ever imagined. I get it, how could some nobody from Tualatin OR write anything worth reading but people are really believing in this story as a message of God’s power. The basic storyline is America goes bankrupt from too much Socialism which causes Texas to leave the union and becomes the most powerful country in the world. This draws the attention of the United Nations which wants to tax and regulate them causing Texas to say no thanks. This begins WWIII and the book turns into Star Wars and a suspenseful adventure between a small air force against the might of the entire world.

This is an explanation of how capitalism works along with why a Christian society is critical for a healthy economy as well as a healing for the soul. People are absolutely loving this story as it is so unique in its melding of the human need of freedom as well as the strength of God in a person’s life. You will go on one of the most imaginative trips in your life as the story keeps you on edge from the bottom of the ocean to the heights of outer space while traveling at 10,000 mph. I am being contacted by some people who believe this book is perfect timing with a deep message and believe it will be an important book in the Conservative book market. God is using it to reach his people.

This story gives people hope in a hopeless world. It invigorates your soul as one person says it reaches you in multiple ways. The tale will explain what will happen if we stay on the path America is on. It explains in detail what could happen if the country changed to a small government free market economy and finally challenges you with the question of what would happen if you turned your entire life over to God.

People are absolutely loving this story. It is made for the MAGA community who have been beat down for the past six years being told they are wrong while being called the most vicious names imaginable. This story will validate what these Americans have been saying as it explains the entire structure of how capitalism works. This is why my friend told me to republish it which TNB has done.

It is now being offered to High Schools as a textbook on capitalism. Everyone has been taught what Socialism is and how wonderful it works, just give all your money to the gummit and it solves all your problems. This book explains how it takes all your freedoms as a price to solving your problems.

God called me to write this book ten years abo as a text-book to explain capitalism to the average guy. I published it in 2013 and people loved it but did not have a good marketing method to get it to a broader group. Three years ago a friend of mine Art Scavola called and said I had to republish since all of the predictions were coming true so I began looking for a publisher.

Two years ago, Memorial Day I woke up dead. My wife heard what sounded like a moose in my office since she fell asleep in the living room a few feet away. As a retired nurse she checked the pulse and it there was none, I was dead. She called 911 even though the phone was dead hearing you could call 911 on a dead phone and it would work which it did. She gave the address and said to send an ambulance the door was open.

The operator said to start CPR which she said she did but what’s that song? Oh yeah, Staying alive, staying alive, doot, doot, doot..

She went around 10 minutes by herself waiting for the ambulance. When they got there, they hit me with the paddles and nothing happened while working on me for another twenty minutes until they got a heartbeat. They rushed me to the ICU and since Cold-19 just started isolated me and made my wife wait in the parking lot. She called my son in PA to come home and bring a suit since you are probably going to the funeral.

The hospital called later around 8 PM that I was dead and there was nothing they could do. They said to not worry about Covid and come in to say goodbye and when to turn off the machines. They said they had tried everything and there was nothing else. Twenty minutes later my heart started beating and two days later I was laughing and joking with the nurses. One nurse asked if I wanted to try walking and I told her of course what is the big deal about walking? As I was walking across the room another nurse asked if I was Gary and when the other said yes, she responded, “I don’t believe it, that’s why we do this job.”

I have what is called Sudden Death Syndrome which your brain stops sending signals to the heart. In around 95% of the cases, you simply find the body since there is absolutely no symptoms, you just drop dead. I walked 18 holes of golf the night before with no problems. Of the survivors around an equal number suffer a certain amount of brain or organ damages since you have to find the person within ten minutes. My wife Saint Marilyn started CPR within 5 minutes.

When she is asked about any brain damage see simply says, “he didn’t get any worse, but he didn’t get any better.”

I have to remind her it is not like restarting a computer. When I came out of the coma, I tested my brain by singing Christmas Carols. Singing is a very complicated skill and I figured if I could sing songs I it was a good test for the brain. So, they were having songs like O Holy Night at the top of my lungs in the middle of the night Memorial Day weekend. As it turned out I was a one in a thousand who survived without brain damages and felt the presence of Jesus during my death. He was more real than anyone else and told me, “Well Done my Good and Faithful Servant.”

A couple of months later I was invited to speak on a radio program about my near-death experience and told to bring the book as something we may talk about at the same time. A guy I had never met sat next to me and asked what the book was. I told him the basic story and asked if anyone has ever done the audiobook? I said of course not and he said God has told him to do this book. He is a 1 in a thousand survivor of stage 4 cancer.

I then asked if he should read it first and he said no, God told him to do this book as an audiobook even though he had never done accents which there are over 50. He and his wife have spent over a year and a half making an audiobook of The Republic of Texas and it is a gem.

He has made an old-fashioned audio play with sound effects and everything to make it come alive. Just an exquisite piece of professionalism which I am so proud of them. One lady ran to the front of a room we were at saying how much she loved it on a trip she listened to it two times in a row for seventeen hours. She told me everyone in America has to read or hear this book since it will change the country. She said schools need to use it to counter all the socialism they are taught.

I know what you are thinking, how can anyone from Tualatin Oregon write anything worth reading? You are right, I could never write something this good, only God can and he did. He inspired it and it will make you laugh, it will make you cry. It will warm your heart, it will give you hope in a hopeless world. This will be the best book you have ever read and if it is not I will refund your money since that is not why I want you to read it. I want you to read it to make your life better and to tell other people and make their lives better.

I have had numerous readers say they have read it in one sitting since they cannot put it down. It will challenge you to fly inverted as you discover what that means. Go to Braylog.com and order a copy or your favorite audiobook service and take the first step to giving yourself hope and reaffirmation to what you know in your heart what is true. This story is The Patriot, Braveheart and Star Wars all wrapped together with God as the centerpiece wrapped around a nice little Hallmark love story.

Order the book for you and someone needing the most unique gift they will ever receive. Especially, give it to those who do not believe in God, you can tell them they are reading or listening a book from two guys who God gave another miraculous chance to spread his message. One man with God is a powerful army. We are three armies together.

Following the report of the alleged hack by the Daily Mail, opposition parties demanded an independent investigation into the hack and into the leak of the information to the newspaper.

""Was Liz Truss’s phone hacked by Russia, was there a news blackout and if so why?"" said Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran. ""If it turns out this information was withheld from the public to protect Liz Truss’ leadership bid, that would be unforgivable.""

Then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case suppressed details about the security breach, the newspaper reported.

RUSSIAN AGENTS MAY HAVE HACKED FORMER BRITISH PM LIZ TRUSS' PHONE: REPORT

The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said Russian spies were suspected of the hack. It said the hackers gained access to sensitive information, including discussions about the Ukraine war with foreign officials, as well as private conversations between Truss and a political ally, former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng.

Labour Party law-and-order spokeswoman Yvette Cooper said ""the story raises issues around cybersecurity.""

""It’s why cybersecurity has to be taken so seriously by everyone across government, the role of hostile states,"" she told Sky News. ""But also the allegations about whether a Cabinet minister has been using a personal phone for serious government business, and serious questions about why this information or this story has been leaked or briefed right now.""

The U.K. government spokesperson declined to comment on security arrangements but said it had ""robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats,"" including regular security briefings for ministers.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has done it again: Twenty years after first winning the Brazilian presidency, the leftist defeated incumbent Jair Bolsonaro Sunday in an extremely tight election that marks an about-face for the country after four years of far-right politics. With more than 99% of the votes tallied in the runoff vote, da Silva had 50.9% and Bolsonaro 49.1%, and the election authority said da Silva’s victory was a mathematical certainty. It is a stunning reversal for da Silva, 77, whose 2018 imprisonment over a corruption scandal sidelined him from the 2018 election that brought Bolsonaro, a defender of conservative social values, to power.

Witnesses describe 'a hell' inside South Korean crowd surge

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A stunned Seoul is beginning to unearth the extent of a Halloween crowd surge that killed more than 150 mostly young people out enjoying festivities in the party neighborhood of Itaewon on Saturday. The night began with thousands of revelers crammed into the narrow, vibrant streets of Seoul’s most cosmopolitan district. People eager to show off their Halloween costumes wore brightly colored capes, wizard hats and bat wings. But after panic ignited, an unmanageable mass of people packed into a narrow alley where toppled revelers were stacked on top of one another “like dominoes.” The chaotic crush was so intense, people had their clothes ripped off.

S. Korea in shock, grief as 153 die in Halloween crowd surge

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Koreans mourned and searched for relatives lost in the “hell-like” chaos that killed more than 150 people, mostly in their 20s and 30s, when a huge Halloween party crowd surged into a narrow alley in a nightlife district in Seoul. It remained unclear what led the crowd to surge into the downhill alley in the Itaewon area on Saturday night. Witnesses said people fell on each other “like dominoes.” One witness said she performed CPR on 10 people who were unconscious, mostly women wearing witch outfits and other Halloween costumes. Nine of them were declared dead on the spot. Nearly two-thirds of the 153 people killed were women.

Concerns rise as Russia resumes grain blockade of Ukraine

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia has resumed its blockade of Ukrainian ports, cutting off urgently needed grain exports to hungry parts of the world. U.S. President Joe Biden called the move a “really outrageous” act and warned that global hunger could increase. Russia has suspended a U.N.-brokered deal to allow safe passage of ships carrying grain from Ukraine, one of the world’s breadbaskets. The Kremlin took the step because it alleged that Ukraine staged a drone attack against Russia’s Black Sea Fleet off occupied Crimea. Ukraine has denied the attack. Ukraine’s Infrastructure Ministry reported that a total of 218 ships involved in grain exports have been blocked. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskky said in a video address Sunday that “Russia is blackmailing the world with hunger.”

Suspension bridge collapse kills at least 132 in India

MORBI, India (AP) — Over 130 people have died after a century-old pedestrian bridge collapsed into a river in the western Indian state of Gujarat on Sunday evening. State minister Harsh Sanghvi said that 132 people have died so far and that many were admitted to hospitals. Local media reports said over a hundred people plunged into the Machchu river when the pedestrian bridge in the state’s Morbi district collapsed. The colonial-era suspension bridge had reopened four days ago after renovation. Officials said the bridge gave way because it could not handle the number of people on it. The Hindu festival season had drawn hundreds of people to the recently opened tourist attraction.

AP source: Pelosi attacker carried zip ties, in Jan. 6 echo

WASHINGTON (AP) — The man accused of attacking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband in their San Francisco home carried zip ties with him when he broke in. That word comes from a person briefed on the investigation who spoke on condition to anonymity to The Associated Press. It's the latest parallel to the U.S. Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021. Police say the suspect confronted 82-year-old Paul Pelosi early Friday and, according to AP reporting, demanded to know, “Where is Nancy? Rioters who swarmed the Capitol trying to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory over Donald Trump roamed the halls and shouted menacingly, demanding “Where’s Nancy?” Some in the siege were seen inside the Capitol carrying zip ties.

Kemp, Abrams argue abortion, voting in Ga. governor debate

ATLANTA (AP) — Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams offered differing visions for Georgia on abortion, the economy and voting in a policy-heavy debate. Sunday evening's match was the pair’s final meeting as Georgians continue voting leading up to the Nov. 8 election. Kemp said “it’s not my desire"" to have further abortion restrictions but that he would consider bills sent to him by a Republican legislature. Abrams said she would support legal abortion until a fetus was viable outside the womb. Abrams accused Kemp of using voting laws to aid his own elections while Kemp said Abrams lies about voting in Georgia to aid and enrich herself.

Men exonerated in Malcolm X killing to receive $36 million

NEW YORK (AP) — The city of New York will settle lawsuits filed on behalf of two men who were exonerated last year for the 1965 assassination of Malcolm X. Their lawyer, David Shanies, confirmed Sunday the city has agreed to pay $26 million for the wrongful convictions which led to both men spending decades behind bars. The state will pay $10 million. The move comes nearly a year after a Manhattan judge dismissed the convictions of Muhammad Aziz, now 84, and the late Khalil Islam. Prosecutors said new evidence of witness intimidation and suppression of exculpatory evidence had undermined the decades-old case against the men.

AP Top 25: Tennessee, Ohio St tied at 2, UGA next for Vols

Tennessee moved into a tie with Ohio State for No. 2 in The Associated Press college football poll. That sets up a 1 vs. 2 matchup next week between the Volunteers and top-ranked Georgia. It'll be the 25th regular-season game matching the top two teams in the AP poll, and the third straight involving Southeastern Conference teams. Neither the Bulldogs nor the Volunteers have ever played in a 1-2 game in the regular season. Georgia remained No. 1 for the fourth straight week, receiving 30 first-place votes and 1,528 points. The last time there was a tie at No. 2 in the AP poll was Nov. 14, 2004, between Auburn and Oklahoma behind No. 1 Southern California.

Oct 30 (Reuters) - Election officials in the United States have been alerted to safe-proof their voting systems and be vigilant about political violence amid a ""very complex threat environment,"" top U.S. cybersecurity official Jen Easterly said on Sunday in the wake of an attack on the husband of a leading Democratic lawmaker last week.

Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in an appearance on CBS ""Face the Nation"" said the agency is concerned about a range of threats, including cyber, insider, physical and disinformation even as it sees no ""specific or credible"" threats.

CISA is distributing information about disinformation campaigns and tactics that seek to undermine confidence in U.S. elections, she said

""We are putting out information ... to make sure that state and local election officials have the information that they need to protect their voting systems and their election infrastructure.""

The warning is among a range of messages being distributed by federal agencies and law enforcement, including the New York Police Department, with the midterm election just nine days away.

Businessman Paul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was attacked with a hammer by an intruder during a break-in at the couple's home in San Francisco early on Friday. The attack has ignited fears about political violence at a time when crime has become a leading issue this election season.

The Department of Homeland Security, FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and U.S. Capitol Police issued a bulletin on Friday warning that political candidates, election officials and the public faced a heighten risk of violence.

Last week the NYPD called for ""elevated vigilance"" ahead of the midterm elections in an internal bulletin. The department warned that extremists could target political events and polling sites, putting poll workers and political candidates at risk.

The Mail on Sunday report, which cited unnamed sources, suggested that private messages exchanged between Truss and foreign officials while she was foreign secretary — some apparently involving sensitive information about the war in Ukraine, and personal communication with former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng — were breached in the supposed cyberattack.

It also claimed that U.K. government officials learned of the breach over the summer and suggested that former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who preceded Truss, and cabinet secretary Simon Case intentionally hid it from the media amid Truss' campaign to become the conservative party leader and prime minister. Truss, who was ultimately appointed by Queen Elizabeth II to succeed Johnson, announced her resignation earlier this month after just six weeks in office.

A U.K. government spokesperson declined to ""comment on individuals' security arrangements"" in a statement to CBS News.

""The Government has robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats. That includes regular security briefings for Ministers, and advice on protecting their personal data and mitigating cyber threats,"" the statement said.

Meanwhile, Michael Gove, who was recently reappointed to his government position as Levelling Up secretary, shared a similar response to questions about the alleged hack during an interview with Sky News on Sunday.

""I don't know the full details of what security breach, if any, took place,"" Gove said. ""What I do know is that the government has very robust protocols in place in order to make sure that individuals are protected, but also that government security and national security are protected as well.""

However, Labour party leaders have demanded a probe into the potential cybersecurity breach, with Yvette Cooper, the party's law-and-order spokesperson, suggesting that the Mail on Sunday's report raises broader concerns about the British government and national security.

""Clearly these are very serious allegations,"" Cooper said later on Sky News. ""It raises issues around cybersecurity. It's why cybersecurity has to be taken so seriously by everyone across governments, the role of hostile states, but also the allegations about whether a cabinet minister has been using a personal phone for serious government business, and serious questions about why this information or this story has been leaked or briefed right now.""

Cooper suggested that each of those issues points to ""the way in which the government is not taking seriously enough national security.""

Read more on that story here.

In other developments:

1. Tens of thousands of Czechs show their support for Ukraine

Tens of thousands of Czechs gathered in the capital on Sunday to demonstrate their solidarity with Ukraine and their support for democratic values.

The rally took place in reaction to three recent anti-government demonstrations where other protesters demanded the resignation of the pro-Western coalition government of conservative Prime Minister Petr Fiala for its support for Ukraine.

Those earlier rallies also protested soaring energy prices and opposed the country’s membership in the European Union and NATO. Their organisers are known for spreading Russian propaganda and opposing COVID-19 vaccinations.

The people who turned out Sunday in Prague waved the Czech, Ukrainian and EU flags while displaying slogans that read “Czech Republic against fear” and “We will manage it”.

Sunday’s rally at central Wenceslas Square was organized by a group called Million Moments for Democracy, which was behind several rallies in support of Ukraine following the Feb 24 Russian invasion. The group also previously held massive rallies against the former prime minister, populist billionaire Andrej Babis, calling him a threat to democracy.

The group said the anti-government protests united the far right with the far left and exploited the people’s fear of inflation and the war in Ukraine, and were trying to undermine democracy.

Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, thanked those at the rally in a video message. She said her country has been facing “the darkest moment in its history” but added hope that Russia's aggression won’t succeed.

2. More Ukrainian civilians killed as Russian missile attacks continue

On the battlefront, Russian missile attacks kept pounding key front-line hot spots in Ukraine. The Russians shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours, killing at least five civilians and wounding nine more, Ukraine’s presidential office said.

In the eastern Donetsk region, where the fighting is ongoing near the cities of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, eight cities and villages were shelled.

Earlier this month, Moscow intensified its missile and drone strikes on Ukraine's power stations, waterworks and other key infrastructure, damaging 40% of Ukraine’s electric system and forcing the government to implement rolling blackouts. Kyiv's mayor said the Ukrainian capital's power system was operating in “emergency mode.”

In addition, in areas that Ukraine has recaptured, residents are still recovering bodies of killed civilians, Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.

“Over the past 24 hours alone, in three de-occupied towns and villages, we found abandoned bodies of Ukrainian civilians,” Kyrylenko said.

Ukraine’s Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskiy said Sunday that Russian forces were mining territories they left behind twice as densely as during the first months of the war.

Power outages were reported Sunday in the occupied Ukrainian city of Enerhodar, home to the closed Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest. Ukrainian and Russian officials traded blame for the shelling that caused the blackout.

3. Russian soldiers released in prisoner swap

Russian state TV shared footage on Sunday of what it said were Russian soldiers who had been released as part of a prisoner swap the day before.

The video showed young men disembarking from a plane and boarding buses, including one man being met by his father.

Some were filmed apparently talking to loved ones on their phones, telling them they were home.

The AP could not independently verify the date, location or conditions under which the footage was shot.

The Russian defence ministry said in a statement on Saturday that Kyiv released 50 Russian army personnel as part of a prisoner swap that same day.

Fifty Ukrainian soldiers and two civilians were released as part of the swap with Russia, both sides reported.

4. Russia's Lavrov needles Biden over Cuban Missile Crisis and Ukraine

President Vladimir Putin's foreign minister on Sunday needled Joe Biden over Ukraine, saying that he hoped the US President had the wisdom to deal with a global confrontation similar to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

In an interview for a Russian state television documentary on the missile crisis, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there were ""similarities"" to 1962, largely because Russia was now threatened by Western weapons in Ukraine.

""I hope that in today's situation, President Joe Biden will have more opportunities to understand who gives orders and how,"" Lavrov said with a faint smile. ""This situation is very disturbing.""

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the Cuban crisis when the Soviet Union and the US are to considered to have come closest to nuclear war.

5. UK politicians demand probe into Liz Truss phone hack claim

The British government insisted Sunday it has robust cybersecurity for government officials after a newspaper reported that former Prime Minister Liz Truss’ phone was hacked while she was UK foreign minister.

The Mail on Sunday said the hack was discovered when Truss was running to become Conservative Party leader and prime minister in the summer. It said the security breach was kept secret by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the head of the civil service.

The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said Russian spies were suspected of the hack. It said the hackers gained access to sensitive information, including discussions about the Ukraine war with foreign officials, as well as private conversations between Truss and a political ally, former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng.

The UK government spokesperson declined to comment on security arrangements but said it had “robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats,” including regular security briefings for ministers.

Just as Elon Musk was finalizing his purchase of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, the company's founder and former CEO, announced a beta for a new social-media company.

Dorsey's blockchain-based Bluesky Social announced last Tuesday that it's launching soon and is currently enlisting users for beta testing. The initial news drew 30,000 sign-ups within two days, company representatives said. Users can still sign up to join the app to become a beta user before the platform is publicly available.

Bluesky's website said it's intended to support ""a new foundation for social networking which gives creators independence from platforms, developers the freedom to build, and users a choice in their experience."" According to Gizmodo, one of its Bluesky's main selling points is that its technology — which it calls ""AT Protocol"" — will give users control of their algorithms.

Dorsey had said in 2019 that Twitter was funding work into developing ""an open and decentralized standard for social media.""

In private text messages between Dorsey and Musk that became public in the course of Musk and Twitter's months-long legal saga, Dorsey said, ""A new platform is needed. It can't be a company. That's why I left."" He went on to say Twitter should have an ""open-sourced protocol"" similar to the encrypted-messaging app Signal, adding that Twitter ""can't have an advertising model.""

Dorsey cofounded Twitter in 2006 and had several years-long stints as CEO, most recently from 2015 to November of 2021, when he stepped down. Parag Agrawal, who was then chief technology officer of the company, replaced him. Shortly after taking over Twitter this week, Musk fired Agrawal, as well as Ned Segal, the chief financial officer; Vijaya Gadde, the legal chief; and Sean Edgett, the general counsel.

Musk reportedly fired them ""for cause"" to avoid having to pay severance payments and unvested stock awards, a person familiar with the matter told The Information.",blockchain,business insider

Observations

soft quotes in hn_comment_nouns_common

$ cat hn_comment_nouns_common 126179 ”

There are 126,000+ quotations on HackerNews using smart quotes. I find this deeply disturbing.

Intel vs AMD

First we look at hn stories (the posts that people comment on but not the comments themselves). Stories include titles and text (what reddit calls selftext).

$ rg ' Intel|AMD ' hn_story_nouns_common 3921 AMD 5477 Intel

ripgrep recognizes hn_comment_nouns_common as a binary file and I don't know how to fix that so using grep:

$ grep --binary-files text -E ' Intel|AMD ' hn_comment_nouns_common 49167 AMD 87458 Intel

And Intel is mentioned even more in the comments (probably because AMD makes programmers' lives easier so there is no need to complain)!

AI vs Blockchain

$ grep --binary-files text -E ' AI|blockchain ' hn_comment_nouns_common 68368 blockchain 160277 AI

I'd guess 99% of blockchain references are either people complaining about the inefficiencies of blockchain as a database or scammy spams.

Sun vs Moon

$ grep --binary-files text -E ' sun|moon ' hn_comment_nouns_common 30905 moon 36100 Samsung 44937 sun

This is closer than I thought it would be!

$ grep --binary-files text -E ' Apollo$|Helios$|Ra$ ' hn_comment_nouns_common 38 Sun Ra 49 React+Apollo 230 The Apollo 278 Helios 762 LoRa 7299 Apollo

But I'm more surprised that there are only 0 or 1 mentions of the sun god Ra.

Industry associations from Hungary and Thailand plan to cooperate on implementing blockchain technologies in the financial services sector. The two sides hope to share experience and produce ideas for alternative services as part of their new partnership.

Thailand and Hungary Announce Blockchain Pact During Bilateral Fintech Forum

The Thai Fintech Association and Hungary’s Blockchain Coalition have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to support the introduction of new technologies to their financial markets. The agreement was inked during the first edition of the “Thai-Hungarian Fintech Forum: Powering the Financial Revolution Together,” the Bangkok Post reported on Saturday.

The event devoted to showcasing financial technology services was organized by the Hungarian embassy. Hungary’s Blockchain Coalition was established on the initiative of the Ministry of Innovation and Technology and the National Data Economy Knowledge Center in March, to promote the country as an innovator in the digital age. Its members come from the private, public, and academic sectors.

Digital financial services such as e-commerce, mobile payments and digital currency are growing rapidly in Thailand, with its increasing number of crypto holders, pointed out Chonladet Khemarattana, president of the Thai Fintech Association. In his opinion, the further development of financial technology requires international cooperation. He elaborated:

The future collaboration with Hungarian companies will help Thailand to gain more experience. It will also help both countries to initiate new ideas or services in the future.

Hungary believes it is of the utmost importance to promote the latest fintech solutions and establish deep cooperation with partners in that field, according to the Hungarian Ambassador to Thailand Sándos Sipos. He added that the diplomatic mission is recognizing the need to shape financial technology trends.

Sipos reminded that the two nations will celebrate the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic ties next year. He described the memorandum as another milestone in the financial cooperation between Hungary and Thailand after last month’s participation of Bank of Thailand Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput in the Budapest Eurasia Forum held by the Hungarian National Bank.

174,Why One of the Smartest Investors Bought Bitcoin and Thinks You Should Too,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706312/bitcoins-cryptocurrency.jpg,30/10/2022,Cathie Wood sat down for an interview and she surprised listeners with what she had to say about her favorite cryptocurrency.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/why-one-of-the-smartest-investors-bought-bitcoin-a/,"On the What Bitcoin Did podcast, ARK Invest Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood shed some light on Bitcoin (BTC -1.01%). Maybe the most intriguing, but not most important, part of the interview was that she finally disclosed for the first time when she originally bought Bitcoin. Back in 2015 Wood purchased $100,000 of Bitcoin when its price was hovering around $250. That investment is worth about $7.5 million today.

Wood's faith in Bitcoin has only grown since 2015. When her firm started researching the world's first cryptocurrency, she said they quickly realized Bitcoin had the potential to be ""one of the most profound innovations of our time.""

Gold, the dollar, and Bitcoin

During the initial research of Bitcoin, Wood and her team worked with one of the world's most prominent economists with expertise in monetary policy, Art Laffer. Laffer served under President Ronald Reagan on the Economic Policy Advisory Board and has been active in economic policy on the national and international stage ever since.

Wood said that it was Laffer's analysis of Bitcoin that led her to make her first purchase. She said that Laffer was in awe of the dynamics behind Bitcoin. As she put it, Laffer said that he had been looking for a currency like Bitcoin ""since we went off the gold exchange standard.""

Before the U.S. abandoned the gold standard in 1973, the value of the dollar was fixed relative to the price of gold. It's considered by many that the gold standard mitigated the issuance of money and subsequently quelled inflation because the amount of physical gold held by a government acted as a limit to the creation of new money.

After the gold standard was dropped, there was little to dissuade the government from printing more money or manipulating monetary policy. When a government can control the money supply it can finance any agenda or project regardless of how popular it may or may not be. This is simplified to maintain brevity but theoretically, all it has to do is print more money and it can come up with the funding. Today, the dollar lacks traits of intrinsic value that it had when it was on the gold standard and it is almost constantly inflated to finance government budgets.

As the government takes on more costs, it subsequently increases its debt burden. To get a better idea, we can take a look at the U.S. national debt, which has increased more than 6,500% since 1973. Some debt is considered healthy, but a balance sheet with an exorbitant amount of liabilities compared to assets can spell trouble for economies when those debts eventually need to be paid.

Like gold, but better

Laffer wasn't a huge fan of the current monetary standard and once he discovered that Bitcoin had many characteristics superior to gold he was sold on its potential. Bitcoin one-upped gold. Unlike gold, Bitcoin is private, digital, easily divisible, and rules-based.

Let's unpack that one by one because Wood believes that each of these characteristics makes Bitcoin even more valuable than gold. First, because Bitcoin runs on a blockchain, which means that all transactions are encrypted and pseudonymous. Transactions on its blockchain cannot be altered and they can only be halted if the user doesn't have sufficient funds.

Second, Bitcoin is digital. This makes it much more portable than gold and even the dollar. Bitcoin holders only need a digital wallet on their phone or computer to hold or transfer value. If you lose your phone, the funds are protected and you can access funds by entering your unique password on another device. In addition, digital money serves an integral role in the age of the internet that gold or the dollar falls short of.

Bitcoin is also easily divisible. Even though its price sits at around $20,000 today, users can send and receive fractions of Bitcoin with just the press of a button. No need to carry spare change, find larger or smaller bills in your wallet, or carry around gold bullions (although of course almost no one does that).

Lastly, Bitcoin runs on specific rules. There is a limited supply that cannot be inflated or manipulated. That means no government can meddle in how it operates or even block transactions.

Most importantly, it does all of this without any centralized authority overseeing it. Instead of one person or agency running it, computers, referred to as nodes, around the world run the Bitcoin blockchain to ensure that it remains decentralized and operates without any interference.

Bitcoin's potential

When considering all of this, Wood needed no further convincing. She made her original purchase and continues to hold on to that original investment. But since 2015, much has changed. Bitcoin hit a high of nearly $70,000 in November 2021 and its ascension to prominence has even led to publicly traded companies like Tesla holding some on their balance sheet as an alternative to cash, further legitimatizing it as a viable asset.

It's been nothing short of an astronomical rise. Yet, Wood believes Bitcoin has more in store. In her and Laffer's opinion, Bitcoin could have a value roughly equal to that of the entire U.S. monetary base. During their research in 2015 when they originally posited this, that figure was about $4.25 trillion. If Bitcoin's market cap reached that mark it would mean one Bitcoin would be worth near $215,000 -- a far cry from its current $20,000 price.

So what's Wood's best advice? Have patience. She said that by investing with a time horizon over 10 years and ignoring price fluctuations ""you're going to win.""",blockchain,motley fool

The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world has reportedly invested $500 million in Elon Musk's Twitter buyout. Binance will work with Musk's teams to develop and incorporate blockchain-based solutions for social media platforms. The partnership allows Binance an excellent opportunity to integrate social media and news into Web3's envisioned future.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, has supported Musk's Twitter ambitions since the early stages. As an equity co-investor, Binance joins the ranks of Musk's other partners, including Sequoia Capital, Fidelity Management, Andreessen Horowitz, and Brookfield.

Analysts questioned Binance's commitment to the investment following Musk's hesitations earlier this year. In a June Bloomberg interview, Zhao clarified his company's position, stating his support would only remain if Musk followed through: ""...If he's off, we're off.""

Our intern says we wired the $500 million 2 days ago, probably just as I was being asked about Elon/Twitter. https://t.co/gM65GHUnZC — CZ "" Binance (@cz_binance) October 27, 2022

An October 27 tweet from Zhao responded to inquiries asking whether or not the exchange held to its word and followed through on the investment. An additional tweet on October 28 confirmed the commitment was indeed completed, proudly stating, ""Let's unleash the bird.""

The move toward blockchain-based technologies isn't a new step for Twitter. Last November, the company tasked a team of cryptocurrency and blockchain experts to research and develop new blockchain-based technologies and solutions. The effort led to Twitter allowing users to have non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as avatar photos.

Let's unleash the bird. — CZ "" Binance (@cz_binance) October 28, 2022

Binance aims to leverage its investment to drive progress toward Web3, an updated, decentralized version of the internet focused on promoting user ownership, censorship resistance, decentralization, better identity solutions, and native payments that do not rely on today's financial institutions. The shift in focus represents a departure from today's Web2.0, which emphasizes user participation, user-friendly content generation, and interoperability across platforms and solutions.

Binance also hopes to aid Musk in reducing the number of bot accounts in use. Bots were a central point of contention for Musk throughout the acquisition. He insisted they were far more prevalent than previously reported. Binance has expressed its desire to develop an on-chain solution to combat the proliferation of bots. However, Twitter's new management has not yet revealed designs or plans to combat the problem.",blockchain,techspot
176,Why Chainlink Was Shooting Higher on Sunday,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706904/person-looking-pleased-while-gazing-at-a-smartphone.jpg,30/10/2022,Might this tech star-backed token be at the start of a Dogecoin-like surge?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/why-chainlink-was-shooting-higher-on-sunday/,"What happened

Sunday was hardly a day of rest for Chainlink (LINK -1.05%) investors, as they were busy trading up the niche cryptocurrency. As of mid-afternoon, Chainlink's price had risen by almost 4%; like a certain low-priced crypto in the very recent past, the token seems to be benefiting from an association with a high-profile individual who's involved in the digital currency realm.

So what

Chainlink is a token that anchors a network of ""oracles,"" which are node operators that provide reams of data. This is made available to other blockchains to provide data that can underpin smart contracts. A good example of this is scores and statistics from sports contests, which can be fed into smart contracts operated by online betting companies to handle wagers.

That's enough of a specialty to attract Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, now the core business unit of Alphabet. Since late 2021 he's been a strategic advisor to Chainlink Labs, the token's developer, and has become arguably the most high-profile individual proselytizing for the blockchain and its token.

Does that sound vaguely familiar?

It should, because that's analogous to the relationship between Tesla -- and now Twitter -- leader Elon Musk, who has been a longtime Dogecoin bull. Musk's association with the not-especially-useful coin recently led to a price spike as he restarted, and ultimately succeeded in, his attempt to buy Twitter. More than a few times, he talked up Dogecoin through the micro-messaging app.

Now what

As often happens in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin's price retreated very shortly after the Twitter deal was consummated.

But investors like to look for patterns, so in that light, it's not surprising they're latching on to another crypto asset backed by a respected corporate leader. It also helps that, in contrast to Dogecoin, Chainlink is a digital asset underpinning a system that actually has a solid, real-world use.",blockchain,motley fool
177,Why The Sandbox Was Climbing Almost 7% Today,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706912/2-young-people-in-costume-using-pcs.jpg,30/10/2022,"Apparently, 'tis the time of the season to visit a metaverse temporarily invaded by zombies and ghouls.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/why-the-sandbox-was-climbing-almost-7-higher-today/,"What happened

Spooky season might be upon us, but investors were hardly spooked by the prospects for The Sandbox (SAND -3.88%). On Sunday, they were trading the specialty token up by just under 7% across the 24 hours preceding roughly 6:30 p.m. ET. Seasonal factors played a role in this advance, as did the continued momentum of the metaverse that the cryptocurrency anchors.

So what

The Sandbox Game is a metaverse with its own economy, hence the near-namesake token. The developers behind it run a series of Alpha Seasons, which they make available to users as sneak previews for new features and locations. At the moment, The Sandbox is pushing its Halloween Special, a creepy world that's tied into the current Alpha Season 3.

And who, after all, doesn't like immersing themselves into the odd and scary at this time of the year? It isn't easy to tie a blockchain or cryptocurrency into Halloween (you can't buy zombie-costumed Bitcoin, for example), so it's hard for developers to market their wares for the holiday. The Sandbox does not have that problem.

As with any metaverse project, or online world generally, its success is dependent on the user base. After all, a virtual world isn't very compelling without a population. The Sandbox's Halloween Special is sure to draw curious players who already populate the developer's metaverse, and perhaps it will even rope in a few new devotees. This can only be beneficial for its native cryptocurrency.

Now what

Compounding that, The Sandbox continues to expand. Late last week, iconic fashion brand Gucci announced it has rolled out its own piece of real estate in the Sandbox metaverse. Called Gucci Vault Land, this will be open as a ""private event"" on a limited run until Nov. 9.

In the company's flowery language, Gucci Vault Land offers ""an ephemeral platform to manifest the multifaceted essence of today's Vault in one single place."" That certainly won't be for every Sandbox player, but it does indicate the metaverse's increasing popularity for a wide variety of developers and players.",blockchain,motley fool

Amendments to the nation's Information Technology Rules gazetted [PDF] last Friday allow the creation of Grievance Appellate Committees (GACs) that citizens can petition if social networks and other online services don't act on their takedown requests.

India's minister of state for electronics and information technology, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, said the GACs are needed because India's previous attempt at regulating social media – requiring the networks to appoint a grievance officer – has not delivered.

""The accountability structure that was put in place in the last set of rules has not worked adequately,"" Chandrasekhar admitted.

""Therefore we have created appellate committees so that those citizens who are dissatisfied with the grievance addressal mechanism of a platform have the ability to appeal.""

But India's Internet Freedom Foundation characterized the Committees as ""a government censorship body for social media that will make bureaucrats arbiters of our online free speech.""

""Given that the GAC would hear appeals against the decisions of social media platforms to remove content or not, it will incentivize platforms to remove/suppress/label any speech unpalatable to the government, or those exerting political pressure,"" the Foundation argued.

India's government flagged the creation of the GACs in June 2022.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore has proposed measures to protect consumers who engage in cryptocurrency trading, including stablecoins – a type of cryptocurrency whose value is allegedly tied to an existing fiat currency.

Although the city-state would prefer consumers avoid retail digital payment tokens (DPT), it has acknowledged it's not likely to stop them and has taken an ""if you can't beat them, regulate them"" approach.

""Regulations go hand-in-hand with innovation in financial services,"" argued MAS deputy managing director Ho Hern Shin.

The proposed regulations broadly put more responsibility on the DPT providers when it comes to consumer access, business conduct and risk of failing technology. They require that providers disclose risks, don't allow users to trade in credit, mitigate conflicts of interest and segregate assets, and that systems are easily recoverable.

But even though MAS is putting out these regulations, it still wants to put the onus on the people for any losses.

""Notwithstanding these regulatory measures, consumers must continue to exercise utmost caution when trading in DPTs and must take responsibility for such trading. Regulations cannot protect consumers from losses arising from the inherently speculative and highly risky nature of DPT trading,"" said the regulating body.

MAS also explained stablecoins ""have the potential to be a medium of exchange to facilitate transactions in the digital asset ecosystem, provided they are well-regulated and securely backed."" Which is why the org wants special regulations for them – or at least single currency stablecoin (SCS) where the value in circulation exceeds S$5 million ($3.5 million).

The proposed measures require issuers to hold reserve equivalent assets in cash, use only certain currencies as the reference fiat currency, be clear about redemption rights via published white papers, and keep at least half the amount of annual operating expenses at hand in case of company collapse – or S$1 million ($700,000), whichever is higher.

Banks in Singapore will also be let in on the SCS trade.

""Banks in Singapore will be allowed to issue SCS as well, and no additional reserve backing, and prudential requirements will apply when the SCS is issued as a tokenized form of bank liabilities given the existing rigorous capital and liquidity frameworks applied to banks,"" said the org.

The first step for the proposals is a feedback gathering stage. Any passed regulations will harbor a six to nine month transition period so affected parties can adjust.

China's outpaced other CBDC with its digital yuan, reveals pilot study

China's digital currency, the e-CNY, was the most-used token in a cross-border central bank digital currency (CBDC) trial, according to a report published by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS).

The six-week pilot used a custom-designed native blockchain platform called the mBridge ledger. Other participating countries included Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.

The pilot, which is considered the largest cross-border CBDC to date, culminated in 160 payments and transactions totalling over $22 million. China accounted for 142 out of 305 total transactions.

""Project mBridge tests the hypothesis that an efficient, low-cost, real-time and scalable cross-border multi-CBDC arrangement can provide a network of direct central bank and commercial participant connectivity and greatly increase the potential for international trade flows and cross-border business at large,"" explained [PDF] the report's authors.

The project seeks to build a ""minimum viable product"" that will ultimately provide a production-ready system.

India extends tax filing deadline after portal problems

India's government last week announced a seven-day extension of the deadline to file some tax information, due to problems with the portal on which citizens upload their data.

India's Tax Office previously acknowleged [PDF] ""difficulties faced by the taxpayers and other stakeholders in electronic filing of various reports"" and extended the deadline for other filings by a week.

The extensions are an embarrassment to Infosys, which has built much of the digital infrastructure at India's Income Tax Department. The main portal Infosys built proved buggy, unreliable, and was delivered late. The government excoriated the company for its failings. Even a year after the portal went live, problems were still present.

Two weeks ago the GST filing portal build by Infosys experienced a day of significant outages.

With imperfect timing, Kioxia opens new memory fab

Japanese memory maker Kioxia has opened another fabrication plant.

Fab7, at the Yokkaichi Plant in Mie Prefecture, Japan, can produce sixth-generation, 162-layer flash memory and future advanced 3D flash memory. The plant is expected to start shipping product in early 2023.

But the facility is unlikely to operate at full capacity for some time. Global demand for semiconductors has dipped amid a softening global economic outlook that has seen rival SK hynix report nasty buyer behavior and warn a resurgence may be months away.

Kioxia's announcement of the facility appears to acknowledge those difficulties, stating ""Production capacity at Fab7 will ramp up in stages over time, in line with market trends.""

Once operating at full capacity, investment in the facility will top ¥1 trillion ($6.7 billion) with some of that contributed by Japan's government as it seeks to win a chunk of what it hopes will once again be a buoyant semiconductor market.

The latest report by EUBlockchain Observatory, named “EU Blockchain Ecosystem Developments,” tries to measure this combination within the European Union, combining the data on each and every member country from Portugal to Slovakia.

As the original report counts more than 200 pages, Cointelegraph prepared a summary with the intent to capture the most vital information about the state of crypto and blockchain in Europe. Cointelegraph started from a group of countries that are usually labeled as Western European and continues with a review of Northern European states.

Sweden

Numbers: $39.9 million (40 million euros) raised in initial coin offerings (ICOs), 15 blockchain startups launched.

Regulation and legislation: According to the report, the country still lacks any definite crypto and blockchain legislation: “One must often use the existing legal framework and force blockchain to fit within that framework.” The principal supervisory authorities in the country are the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority and the Swedish Data Protection Agency.

Taxes: While the report lacks any information about the tax regime regarding crypto in the country, the local tax advisers specify that capital gains from selling crypto are subject to a 30% tax.

Notable initiatives: The Swedish land-ownership authority Lantmäteriet began testing blockchain technology in 2016, which resulted in a pilot project to develop future real estate transactions by using smart contracts. In June 2018, developers completed the first successful transaction on the platform. Together with Nasdaq, one of Sweden’s major banks, SEB, initiated the Nordic Fund Ledger — a consortium to improve mutual fund trading by applying blockchain. An initiative should have been launched in 2020, but by the publishing time, there is no evidence it did.

Local players: 3Box, a decentralized user data storage system, AIAR, an Ethereum-based education platform, and Bitrefill, a digital gift card and mobile airtime provider that accepts crypto as a payment method.

Denmark

Numbers: $32.4 million (32.5 million euros) of total funds raised by blockchain projects, 24 blockchain startups.

Regulation and legislation: Denmark has no laws specifically addressing cryptocurrencies. In 2021, Danske Bank, the largest bank in Denmark, stated that it won’t offer any cryptocurrency services to customers itself, but also that it wouldn’t interfere with transactions coming from crypto platforms.

Taxes: According to Coincub, crypto gains incur an income tax of around 37%: “If you’re a high earner, your crypto gains — as part of your overall income — could go up to 52% tax.”

Notable initiatives: In 2018, Copenhagen-based shipping giant Maersk and IBM announced the launch of TradeLens, a blockchain-enabled shipping solution designed to promote more efficient and secure global trade.

Local players: As the report specifies, perhaps the most important names among the Danish crypto startups would be the ones that were established in the country but registered in other jurisdictions, such as Chainalysis, Blockshipping and MakerDAO.

Finland

Numbers: 18 blockchain startups

Regulation and legislation: The chief supervisory authority for everything crypto-related in the country is the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority. In 2019, the Act on Virtual Currency Providers came into effect. It demands registration from any entity that aims at Finnish customers while providing or marketeering its crypto-related services. The Virtual Currency Act does not draw any distinctions between different types of digital currencies.

Taxes: Profits from the exchange or sale of crypto are subject to capital gains tax, which makes up 30% of the income not exceeding $29,922 (30,000 euros) and 34% on the excess above this limit.

Notable initiatives: Back in 2018, the Finnish government announced the collaboration with Essentia to build blockchain-based solutions for smart logistics.

Local players: SOMA (SOcial MArketplace), a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) platform on Ethereum for trading and exchange of physical goods, LocalBitcoins, a P2P platform for digital currencies, and Haja Networks, a developer of distributed and decentralized database solutions based on blockchain solutions.

Norway

Numbers: $26.9 million (27 millions euros) of total equity funding, 22 blockchain solution providers.

Regulation and legislation: The advisory and supervisory authorities regarding blockchain and crypto are the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), Norges Bank and the Norwegian Tax Authority. The FSA has previously noted that a legal framework and rules for investor protection are needed if cryptocurrencies become a suitable investment for consumers. However, according to the report, “It is unlikely that Norway will enact additional legislation on cryptocurrencies until the EU adopts its flagship cryptocurrency legislation, the Regulation on Markets for Crypto-Assets (MiCA).”

Taxes: As in other Scandinavian countries, crypto assets in Norway are subject to the general capital gains tax. The annual tax rate for private individuals constitutes 22%; the same percentage goes for legal entities due to a flat corporate income tax rate. However, an individual would pay more if his yearly income exceeds certain levels.

Notable initiatives: In 2021, The FSA established a regulatory sandbox to encourage fintech innovation. The Central Bank of Norway is actively exploring a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which is now proceeding through a two-year phase of technical testing.

Local players: Choose, a cryptocurrency platform backed by CO2 emission permits, ViPi Cash, an online platform facilitating global money transfers using blockchain technology, and Diwala, a decentralized platform for skill verification of individuals through the decentralized ledger technology.

Latvia

Numbers: 15 blockchain startups

Regulation and legislation: Crypto remains largely underregulated in the country. In 2020, the chief local financial regulator, the Financial and Capital Market Commission, urged investors to “be particularly vigilant, as cryptocurrencies operate in an infrastructure that is currently characterized by lower regulation than in the financial and capital markets.”

Taxes: The Latvian PIT Act defines crypto as a capital asset subject to the general capital gains tax, which is 20%.

Notable initiatives: In 2019, the Economic Ministry of Latvia introduced two blockchain-based pilot projects. The first one should strengthen the supervisory capacity of the State Revenue Service and reduce the shadow economy through the implementation of a blockchain-based cash register. The second would ease the process of acquiring limited liability company status by using blockchain systems in the Enterprise Registry.

In 2021, the national air carrier airBaltic added Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ether (ETH) as payment options. It started to accept Bitcoin (BTC) as early as 2014.

Local players: Blockvis, a blockchain development and consulting group, Velvet, a blockchain-powered solution for online identification, and Soft-FX, a software developer, which collaborated with a list of major cryptocurrency platforms such as Binance, Bifinex and others.

Lithuania

Numbers: 31 blockchain startups, $1.09 billion (1.1 billion euros) raised by local startups

Regulation and legislation: The report calls Lithuania “one of the most pro-blockchain countries in Europe.” It became one of the first countries to issue regulations on ICOs back in 2018. From 2019, every digital assets provider needs to be registered with the country’s Centre for Registers.

Taxes: Corporate tax for the crypto companies stands at 15% and the same flat rate goes for the individual’s income.

Notable initiatives: In 2018, the Bank of Lithuania launched a digital currency sandbox called LB Chain, which is envisioned to become a prototype for central bank-issued blockchain-backed coins.

Local players: DappRadar, a market intelligence vendor for decentralized applications (DApps), Bankera, a blockchain-backed digital bank, and BirDegree, a blockchain-based and gamified online education platform.

Estonia

Numbers: $284 million (285 million euros) raised, 200+ blockchain solutions providers

Regulation and legislation: Estonia was the first European country to provide clear regulations and guidelines for digital currencies. The local law recognizes digital currencies as “value represented in digital form that is digitally transferable, preservable, or tradable, and that natural persons or legal persons accept as a payment instrument.” However, digital currencies are not considered legal tender and do not otherwise possess the legal status of money.

Taxes: Digital currencies are qualified as property and their exchange is subject to a capital gains tax of 20%.

Notable initiatives: The blockchain-enabled e-Residency program allows anyone to start and manage an EU-based company completely online and, according to the report, “has proven a significant facilitator of blockchain business activity in the country.” However, it should be noted that when the country tightened the definition of virtual asset service providers (VASPs), more than 1,000 licenses were revoked from crypto firms.

The country utilizes a highly scalable and privacy-focused keyless signature infrastructure blockchain, which is being used in healthcare, property, business and succession registries, along with the state gazette and the country’s digital court system.

Local players: Idealogic, a full-cycle software development firm with strong expertise in product design and custom software development in Fintech, Cryptodevelopers.net, a developer of cryptocurrency wallets, and Solve.care, a healthcare blockchain technology company.

Key takeaways

Discussing the report takeaways with Cointelegraph, Kristina Lillieneke, CEO at BlackBird Law and a member of EU Blockchain Observatory, explained the rather low numbers demonstrated by Scandinavian countries regarding the crypto industry. While she agreed with the important factor of high taxes, Lillieneke pointed out such regional problems as regulatory uncertainty and fear-mongering among banks and media.

“Most banks have been blocking their customers from trading in crypto and founders of crypto companies have had their bank accounts forcibly closed. As most people are still dependent on the fiat banking system in the Nordics this is a strong deterrent to making innovations,” she said.

The expert drew the example of Sweden, where the local financial authority, Finansinspektionen, leads a non-stop crusade against Bitcoin. Erik Thedéen, the head of Finansinspektionen, has written numerous articles sharply criticizing Bitcoin and claiming it is only used by criminals to launder money and finance terrorism and is a large threat to the environment.

Recent: What the Russia-Ukraine war has revealed about crypto

Lillieneke expressed pessimism regarding any possibility of a U-turn in the Nordics, even with the upcoming pan-European MiCA framework. In her opinion, MiCA itself doesn’t contain any cure for the familiar problems:

“The regulations in Europe seem only to aim at limiting the market and innovation around everything that is decentralized and has the potential of empowering people while it favors centralized solutions run by the states, the EU or big-tech.”

More controversy comes with the recent transformation of Estonia, which has been one of the earliest blockchain adopters in the world and conducted a crypto-friendly policy until 2021, when the new guidelines for VASP licensing demolished all the previous gains for the industry. However, speaking to Cointelegraph, Marianna Charalambous, research project manager at the University of Nicosia and member of the EU Blockchain Observatory, noted that the country still remains one of the leaders in public blockchain implementation.

“Estonia remains an advocate of public sector blockchain initiatives on a national and European level, as a wide number of blockchain applications are being implemented in the public sector. Looking at the use of blockchain on an institutional level we can identify a different approach compared to the private sector which has been affected by the new legislation,” she stated.",blockchain,cointelegraph

To put this in perspective, data from Layoffs.fyi found that over 700 tech startups have experienced layoffs this year, impacting at least 93,519 employees globally. It has also been reported that tech giants like Google, Netflix and Apple are undergoing massive job cuts.

While many of these layoffs are likely due to an economic downturn, this has resulted in an overwhelming amount of talent flocking to early-stage Web3 companies. For example, Andrew Masanto, a serial entrepreneur who has founded a number of startups, told Cointelegraph that he recently launched Nillion, a startup specializing in decentralized computation, to help ensure privacy and confidentiality for Web3 platforms.

Although Nillion is still in its early stages, the technological innovation behind the company has already proven to be appealing. Since the company’s inception in October this year, leading talent from companies like Nike, Indiegogo and Coinbase have joined the growing startup.

For instance, Slava Rubin, founder of the crowdfunding website Indiegogo, told Cointelegraph that he had recently joined Nillion as the company’s chief business officer based on the opportunity to join a startup with an innovative business model.

“The tech behind Nillion is massively innovative, as it focuses on advancing secure multiparty computation (MPC). MPC is known for being slow and unable to work for certain use cases. The risk of failure doesn’t concern me here since it’s such a huge opportunity to solve this problem,” he said.

The notion of building technology to advance MPC also attracted Lindsay Danas Cohen to Nillion. Cohen previously served as associate general counsel at Coinbase before joining Nillion this year as the company’s general counsel.

Although Coinbase announced in June that it was cutting its staff by 18%, Cohen explained in a recent blog post that she left Coinbase to join Nillion due to the opportunity to help advance privacy and data sharing through MPC. “This would be a true zero-to-one innovation,” she wrote.

While the crypto industry continues to face a bear market, it’s clear that the projects being built during this period are seen as an exciting opportunity. “I built Indiegogo during the 2008 bear market, and I think we will see the same thing in this market. In about three to five years, we will see some very strong companies emerge that know how to use capital efficiently,” Rubin remarked.

Indeed, well-funded Web3 companies continue to hire, while large tech companies face layoffs and hiring freezes. Sebastien Borget, co-founder and chief operating officer of The Sandbox, told Cointelegraph that the popular metaverse platform currently has a total of 103 job openings. “The excitement of working in the front row of Web3 is big, and we are enjoying this interest towards our open positions,” he said.

According to Borget, The Sandbox has grown to 404 employees this year, almost doubling in size from its 208-employee workforce it had in December 2021. Borget added that The Sandbox’s virtual real estate known as “LANDs” is now worth over $1 billion in total market cap.

Moreover, as Web3 companies continue to bring on both new and acquired talent, young jobseekers seem to be displaying a greater desire to obtain the skills needed to join these firms.

Priyanka Mathikshara Mathialagan, president of the Stanford Blockchain Club, told Cointelegraph that she has seen an increasing number of undergraduate students at Stanford taking blockchain-focused courses in preparation for careers after graduation.

Recent: What the Russia-Ukraine war has revealed about crypto

“This year, we had more students enrolled in professor Dan Boneh’s cryptography class than those enrolled in traditional computer science courses,” she remarked.

Despite the bear market, Mathialagan also believes that there have been significant improvements made within the Web3 space, resulting in a more positive outlook toward the sector. For example, she mentioned that the Ethereum Merge that took place on Sept. 15 has helped ensure a more energy-efficient platform, creating appeal for students that may want to leverage the Ethereum network for Web3 projects. Mathialagan added that while a numerous amount of theoretical research has been performed for years within fields like computer science, Ph.D. students are considering Web3 due to new opportunities for advancement. She said:

“The math used in theoretical computer science and cryptography is similar to the math needed to advance zero-knowledge proof-based applications. There is now an industry that wants to pay Ph.D. students for their research and put these findings to use. For example, there is a large demand for distributed system engineers since every single blockchain is really a distributed system. These are the people who can design consensus algorithms and new architectures for scalable and secure blockchains.”

This seems to be the case, as Masanto shared that Nillion has hired 10 engineers within the last six months. Borget added that The Sandbox is currently hiring 17 engineers, along with game designers, architects and other individuals capable of supporting brands building in the company’s metaverse.

Skepticism remains

While it’s notable that Web3 companies are actively hiring, a number of concerns remain. For instance, although companies remain focused on building during a bear market, fundraising may be problematic.

Given this, it’s important to point out that Nillion is currently being bootstrapped by its founding team. A spokesperson from Delphi Digital, a crypto-focused research firm, also told Cointelegraph that while the company is currently hiring across the board, no funds have been raised.

“We have been completely bootstrapped up until now.” While impressive, running a company based on personal finances or operating revenue may be concerning for job seekers. For instance, Mathialagan noted that students starting a career in Web3 want to be assured that the company will exist two to three years down the road.

Jessica Walker, chief marketing officer of Fluid Finance — a fintech company focused on revolutionizing banking with blockchain — further told Cointelegraph that it is a waiting game to see what companies have the strongest communities and teams capable of withstanding the crypto winter, adding:

“It’s important for organizations to build partnerships and roll out products, while also being able to budget their overhead costs during this time.”

Moreover, Mathialagan believes that it’s challenging for students, along with individuals within the Web2 sector, to get connected with Web3 companies. For instance, while companies like Nillion have brought on individuals from organizations like Coinbase, Indiegogo and Nike, Masanto shared that he already knew a handful of these people prior to hiring.

Recent: Does the IMF have a vendetta against cryptocurrencies?

Walker also remarked that due to the bear market, recruiters need to pay additional attention to detail when onboarding new team members. “Some uncertainty comes from new hires about the security of their role, especially during a bear market. At Fluid, we often try to hire from our community first,” she said.

Although strategic, Mathialagan mentioned that the Stanford Blockchain Club is compiling a list of job postings to help students connect better with Web3 firms as more hiring takes place: “For students, hiring remains the biggest single problem even beyond security issues faced by Web3 companies today.”",blockchain,cointelegraph
185,An introduction to decentralized NFT catalogs,https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjItMTAvZGMyYjM3MmItNGFlNS00MjIxLWEwNWEtODExYmQ5NjBiNGI3LmpwZw==.jpg,30/10/2022,"After last year’s hype over nonfungible tokens, people have been speculating about their potential. It created a bubble of unfounded expectations.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/an-introduction-to-decentralized-nft-catalogs,"Over the last year, venture capitalists poured more than $4.6 billion into infrastructure and projects related to nonfungible tokens (NFTs). This infrastructure now needs users. They will come when people understand that they can apply these NFTs not just for speculative purposes but to design and structure their everyday activities. For these, they don’t need NFTs — they need to sort their lives out. And, decentralized catalogs are there to help them do it.

We can think about an NFT as a book someone owns, and this ownership is recorded on the blockchain. But what we’re actually missing is the library.

Not just a flower, but a garden

Multiple NFTs making up a collection form a system. This system has a structure through the standards it uses. If you’ve ever visited CryptoKitties, you’ve probably noticed the museum-like categorization of the Kitties and their attributes in their “catalog.”

A catalog of CryptoKitties

However, each item in the collection means nothing without the collection itself. You can’t take a CryptoKitty out of the original smart contract. You can copy the image or create a fractional version of it, but you will not be able to transfer its value if the derivative version of your CryptoKitty isn’t linked to the original collection. This means that the value of each NFT is not determined by a stand-alone item in the collection but by the collection itself.

In simple words, if we take a step back from each item in almost any NFT collection, we’ll discover that the actual value is not in a single NFT itself but in a perfect system of multiple NFTs bound together by one smart contract. By doing this, we stop staring at a single flower and realize we are in a well-designed garden.

When applying all the standardization approaches and structuring all the data properly, we are creating systematic lists of items publicly stored on the blockchain — decentralized catalogs.

How decentralized cataloging can add new value

Everyone has heard of Guinness World Records, Michelin Guide or IUCN Red List. In a nutshell, they are all extremely valuable catalogs. Behind each of them is a managing authority that invests its brand and expertise in bringing value to every new iteration of the catalog. Even if the rules of adding new items to centralized lists are not transparent or even questioned, this approach is sustainable.

However, the biggest problem these catalogs present is an extremely high barrier to entry for new, valuable lists to enter the market. Through NFT infrastructure and a Web3 mindset, though, we can democratize the process of building valuable catalogs. The difference between a normal list and a decentralized catalog is the potential value it can accumulate.

When you own a CryptoPunk, you are a co-owner of the CryptoPunks collection. Yes, that CryptoPunk may represent your inner self, but on its own, it’s just a JPEG. As we have already discovered, the value is in the collection itself, and the value is created not only by the expertise that went into designing the character generator but also by the owners of the collection.

By building an economy powered by co-ownership, we can make future-proof and transparent catalog systems. While yet another restaurant list will hardly add something new to society, there are plenty of situations where decentralized cataloging makes sense.

The library

Let’s imagine the most basic use case of decentralized cataloging. You own a collection of books and you want to share these books with someone. You know, however, there’s a good chance that those you lend your books to will never return them. That’s life.

So, you start a very simple process of making a record of each book you’re sharing to the decentralized catalog; only each record is actually an NFT.

The person taking the book decides to use it to put his own books on the catalog and share them with someone else, and that person shares it with their friend, too. In a few years, your book-sharing club will become an internet phenomenon, with more and more people adding books to the catalog.

It’s only a matter of time before big publishers join in as well. Some publishers may start adding newly published books to distribute them through the catalog system you created. As we know about NFT compatibility, it’s clear that all the NFT marketplaces and infrastructure we have today will become handy tools and interfaces that will work right out of the box. No need for additional listing websites, centralized bookstores or payment solutions.

And it all started with you, who added the first book as an NFT to the shared collection of books.

The same approach is used in Cointelegraph’s Historical NFT Collection. It is a catalog of news from the largest crypto media outlet, and Cointelegraph readers are choosing which news should be added to it.

The real future of the NFT standard is ordinary, and that’s great. We use many ordinary things every day that were overpriced when they entered the market. As production and technology evolved, however, prices dropped and made them available for everyone.

The same thing will happen with NFTs. The only thing we need to do now is stop staring at the tulips and start designing a garden.

In addition, the giant crypto service provider recently unveiled its new decentralized Web 3 oracle network.

The shift into Web 3 is skyrocketing gradually. More events, projects, applications, and activities are coming with more innovative additions. In addition, the new belief surrounding Web3 as the next future with greater possibilities fuels its popularity.

Will Chainlink Continue Leading The Game?

This new project from Binance serves as the first major competition to the other oracle services networks. Chainlink (LINK) has been the lead among others of its type. Chainlink’s robust infrastructure has helped it create a strong data feed network. Hence, it could bridge real-world online data and blockchain-based systems.

The new Binance Oracle is to operate as a data feed network by creating a link between real-world data and smart contracts on blockchains. This means it will enable smart contracts using real-world inputs and outputs.

Binance Oracle Will First Operate On BNB Chain

According to its plan for the new oracle project, Binance will first use the services on its BNB Chain. Then, it will enable almost 1,400 DApps and different Web 3 partners to access some existing data sources.

Following the unveiling, many projects are taking several actions already. For example, over ten projects on the BNB Chain have integrated smart contracts to flow with Binance’s bird program.

Before now, Binance disclosed that the oracle services from the new project are chain-agnostic. But there will be support for more blockchain networks in the future.

Gwendolyn Regina, the Investment Director at BNB Chain, spoke concerning the development. The director noted the wave of interest in the new internet through its shift to well-connected smart contracts. Also, it has been essential to use oracles to heighten the knowledge of the smart contract. This will connect it with the current happenings outside the blockchain. So, blockchain activities could quickly respond and adjust to external events with the proper flow.

According to director Regina, the new Binance Oracle will provide stable and reliable reports. This will represent complete accuracy and accessibility features. Hence, the oracle will become a significant contributor to Web 3.

Operations Of Binance Oracle

Binance has placed some distinctive features for its new project. First, the overall performance of Binance Oracle targets a higher level of reliability. The network sources price data from several centralized exchanges (CEXs) and aggregates prices through an intelligent algorithm.

While providing data feeds, the Binance public key is meant to verify the authenticity of the data multiple times. This will eliminate cases of tampering.

Regarding individual data feeds, Binance Oracle depends on Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS). This is reputable in providing a distributed mechanism that removes all failure traces.

The fourth annual Bermuda Tech Summit was presented by the BDA, in partnership with government’s Economic Development Department (EDD) and FinTech industry association, NEXT Bermuda.

The immediate economic impact of this event at the Hamilton Princess Hotel from October 26-28, which had over 300 delegates (nearly 80 from overseas) including lodging, transportation, food and beverage, retail and recreation was estimated at $527,000 and supported 115 local jobs.

Fiona Beck, independent director and BDA board member, who led a conversation with SailGP at the Bermuda Tech Summit said, “The BDA continues to inspire, and the energy from SailGP for Bermuda was exciting to see. They are true world leaders in innovation and sustainability for sailing and they describe Bermuda as a pinnacle location, both on and off water. We are fortunate to have such committed partners.”

John Narraway, NEXT Bermuda, Founding Committee Member said, “This year’s summit is a realisation of several years of focused and collaborative effort to build momentum in the technology and digital assets space. We are witnessing the growth of new jobs as our member companies scale-up their local operations, hiring experienced Bermudians transitioning from the traditional finance world to take on roles in areas such as compliance, risk management and human resources.”

Denis PItcher, Chief FinTech Advisor, Government of Bermuda said, “The BDA has done an outstanding job of pulling together an excellent, engaging and well attended Tech Summit despite the global downturn in traditional and digital asset markets. The attendance and feedback of the event confirms that FinTech continues to have strong momentum and growth ahead which matches the strong pipeline of digital asset business, insurers and funds that are looking to get licensed in Bermuda.”

Dan Thomson, CMO, InsurAce said, “We did not know what to expect from the Bermuda Tech Summit, but we have been blown away by the incredible hospitality and innovation shown by local government, businesses, and individuals. InsurAce has been looking for a regulatory framework that fits with our future vision and we are delighted to be exploring the opportunity to build our business in Bermuda. We cannot wait to come back.”

David Hart, BDA CEO said, “On behalf of the BDA, I want to thank our partners, sponsors, speakers and engaged guests for making this such an incredible Tech Summit that showcased Bermuda's dynamic and growing tech sector and innovation leadership.”

Without the generous support of our sponsors: Hub Culture, RELM, Appleby, SailGP, Carey Olsen, Jewel Bank, Walkers, and Bittrex Global; as well as Apex, Blockchain Triangle, Bloktime, Clarien, Chainproof, Coinzoom, Global Policy House, Hive, and 24 Exchange, we could not put on this in-person event. Our spirits partner was Goslings.

Day one’s keynote fireside chat with Bermuda’s Premier and Minister of Finance, The Hon. David Burt, JP, MP and Michael Casey, Chief Content Officer, CoinDesk, was followed by a regulatory panel, a crypto lending and yield products panel, a NEXT Bermuda case study, a digital banking panel and a funds panel. Day one was rounded off with a SailGP welcome reception on the Regency Terrace.

Day two began with a conversation with SailGP, and was followed by a digital identity panel, a capital formation in a bear market panel, conversation about Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), a (re)Insurance reimagined panel, and concluded with a panel entitled: ‘Is the Price Right for Trust and Liquidity?’

The final day began with an ‘ESG and DABs’ panel followed by a panel dealing with ‘Out of this world infrastructure’, a panel ‘Building and Nurturing a Sustainable Tech Ecosystem,’ and a panel about cyber security and concluded with a discussion about the future of technology. The wrap party sponsored by RELM Insurance featured live music and signature cocktails at the picturesque Fort Hamilton.

“The EDD’s Tech Education Day and TechAwards will be held 31 October, following which Bermuda Tech Week 2022 will officially come to a close,” Mr. Hart said. “The BDA looks forward to building on our success and bringing back an even better event in November 2023.”

Meanwhile in European football, one of the sports biggest stars has signed a new partnership deal.

There’s more sports and crypto action outside of European football, however, and that’s why we dive in every weekend with The Sports Slice. Let’s take a look at some of the biggest sports news across the globe around NFTs and blockchain technology.

The Sports Slice

Messi Signs On With Bitget

Argentinian football legend Lionel Messi isn’t new to crypto. When he signed on with Parisian club PSG last year, an undisclosed amount of PSG tokens were included in the deal. Earlier this year, Messi continued his engagement by signing a $20M deal with fan token platform Socios.

A new deal enters the fray this past week courtesy of crypto exchange Bitget. The move comes on the heels of the World Cup, the sport’s biggest event – which takes place every four years – and one that has yet to see Messi raise the trophy.

English Premier League Eyes ~$35M Deal With Sorare

Last week’s Slice covered the launch of Sorare’s new NBA fantasy beta platform. No reason to pump the brakes now, as Sorare is clearly seeing some momentum; reports have emerged over the past week that Sorare is on the verge of closing a roughly $35M deal with the Premier League, expanding the blockchain fantasy game’s dominance across the soccer vertical.

While the deal is not yet set in stone, it is reportedly near the finish line and is likely a multi-year deal that will encapsulate the league’s 20 clubs for usage rights within Sorare’s fantasy gaming platform. Additionally, it is believed that the deal is slated to replace an existing deal with ConsenSys, which was also a ‘nearly completed’ deal but one that never saw the finish line.

The English Premier League has also been in conversations with Dapper Labs.

Hong Kong Rugby Union Explores NFTs

The Hong Kong Rugby Union has opened up their own NFT marketplace, according to a press release shared with Bitcoinist. The marketplace comes courtesy of a partnership between the Hong Kong Rugby Union and NFT whitelabel platform firm NuArca Labs.

Hong Kong Rugby Union, which is the region’s official governing body for rugby, joins a growing list of reputable rugby partners for NuArca Labs, which includes the likes of Major League Rugby and Rugby League World Cup 2021.

Crypto Sponsorship Risk Level

A new report from SportsPro took a high-level evaluation at current sport sponsorship categories, landing crypto sponsors – who have been emerging into sports far and wide – as ‘high risk.’

The reasoning is sound; 2022’s bear market has seen substantial reductions in new crypto sponsor entrants compared to last year’s boom. Furthermore, bear market conditions have led to some deals dissolving, often by necessity – such as Voyager’s deals with the Dallas Mavericks and the National Women’s Soccer League, or Terra Luna’s deal with the MLB’s Washington Nationals.

However, most teams and leagues are willing to have some degree of risk in their sports sponsorship portfolio. Crypto sponsors join the likes of betting, tech, and even airline sponsors in the ‘high risk’ category.

Sports Stadiums In The Metaverse

A new deal between Warner Bros Discovery Sports and Infinite Reality looks to build out sports venues in the metaverse. It is Warner Bros Discovery’s first foray into building fandom in virtual environments targeted around sports communities in particular.

It is not, however, the firms first foray into NFTs or other web3-associated tech. In fact, quite the opposite. The parent conglomerate company oversees DC Comics, which is gearing up for Superman NFTs, as our team covered in recent days. We’ve also seen recent engagement from the Warner Bros behemoth around IP like Lord Of The Rings, and we’ve seen the firm pair up with NFT-first companies such as Nifty.

What exactly this sports-centric initiative from Warner Bros Discovery will look like remains to be seen, but sports fans should keep an eye out for new AR/VR experiences with their favorite sports coming to market in the months ahead.

190,BUG: Invest In Cybersecurity With This Concentrated ETF,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1366728672/image_1366728672.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,30/10/2022,"Cybersecurity, our favorite growth theme for medium-to-long-term investment horizon. Learn why we recommend BUG ETF to gain exposure to cybersecurity industry.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550873-bug-invest-cybersecurity-concentrated-etf,"TU IS

Cybersecurity is one of our favourite growth themes for a medium-to-long-term investment horizon. Not only has growth in this sector been particularly resilient to the current economic slowdown, but valuations have also become attractive relative to long-term growth prospects. For investors looking for a cost-effective and convenient way to build portfolio exposure to this theme, we think that the Global X Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:BUG) could be a great choice.

Growth Prospects Not Fully Appreciated By Investors

Despite the increase in frequency and cost of data security breaches across government agencies and corporate enterprises in recent years, there is still significant underinvestment in cybersecurity.

So far in 2022, there have already been multiple major cyber attack incidents that have cost U.S enterprises millions in damages. According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report 2022, the average cost of a data breach in the U.S is around US$9.4 million, which is more than twice the global average of US$4.4 million. The T-Mobile (TMUS) data breach in 2021, which affected around 80 million U.S residents, ended up costing the company US$350 million to settle a class action lawsuit. In an SEC filing following the settlement, T-Mobile stated that it would spend US$150 million this year and in 2023 on cybersecurity.

For many years, cyberattacks appear to be specifically targeting large corporations and government agencies due to the massive volumes of personal data held by these entities. However, as these entities beef up their cybersecurity, future attacks will become increasingly more difficult and risky for hackers. Small and medium enterprises with tiny cybersecurity budgets and thus weaker defenses, could increasingly become the next target of choice.

From our perspective, there is enormous scope for growth in cybersecurity spending due to persistent underinvestment over the years. This is in stark contrast to the breathtaking boom in cloud computing and blockchain technologies. Cybersecurity spending has only recently begun to emerge more prominently on the IT budgets of large companies that have come to appreciate the risks and cost of cyberattacks the hard way. As the modern world becomes increasingly more digitalized, interconnected, and data-dependent, we expect cybersecurity spending growth to accelerate.

Cybersecurity Will Be Multi-Layered And Constantly Evolving

The ever-increasing sophistication of information technology that is being applied in more areas of government services and businesses, means that there will be a greater number and variety of connections that could become vulnerable to cyberattacks. The sheer sophistication and scope of detecting and defending against all types of cyberattacks mean that cybersecurity will be multi-layered in nature, requiring uniquely different solutions for different parts of an IT infrastructure. Furthermore, as new technologies are added to existing infrastructure, cybersecurity solutions will need to constantly evolve to meet new challenges and requirements.

This multi-layered nature of cybersecurity could present a difficult problem for investors: there is unlikely to be a single cybersecurity company, not even a handful, that will end up dominating the industry. Just like how diverse the software industry has become, the same is likely to happen to cybersecurity. Therefore, the odds are stacked against the stock picker who is looking for that one big winner. Instead, we think that the optimal way to execute this bullish view on the cybersecurity theme is to invest in a concentrated basket of leading companies that are dominating in their respective areas of cybersecurity.

Global X Cybersecurity ETF

According to fund information provided by Global X, BUG seeks to invest in companies that stand to potentially benefit from the increased adoption of cybersecurity technology, such as those whose principal business is in the development and management of security protocols preventing intrusion and attacks to systems, networks, applications, computers, and mobile devices. The fund seeks to provide returns that correspond generally to the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Indxx Cybersecurity Index.

BUG is one of the most concentrated among liquid cybersecurity ETFs with more than US$50 million in assets under management, including First Trust Nasdaq CEA Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR), iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (IHAK), and ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK).

BUG is heavily concentrated on large cybersecurity software companies with a portfolio of just 24 holdings with net assets of US$1.11 billion. As of 27 October, BUG's top 5 largest holdings make up close to 39% of the portfolio: Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD), and CyberArk Software (CYBR).

Global X

We like BUG's concentration on cybersecurity software companies (57.5%) which enjoy several advantages over other categories of cybersecurity companies. Software solutions can be deployed more rapidly and are more scalable than hardware-supported solutions. More importantly, software companies offer a differentiated solution that is less likely to face direct competition.

Global X

Valuations And Expense Ratio

BUG's portfolio valuation at 54x P/E and 9.2x P/B may seem extremely expensive, but we note that this could be misleading for investors. It is extremely challenging to value growth companies that are in the very early stages of a multi-decade boom. Not only do some of BUG's holdings have very little earnings or even suffer losses due to the need to invest heavily in R&D, but many are also spending heavily on sales and marketing to expand market share. Thus, revenues at some of these companies could be growing at rates above 20%-30% annually with little earnings to show.

To be sure, investing in cybersecurity is certainly going to be more risky compared to investing in a mature industry. We acknowledge this risk and recommend that investors consider their own risk appetite and investment objectives in deciding if the cybersecurity theme is a suitable investment for their portfolio.

BUG's expense ratio is moderately high at 0.5%, but this is generally in line with its peers.

Seeking Alpha

Trading metrics for BUG are healthy with low and stable spreads, healthy volumes, and the fund trading close to NAV.

In Conclusion

We like BUG's concentration on cybersecurity software companies and we see enormous scope for growth in cybersecurity spending due to persistent underinvestment over the years.

On the surface, BUG appears to be grossly overvalued based on regular measures comparing share price to earnings and book value. However, relative to the sector's long-term growth prospects, we view the risk-reward as attractive.

192,"Dustin Trammell On The Original White Paper Day, Corresponding With Satoshi And The Growing Need For Bitcoin",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/t_share/MTgwODA0OTg3MDA0MjAwMjk2/satoshi.jpg,30/10/2022,Trammell was one of the first to recognize Bitcoin’s potential and offers unique perspective for Bitcoiners celebrating White Paper Day 2022.,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/trammell-on-satoshi-bitcoin-white-paper-day,"On October 31, 2008, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto submitted their white paper outlining “Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System” to Metzdowd.com’s cryptography mailing list. Shortly after the project’s launch in January 2009, a mailing list subscriber named Dustin Trammell began contributing to the project, asking questions and submitting bugs to the paper’s author and becoming one of the first people on earth to be “orange pilled” by Bitcoin’s formative outline.

“When first reading it, I remember being impressed that someone had discovered a way to prevent double-spending with digital currency,” Trammell recalled. “Being fairly Libertarian minded and interested in alternative currencies and economic systems, I was excited for the software to be released so that I could take a look at it in action.”

Nakamoto’s paper outlined a vision of digital currency that would enable direct payments between parties “without going through a financial institution.” It explained the potential roles of digital signatures, a network of nodes screening for valid transactions and the incentives of block rewards and transaction fees. And, looking back some 14 years later, other aspects of the introduction seem particularly prescient to Trammell as well.

“When I initially read the paper, the importance of the proof-of-work consensus mechanism didn’t really sink in, whereas today I’ve realized that proof-of-work consensus really is the innovation,” he said. “I also first read the paper with more of an eye to the technology, whereas reading it today it is a bit more obvious that there was an inherent, generalized decentralization philosophy to it as well.”

Corresponding With Satoshi

Trammell, aka I)ruid, is an information security research scientist, venture capitalist and avid cosplayer. That inaugural White Paper Day (as October 31 is now known in the Bitcoin community) served as his introduction to digital currencies, but he quickly found that the project sparked an enduring interest. He became one of the first Bitcoin miners, back when it was possible to successfully find blocks with a CPU, and he received bitcoin directly from Nakamoto.

“From my brief correspondence with Satoshi, they seemed to have a very pragmatic view of technology and seemed to be open-minded to suggestions and advice, whether they ended up going that direction or not,” Trammell explained. “Satoshi and I specifically had some conversation around the insecurities of the ability to send bitcoin by IP address, and Satoshi ended up dropping that feature from the software entirely.”

Based on that original experience, Trammell encourages anyone celebrating this year’s White Paper Day to think of Nakamoto’s seminal work as a practical blueprint, outlining a project that should be somewhat amenable to change if it has buy-in from its community.

“I think had Satoshi stuck around longer than they did, they would have been open minded and willing to work with the consensus of the Bitcoin developer community to take Bitcoin in the direction that was best for Bitcoin, whether it stuck to the original outline of the white paper or not,” he said. “I think Satoshi was pragmatic enough to do what they thought was right for Bitcoin at the time and under potentially ever-changing circumstances.”

From A Cypherpunk Mailing List To $396 Billion

Despite its inauspicious beginnings and straightforward nature — running less than 3,500 words yet introducing the underpinnings of blockchain technology and a $396 billion asset to the world — the Bitcoin white paper has come to be akin to a religious text among diehard Bitcoiners, and it has inspired pale imitations from countless altcoin pumpers. Hosting the white paper text has become an act of defiance against those who might attempt to co-opt the open-source revolution and, as one of Nakamoto’s few messages to the world, it has become much more than a technical roadmap.

But for Trammell, “Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System” ranks as a dictionary-definition white paper, despite any reading between the lines that Bitcoin Core’s proponents or detractors may attempt.

“White papers are essentially a technical description of a problem and a proposed solution to that problem, and Satoshi’s Bitcoin white paper fits that definition perfectly,” he explained. “Anyone that then tries to pigeonhole a technical project into a white paper’s original definition or description of it, like for example the ‘Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision’ folks, are inhibiting the project’s growth and development, and ultimately its success. Technology rarely can continue succeeding without modification, and must be free of constraints to do so, such as any perceived limitation of its original design documentation.”

Celebrating White Paper Day, 14 Years Later

With a unique perspective on how the idea of Bitcoin resonated in 2008 compared to today, Trammell noted that, if anything, Nakamoto’s invention is even more desperately needed now than when it was first introduced.

“The economic environment seems much more dire today than then,” he explained. “Obviously, Bitcoin was released during the 2008 economic crisis, but since then we’ve had multiple other crises, and today we’re actively observing fiat currencies fail around the world… This seems to be a near-perfect storm of the economic environment within which Bitcoin was designed to thrive.”

Still, it is a uniquely Bitcoin thing to do to commemorate the publication date of a brief technical document as much of the world is turning its attention to spooky costumes and trick or treating. But refocusing on Bitcoin’s humble, pseudonymous introduction, its technical underpinnings and quietly-revolutionary fundamentals can serve this community well, as long as the simplicity of its origins aren’t overblown.

“As a big fan of Bitcoin-themed holidays and a big fan of Halloween, I now celebrate both holidays on October 31,” Trammell said. “While the Bitcoin white paper is obviously a very important historical and technical document, we need to remember that it is what it was, which is simply a white paper. It’s a statement of a problem, and a proposed technical solution. Satoshi also coded the solution and released it to the world, and shepherded it for a short time, but beyond that, Bitcoin has a life of its own and technology always grows beyond its original specification, its original function and its original community, including its founders. This is the nature of technology.”",blockchain,bitcoin magazine

The money …",https://www.voanews.com/a/india-to-contribute-500-000-to-un-to-counter-terrorism-/6811448.html,"India will contribute half a million dollars to the United Nations' efforts to counter global terrorism as new and emerging technologies used by terror groups pose fresh threats to governments around the world, the foreign minister said Saturday.

The money will go toward the U.N. Trust Fund for Counter Terrorism and will further strengthen the organization's fight against terrorism, S. Jaishankar said as he addressed a special meeting of the U.N. Counter Terrorism Committee in New Delhi.

It was the first such conference — focused on challenging threats posed by terror groups in the face of new technologies — to be held outside the U.N.'s headquarters in New York.

Jaishankar said new technologies, like encrypted messaging services and blockchain, are increasingly misused by terror groups and malicious actors, sparking an urgent need for the international community to adopt measures to combat the threats.

""Internet and social media platforms have turned into potent instruments in the toolkit of terrorist and militant groups for spreading propaganda, radicalization and conspiracy theories aimed at destabilizing societies,"" he said in his keynote address.

Jaishankar also highlighted the growing threat from the use of unmanned aerial systems such as drones by terror groups and criminal organizations, calling them a challenge for security agencies worldwide.

""In Africa, drones have been used by the terrorist groups to monitor movements of security forces and even of U.N. peacekeepers, making them vulnerable to terrorist attacks,"" he added.

British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly reiterated the dangers of unmanned aerial platforms, saying that such systems were being used to inflict terror, death and destruction.

""Drones are being used currently to target critical national infrastructure and civilian targets in Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine,"" he said. ""This is why we have sanctioned three Iranian military commanders and one Iranian company involved in the supply of drones.""

The special conference kicked off Friday in Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital, which witnessed a massive terror attack in 2008 that left 140 Indian nationals and 26 citizens of 23 other countries dead by terrorists who had entered India from Pakistan.

Jaishankar on Friday said India regretted the U.N. Security Council's inability to act in some cases when it came to proscribing terrorists because of political considerations, undermining its collective credibility and interests. He did not name China but referred to its decision to block U.N. sanctions against leaders of Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistan-based extremist group designated as a terrorist organization by the U.N.

India and the United States sought the sanctions earlier this year. China put the proposed listing of the two terrorists for sanctions on hold on technical grounds, saying it needed more time to study their cases.",blockchain,voa news

Turkey to Integrate Digital Currency with National Digital Identity System",https://www.activistpost.com/2022/10/turkey-to-integrate-digital-currency-with-national-digital-identity-system.html,"By Tom Philips

Turkey is planning to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that will be integrated with the country’s digital identity system and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey’s FAST instant payments service.

The integration will form part of the next phase of the country’s Central Bank Digital Turkish Lira Research and Development Project that will also include testing the use of the CBDC for payments as well as for wholesale banking transactions.

Turkey’s Presidential Strategy and Budget Directorate announced the plans in the Presidential Annual Programme for 2023, which stated that a “blockchain-based central bank digital currency will be put into practice”, according to a CoinDesk Türkiye report.

The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) launched the first phase of its CBDC project in September 2021 when it announced plans for limited closed-circuit testing of a prototype digital Turkish lira network prior to “advanced phases of the pilot study that will reflect broader participation”.

The CBRT was one of 26 central banks that contributed to the Bank for International Settlements’ ‘CBDCs in Emerging Market Economies’ report in April.

The buzz this past week wasn’t with Ethereum or Solana powered NFTs, but rather with new emerging players. That’s right, we saw some ‘unusual suspects’ with blockchains like Cardano and Aptos making noise in the NFT space this past week.

We’ll review those, as well as some of the biggest headlines in the NFT space – including moves from major tech and social behemoths like Twitter and Apple – in our weekly Nutshell. Let’s dive in.

This Week’s Non-Fungible Token News

Twitter’s New ‘NFT Tweet Tiles’

Last week, it was Reddit’s time to shine as the social media platform had a $2.5M day in NFT sales, and sold out of their initial 40K NFT distribution in less than a day. However, this past week was certainly Twitter’s time to take the realm. Between an Elon Musk takeover that would take the company from public to private ownership, and rumors of a new crypto wallet in development, the social media still managed to find time to announce testing of a new NFT feature.

The new feature, titled by the dev team as ‘NFT Tweet Tiles,’ aims to allow a handful of NFT marketplaces and platforms the ability to have in-app displays of NFTs for buying and selling.

Apple Addresses NFTs… With A Lot To Be Desired

Let’s say you have an app that is listed on the Apple App Store: can you, or can’t you, sell NFTs? Well, if there was any question before, you can put it to rest after this week. However, the answer isn’t likely the most appetizing for those educated with the space.

Apple’s new NFT terms for it’s app store specify that while NFTs are approved for minting, listing, and transferring, sales of NFTs on apps would be subject to Apple’s criticized collection fees (roughly 30%). Additionally, NFT ownership within apps cannot “unlock features or functionality” within any app, meaning that you can throw in-app utility potential out of the window.

Overall, it’s simply not a model that makes sense for NFTs, making this progress in name only for Apple and blockchain technology.

New DC Comics NFTs

Iconic comic book studio DC Comics has rolled out ‘Superman’ NFTs as their latest digital engagement activation. It’s the latest powerhouse IP to see ‘digitization’ via NFTs as DC Comics, a Warner Bros subsidiary, shows a continued investment in the space. We’ve seen other IP from the studio, such as Batman, as well as other Warner Bros. owned IP, like Looney Tunes, find their way to NFTs over the course of the past year. We’ll see what comes next from the legacy studio.

A New Player In Town? Aptos Enters The Arena

Aptos has been all the talk of the town lately, and is seemingly making swift moves into NFTs. The blockchain is brand new after years of hype and development, but it took no time at all for Aptos-based NFTs to gain steam; as our team at Bitcoinist covered early last week, some projects with free or cheap mints quickly found their way to $1K+ floor prices, as the chain introduces itself to the latest in a growing roster of potential ‘Solana killers.’

No Bear Market Here, Cardano

Speaking of ‘Solana killers,’ should Cardano be considered a legitimate threat in the NFT sector? Surges in volume suggest perhaps so, as they’ve hit record-highs for the blockchain recently. A DappRadar report published in recent days noted that Cardano has pushed to be the third-largest NFT protocol in volume (behind top dogs Ethereum and yes, Solana).

Solana-challengers like Cardano, the aforementioned Aptos, Avalanche, Flow, and more will allow the entire ecosystem to flourish and improve (Solana included).

Azukis Go IRL, Bring In Over 1,800 ETH

Who said Azukis were dead? Well, plenty of NFT naysayers might’ve said so, but Azuki whales stepped up and made their presence known when bidding was live for eight 24K gold-plated skateboards last week. The custom skateboards brought in over 200 ETH a piece, boasting the title of the most expensive skateboards sold in documented history. The top buyer shelled out a cool 309 ETH for their board – each of which, of course, came with a paired NFT.

These market solutions include threat intelligence, monitoring of transactions, and trade surveillance.

Its primary mission is to ensure the safety of crypto transactions and investments throughout all decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized markets. Solidus Labs, situated in New York, United States, began its actions in 2017.

In the meantime, there are about 12 leading blockchains under the company’s radar to detect possible theft or fraudulence cases. The need to monitor and carry out threat surveillance in the crypto industry is necessary, considering the high possibility of scams.

Most of the scam cases detected came from a crypto exchange platform’s chain known as BNB Chain. Besides this, more cyber threats keep arising, and recently, the Web3 system has detected 15 new scam cases.

Major Information On The Scam

Solidus Labs has detected around 188,525 scam cases dating. The cases reported came from some blockchains among the 12 monitored blockchains. These blockchains include BNB Chain, Polygon, and Ethereum.

According to Kathy Kraninger, there were several scam cases that Solidus Labs failed to identify. This is evident from the company’s data. Meaning that there’s a need for extra effort from the firm as scam cases are snowballing. Kathy Kraninger is Solidus’s regulatory affairs vice president and former U.S Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, director.

Scam Percentage Per Token

According to the company’s data, the BEP-20 tokens had the highest recorded cases. In addition, these tokens operate on the BNB Chain, giving the blockchain about 12% of the detected cases.

The company stated that the percentage of scam tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, ERC-20, was 8%, following that of BEP-20. Moreover, around $910 million worth of ETH tokens were lost to the scam case. The report had it that the transactions occurred on regulated and centralized crypto exchange platforms.

Idea Behind Crypto Scam

Based on the Solidus report, the objective and mission of the culprits were relatively straightforward. They aim to deprive investors of their assets using hard-wire mechanism. To achieve this purpose, they lure investors to invest their funds in tokens that have no future but appear to.

The system used for this operation is automated. Primarily, the scammers repeat the process of the contracts. This process enables scammers to access organizations like exchanges, authorities, and regulators.

According to Chainalysis, an analytic firm, investors need to be careful regarding their transactions in the crypto ecosystem. This is because crypto theft cases can come in different ways, excluding scamming.

There are also chances of hacking into investors’ accounts, particularly those with little knowledge about crypto.

Blockchain development platform Tatum received $41.5 million to scale its tooling system

Crypto venture capital funding dropped in the third quarter.

Only $5.5 billion was invested in crypto startups from July through September, according to a new Galaxy report — marking the lowest quarter for investments this year.

The figure is still higher than the seven-year quarterly average of $3.1 billion, which takes into account the significantly smaller investment universe in the early days of digital assets.

This week, the Celo ecosystem, a protocol which supports mobile-first DeFi payments infrastructure, revealed that projects on its platform have secured over $77 million in funding. Company valuations were not revealed.

Among them, blockchain development platform Tatum secured the most significant amount — $41.5 million — and will be using the latest fundraise to integrate their tooling system with Web3 projects.

Interchain communication protocol Hyperlane also raised a significant amount of capital — $18.5 million from venture capital fund Variant to promote cross-chain communication and interoperable security.

Regenerative finance project Loam, working to develop a data farming marketplace, raised $4 million.

“I am immensely proud of our ecosystem projects in raising over $77 million across various venture rounds,” Rene Reinsberg, Celo co-founder and Celo Foundation President, said. “This demonstrates how bullish investor sentiment is in driving mainstream adoption of Web3 and real-world use cases for real people.”

Other projects that received funding this week include Fun — a company building decentralized wallet and access control solutions on Odsy Network.

Fun raised a total of $3.9 million in its pre-seed funding round led by Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen’s JAM Fund with an unknown valuation.

Another pre-seed project which received venture capital interest this week was Web3 wallet Martian.

Martian, a wallet built on the Aptos blockchain, allows users to access decentralized applications on the network to buy, swap, swell tokens and collect NFTs.

The company secured $3 million in a funding round led by Race Capital, with participation from FTX Ventures, Superscrypt, Jump Capital and Aptos.

According to a new report by Reuters, Binance is planning to help the business magnate determine how crypto assets could be integrated into Twitter.

Binance pledged to invest $500 million into Twitter earlier this year when the exchange heard about Musk’s plans to acquire it.

Binance’s team will reportedly look into finding crypto-based solutions to stifle the many issues Twitter has had over the years, including spam bots, a complaint that caused the Tesla CEO to almost cancel his bid to purchase the social media giant.

Musk, who initially offered to acquire Twitter in April, officially bought the firm earlier this week for a staggering $44 billion after months of negotiations.

Once at its helm, the billionaire made good on his promise to clean house and began firing top executives, naming himself as the firm’s new CEO.

Binance originally pledged to co-invest with Musk in May, at the time saying that Musk’s leadership would bring about the fusion of social media and Web3 services. The company said it also believes the acquisition will accelerate the adoption rate of crypto assets and blockchain technologies.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tells his 7.1 million Twitter followers that the money was wired over a few days ago.

“Our intern says we wired the $500 million two days ago, probably just as I was being asked about Elon/Twitter.”

The startup aims to put satellites capable of transmitting securely-computed data to Earth.

It's not the first time the crypto industry has experimented with using outer space for security. Bitcoin development firm Blockstream has launched multiple of its own satellites to bring maximum decentralization to the foundational blockchain.

Hardening cryptography with Cryptosat

Many cryptographic processes are hard to perform. Extremely large numbers, for example, are used all over cryptography but getting a computer to generate random numbers is difficult. This makes key generation laborious and presents security vulnerabilities. If a piece of hardware responsible for generating your random number is compromised, your security might be, too.

From Verifiable Delay Functions to ZK-SNARKs, there are many examples of systems that would be improved if a trusted source existed. Cryptosat believes its ""oracles of the sky"" will be that trusted truth source.

According to a recent press release, the company has just raised $3 million to continue the development of its satellites, the first of which was launched in May 2022. Crypto1 completed the journey from Earth with help from SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket.

Cryptosat was founded by Yan Michalevsky of Anjuna enterprise security company, and Yonatan Winetraub of SpaceIL. The two published a paper on the possibility of satellites beaming sensitive cryptographic operations in 2017 and have developed the idea since.

Commenting on Cryptosat's mission, Yan Michalevsky stated:

""Cryptosat provides unprecedented integrity, confidentiality and authenticity guarantees for the most sensitive cryptographic operations by leveraging an environment that provides ultimate physical security: space.""

Cryptosat is already working with one of its backers, Protocol Labs, on space-hosted Verifiable Delay Functions. Meanwhile, a partnership with EVM-compatible Velas blockchain focuses on creating a Random Beacon. The pair aim to create a tamper-resistant random number generator that can be referenced by many apps.

The crypto space race continues

Veterans in the crypto industry might remember another company looking to maximize security from space. Blockstream, the long-running blockchain development firm — previously launched several satellites into orbit.

Beginning in August 2017, the Blockstream satellite aimed to provide free access to the Bitcoin network no matter where a potential user is in the world. Like Cryptosat, Blockstream identified that it is currently infeasible to take satellites out of orbit. Thus, the effort was not only to strengthen Bitcoin's accessibility but also its resistance to state-level censorship.

Speaking in 2022 at Bitcoin Amsterdam, Adam Back, Blockstream's cofounder, added privacy to the benefits:

""You can receive the data anonymously because it's broadcast, and basically nobody can tell you're receiving it. So, that's good for privacy.""

Since 2017, Blockstream has launched three more satellites before announcing the new and improved Blockstream Satellite in 2020. The revamped version introduced additional coverage and the ability to sync a full Bitcoin node without an internet connection.

With an expected recession in 2023, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs need to rethink their strategy. Many of them have accepted that Kava (KAVA), Binance (BNB), Polygon (MATIC), and other similarly situated projects are struggling. While that is happening, a new DeFi project called Oryen (ORY) is already about to start the second phase of its presale.

Oryen (ORY)

Oryen is a blockchain platform for all investors, whether beginners or professionals. It offers peace of mind and convenience through the Oryen Autostaking Technic (OAT), which allows automatic staking and auto-compounding directly inside the investor’s wallet. No need to transfer funds or assets because the ORY holding grows every 60 minutes thanks to OAT and the protocol’s rebase reward system.

Furthermore, Oryen offers its early investors a 90% annual yield (APY) or a daily return on investment (ROI) of 0.177%. These rates significantly exceed what other tokens can offer. The APY is fixed and does not change regardless of market conditions. The stability of the ORY floor price is ensured by the risk-free value (RFV), a wallet within the protocol containing a buffer value. As the protocol is community-driven, profits are distributed directly to investors rather than into a treasury fund.

Kava (KAVA)

Compared to Oryen (ORY), Kava (KAVA) struggles to keep up. The Kava Network combines the speed and interoperability of Cosmos with the developer power of Ethereum. This network features a native governance and utility token, KAVA, that can be staked by validators or delegated to validator nodes. Stakers and delegators earn 37.5% of all KAVA emissions as a reward for securing the network.

(BNB)

Holders of BNB are also trailing behind ORY investors. BNB is the native token of Binance, the unique ecosystem of decentralized blockchain-based networks. The project has become a major crypto exchange in many countries, and its affiliates have also attracted much interest. The company started as a mere exchange in 2017, but today it has expanded its services into different areas.

Polygon (MATIC)

Polygon (MATIC) shows signs of an uptick but may not grow as much as Oryen (ORY). Polygon is a scalable, easy-to-use framework, the first Layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum. This protocol allows the creation of DeFi applications on a central blockchain. It also has a swift rate of 65,000 transactions per second on a single sidechain and a TXF block confirmation time of fewer than two seconds.

The bottom line

With the success of Oryen’s first presale phase, it starts the second phase.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications refer to the entire space of blockchain projects that include open lending platforms, decentralised exchanges, and digital asset staking, while many other use-cases are emerging regularly. DeFi is powered by smart contracts which are self-executing computer codes used for automatically executing transactions.DeFi has been democratizing finance and will play an integral role in the future of finance. It is evolving at a rapid pace and is instrumental in creating a decentralised economy where anyone from anywhere in the world can now connect and transact with each other directly, opening a new range of possibilities for financial transactions that did not exist previously.Based on blockchain technology, DeFi protocols and products rely on cryptology and smart contracts to execute transactions when predefined conditions are met. Decentralization allows you to become a part of the banking system, potentially helping to bank the unbanked. This is a very important element that ties in with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of financial inclusion, adopted by world leaders at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in New York way back in 2015.DeFi allows programmers to continue developing a wide range of secure and efficient financial platforms from anywhere in the world, bringing in rapid innovation and autonomy to contribute towards the global GDP. It brings in opportunities to the common person that were only available to large players, including access to international markets, access to new forms of lending and borrowing, faster and cheaper transactions, tokenization of assets, etc.Crypto assets and DeFi in conjunction have been offering an alternative way of investing money, opening up the possibilities to earn positive returns on any capital employed. DeFi products like staking pools, Liquidity mining and Yield farming continue to provide crypto investors with an opportunity to earn rewards on their crypto holdings, while they hold onto their cryptocurrency investments for the long term.DeFi protocols and platforms are distributed across the world on blockchains that facilitate international financial transactions. And as there are no intermediaries involved, DeFi applications allow transactions to be conducted at very low costs and sometimes at no costs, allowing cheap currency conversions. Users can automatically lend and borrow funds using crypto assets as collaterals within DeFi and this automation via smart contracts has the potential to accelerate financial transactions, decreasing costs while providing more lending opportunities.Users maintain control of their assets as DeFi allows them to buy, sell and transfer digital assets of their own accord. Users are custodians of their funds in DeFi as access to their crypto funds is restricted to the account holder due to the existence of encrypted passwords, and private keys. Hence, asset management in DeFi is as per the user’s choice with complete ownership control.Due to the transparency that blockchain technology provides, decentralisation allows the analysis of compliance around the behaviour of the users’ addresses as every translation is recorded on the ledger and can be traced back. The real-time monitoring of the addresses protects against data breaches, fraud, and financial crimes.With more than one billion people living on less than $1.90 daily, DeFi innovation is gaining acceptance as a sensible business model for humanity, bringing in the digital revolution. DeFi projects are bridging the gap between decentralized finance infrastructure, assets, and the underbanked and have the potential to accelerate adoption. This will change the way we bank and interact with assets of all sizes. This shift is as large as the move onto the internet with the tokenization of all assets and value represented digitally.With the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols exceeding $55 billion as of August 2022, both GenZ investors along with the older millennial and boomer population are increasingly leaning towards DeFi platforms. Not only does this bode well for cryptocurrencies, as more people look to invest in them as a store of value, but also reflects the impending investments that will undoubtedly be pooled into DeFi protocols consequently.( The author is CTO & CoFounder, CoinDCX)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

It does not necessarily reflect the opinion of U.Today. Every investment and all trading involves risk, so you should always perform your own research prior to making decisions. We do not recommend investing money you cannot afford to lose.

Ethereum killers appear during every bull run on the cryptocurrency market, and almost every time they end up losing more than the cryptocurrency they were planning on destroying. In 2021's bull run there were at least three ""killers"" that are not feeling too well today.

According to the market performance of the aforementioned assets, the average return on each Ethereum competitor is around -80% from the all-time high. The least effective asset in terms of market performance is DOT with an 88% drop.

Solana, which at some point was seriously close to overtaking Ethereum's market, including the NFT and DeFi industries, went through a severe bull market, not finding any support for a proper recovery. The biggest issues with SOL have always been technical issues on the network.

Solana's stability became a meme at some point as it has been going down steadily around weekends, which made some people think that the blockchain shuts down at the end of the week and opens up again on Monday.

With its lack of technical sustainability, Solana stopped being a go-to network for many blockchain developers previously aiming to build their decentralized solutions on it.

AVAX was yet another Ethereum rival that was aiming to bring more scalability and convenience for users and developers. Higher transaction output was the main selling point. However, with the Merge update, Ethereum is expected to become way faster and have a stable fee structure during high network load, which makes projects like AVAX irrelevant.

Ethereum itself did not become an inflation hedge or a safe haven for crypto investors. Losing almost 70% of its value from ATH made ETH yet another risk asset that no one needs in the current market.",blockchain,u.today

The apex body of India’s tech business, NASSCOM, said in a report that the country is set to emerge as a key player in the global web3 landscape, thanks to the rapid adoption of emerging technologies, a vibrant startup ecosystem, and a digitally skilled talent pool. In a study jointly prepared by web3 venture capital firm Hashed Emergent, NASSCOM said the Indian web3 firms received $1.3 billion in venture capital in two years between 2020 and April 2022, media reports said.

The study — The India Web3 Startup Landscape: An Emerging Technology Leadership Frontier – further stated that India has got 450 startups in the web3 space, with four of them having achieved unicorn status in the last one year.

“India’s rapid adoption of new-age technologies, its growing start-up ecosystem, and large-scale digitally skilled talent potential is cementing the country’s position in the global Web3 landscape,” Debjani, President, Nasscom, said at the release of the report in Bengaluru.

Fast-paced adoption of new technologies positions India on a high growth trajectory in the global web3 market. The growth of web3 startups is about six times since 2015 when the launch of the Ethereum network galvanized global interest in this field. Although 82% of the web3 startups are concentrated in tier-I cities, even tier-II and tier-III cities are witnessing rapid growth in the web3 ecosystem, the report mentions.

“One-third of these startups have come up in the past year alone, and several of them have a B2B model. A lot of them are also working on areas outside cryptocurrency like Defi (decentralized finance) and entertainment,” Achyuta Ghosh, senior director, and head- of insights, at Nasscom, said.

The NASSCOM singles out India’s tech talent pool as the major driver of its web3 push. Despite policy uncertainty, India’s position in the global web3 ecosystem has become important thanks to the domestic talent pool. Its web3 and blockchain talent pool accounts for 11% of the global market, making it the third-largest. While 60% of the crypto startups are registered outside India, they source talent from India. “India’s Web3 talent pool is growing at the fastest rate worldwide, at around 120 per cent likely in the next 1-2 years,” the report said.

India’s web3 ecosystem is driven by GenZ and millennial people that constitute 77% of the population.

Web3 startups are engaged in Defi, NFT, and metaverse projects and employ nearly 75,000 professionals. India has also scored high on Defi activities with $88 billion worth of value received on-chain.

The NASSCOM report also predicts that the global crypto user base is set to reach 1 billion by 2030 from the current 320 million. Globally, blockchain and crypto firms have raised $30.5 billion in venture funding in 2021.

“The lack of policy clarity around Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs), leading to a lack of confidence in founders and innovators, thereby forcing them to move their base to other countries, is not only taking the market away but also the critical talent and expertise needed in this area,” the report points out.

The National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) is the apex body for the $227 billion Indian technology industry.",blockchain,zycrypto

Le Thanh, a self-proclaimed ‘King of VGA,’ showed a video on Facebook where a bored GPU seller was sitting there all day chasing the flies away.

A passerby on a scooter then stops with the GPUs weighed prior to the smartphone payment being made.

Demand for GPUs has significantly fallen following ethereum’s move to Proof of Stake (PoS) which removed miners.

No other blockchain network has been able to absorb them, with data for September already showing a 10% decline in GPU prices.

October is the first month that ethereum is fully PoS. Price data are not yet out, with Q3 earnings for AMD to be published tomorrow, while Nvidia is later in November.

Both however will cover the months when eth was still Proof of Work. It won’t be until Q4 data that we’ll see just what effect ethereum mining had on GPU prices.

Nonetheless, at locations close to production the effects are already being felt in a sign of overproduction.

The market may therefore start being flooded as that supply moves from local areas to more globally where GPUs by the kilo are unlikely but lower prices should be expected.",blockchain,trustnodes.com

With tech billionaire and crypto supporter Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter spurring rallies in Dogecoin over the last week, Hoskinson says that there’s a real possibility that DOGE could be integrated with the social media platform.

“Now that Twitter is in the hands of Elon Musk I can see a real possibility that doge will somehow merge with the platform.”

According to Hoskinson, the Dogecoin blockchain could also act as a sidechain for Cardano. He says he would do the migration for free and even add smart contract capabilities.

The crypto billionaire also teased the idea of Twitter being a Cardano-based protocol.

Twitter as a protocol as a cardano sidechain is definitely the way to go — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) October 28, 2022

Musk completed his takeover of Twitter on Friday, saying he acquired the tech giant because he believes civilization needs a space where ideas can be debated freely.

“The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence.”

Dogecoin, one of Musk’s favorite crypto assets, has reacted extremely positively with the takeover, outperforming virtually the entire digital asset market as it becomes the eighth-largest coin by market cap.

At time of writing, DOGE is up 133% in the last seven days, currently changing hands at $0.138.

Santiment says that Shiba Inu is starting to gather some momentum after displaying strength in its Bitcoin pair (SHIB/BTC).

“Whatever side of the fence your on with memecoins like DOGE and SHIB, there is no denying that they have had their pump moments. Shiba Inu has historically followed Dogecoin pumps. Watch trading volume on our chart.”

According to Santiment’s chart, Shiba Inu bulls are showing signs of life as the SHIB/BTC pair witnesses a significant rise in volume, suggesting that traders are betting on the meme token outperforming Bitcoin.

At time of writing, Shiba Inu is changing hands for $0.000013, up over 8% on the day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading a $20,800, up a little over 1% in the past 24 hours.

In addition to crypto traders, blockchain tracker WhaleStats shows that the largest 5,000 Ethereum whales have also been accumulating SHIB over the last few days. According to WhaleStats, the top 5,000 ETH whales hold over $94.2 million worth of SHIB, an increase of 4.5% from their Shiba Inu trove of $89.7 million, which was recorded on Friday.

Looking at Bitcoin itself, Santiment reveals that long-term bulls continue to stash away the largest crypto by market cap as BTC supply on crypto exchanges plummet to a level last seen in November 2018.

“With Bitcoin back above $20,700, traders appear to be content with long-term holding as coins continue moving away from exchanges. With the ratio of BTC on exchanges down to 8.3%, it’s the lowest seen in four years. October has been a big outflow month.”

However, with billions of dollars passing through the industry, it has become imperative to ensure the safety of users through adequate security measures.

Bitcoinist caught up with Erez Ben-Kiki, CEO and Founder of DeFi cross-chain bridge, ChainPort, where he shares thoughts on the current DeFi climate and how ChainPort is ensuring the safety of user funds on its platform.

Bitcoinist: Hello Erez, let’s start by just giving us a brief background of your journey so far in crypto and DeFi

Erez Ben-Kiki: After graduating with a BA in economics, I worked for ten years in the financial sector as an analyst and Nostro manager, and trader. Later I transferred to digital advertising and founded a marketing agency. After falling deep into the crypto rabbit hole, I founded 2key, a project that later became DecentraLab.

Bitcoinist: So how did ChainPort come out of all of this?

Erez Ben-Kiki: Decentralab became a development house that builds various projects and products in the Web3 space. ChainPort is one of Dcentralab’s most prominent products, as well as Hord, TokensFarm, 2Key, and more coming soon.

TokensFarm is a leading Farm-As-A-Service provider; TokensFarm offers fully customized, deployable Vesting, LP, or staking farms that can be live within hours.

Hord is an innovative DeFi protocol that offers tokenized ETFs. Hord includes Viking DAO, Champion’s Pools, and more. Viking DAO is an investment platform where backers can support pools of up to 20 projects and receive a tradable pool token in return. Champions pools allow users to create or follow crypto trading strategies.

2key was the first project that brought Dcentralab together. 2Key offers multi-step link tracking and smart contracts over HTTP protocols via the noble 2key protocol.

ChainPort was born out of necessity. Interoperability is needed to connect different blockchains and facilitate communication and transfer of value between them. While interoperability and bridges are needed, it became evident that security is the “Achilles heel” for most bridges.

The issue is that bridges, like exchanges, are high-stakes platforms that hold enormous amounts of value and can be vulnerable to bugs in their underlying code. Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin mentioned the security risks of bridges on Reddit several months ago. Since then, hundreds of millions of dollars have been stolen in various bridge exploits and hacks.

We spent time trying to solve the security issue that many bridges have, and from this problem came ChainPort, the world’s first ultra-secure custodial bridge.

More than $55 billion are currently locked in DeFi protocols : Source: DefiLlama

Bitcoinist: ChainPort is a cross-chain bridge. Can you tell me how it’s different from other cross-chain bridges?

Erez Ben-Kiki: ChainPort is a cutting-edge cross-chain bridge that offers complete interoperability and custodian-level protection. ChainPort provides a level of security architecture that has never been seen before, reliably transferring tokens between blockchains with only a single click.ChainPort is the only custodial bridge in the world of blockchain. We store 95% of the funds in cold storage wallets provided by leading industry security experts, including FireBlocks MPC and Gnosis-safe multi-sig, to ensure the security of funds.

Users can port tokens in a permissionless manner with ChainPort, and human approval is not required. ChainPort is also a high-speed bridge; tokens can be ported in as fast as 2.5 minutes across chains. Users can also port tokens across multiple blockchains without the need to revert to the original token for each port.

Now, a lot of hacks have happened in DeFi, a good chunk of them being on cross-chain bridges. What are the most common risks with these kinds of DeFi protocols?

When it comes to risks regarding DeFi and specifically bridges, the most significant risk is smart contract risk.



In many recent bridge exploits, the core of the failure was “implicit checksums.” Implicit checksums mean the code relies on an implicit assumption that functions will be called or parameters will be used in a certain way.

Chainport has various checksums and monitoring tools in place to prevent failures. For example, we have a monitoring tool in place that constantly checks that the balance of assets across all our supported chains remains 1:1. Any deviation results in an immediate bridge freeze and can trigger potential rollbacks or manual intervention.



We also ensure all deposited funds are kept safe in cutting-edge multi-signature MPC wallets. So even in a worst-case scenario, funds have multiple layers of protection.

Bitcoinist: So what is ChainPort doing to make sure something like this never happens?



Erez Ben-Kiki: ChainPort brings a unique security architecture, funds segregation being the main one. Only up to 5% of the assets will be in the hot bridge contract, with the remaining 95% + being on rebalancing and treasury vaults. All our custodian wallets are secured by multiple security layers, including Fireblocks MPC and Gnosis multi-sig wallets, the main ones.



On top, ChainPort’s team rigorously tests all code and smart contracts, and they undergo multiple independent audits by blockchain security leaders. ChainPort passed numerous audits by both Certik & Cyber Unit. We’re also in the final stages of an audit with Trail of Bits, one of the top 3 auditors in the world.

We could fairly say that ChainPort today is the safest bridge in the crypto space.

Bitcoinist: Where does DeFi security go from here, do you think? Are DeFi protocols learning from these hacks to prevent future hacks?

Erez Ben-Kiki: Security is a constant game of cat and mouse. Learning as much as possible from every hack is necessary in the world of DeFi. Protocols need to emphasize security as much as possible.



It is almost impossible to be fully protected at all times, as hackers always outnumber you and your team. They will try day and night to hack and steal assets deposited in your product or protocol.



That’s why we took the custodial approach, which allows all parties to rest assured that even if it’s unlikely to happen, the funds are off-chain and fully protected.

These days, we introduce an even safer, more secure premium version of ChainPort, the ChainPort Private Custodian. The service combines ChainPort’s best features with added features and an enhanced custodial security model. The custodial security model shares the multi-sig keys with the project porting tokens and an external lawyer in a ⅗ multi-sig model.

Sharing multi-sig keys across three parties eliminate any single party’s access to the tokens and takes segregation one step forward. Distributing control makes the bridge even more secure and adds an extra layer of safety for tokens. Additional features include setting supported chains, a set path for ports, and setting the minimum or maximum amount of tokens you want to allow users to port are also part of that service.



Bitcoinist: To close, where do you see DeFi in the next five years? More interoperability or less?

Erez Ben-Kiki: Despite the recent market downturn, consumer interest in DeFi and cryptocurrency is still solid. According to Google Trends, the search volume for popular cryptocurrencies is much higher than in 2020. DeFi as an aspect of crypto will continue to grow, with even more novel protocols and chains being developed. As such, interoperability will be necessary, and bridges will be required to facilitate the transfer of information and value. Crypto adoption is most probably here to stay and thrive. Interoperability will be a significant part of the next cycle of growth.



At ChainPort, we’re constantly adding support for more tokens and blockchains to guarantee more interoperability. Just recently, we’ve added support for Fantom and Dogechain. Support for Cardano, Arbitrum, Milkomeda, Solana, and many other chains is also coming soon to ChainPort. With bridges like ChainPort, it is safe to say that we will see much greater interoperability in the next few years.

214,Dogecoin (DOGE) Ahead of Cardano After Explosive Price Performance,https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/2022-10/25276.jpg,30/10/2022,Cardano gives up its place on market to memecoin that shows record-breaking price performance,https://u.today/dogecoin-doge-ahead-of-cardano-after-explosive-price-performance,"Cardano gives up its place on market to memecoin that shows record-breaking price performance

Every investment and all trading involves risk, so you should always perform your own research prior to making decisions. We do not recommend investing money you cannot afford to lose.

The lack of momentum on Cardano is nothing new for cryptocurrency investors. However, falling back below the top eight of the cryptocurrency market is more about Dogecoin's explosive price performance rather than the lack of movement on ADA.

Pivotal moment for ADA

Unfortunately, ADA is still struggling with the local resistance level at the 50-day moving average, and the main reason behind it is the lack of inflows to the asset. The recovery of the cryptocurrency market helps Cardano return to the level prior to the Oct. 11 dump, but a recovery from it seems like an unlikely scenario.

At press time, Cardano is trying to break the 50-day moving average, but the lack of volume on the weekend market remains a problem as the cryptocurrency cannot gain enough momentum to do so.

Unfortunately, the sixth attempt to break from the prolonged downtrend might be as unsuccessful as the others, considering the current state of ADA on the market.

Dogecoin is euphoric

Since the start of the rally, DOGE is showing a mind-blowing 140% price increase in the last 24 hours. Following the Twitter acquisition by Elon Musk, a lot of investors believe in the possibility of Dogecoin being implemented on social media as a payment tool.

Obviously, that would increase the market capitalization and usage of DOGE exponentially, making it one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world.

With the current bear market in full swing, some savvy investors are deciding now is the time to get on board. While this might go against conventional wisdom, they believe that we are near the bottom for many crypto projects and that they could begin to ascend soon. Some believe that current discount prices might not be available for much longer.

Some of the tokens that are currently bottoming out might not survive much longer or might not thrive as much as others do. But with the right move, you can set your portfolio up for substantial long-term evolution.

Uniglo (GLO)

The interesting thing with Uniglo is that it isn’t at the “bottom” because of recent losses, but it’s still available at discount prices before expected headways during pre-sale. That means you get the chance at the ground level before it officially launches.

With the incredible selection of deflationary measures GLO offers, you get complete price solidity thanks to an asset-backed store of value that’s primed for growth. GLO could be the perfect weapon against rampant inflation.

Cronos (CRO)

Cronos is the utility token for the thriving exchange platform crypto.com. This platform has already gathered mainstream attention and is increasing its foothold in the market. If the wider crypto space begins to flourish again, CRO could be perfectly placed to surge higher as crypto.com becomes one of the most established mainstream marketplaces.

Elrond (EGLD)

EGLD is a highly scalable and speedy blockchain ecosystem that is the heart of the enterprise solution development world. It could significantly impact the business world’s future and create a new internet economy and is, therefore, a solid asset for your portfolio right now.

Conclusion

EGLD and CRO both have strong futures in crypto. But they don’t offer the same early upsides as GLO.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (also known online as CZ) has revealed that the company’s team has reached an agreement with the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) to have the country’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) integrated into the BNB Chain.

CZ said in a tweet that the agreement is a result of Binance’s relentless push for crypto adoption globally. The team introduced the Binance-created blockchain — BNB Chain — to the First Deputy of the Governor of the NBK, Berik Sholpankulov, and the Head of Payment and Technological Center, Binur Zhalenov.

The Central Asian country’s central bank has been working on the digital tenge as the CBDC is called for a while now. It recently launched a pilot to test the CBDC in a controlled environment and with real consumers and merchants with the involvement of the country’s largest commercial banks — Kaspi Bank JSC and Eurasian Bank JSC.

The NBK says it hopes to reach a final decision on launching the CBDC by the end of 2022. However, CZ noted that he is looking forward to integrating the CBDC into BNB Chain.

“Looking forward to NBK preparing CBDC use cases to see how they could be integrated into BNB Chain to bridge the gap between traditional banking and the crypto ecosystem,” he wrote.

Binance deepening ties with regulators globally

Binance recently got a “permanent license” to operate a digital asset platform and provide custody services in Kazakhstan. The license gives Binance the status of a regulated platform, allowing the exchange to process deposits and withdrawals of fiat money, conversion of cryptocurrencies, and offer storage and exchange of crypto assets.

Binance also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Financial Monitoring Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan to help the country fight financial crime. The deal is part of the company’s Law Enforcement Training Program (LETP), implemented in France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Norway, Canada, Brazil, Paraguay, and Israel.

Kazakhstan, which has become a major crypto mining hotspot following China’s ban on the activity, is not the only country Binance has made significant inroads into this year. The world’s largest exchange by trading volume launched in Bahrain just this month after getting Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) back in May 2022.

Binance has also secured licenses to operate in Dubai, New Zealand, and Cyprus while also seeking permission to return to operating in Japan.",blockchain,zycrypto

The post BNY Mellon, Nasdaq Say Institutions Want TradFi To Handle Their Crypto appeared first on Blockworks.",http://blockworks.co/bny-mellon-nasdaq-say-institutions-want-tradfi-to-handle-their-crypto/,"BNY Mellon reported that 70% of institutional investors surveyed would be interested in crypto if they had services from firms they trust

TradFi is also hesitant to enter crypto without more regulatory clarity

Institutional investors are looking for familiar names to provide their crypto services, and Wall Street is delivering.

BNY Mellon, America’s oldest bank and one of the more crypto-friendly institutions, said earlier this month that select institutional clients will be able to hold and transfer bitcoin and ether through its new crypto custody offering. Nasdaq said in September it would be looking into offering similar services. Boston-based State Street has been plotting its crypto custody plans since March 2022 when it revealed its partnership with crypto-native Copper.

The trend is not surprising, Talia Klein, BNY Mellon’s head of digital asset custody commercial product, said during a Blockworks webinar this week.

“We’re seeing a lot of institutional interest [in crypto,]” Klein said. “As you think about what is prohibiting others from getting into the space, what we’ve seen is that people require an institutional grade provider.”

In a research report published alongside its custody announcement, BNY Mellon reported 70% of institutional investors surveyed would “increase their digital asset activity if services like custody and execution are available from recognized, trusted institutions.”

Institutional investors are more concerned about getting into crypto in a safe and compliant manner instead of jumping in immediately with hopes of high returns, Matthew Savarese, vice president and global head of strategy at Nasdaq, added.

“Twelve months ago, everyone was worried about how to get into the space in the quickest way possible,” Savarese said. “Now, with the so-called crypto winter, people are taking a step back to say, ‘All right, let’s assess to make sure that we’re solving for information security, market fragmentation, liquidity, understanding what credit intermediation is, what quality execution looks like.’”

More options are available today, Savarese added, from both traditional financial institutions and crypto-native companies.

The current regulatory environment is also weighing on institutional investors and slowing their entry into the space, webinar panelists agreed.

“Whenever you’re operating in an environment like this, where this industry is rapidly evolving…we’re trying to stay one one step ahead,” said Geoffrey Clauss, chief revenue officer at blockchain infrastructure provider Blockdaemon.

220,The Ethereum Merge,https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/images/csharp-corner.png,31/10/2022,"The Ethereum merge is the biggest news in the blockchain world right now. Before entering into the merge, let’s discuss about the consensus mechanism; how blockchains agree on whether an event actually happened.",https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/the-ethereum-merge,"INTRODUCTION

The Ethereum merge is the biggest news in the blockchain world right now. Before entering into the merge, let’s discuss about the consensus mechanism; how blockchains agree on whether an event actually happened.

ETH was using Proof of Work or we can say it as proof of burnt energy. Miners use expensive hardware to compete to solve complicated problems to win the block reward. This spanks a huge amount of energy over 100 TwH at the time of usage but every time it becomes progressively harder and harder to mine a block. The equipment is also specialized, you need a lot of rigs, cheap electricity, etc. none of this is great for decentralization.

On the other hand, we consider Proof of Stake. You take ether to activate software that verifies transactions in exchange for a transaction fee. Validators are selected randomly with the probability of selection proportional to the amount of ETH staked. This is much closer to a web3 implementation.

The Merge

In simple words, Ethereum shifted from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. Before shifting, Ethereum launched a test chain to test the PoS called Beacon chain. This chain has been running PoS in parallel with the existing Ethereum PoW mainnet although without smart contract functionality and the one-way bridge has been accepting staking deposits with over 326000 users active on the network. Since Apr 2022, the beacon chain is 10.4 million each or around 36 billion dollars or to put in another way, the entire solana market cap. The fomo is clearly catching as ether has been withdrawn from exchanges in vast quantities. So, the final piece is to bring the entire history of the current ETH PoW chain and merge it with this beacon chain to create a discrete short in the new network, complete with smart contract using PoS.

Merging is no small task, but there was big news recently with the announcement of successful dry run on the kiln test. Kiln is the final public test net before the big one. once the merge is behind us, the next big challenge is sharding which will spread the network load across 64 discrete shards.

Improvements in the Merge

Proof of Stake Ethereum promises to lower energy consumption by 99.9 percent. Issuance and inflation will also be radically reduced. Ultrasound money’s simulator predicts supply will contract at -1.8 percent yearly while new ether produced will plummet to just half a million a year, but that is of course just a simulation. The main thing to be noted is that the burn rate doesn’t move and that’s because scientists say the merge will do pretty much next to nothing to the cost of transacting on Ethereum.

If we consider about the validators and the numbers say that, to become a validator we need to have a minimum of 32ETH. In phase 0 there has been a minimum validate account of 16,384 and that is a lot. For phase 1 and beyond the recommended minimum validators per committee is 128. So, in order for all shards to learn each other’s state on every slot across 64 shards, that would mean 262,144 validators and total 8,388,608 ETH staked.",blockchain,c-sharpcorner.com

Solana Daily, A Solana-centric Twitter handle, recently posted a tweet around the same. The tweet also mentioned all the major developments that happened in its NFT ecosystem over the last week.

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Solana [SOL] for 2023-2024

_____________________________________________________________________________________

A few notable developments included that Bonfida integrated with Notifinetwork. This new integration brought along several new features, such as new and improved alerts, which have become easier to set up. Moreover, another important update was that Solana collection trade became free on SalanartNFT.

Interestingly, Solana’s Q3 looked extremely promising for Solana’s NFT ecosystem as it witnessed considerable growth. Between July and September, the overall number of daily new NFTs on the network increased by 19.3%, which was commendable.

However, despite these events, Santiment’s data revealed a different story. According to the chart, Solana’s total NFT trade count went down over the last week. This was contrary to the aforementioned developments. Incidentally, Solana’s NFT trade volume in USD registered a spike on 26 October, but later witnessed a downfall.

Solana geared up

While SOL’s NFT space grew over the last three months, SOL’s price action also showed promising movements in the last seven days. This was exciting news for investors. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that SOL registered over 15% weekly gains and at press time was trading at $32.90 with a market capitalization of over $11.8 billion.

Solana’s on-chain metrics also painted a bullish picture for the token, further giving hope to investors. For instance, SOL received significant interest from the derivatives market as its Binance funding rate went up last week. Not only this, but Solana’s development activity also surged considerably, which was a positive sign for the blockchain.

Furthermore, the popularity of Solana in the crypto community was highlighted as its social volume spiked over the last week.

SOL traders can sit back and relax

Several Solana market indicators were backing the possibility of a further price surge. Some credit for this development should also go to the current bullish market, because of which most of the cryptos were pumping. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon revealed that the bulls might soon have an upper hand in the market.

This was because the 20-day EMA was fast approaching the 55-day EMA. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) registered a golden crossover and indicated a buyers’ advantage. The Bollinger Bands (BB) suggested that SOL’s price was about to enter a high volatility zone. This increased the chances of a continued northward movement. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) went down slightly and was directed towards the neutral mark. This could restrict a further price surge in the coming days.",blockchain,ambcrypto.com

The…",https://www.trustnodes.com/2022/10/30/bitcoin-drone-show-flies-over-lugano,"A bitcoin drone show lit up the city of Lugano in Switzerland’s border with Italy, commemorating the closing of the bitcoin conference Plan ₿.

The show was put on by Cyberdrone, which describes itself as “a drone light show company specializing in high-performance drone development and the creation of autonomous swarm solutions.”

It is the first drone show of its kind, highlighting the gathering of many prominent bitcoiners, including Adam Back, the President of Blockstream.

Max Keiser, a long time bitcoiner, held a key note on “Conquering Time and Space,” so keeping the overhype in the depth of bear.

Other talks were by Jimmy Song who preached to the audience on “How Fiat Ruins Everything.” Everything!

We had Peter McCormack to speak about how “An Attack on Assange is an Attack on Freedom of Speech,” even though for some reason Wikileaks never used its free speech to reveal anything about Russia or China even as both were moving towards dictatorship.

For a further taste of what sort of conference this was, we have a “Masterclass on How to Invest in Bitcoin.” That PhD probably took about one minute, with the speaker not saying you just open an account on one of the exchanges, 100x long and then get rekt, and then next time hodl for life.

But there were more interesting talks, including on defi, and although bitcoin parties are nothing compared to eth-heads, they’re not bad.

There were also NFTs. Well, RGB assets, and RGB here stands for Really Good for Bitcoin because some kids never grew up.

To show its copying nature in addition, they look more like a meme than NFTs, but still somewhat cool.

That’s Peter Todd, whose gotten old-er and now has a beard, holding a cat because the dog has been taken by dogecoin.

The cat is an RGB, which presumably also stands for color. Like the arrival of color TV about half a century ago, or pictures on the internet, blockchains now get their jpegs.

In this case the jpegs are off-chain and linked to bitcoin in a sort of roundabout way with the project stating:

“Each RGB smart contract is represented by some genesis state, created by smart contract issuer (or, put simply, issuer) and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of state transitions kept in form of client-validated data (i.e. this data is not stored on blockchain or within LN transactions/channel state).

The state is assigned to unspent bitcoin transaction outputs (UTXO), which defines them as single-use seals.

The party that is able to spend corresponding transaction output is named a party owning state: it is a party that has the right to change the corresponding part of the smart contract state by creating a new state transition and committing to it in a transaction spending the output containing previous state.

This procedure represents closing of a seal over state transition, and a pair of spending transaction and corresponding extra-transaction data on the state transition are named witness.”

The address above might look like a bitcoin one, but it’s not, it starts with rgb. In general terms this is effectively an ‘offline’ or off-chain system that kind of ‘pauses’ a transaction to put stuff – link code – to it, like a cat.

This overall performs the basic function of allowing you to own a picture, with the Iris Wallet allowing you to see it.

So bitcoin has kind of made it to around 2017 when the first CryptoKitties clogged ethereum.

That’s progress as it wasn’t clear it would move at all, but it isn’t quite leadership, it is more following and catching up in a somewhat convoluted way where the smart contract code is not on-chain, making its immutability more open to question than otherwise.

That naturally has to apply to all of bitcoin attempted defi. They’re trying to work on DEX-es, that’s decentralized exchanges, which in ethereum are pretty old fashioned things with modern kids nowadays playing on order-less, as in order books, exchanges like Uniswap.

Collateralizing bitcoin in its natural environment would be cool however, but the only way this can be done is by locking your coins to some other network, and in the process many attack vectors would have to be strengthened, including bridges or watchtowers or whatever they’ll use, which haven’t really been tested because no one is quite using them.

That all said, bitcoin excels in stunts, like this pretty cool drone show even though the bitcoin symbol used could be nicer, and one gets the feeling that bitcoin coding may be at least attempting to revitalize after about five years of complete standstill.

They’ve lost a lot of talent to ethereum, and for half a decade now bitcoin was for punk attitude, while eth was for code.

That may change in as far as bitcoin tries to become for code too, but developers have to work with very limited capabilities and self executing open source code will probably never quite be a thing in bitcoin in a way where you have the opportunity to publish unchangable code.

Still, there’s a lot of copycat fruits and they’ll probably blossom eventually once all the low fruits are picked in eth, although bitcoin is bigger and there is opportunity to grab attention especially in native collateralization, but whether that can be done in a way you’re sure your private key is ownership, is not too clear.",blockchain,trustnodes.com

Investors will also have a Federal Reserve meeting and Jerome Powell press conference to digest with the expectation that the hawkish position of the central bank will be confirmed and the target rate will be boosted 75 points. Economic reports due in include updates on construction spending, PMI and factory orders before the week ends with the October jobs report.

IPO lockups periods expire during the week for blocks of shares of Austin Gold (AUST), PepGen (NASDAQ:PEPG), and Kiboko Gold (KIB:CA).

FOMC earnings preview: The Federal Reserve Bank's policy-making committee is expected to raise rates at November 1-2 meeting and keep a hawkish tone with a steady stream of inflationary data coming in since the September meeting. UBS expects the FOMC to keep its options open rather than provide guidance that the pace of rate hikes is slowing down in December. The firm noted that there are no new economic projections released at the November meeting, so all the action will be in the FOMC statement and the Chair's press conference. FRB of Kansas City President George is seen dissenting in favor of a smaller rate hike. It was also observed that in recent weeks FRB Vice Chair Lael Brainard has voiced concerns over the pace and magnitude of the global monetary policy tightening underway and FRB of San Francisco President Mary Daly said there at least should be a discussion about slowing down the pace. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to highlight a wait-and-see stance about the December meeting decisions.

Boeing investor day preview: The world's largest aerospace company holds a key investor day just a week after seeing its stock post the biggest one-day decline since May. Boeing reported a bigger quarterly loss than expected and noted losses widened amid difficulties in its defense business, while its commercial aviation unit continues to face supply-chain constraints and regulatory hurdles. Revenue grew 4% from the prior year to $16 billion, but missed the consensus estimate by $1.95B. During the earnings conference call, Boeing execs again cut the 2022 target for deliveries of the 737 MAX single-aisle plane to 375 from the low 400s. The investor event is expected to add more color on Boeing's expectations for 2023 deliveries and the mix of aircraft from the off the line or pulled from storage. In addition, many of the longer-term questions with Boeing are anticipated to be addressed during the investor day to perhaps soothe some investor anxiety.



Holiday shopping preview: The National Retail Federation will hold a media call on November 3 to release its forecast for 2022 holiday retail sales. The NRF forecast will be another key data point for investors sizing up Target (TGT), Best Buy (BBY), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), and Walmart (WMT) following the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) guidance shocker and amid ongoing concerns around consumer discretionary spending. Bank of America is already out with a forecast that holiday comparable sales will be up 1.3% this year in a rapid deceleration from the +6.5% pace from a year ago. The firm noted that inflationary pressures are weighing on consumer spending, particularly at the low/middle income levels, as nondiscretionary expenses such as gas, grocery, rent are elevated. However, that does not mean that there will not some be some holiday season winners. BofA has Tapestry (TPR) slotted as a top specialty retail top pick on its view that the company has sustainable pricing power and little markdown risk to inventory. In hardlines, Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI) and Tractor Supply (TSCO) are called the standouts. Meanwhile, the food and discount top picks are Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and BJ's Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) with their strong value proposition seen supporting continued traffic and share gains.

Corporate events: Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) and Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) will hold Investor Day events on October 31. The three-day LA Blockchain Summit begins On November 1 with the cryptocurrency world looking for a spark. Notable speakers include MicroStrategy's (MSTR) Michael Saylor, SkyBridge Partners Anthony Scaramucci and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. SpartanNash (NASDAQ:SPTN) will host its Investor Day on November 2. Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) will hold a virtual Investor Day on November 3. On the same day, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) will hold a livestream event with the tagline ""together we advance gaming."" The chipmaker plans to unveil the next generation of AMD Radeon graphics and provide details on the new high-performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNA 3 architecture. The week caps off with shareholders with VMWare (VMW) meeting on November 4 to vote on the Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) merger. Read Seeking Alpha's Catalyst Watch for a detailed list of events next week.

Barron's mentions: Visa (V) attracted a bullish recommendation from the publication this week with shares down sharply amid the broad market sell-off this year. Visa has fallen all the way back to where shares were in January of 2020 before supercharged growth in digital payments drove the stock higher during the pandemic. On the plus side, Visa is noted to have impressive free cash flow, no net debt, and continues to be a double-digit sales and earnings compounder. The kicker is that on a valuation basis - Visa looks cheaper than it has been in years. While concerns about a possible recession have cut into sentiment, Barron's reminded that history shows that Visa continued to grow even through the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The cover story this week called out the potential upside for small cap stocks in a market that is as choppy as it has been in years. Small-cap companies were noted to be mainly domestic, which has helped them avoid much of the effects of the U.S. dollar's 17% surge against other currencies. Even more important, multinationals are observed to be in an onshoring trend with supply chains in what could end up being a major tailwind for small-cap companies. Stocks from small cap universe mentioned as looking attractive were Veritex Holdings (VBTX), Advanced Energy Industries (NASDAQ:AEIS), Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN), ChampionX (CHX), AAR Corp, (AIR), KAR Auction Services (NYSE:KAR), Flowserve (NYSE:FLS).

This article first appeared at Rebel's Guide to Project Management",https://rebelsguidetopm.com/project-management-the-next-10-years/,"What is the future of project management? Let’s look ahead and see what the next 10 years will bring for project management software, jobs, and the role itself.

Does Project Management Have a Future?

There’s a trend towards more and more knowledge work being run in a projectized way, which means more and more people doing project management as part of their day job.

So will we need ‘professional’ project managers in the future? People who just do managing projects?

I think we will, because there will always be complex and complicated projects that need a steady hand and a particular set of skills to bring to a successful delivery

As the business environment gets more and more global, digitalized, uncertain and fast, companies need to quickly adapt and bring services and products to market. Project managers are the people who can make that happen.

I do think project management has a future.

Future of project management: Jobs

PMI says that by 2027 employers will need nearly 88 million people in project-related roles. The global demand for project managers is increasing.

While PMI is an organization for project managers predicting the importance of their own community and you do want to take their figures in context, I do think they have a point.

The role of the project manager has long been shifting away from someone who can tick off tasks as complete on a Gantt chart and towards a strategic leadership position for effecting change in an organization.

Project managers still provide an irreplaceably human combination of leadership, integration of specialists, and ethical behaviour. ~ Arup, Future of Project Management

We are a long way from the death of project management.

Hybrid Project Management: The Next Step for Agile

One of the project management trends we are seeing is the acceptance that hybrid management approaches are the way forward.

I think hybrid project management has been around for ages. It’s certainly something I’ve used: ongoing iterations for development with significant customer involvement in the deliverables at all stages, but managed within a waterfall governance structure and life cycle.

Frankly, hybrid isn’t new.

But there does seem to be a trend in accepting that agile approaches like Scrum can fit within a hybrid framework.

The rise of hybrid project management is good news because:

Projects are more complex than ever

They involve many more individuals: more than could comfortably fit in a multi-skilled Scrum team

Most large organizations aren’t geared up to run their whole operation in an agile way.

The future of project management needs to be more agile . According to research by IPMA, only 47% of organizations are using agile approaches for delivery.

And we wonder why we can’t respond to change fast enough.

The Future is Flexible

The way we run projects has been evolving since we started out formalizing how work gets done in a project setting.

As our environment gets more complex, uncertain and – dare I say it, political – we’ll need more and more tools to help deliver projects in that kind of environment.

For example, project managers need to respond to:

Stakeholders with shorter attention spans

Stakeholders with competing demands on their time

Complex and unknown technical situations

Complex and unknown geopolitical and socio-political situations

Higher staff turnover (no such thing as a job for life any more)

Greater demands being put on management teams

Collaborative contracting and partnering with suppliers

Increasingly complex regulation and governance.

Project managers need options that will help them deliver. And that means being able to choose from predictive, iterative and hybrid ways of delivering the work and blending what works to get the best results.

The future of project management relies on more professional judgement and fewer textbook answers.

Project Management Software: The Next Generation

The future of project management software is interesting. I review a lot of PM software tools and there are companies now making massive leaps into integrating big data, automations, machine learning and more into the way they collate, present and make it possible to use large data sets.

Take Otter, for example, the online transcription tool I use for managing meeting output. It saves so much time and helps with inclusive meetings and accessibility.

Our Pick Otter.ai Otter is a note-taking app that also records in-person meetings. I have a paid version of Otter and it is the tool I use myself. Buy Now We earn a commission if you click this link and make a purchase, at no additional cost to you #ad

Here are some considerations for future technology – project management style.

5 themes for the future of project management software

Blockchain

Artificial intelligence

Human/machine collaboration

Mobile

Remote access

Blockchain

We will need to know about this and how we can harness digital assets to streamline infrastructure, logistics and data tracking on projects.

Over 80% of organizations report hiring someone with blockchain skills or planning to do so in the next 12 months. Could that be you?

AI

AI is already a feature in some project management tools and robotic processing will help automate routine PMO tasks. According to Deloitte, 70% of organizations are exploring or using AI.

Human/machine collaboration

I don’t know yet what this would look like in a project setting beyond the innovations we are seeing in AI, particularly in the PMO. But it’s coming. And it could affect jobs.

While I still remain positive about the role of the project manager, I think other jobs you routinely interact with, like system testers, could be more at risk of being automated.

Hopefully that means the human’s role is elevated into a knowledge leadership position and is freed up from doing the grunt work of tasks like system testing – taking the tools already in use to a whole new level.

Mobile

Devices will become more powerful, but currently we still don’t have all the functions of PM software available in most of the equivalent mobile apps. That will have to change.

Remote access

It’s going to be increasingly important that tools and systems are available at home and remotely for people based out of their home office. Which means connectivity and security have to extend outside the walls of HQ.

Data security is still an important part of being able to set yourself up on your kitchen table and get that work/life balance you dreamed of.

Resource Management: The Next Challenge

For all the talk about the future of work and how project management is going to evolve, I still think we have some challenges with how we work now.

For example, resource management and capacity planning are not things that are easy to do. Project managers lack the tools to effectively manage workload across teams because the solution required relies on enterprise adoption of software.

Make everyone do timesheets and resource planning just so project teams know who’s available to work? No thanks.

Unfortunately, unless we get strategic buy in for managing projects in a professional way, the resource planning challenge isn’t going anywhere soon.

Projects on the Board: The Next Professionals

Arup’s collaborative thought leadership piece into the Future of Project Management talks about every top 100 firm has a project management professional in at least one C-suite role by 2030.

If we are serious about improving project delivery and delivering strategically-aligned projects that generate business value, we need organizations to take project delivery seriously. And that means elevating the discussion beyond senior managers to the board of directors.

The Chief Project Officer role is (in my opinion) long overdue already. With executive oversight from people who actually get it, projects would have more chance of completing successfully – and fewer vanity projects would get started.

Digital Skills: The Next Competency for Project Managers

Digital skills are important for the project managers of the future (and – in all honest, those of us working as PMs today).

CBI’s report into what’s required to create a world-leading innovation economy says that upskilling people with digital skills is essential. The digital skills pipeline isn’t that great at the moment and they suggest more needs to be done to encourage greater ambition in that arena.

PMI’s research, The Project Manager of the Future: Developing digital-age project management skills to thrive in disruptive times (2018), has similar themes.

The digital skills important to project managers are:

Data analysis, analytics and management

Security and data protection

Legal and regulatory compliance

Online collaboration and leadership

Knowledge management

Data-driven decision making.

Add into all of that a very non-digital skill of resilience. With all this change, disruption and digital-ness, the ability to cope with the ups and downs of the job is going to be essential.

The role of project managers in the future

The future of project management is bright. There remains strong demand for people delivering change.

I believe much of the mundane stuff of being a project manager will go away eventually, as our tools tap into the advances in technology that are already out there.

PM will move from being seen by some execs as an administrative function and towards the strategic partnership that it has the potential to be in every business – not just in those enlightened firms with high levels of program management maturity.

Skills for project managers have been shifting towards the ‘soft’ stuff for years. That’s going to be even more important with the way the future of work is going.

Project managers will need to be the humans on the team. We’ll need to connect with others with the skills that you can’t get from your robot colleague:

Empathy

Strategic thinking

Fun

Creativity

Motivation and persuasion

Thoughtful customer service

Listening.

Looking forward: Summary

Project management evolves to meet the needs of today’s workplace problems. We’re facing the kinds of evolution we’re seeing at work because the nature of the work itself demands it.

Efficiency is more than having the right process. It’s also having the capacity as a team – not simply as a project manager because the role is getting too big for one person to do everything – to lead increasingly complex work and solve difficult problems almost daily.

We can do it. We are doing it. And the best project managers are improving how they do it every day. Are you?

Showing the value of practice theory and teaching-led research, this book is a welcome addition to the literature that will be useful to scholars undertaking future research into the remaking of property regimes, writes Scott Timcke.

The Digital Economy. Tim Jordan. Polity. 2020.

Find this book (affiliate link):

Firms like Meta and Google have become unprecedented vehicles for creating commodities, forms of marketing, networks of publicity, great wealth, ways of working, and they have arguably changed the nature of conflict too (see Matthew Ford and Andrew Hoskins, 2022). Through broadening and valorising audiences, the digital economy has the proven capacity to provide new market opportunities, albeit with significant negative social ramifications caused by the accelerated processes of accumulation.

That these lines sound overly familiar is testament to the vitality of nearly three decades of research on the digital economy that has made these kinds of insights commonplace (for early examples, see Andrew Feenberg and Alastair Hannay, 1995; Nick Dyer-Witheford, 1999; Ursula Huws, 1999; and Daniel Schiller, 1999). Still, as new products come to the market so the conceptualisation of property may itself change. Sitting favourably alongside the emerging assetisation literature in STS (for example, Kean Birch and Fabian Muniesa, 2020), the scholarly intervention that Tim Jordan’s The Digital Economy makes is a welcome addition that STS scholars may find useful for future research projects conceptualising the remaking of property regimes.

Seizing upon the adage that when people have different expectations, they tend to see the facts differently, Jordan presses readers to defamiliarise themselves with the market practices they believe they know so well because they are typically the main users too. For example, with so many people working at the interface of desktop computers, the opening chapter gives considerable space to defining the ‘digital economy’, asking for a general rethinking of the assumption that it is simply the truck and trade in software.

Rather than dealing with commercial exchange, Jordan’s preferred affiliation is with practice theory; and he draws specifically on Nick Couldry’s (2010) precepts, giving attention to the meaning of routine cultural actions without presupposing analytic categories in advance. What is at stake is how the practices with and by products, firms, consumers and ancillary services give rise to a hierarchy of claims. In the conclusion Jordan suggests participatory digital practices could take priority, thereby ushering in a property regime which is more democratic than the one that dominates at the moment.

Jordan’s inquiry is first and foremost driven by the salient question of how property is made in the digital economy. This is not an argument about enclosure and pure dispossession per se, because user practices give rise to value and profit; continued use of the property is essential to generating value.

Jordan’s model suggests that the main economic strategies within the digital economy — such as data arbitrage, disintermediation (sellers and buyers circumventing established brokers to transact directly) and after-service sales — rely not only on the customer’s perception of value, but also the users whose practices create products that consumers could purchase. Google’s search algorithms, for instance, allow the data generated by communities of practice to become ‘read’ (that is, commodified), but the utility of these commodities only retains value insofar that such communities continue to practise with the service. If practices alter or diminish, then value is lost.

This is another instance where practices appear to make a difference. Matters of trust and credibility in Google’s products set the scope for value too — value here understood as the viability for downstream data brokering. However, like other sectors, if users do not trust Google’s search engine, then these properties will not receive use nor retain value.

This points to one central aspect of Jordan’s argument about practice: ‘How information is treated will fundamentally be an issue of what kind of property it is formed as’ (135). This point of view is supported by case studies of Google (Chapter Two), Facebook and WeChat (Chapter Three), Uber, AirBnB and Blockchain (Chapter Four), Free Software (Chapter Five) and massive multiplayer online games (Chapter Six). One important consequence of beginning with entangled practices is that it — rightly in my view — decentres platforms as the main object of study (see also Carlotta Benvegnù et al, 2021) A time-strapped reader can find the condensed version of the main argument spanning pages 10-12, with extended treatment in Chapter Eight.

Unfortunately, Jordan’s invitation to defamiliarise entangled practices does come through terse words for ‘the over-reaching of some commentators’ (1) who speak about a new periodisation in capitalism — Shoshana Zuboff being a named target here — as these scholars supposedly discount the practices of users. Similarly, Jordan charges Marxist internet studies scholars like Christian Fuchs with having an ‘unenlightening position’ when they ‘shrug’ that ‘it’s really just the same old capitalism’ (page 1; details of Jordan’s critique can be found on pages 112–23). Still, barbs like these should not put off readers affiliated with these traditions from taking a closer look at the text, if only to hear Jordan’s case about why a theoretical deficit exists (166-68).

There are points where I might organise my thoughts differently to Jordan. While we would likely agree that how social relations are practised matters a great deal, there is merit in looking at the cascading effects of the various processes Jordan isolates. How might disintermediation have wider social ramifications? As a template, take for example the theory of industrial society that Anthony Giddens (1990) and others built. This theory highlighted that industrialisation led to the reconfiguration of space, time and matter, as well as new ways of conceptualising the world by creating new categories of thought for governance, identity and intimacy. Effectively, industrialisation created new objects for and new subjects of struggle. Or to use Jordan’s terminology, new practices, points of view and entanglements arose. So if Jordan vehemently disagrees with Marxists, what new civic identities, relations and regimes have emerged to make their categories obsolete?

Furthermore, insofar as STS case studies of digitisation may focus on local, regional or national jurisdictions — such as city transportation in the case of Uber or housing stock in the case of AirBnB — as a discipline STS typically keeps questions of global capitalism at the forefront (for example, Saskia Sassen, 2017; Donald MacKenzie, 2018; and Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman, 2019). By contrast Jordan does not.

There is an adage that circulates within STS: ‘Big Data would not be possible without Big Finance nor Big Law.’ This points to the initial financing that permits platforms like Uber to register considerable losses and continue operations; or how law firms are retained by Big Tech companies to fend off regulators targeting the range of interlocking services that make it harder for users to switch (Ilan Strauss et al, 2021). It is worth speculating how Jordan’s study would look if he began with the practices of the shareholders of platform companies rather than their users. If there is merit in looking at ‘the practices that create and sustain the wealth of a society’ (12), there is equal merit in focusing on the practices that sustain foundational social inequalities caused by global capitalism. In short, there may be user bias in Jordan’s practice theory.

This raises another issue. Markets both need and fight states. Markets need states to help discipline workers and maintain property rights, but markets also fight states when governance threatens desired rates of profit. Yet the interplay of law, political economy and shareholder lobbying are at the very edge of Jordan’s method. It takes until page 40 before the government is raised, and that just receives a two-paragraph treatment before a new chapter begins. Similarly, the book’s index has no entry for government, the state or finance.

Related to my points about states and markets, Jordan overlooks how routine state military procurement helps buoy the valuation of firms making products for the digital economy (as I have explored in my own work). In the case of the US, much of the core technology for the practices Jordan addresses were developed in public and private universities through targeted grants directly from the US Department of Defense (see MacKenzie, 1990). By contrast, Jordan’s case studies reside at the nexus of savvy cultural and creative work, seemingly unbothered with entangled questions about warfare, leaving unacknowledged how the broken bodies of droned children are also the outcome of the digital economy and its martial components. This book does not encourage readers to think about the entanglement of the digital economy and violence.

One challenge for scholars is articulating precisely how different locations are subject to the dynamics of global markets. Jordan alludes to this important question when raising the matter of how to tax the digital economy (155-58), but he stops short of giving attention to why the private property regime is so dominant the world over.

This is telling about the inclination of Jordan’s politics. In the final chapter he admits his discomfort with the term ‘capitalism’: ‘Capitalism has all too often become little more than a swear word or rallying call’ (166). Rather, he advises ‘seeing digital economic practices in action and then modelling the digital economy’ through looking ‘at the wider significance of those practices, particularly their reliance on cultures and collective actions’ (166). Jordan is reluctant to situate his well-argued micro-sociological insights of the firms and customers in the digital economy within a broader macro-sociological analysis. This limits the ability for tax-fairness activists, among others, to coordinate cross-jurisdiction movements to counter the tremendous clout which firms in the digital economy possess.

To end, one of the hallmarks of The Digital Economy is that it is reminiscent of the classic sociology textbooks of yore. Rather than surveying sets of theoretical-methodological traditions, these kinds of books sought instead to assemble data and conduct an emblematic analysis of their preferred approach in action. Much of this ‘classical feel’ is due to Jordan’s professional skill. Still elements can also be attributed to the origins of the manuscript. As Jordan notes in the preface, the book emerged from ‘teaching-led research’ (vi) where he tested ideas in the seminar room, gauged reception and took critique from students. Polity ought to be commended for supporting a project that shows how vital teaching is in the lifecycle of research.",blockchain,lse.ac.uk
233,Will Web3 Replace Web2,https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/images/csharp-corner.png,31/10/2022,Will Web3 replace Web2?,https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/will-web3-replace-web2/,"Introduction

Today, internet has become part of lives as any other essential need. As much as we love the internet, it's not without its flaws. Its not actually the internet but some bad actors that have manipulated it. Our dependence on centralized web 2.0 platforms has led to huge monopolies and data breaches that have put our personal information at risk. Web3 was created to address these problems by creating a trustless and decentralized internet with ownership of our own data.

The key fundamental difference between Web3 and Web2 is, centralization vs decentralization. In Web2 world, the infra, applications, and data is stored on centralized systems (hosting servers and cloud) that can easily be manipulated by anyone who has access to these systems. In an ideal Web3 world, this may not be possible. The idea behind Web3 is, only the owner of data/content will have control over their content and data. It is upto the owners who they want to give access to their content and data. For that, they may very well earn something in return.

Now, let's get back to the question. Will Web3 replace Web2? If you look at the history of computers and technology, every 15 years or so, there is a major shift in Web technology and right now, we are going through one of those shifts. We started with Web 1.0 in 1989 and 15 years later in 2005, Web 2.0 started. Now we are enterning in Web 3.0 era. Let's take another example. We started with big punch card machines as computers, start building software using console applications. Then Windows UI change the way we use computers and work with data. Then came Web and mobile. While we are in this Web and mobile era, cloud native is another technology that is growing. Does that mean we don't need Windows UI apps? OR will we stop using mobile apps? NO.

So, in short, Web3 will not completely replace Web2. Both world will live side by side for a long time,

If you are not familiar with Web3 and want to learn more about it, please check out What is Web3.

Web3 replaces trust with security

Web3 is a new web that replaces trust with security.

The Web2 was built on trust, where users trusted websites to be secure and not steal their information. This meant that websites could collect personal data from users like usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and more without providing any proof of identity as long as they said they had a privacy policy on their site. This system allowed for the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter where your friends could connect with others and share photos or videos but also allowed for high-profile hacks like those at Equifax in 2017 which exposed millions of people’s personal information including names, addresses and Social Security numbers (SSNs).

The Web3 is different because it uses blockchain technology to provide an immutable record of transactions between two parties who are confident they know who each other are due to cryptographic signatures/private keys instead of trusting a middleman like Google or Facebook which may have bad intentions or even just go out of business someday leaving you with no way to access your account again after being locked out forever!

Web2 is data centralized, Web3 is data decentralized

Web2 is data centralized, Web3 is data decentralized. The difference is that while Web2 is owned by a single entity and can be manipulated at will, Web3’s decentralized nature prevents anyone from manipulating the network.

This means that with Web3 you will have greater privacy as well as better control over your own data than ever before.

In today’s Web2 world, Twitter can go and manipulate data of number of transactions, users, authentic vs fake accounts, and analytics. I’ve experienced Google provided me with false data when running Google Ads. While Google said, they sent thousands of users to our website, we saw very less users coming from Google. On another website, we saw ton of traffic coming from south Asian countries while Google reported very less traffic from those countries. We have seen Facebook charging advertising fees for clicks while those clicks were generated by fake users. We have seen financial data is being manipulated by greedy companies again and again.

Ideal Web3 world is supposed to solve these problems where data is manipulated by businesses and people who have access to the data.

Web3 enables digital ownership

Web3 enables digital ownership. All transactions are recorded on a public network, so no one can take away what you own.

Web3 enables digital economy without intermediaries. You don’t need to trust any third parties like banks or governments to transact with each other—everyone just needs an internet connection!

This is great news because it means that we can finally have a more democratic society where everyone has access to financial services and opportunity, regardless of geography or socio-economic status.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies and Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are great examples of digital ownerships. If you own a digital asset in Web3, no one can come and claim that from you.

Web3 enables digital economy without intermediaries

Yes, it is. And this is a great thing. Let's take a look at how it will help the world change, and why we're excited about it taking over.

Web3 is a decentralized internet that empowers individuals with control over their identities and assets, which allows them to transact directly on the internet (without requiring an intermediary). It also enables digital economies; people can create tokens for anything they want, such as virtual currencies and intellectual property rights. The result? A digital asset economy where anyone can buy things on the internet without middlemen taking their cut along the way - no more credit card fees or bank fees!

In ideal Web3 world, everyone owns their digital wallets that stores digital assets including cryptocurrencies. Each user gets an address. If I need to pay someone for a service or product, I can send him/her digital currencies direct to their wallet. There is no intermediate party involved. While this may not be a major problem in developed countries, but for developing countries, this is a major plus where not only people can save money but can also transact direct almost in real-time.

Web3 empowers metaverse

Metaverse is a digital (virtual) world that is made of digital identities, digital assets, and digital economy. Metaverse is the new way people will interact and will do things on the internet. Metaverse uses avatars and digital identities to represent users and digital currency is used to transact for digital assets in digital economy.

If you want to learn more about metaverse, please read What is Metaverse.

Web3 technologies

Web3 is the next internet. It is not just one technology. It involves how the internet is built, run, and owned. Some of the key technologies of Web3 include decentralization, metaverse, micropayments, digital assets, and digital economy.

To learn more about these technologies, check out What is Web3.

When will Web3 replace Web2?

This is an interesting question. History teaches us a lot. Let’s take a few of these examples.

First credit card was issued by Diners’ Club in 1950. Visa was founded in 1958 but even today, 88% of US consumers spend cash from time to time. Did credit card replaced cash? It’s been 72 years since the credit card was issued.

Mainframe computers were introduced in 1950s but still there are businesses that reply on and use mainframe computers.

Windows UI applications were introduced in late 1990s. More than two decades later, many businesses are still running on Windows applications.

Tesla was incorporated in 2003 and 20 years later, we only have about 2.2% of cars that are fully electric.

As you can imagine from the above examples, while Web3 may be the next kid of the block, Web2 and centralized systems will be here for decades. As a matter of fact, cloud computing is still evolving and growing, and it has not done yet. Before we see a full Web3 boom, we will still have to go through the cloud boom.

Conclusion

Web3 is knocking our doors, but the question remains, will Web3 replace Web2 and when. But we must not forget that when new technologies are developed and evolve, there are many bumps on the way, and it takes time. While Web3 is being built (infrastructure), more and more applications will start testing under the hood technology, make mistakes, learn from them, and fix them. This is how it works.

But in the meantime, Web2 technologies such as cloud, AI, machine learning, robotics, data analytics, mobile apps, and smart everything will continue to flourish. As we have learned from the past, there may not be a full replacement of Web2 by Web3 but the both worlds, Web2 and Web3 will live side by side.",blockchain,c-sharpcorner.com

236,Better Cloud Computing Stock: IBM vs. Alphabet,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/705302/cloud_computing_data_center-gettyimages-1336250753.jpg,30/10/2022,"These two tech titans are experiencing strong growth in the cloud computing market, but one holds the edge as the better investment.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/better-cloud-computing-stock-ibm-vs-alphabet/,"While tech stocks were hammered in 2022, the cloud computing industry barreled along at an impressive growth rate. According to research firm Gartner, the public cloud sector alone is estimated to grow 20% this year.

This amounts to nearly half a trillion dollars in 2022. Just a decade ago, global public cloud computing revenue was a mere $26.4 billion.

Given the cloud industry's rapid expansion, competitors abound. Among the bigger players are tech giants IBM (IBM 1.85%) and Google Cloud, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL 3.78%) (GOOG 3.85%).

Both are seeing strong growth in their respective cloud businesses. But if you had to choose between the two, which company offers the better investment opportunity? Let's dig into each to arrive at an answer.

IBM's cloud strategy

IBM spent the past few years reinventing itself into a hybrid cloud-focused company. In a hybrid cloud implementation, a business employs both public and private clouds, using the former to perform basic IT infrastructure tasks, such as hosting a corporate website, and the latter to secure confidential or critical data, including financial and customer records.

IBM was smart to focus on this area. The hybrid cloud market is forecasted to grow from $85.3 billion last year to $262.4 billion by 2027.

In addition, IBM's impressive list of enterprise clients is an ideal fit for hybrid cloud solutions. Big Blue's customers include the top ten banks, governments, and healthcare companies in the world. These industries need the security of a private cloud while capturing the cost savings of a public one.

IBM's hybrid cloud strategy proved successful. In its third-quarter earnings report, IBM generated revenue of $14.1 billion, a 6% increase over 2021. This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth despite macroeconomic headwinds, such as a strong U.S. dollar.

Big Blue also offers an attractive dividend, yielding about 4.8% at the time of this writing. The company can maintain this robust dividend thanks to its free cash flow (FCF). IBM expects to hit $10 billion in FCF this year, while dividend payments totaled about $6 billion over the trailing 12 months.

IBM has a strong dividend track record, paying consecutive quarterly dividends since 1916. It also raised its dividend in April, marking 27 consecutive years of dividend increases.

Alphabet's Google Cloud approach

Alphabet is building its Google Cloud business in the same way it generated success for its famed Google search engine: by prioritizing customer acquisition and revenue growth over profitability.

That's why Google Cloud is currently unprofitable, exiting the third quarter with an operating loss of $699 million. But its business is growing rapidly. In just three quarters this year, Google Cloud's sales nearly matched all of 2021's income, continuing a multi-year streak of rising revenue.

Time Period Google Cloud Revenue YOY Growth Q1 through Q3, 2022 $19 billion 39% 2021 $19.2 billion 47% 2020 $13.1 billion 46% 2019 $8.9 billion 53%

Google Cloud comprised only about 10% of Alphabet's Q3 revenue, but it's already ranked the third-biggest cloud computing company behind industry leaders Amazon and Microsoft. And Alphabet continues to aggressively invest in Google Cloud despite closing down other bets such as its Stadia video games division.

For instance, Alphabet acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant in September for $5.4 billion, marking one of the company's biggest acquisitions in its history. Mandiant will boost Google Cloud's security in a world where remote workers grew from 23% of the American workforce before the coronavirus pandemic to nearly 60% in 2022.

Is IBM or Alphabet the better investment?

Both IBM and Alphabet have proven successful in their cloud endeavors, so investing in either is worthwhile. After all, the cloud computing industry is forecasted to grow from $706.6 billion last year to $1.3 trillion by 2025.

But if I had to choose one of these cloud computing companies to invest in, I would lean toward Alphabet despite IBM's success and attractive dividend.

Google Cloud's revenue is already edging past Big Blue. IBM's hybrid cloud revenue over the past 12 months totaled $22.2 billion. Google Cloud's revenue was $24.5 billion over the same time period.

Granted, Google Cloud's success can be overshadowed by Alphabet's digital advertising business, which accounted for $54.5 billion of its $69.1 billion in Q3 revenue. And the advertising industry is experiencing a downturn this year, leading Alphabet's Q3 ad revenue to increase just 2.5% year-over-year.

But Alphabet's ad business helps fund Google Cloud. Alphabet generated $63 billion in FCF over the past 12 months, while IBM expects to achieve a cumulative FCF total of $35 billion across three years, from 2022 to 2024.

Also, Alphabet possesses several factors, along with Google Cloud, that make the company an alluring investment, including its dominance in search advertising. Alphabet increased revenue 41% year-over-year in 2021, and its revenue continues to grow this year, reaching $206.8 billion over three quarters compared to $182.3 billion last year.

Google Cloud's strong growth, Alphabet's hefty FCF, and the company's other areas of strength provide compelling reasons to make Alphabet the better choice for an investment in the rapidly rising cloud computing industry.",cloud computing,motley fool
237,Is IBM Still a Great Dividend Stock?,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706749/robot-hand-puts-coins-in-piggy-bank.jpg,30/10/2022,Big Blue has been a top-quality dividend investment for decades. Is it still an effective income stock after the radical strategy change of the last decade?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/is-ibm-still-a-great-dividend-stock/,"If you had asked me for a great dividend stock ten years ago, I wouldn't even have paused to think about it. International Business Machines (IBM 1.85%) was the obvious choice for income investors back then.

IBM was a superstar in 2012. Other companies were lined up to copy Big Blue's successful business plan, serving as a one-stop-shop for every information technology requirement your business might face. The dividend yield wasn't extremely high. At 1.7%, it was actually among the six least generous payouts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the time.

But IBM's commitment to a high-quality dividend was unquestioned, and kind of a big deal. Furthermore, the company powered those rising payouts from ample cash flows. The only reason why the yield wasn't more impressive was that IBM's stock price had posted massive gains from 1995 to 2012. Of all the problems an investment could face, that's a pretty nice one.

That being said, IBM stood at a crossroads in 2012. The company had just installed Ginni Rometty in the CEO's office, and she had started to turn Big Blue in a new direction. That process has been painful and is not completely done yet, even though Rometty already passed the CEO baton to cloud computing veteran Arvind Krishna.

The IBM you see today is a very different company than the hardware/software/services giant of 2012. But is Big Blue still a no-brainer dividend investment?

Big Blue's recent dividend history

As it turns out, IBM's dividend achievements have continued to stack up over the last decade.

In 2012, the company had been raising its payouts annually for 17 years. Now, the unbroken streak of dividend boosts has stretched to 27 years, qualifying the stock as a proper Dividend Aristocrat. Granted, the increases have been relatively small in recent years but Big Blue gritted its proverbial teeth and came up with the cash. Symbolic dividend increases still count, and the annual payouts per share have roughly doubled over the last ten years.

If you picked up some IBM shares at the start of its Aristocratic run of dividend lifts, you would have paid a split-adjusted price of approximately $22 per share in December 1995. Today, IBM pays out quarterly dividend checks adding up to $1.65 per year. The effective yield on those old shares, then, works out to 7.5%. That's not too shabby, and up from an effective yield of 3.9% a decade ago.

All told, the payout has increased by a staggering 2,540% in 27 years:

Is IBM a great income investment for new money?

Investors grabbing new IBM shares right now start from a respectable yield of 4.8%. Starting from this rich payout gives you a leg up on income generation in the long run.

Now that IBM has taken the journey from a complete IT buffet to a leaner specialist in artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud computing, I expect the company to report impressive growth over the next decade or so. Once the global economy finds its feet again, IBM should emerge as a leader and highly trusted provider of cloud and AI services.

And the renewed financial growth will probably inspire another run of more generous dividend increases, like the 2007-to-2020 surge that followed after the slower-paced increases between 1995 and 2005. The company has a long history of putting shareholder-friendly dividends and buybacks first, and I don't expect that philosophy to change.

So yes, IBM is still a great dividend stock. If anything, it's only getting better with age. Time and consistent dividend raises are the magic ingredients in this wealth-building potion.",cloud computing,motley fool
238,2 Once-in-a-Decade Buying Opportunities in an S&P 500 and Nasdaq Bear Market,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706034/investor-63.jpg,30/10/2022,"The bear market has hit these software stocks hard, but the downturn has created rare buying opportunities for investors.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/2-once-in-a-decade-buys-in-a-nasdaq-bear-market/,"Economic concerns have plagued investors throughout the year, and the stock market has tumbled as a result. The S&P 500 has fallen 21% from its high, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 32%, putting both indexes in a bear market. But that chaos comes with a silver lining for patient investors.

Software giants Salesforce (CRM -4.48%) and Adobe (ADBE -0.06%) have seen their share prices plunge 48% and 54%, respectively. Neither stock has suffered a greater loss at any point in the past 10 years, meaning investors now have a once-in-a-decade buying opportunity.

Here's what you should know.

Salesforce: A leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software

Salesforce has been a pioneer from day one. It launched a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform in 1999, becoming the first company to adopt cloud computing on a large scale.

Today, its platform comprises productivity software for marketing, commerce, sales, and customer service, as well as tools for workflow automation, data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI). Salesforce also offers several industry-specific CRM platforms, featuring tools tailored to end markets like consumer goods, financial services, and media. That go-to-market strategy reduces friction and accelerates time to value for customers.

Salesforce has turned its capacity for innovation into a powerful brand. It captured 24% market share in CRM software last year -- more than the next four competitors combined -- marking its ninth consecutive year as the industry leader.

Financially, revenue climbed 25% to $29.3 billion over the past year, though free cash flow (FCF) jumped just 4% to $5.7 billion, as operating expenses rose more quickly than revenue. That said, investors should expect FCF growth to accelerate in the future. Management says its GAAP operating margin will clock in 3.6% this year, up from 2.1% last year.

Looking ahead, investors have good reason to be bullish. Salesforce puts its total addressable market (TAM) at $290 billion in 2026, meaning it has only captured about 10% of its future TAM. Additionally, shares currently trade at 5.5 times sales, a bargain compared to the five-year average of 8.8 times sales. That's why this growth stock is worth buying today.

Adobe: A leader in creativity and digital experience software

Adobe specializes in digital media and digital experience software. Its digital media business includes Adobe Document Cloud, a suite of PDF and e-signature tools that help businesses replaced paper-based processes with digital documents. The digital media business also includes Adobe Creative Cloud, a collection of creativity software comprising industry-leading products for image and video editing, vector graphics, and cinematic special effects, among others.

Adobe supplements those solutions with its digital experience business. Adobe Experience Cloud is a suite of analytics, marketing, and commerce tools that help businesses turn customer data into personalized experiences. Earlier this year, research company Gartner recognized Adobe as a leader in digital experience platforms, citing a better ability to execute and a more complete vision than any other vendor.

Financially, Adobe missed revenue estimates in the most recent quarter, and its 2023 guidance fell short of expectations, due primarily to an estimated four-percentage-point headwind related to the strong dollar. On the bright side, unfavorable foreign exchange rates should normalize in time, and Adobe still turned in respectable results over the past year. Revenue rose 14% to $17.2 billion and FCF climbed 8% to $7.1 billion. That works out to an impressive FCF margin of 41%.

Looking to the future, Adobe puts its addressable market at $205 billion by 2024 -- digital media represents $95 billion and digital experience represents $110 billion -- and investors have good reason to be optimistic . Adobe is already a leader in several creativity categories, but the company is also gaining traction with newer products, like its Substance suite of 3D design applications. That is especially noteworthy because it positions Adobe to be a key player in the metaverse.

Additionally, Adobe recently announced plans to acquire design collaboration platform Figma. It will pay a hefty $20 billion in cash and stock, but Figma is growing like wildfire. The company is expected to add $200 million in new annualized recurring revenue (ARR) this year, surpassing $400 million in total ARR by the end of 2022. Additionally, average spend per Figma customers is growing faster than 50% per year, and Figma puts its addressable market at $16.5 billion by 2025.

With that in mind, shares of Adobe currently trade at 8.7 times sales, a big discount to the five-year average of 15.3 times sales. That creates a nice buying opportunity, and patient investors should seriously consider adding a few shares of this growth stock to their portfolio.",cloud computing,motley fool
239,Microsoft Beats Back King Dollar and Rising Interest Rates,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706669/finance-and-technology-online-finance.jpg,30/10/2022,Effects from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy are starting to accelerate.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/microsoft-beats-back-king-dollar-and-rising-intere/,"Despite issues, big tech stocks are incredibly resilient investments. With the global economy up against inflation, war in Ukraine, and a possible recession in 2023, many tech and software stocks keep chugging higher. Microsoft's (MSFT 3.33%) fiscal 2023 first-quarter earnings showcase this resiliency.

But pressure is mounting. A record run-up in the U.S. dollar is only just beginning to blast corporate earnings. Microsoft is going to be more than fine, but a big speed bump looms large.

King Dollar demands a cut

Just like the other cloud computing giants that reported earnings (Amazon (AMZN 1.88%) Web Services and Alphabet's (GOOGL 3.78%) (GOOG 3.85%) Google Cloud), Microsoft reported a stunning negative effect from currency exchange rates. During the first quarter of its fiscal 2023 (the three months ended Sept. 30, 2022), total revenue increased 11% year over year to $50.1 billion.

However, backing out the effects of currency exchange rates, revenue would have increased 16%. So, King Dollar took a hefty five-percentage-point toll.

This is a challenge for any U.S. multinational organization right now. Here's how it works: A sale is made outside of the U.S. and collected in that country's currency, but that money received needs to be converted back into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. So far, no big deal. But what happens when the dollar increases in value against that foreign currency? Suddenly the value of that international sale gets reduced when exchanged for a stronger dollar.

All of this is a nasty side effect of the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes this year. Other central banks have been slower to raise rates in their fight against inflation compared to the Fed's record-breaking pace of hikes, which has caused the dollar's double-digit-percentage spike in value this year.

Thus Microsoft and friends' problem right now. Revenue growth is still intact, but currency exchange rates are lowering reported financial figures by a very large amount.

A growth stock for nearly 40 years and still counting

The dollar's record run-up is even more demanding on profit margins. Again, like other tech titans, the majority of Microsoft's expenses are made in U.S. dollars. So when those expenses are being made in a strengthening currency versus revenue collected in a weakening international one, the effect is an even larger reduction in profitability. While the dollar took a five-percentage-point cut from Microsoft revenue last quarter, it took a whopping nine-percentage-point cut from operating income -- lowering year-over-year operating profit growth to 6% (versus 15% growth excluding exchange rate effects). Ouch!

The good news, though, is that even after nearly four decades as a publicly traded company, Microsoft is still very much a growth stock. As CEO Satya Nadella said in the earnings report, ""In a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the ultimate tailwind."" When software is done right (paired with sticky hardware products we can't separate our lives from), it becomes an incredible growth investment for many decades. With inflation and economic uncertainty the story of the year, Microsoft is still helping its users ""do more with less"" in new ways.

Of course, these currency headwinds are expected to continue into Microsoft's Q2 2023 and will likely continue for the rest of the fiscal year. Additionally, the accelerating global economic slowdown is also impacting Microsoft's currency-exchange-neutral growth. The cloud segment Azure, the primary driver of results these days, is projected to slow from a 42% year-over-year growth rate (excluding exchange rates) to about 37% (also currency-neutral) in Q2 fiscal 2023.

While these various factors are concerning, it's clear Microsoft is far more resilient than the average mega-corporation. Shares trade for 24 times trailing-12-month earnings per share, which looks like fair value to me assuming the company can grow earnings per share at an average high-single-digit to low-teens percentage for the rest of the 2020s. After all, at some point the dollar's strength will dissipate -- maybe even reverse -- which would be a boost to Microsoft's revenue and profits.

This market will continue to be wild, but Microsoft looks like a good safe-haven stock to hold for the long term.",cloud computing,motley fool
240,"Down 32%, This Towering Growth Stock Is Starting to Look Like a Bargain",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706793/a-person-measuring-a-chart-showing-growth.jpg,30/10/2022,The company sees a decade of growth ahead.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/down-32-this-towering-growth-stock-is-starting-to/,"Most stocks have lost ground this year, leaving many to trade at much more attractive valuations. That's certainly the case for American Tower (AMT 1.29%).

Despite this year's headwinds, the global tower and data center operator has continued to grow its cash flow. With its share price falling, it's beginning to look like a bargain, especially given the dual growth catalysts it sees ahead.

Standing tall amid the headwinds

American Tower faced its share of challenges in the third quarter. Despite those issues, the infrastructure REIT's total revenue rose 8.8%. It benefited from last year's acquisition of data center REIT CoreSite and continued organic tenant billings growth, which came in at 2.6% in the period.

However, the REIT's adjusted funds from operations (FFO) declined by 5.3% per share in the period. That's partly due to a higher share count as it sold stock to fund the CoreSite deal and the impact of foreign exchange headwinds. Meanwhile, collections from one of its customers in India fell short of what it billed them, while Sprint canceled some leases following its merger with T-Mobile.

Despite these headwinds, American Tower expects its full-year adjusted FFO to grow a range of $9.57 to $9.74 per share, a 2.3% increase from 2021 at the mid-point. With its stock price tumbling to below $200 a share, it trades at around 21 times its adjusted FFO. That's significantly cheaper than the more than 28 FFO multiple it fetched at the beginning of this year. It looks like a bargain for a company with American Tower's long-term growth potential.

Two big long-term growth catalysts

CEO Tom Bartlett discussed the company's growth drivers on the accompanying conference call:

Since the start of 2019, 5G spectrum auctions, mainly in the mid band, have collectively driven over $155 billion in purchase price proceeds across our served market. These acquisitions of large swaths of new spectrum have kicked off what we believe will be at least a decade-long period of network investments, aimed at delivering on the promises of 5G's faster and lower latency applications. We anticipate this will result in $5 billion of incremental annual customer capex spend in the United States, on average, as compared to the levels we saw throughout the 4G cycle.

As Bartlett pointed out, the massive investment to buy spectrum will lead mobile carriers to invest more money in building out 5G networks over the next decade. That has already caused T-Mobile, AT&T, DISH Networks, and Verizon to new sign master lease agreements with American Tower over the past year to support this next investment phase. Those ""investments will drive a near-term acceleration in organic new business growth and a sustained level of elevated tower activity over a multi-year period.""

Bartlett also noted on the call that ""the most apparent opportunity of scale that we see over the next decade is out of the mobile edge,"" a network architecture that enables cloud computing at the edge of a cellular network. This opportunity led the company to acquire CoreSite. It sees significant potential to deploy solutions that connect its towers to data centers and provide mobile edge solutions to customers. Bartlett stated, ""the edge will represent a meaningful opportunity to drive incremental value to our assets over the long term.""

These catalysts should drive growth for American Tower over the coming decade. It will be able to add more tenants to its existing tower, build additional sites, and expand its data center footprint. These investments should enable American Tower to accelerate adjusted FFO growth as its current headwinds fade, and those tailwinds pick up speed.

A compelling long-term opportunity

4G was a powerful growth driver for American Tower over the last decade. The infrastructure REIT grew its AFFO and dividend at a double-digit annual pace as it helped mobile carriers support that network expansion.

While it's currently facing some near-term headwinds, it sees two big tailwinds in 5G and mobile edge driving accelerated growth over the next decade. That makes this year's sell-off in its stock look like a bargain, given all the growth that still lies ahead.",cloud computing,motley fool
241,5 Top Stocks for November,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706543/a-person-looks-at-a-computer-and-smiles-while-holding-a-tablet-and-leaning-on-a-desk-that-consists-of-color-pallets-various-writing-utensils-and-other-materials.jpg,30/10/2022,"A dynamic blend of growth, value, and dividend stocks worth considering now.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/5-top-stocks-for-november/,"One of the greatest challenges of being a long-term investor is enduring market cycles. It can be downright perplexing to see individual stocks and sectors go from in favor to out of favor on a whim. But steep sell-offs and volatility can present impeccable buying opportunities for patient investors.

As a recent example, note that in 2020 the three worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500 were energy, real estate, and financials. The reverse was true the following year, as energy, real estate, and financials were, in order, the three best-performing sectors of 2021. While investors shouldn't expect these kinds of rapid reversals over the short term, it's worth noting that sharp price movements aren't always grounded in fundamentals and can have nothing to do with a core investment thesis.

Bear markets have historically presented impeccable buying opportunities -- but only for companies that have what it takes to overcome obstacles and grow over the long term. Here's why Microsoft (MSFT 3.33%), Ford Motor Company (F 1.88%), The Trade Desk (TTD -5.94%), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -0.80%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 1.82%) stand out as five compelling buys now.

Indispensable software products and cloud services

Trevor Jennewine (Microsoft): Microsoft saw its share price tumble more than 7% following its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2022). Revenue rose 11% to $50.1 billion, a big deceleration from 22% growth last year, and earnings fell 13% to $2.35 per diluted share. Worse yet, guidance came in short of Wall Street's expectations, as CFO Amy Hood said weak PC demand would persist into the second quarter, negatively impacting revenue from Windows and Surface devices. Hood also said ad spend on LinkedIn and Bing Search would likely suffer too.

However, things aren't as bad as they seem. Revenue actually climbed 16% when unfavorable foreign exchange rates are stripped out, and earnings climbed 11% when adjusted for a one-time tax benefit last year. Additionally, temporary economic headwinds may put pressure on Microsoft in the near term, but they leave the long-term investment thesis unchanged. That means short-sighted shareholders who sold the stock have created a buying opportunity for patient investors.

The bull case for Microsoft is straightforward. The company offers a range of mission-critical software and cloud services, and it has achieved a strong presence in several end markets. Most notably, Microsoft 365 brings together industry-leading tools like Office 365 for productivity, Power BI for business analytics, and Teams for communication and collaboration.

Microsoft is also a strong contender in several cybersecurity verticals -- access management, endpoint protection, security information, and event management -- and its security customer count jumped 33% to 860,000 in the most recent quarter. That puts Microsoft in front of a large growth opportunity, as the cybersecurity software market is expected to increase at 12% per year through the end of the decade, reaching $500 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.

Finally, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud services provider. It trails Amazon Web Services by a wide margin, but it has twice as much market share as the third-place contender, Alphabet's Google Cloud. That bodes well for the future. Grand View Research estimates that cloud computing spend will grow at about 16% annually to approach $1.6 trillion by 2030.

Currently, Microsoft's share price sits 32% off its high, marking its greatest drop in the last decade. That's why this stock is worth buying in November.

This long-term growth story is intact

Neha Chamaria (Ford): With Ford shares losing more than one-third of their value in 2022 so far, investors were pinning hopes on the auto giant's third-quarter numbers for some respite. Unfortunately, Ford reported a huge net loss for the quarter and trimmed its forecast for adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the full year.

Yet, Ford just made a smart business move, and while that may have driven its Q3 losses higher, it shows how management is focused on high-growth areas even if it means making some tough decisions. Also, it's not that Ford isn't growing at all, which is why you'd want to give Ford stock a serious look while the market harps on near-term blips.

Ford is facing a problem with supply, not demand. At the end of September, Ford had nearly 40,000 vehicles in inventory that couldn't be sold because of a shortage of parts. Yet it still grew its revenue by 10% year over year in Q3 on robust demand and expects supply challenges to ease in the coming quarters. In fact, Ford expects its wholesale shipments -- or units sold primarily to dealers -- to rise 10% in 2022. Also, Ford's adjusted EBIT guidance of $11.5 billion for the full year still translates into nearly 15% growth over 2021.

In short, Ford may not be growing as fast as investors want it to, but it is growing at a decent pace despite the macroeconomic headwinds. Ford's electric vehicle (EV) sales are booming as well -- they tripled year over year in the month of September, with its F-150 Lightning pickup truck selling like hotcakes. And to double down on viable autonomous technologies, Ford will now build Level 2 and Level 3 self-driving technologies internally even as it announced plans to shut down Argo AI. It looks like a prudent move as Argo AI was focused on Level 4 technology, and so far, fully self-driven technology has proven to be more difficult than expected to develop and commercialize.

A big write-off on its Argo AI investment may have hit Ford's bottom line in Q3, but that shouldn't detract you from the steady growth in Ford's shipments, EV sales, and cash flows. Not to mention its growth plans.

Booming business amid a sectorwide slowdown

Anders Bylund (The Trade Desk): I love to buy shares of excellent companies while they are cheap. That's a key ingredient in the classic investing mantra to ""buy low, sell high."" It's even better when the company's business is booming, even though Wall Street tossed the stock in the bargain bin due to a systemic weakness in the relevant sector. A mismatch between expected weakness and robust results sets the stage for wealth-building returns in the long run.

That's exactly what I see in The Trade Desk right now. The stock trades roughly 40% lower year to date as investors wrestle with widely reported slowdowns in online advertising sales. The market reaction makes sense at a glance, since The Trade Desk makes its money by running automated digital ad campaigns on behalf of other companies.

However, The Trade Desk's business is firing on every available cylinder. Sales increased by 35% in the second quarter, compared to the year-ago period. Revenue, free cash flows, and cash reserves are skyrocketing, often leaving analyst estimates in the dust:

The secret to The Trade Desk's success in a weak market is simple. Penny-pinching marketing campaign managers want to make the most of every ad-budget nickel in these challenging times. That's what The Trade Desk does best, adding data-driven value to its clients' advertising efforts.

The company is set to report third-quarter results on Nov. 7. These reports don't always send share prices skyward, even when The Trade Desk presents impressive surprises on the top and bottom lines. Still, we are most likely about to get our hands on yet another piece of evidence that this company can thrive in a difficult market. Whether you buy The Trade Desk now at a deeper discount or wait for cold, hard financial gains in the earnings report, early November looks like a great time to pick up a few shares.

Rising from today's modest starting price, this stock can make you plenty of money in the long run.

A winner with even better days ahead

Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): As 2022 winds down, the odds of the U.S. entering a recession appear to be increasing. Many, if not most, stocks will probably decline during an economic downturn. However, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an exception. It's the kind of stock that's likely to thrive in a recession.

Vertex is certainly defying the bear market right now. The biotech stock has soared more than 40% year to date. I think this winner has even better days ahead.

All Vertex needs to do to continue growing its revenue and earnings is snag additional reimbursement deals and regulatory approvals for its existing cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs. That shouldn't be very difficult, in my view.

The company and its partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, hope to soon file for regulatory approvals of exa-cel in treating rare blood disorders beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. I think the prospects for Vertex to have another future blockbuster in its lineup with the gene-editing therapy look bright.

Vertex's pipeline also features three other promising late-stage programs. It could have yet another powerful CF therapy with the triple combination of VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561. Non-opioid pain drug VX-548 has tremendous potential. Inaxaplin (VX-147) could be an effective treatment for APOL1-mediated kidney disease, an indication with a larger patient population than CF.

A recession wouldn't cause Vertex's CF therapy sales to decline. Neither would macroeconomic issues impact the company's drug development programs. With the signs pointing toward the economy potentially heading south, I think Vertex is an ideal stock to buy in November to weather the storm.

Procter & Gamble's consistency is unrivaled

Daniel Foelber (Procter & Gamble): Currency weakness and inflation are taking a sledgehammer to the performance of U.S.-based companies -- particularly conglomerates with international exposure. Procter & Gamble (P&G) generates just over half of its sales from outside North America. A strong dollar means that international sales are effectively discounted relative to domestic sales, which impacts profitability.

In its Q1 fiscal 2023 presentation, P&G forecasted a staggering $3.9 billion in full-year fiscal 2023 headwinds due to inflation, commodity, and currency-related factors. The $3.9 billion translates to an earnings per share (EPS) headwind of $1.57, or 27% of its full-year forecast.

Despite this challenge, P&G is still forecasting flat to 4% core EPS growth in fiscal 2023, which is incredibly impressive given the impact of the headwinds discussed. P&G plans to distribute $9 billion in dividends in fiscal 2023 and will likely raise its dividend for the 67th consecutive year. However, it's buying back less stock, with direct share repurchases at an estimated $6 billion to $8 billion compared to $10 billion in fiscal 2022.

P&G's consistency deserves a premium valuation, no matter the market cycle. Even in the face of challenges, the company generates ample free cash flow to support a growing dividend and buybacks. After all, free cash flow used on dividends and buybacks is effectively cash that the company doesn't need to run the core business. Investors would be hard-pressed to find a company that is better insulated from economic headwinds than Procter & Gamble. Its 22.9 price-to-earnings ratio isn't all that inexpensive relative to the rest of the market. But the quality of its dividend (yielding 2.8%) makes P&G one of the most reliable ways to generate passive income.",cloud computing,motley fool

Since the year began, all three major indexes have plunged into a bear market, and a number of metrics and indicators suggest the broader market could head even lower.

While that's not exactly a rosy forecast, it does represent an incredible opportunity. No matter how poorly the stock market's major indexes have performed throughout history, big declines have eventually always been recouped by bull market rallies. This means the current bear market is an ideal time to put money to work.

However, investors don't have to buy volatile stocks to build wealth on Wall Street. There are a number of relatively safe stocks that have navigated their way through downturns before and offer reasonable long-term growth potential without the violent price swings typically associated with high-growth stocks. What follows are three exceptionally low-risk stocks that have the ability to turn an initial investment of $400,000 into $1 million, including dividends paid, by 2030.

Walgreen Boots Alliance

The first safe stock that offers low volatility and the opportunity to generate a total return, including dividends paid, of 150% by 2030 is pharmacy-chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 3.72%).

Are things perfect for Walgreens at the moment? No. A slowdown in COVID-19 vaccinations has modestly slowed foot traffic into its stores. Arguably more pressing, a strengthening U.S. dollar threatens to weigh down its earning potential in overseas markets.

That has some folks on Wall Street leery about putting money to work in this pharmacy giant. However, this is a narrow-sighted view for a company making all the right moves.

For years, Walgreens has been undertaking a transformation designed to make the company more efficient, boost organic growth, and increase customer loyalty. The initial report card for this transformation should result in an ""A"" grade.

In terms of operating efficiency, Walgreens set a goal to reduce its annual operating expenses by $2 billion by the end of fiscal 2022 (the company's fiscal year ends August 31). Walgreens surpassed $2 billion in annual cost savings and managed to reach its goal one year ahead of schedule (fiscal 2021).

Of course, cost-cutting only moves margins and the profit needle so far. What's far more enticing is where the company has been deploying its capital. For instance, it's beefed up its online retail presence in the wake of the pandemic. Even though this is a brick-and-mortar-dominated retail chain, Walgreens is seeing sustained digital sales growth in the double digits.

Additionally, Walgreens has partnered with and made a majority investment in VillageMD to open up to 1,000 full-service health clinics by 2027. They'll be co-located at Walgreens' stores in over 30 U.S. markets.

As of the end of August, 152 of these clinics were already open. Having a physician on staff broadens the treatment landscape for these clinics and provides an impetus for repeat visits.

One final note: Walgreens is doling out a 5.4% yield and has raised its base annual payout for 47 consecutive years. Valued at just seven times its fiscal 2022 earnings, Walgreens Boots Alliance seems to provide a very safe floor and reasonably high ceiling.

York Water

Exceptionally low-risk stocks don't have to be well known to deliver triple-digit total returns. Completely off-the-radar water utility stock York Water (YORW 5.16%) is the perfect example of a safe stock that can make its shareholders a lot richer by 2030.

For even the most diehard utility investors, York Water is probably a name few have heard of before. It's a small-cap company ($603 million market cap) that averages about 63,000 shares traded daily. More specifically, it operates water and wastewater utility services in 51 municipalities spanning three counties in South-Central Pennsylvania. But what York might lack in publicity, it more than makes up for with its capital-return program, which I'll get to in a moment.

The beauty of water utility stocks like York Water is that their operating cash flow is very predictable. To begin with, homeowners and renters have few, if any, choices when it comes to choosing their water and wastewater utility provider.

To build on this point, York is a regulated water utility. This means the company can't pass along rate hikes without receiving approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.

While this might sound like more hassle than benefit, it's quite the opposite. With rates known in advance, York avoids being exposed to potentially unpredictable wholesale pricing. This predictability plays a key role in York setting aside capital for acquisitions and its dividend without having to worry about these outlays adversely impacting profits.

But the real star for York Water has been its dividend. Earlier this year, I referred to York as the ""Greatest Dividend Stock of All Time,"" because no publicly traded company has paid a consecutive dividend for a longer time frame -- 206 years (and counting).

Though its 1.8% yield may be a bit pedestrian among utility stocks, the compound annual total return of its shares plus dividend since 1999 would put investors on a path to gain 150% on a $400,000 initial investment by 2030 (assuming its average returns for the past 23 years hold true for another eight years).

Intel

The third exceptionally low-risk stock that can turn a $400,000 initial investment into $1 million by 2030 is semiconductor stock Intel (INTC 4.35%).

Understandably, a quick look at Intel's stock chart on a year-to-date basis might have investors feeling anything but ""safe."" The combination of historically high inflation, persistent global supply chain issues, a strengthening U.S. dollar, growing fears of a recession, and market-share gains by key rival Advanced Micro Devices have pushed shares of Intel to their lowest point in more than eight years. Though cyclical stocks like Intel don't bounce back at the snap of a finger, they can offer competitive advantages and predictability that make them rock-solid buys.

For example, on a macro basis, semiconductor stocks appear poised to benefit from certain products and industries becoming more technology-driven. Everything from our home appliances to cars are becoming more reliant on semiconductor solutions. This provides a steady growth opportunity for what often amounts to multiyear economic expansions.

More specific to Intel, its data center segment should become a cash cow this decade. Although Intel is best known for its personal-computing (PC) processors, it's the steady shift of enterprise data into the cloud that should fuel data center demand for years to come. Even with modest market share losses to AMD, Intel still commands the bulk of PC, server, and mobile central-processing-unit market share.

The CHIPS and Science Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August, presents another opportunity for Intel to move the needle. Intel is spending $20 billion to bolster its foundry operations and build two manufacturing plants in Ohio. The company could lean on the subsidies provided to the semiconductor industry via the CHIPS Act to construct additional facilities in the United States.

At no point in Intel's storied history has the company been valued so inexpensively relative to its book value. When you add in its 5.4% dividend yield, you get an extremely safe tech stock with what should be a sturdy floor beneath its current share price.",cloud computing,motley fool

BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications industry sustained steady expansion in revenue in the first three quarters, with emerging businesses such as cloud computing posting rapid growth, official data showed.

The combined operating revenue of the sector stood at roughly 1.2 trillion yuan (about 167.37 billion U.S. dollars) in the January-September period, rising 8.2 percent year on year, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

Emerging businesses such as big data, cloud computing, internet data centers and Internet of Things registered a rapid revenue increase during the period. The emerging business revenue of China's three telecom giants -- China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom -- jumped 33.4 percent from a year earlier to 232.9 billion yuan.

Specifically, revenue from cloud computing and big data soared 127.6 percent and 62.6 percent, respectively, in the first nine months, while that from data centers logged an increase of 14.3 percent.

The new images have been added to eight years of previous data, which introduce the most detailed polar region terrain maps ever created. Using high-resolution satellite data, the maps show the polar regions in stunning detail and will provide new insights into the effects of climate change over time.

The researchers have also partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to make the high-resolution imagery data publicly available in the cloud for free.

The scientific project is being headed up by Claire Porter, the acting co-director at the Polar Geospatial Center (PGC), a polar science and logistics support organization at the University of Minnesota. The PGC receives support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). PGC provides geospatial support, mapping, and GIS/remote sensing solutions to researchers and logistics groups in the polar science community.

PGC provides three primary services which are domain and institutional knowledge to solve a broad range of polar geospatial problems: access to sub-meter commercial satellite imagery for the Antarctic and Arctic; expertise to be able to task, manage, process, and deliver high-level, value-added products; and educational courses and online material to transfer PGC’s knowledge and experience to the community.

“Our previous data resulted in more than 300 scientific publications,” said Claire Porter, acting co-director of the National Science Foundation–funded Polar Geospatial Center at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. “With four more years of data that is even more accessible, these are transformative data sets. We’re excited to see what scientists will discover about how our Earth is changing.”

The project started with images taken from a constellation of polar-orbiting satellites about 400–700 kilometers (250–435 miles) above the Earth. The researchers then created the digital elevation models based on 50-centimeter resolution images captured by the commercial satellites owned by Maxar and licensed by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

To help create the stunningly detailed maps, PGC partnered with Ohio State University and the Ohio Supercomputer Center to develop the software to process the images and University of Minnesota researchers put the maps together with computing resources from the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign that provided the Blue Waters supercomputer, which is a leadership-class academic supercomputer. After processing millions of images, the researcher was able to create high-resolution extremely detailed topographic maps.

The newest data was used to fill in all the previous gaps in data to provide full coverage of the entire polar regions north of 60°N (including most of Scandinavia, Greenland, northern Canada, Alaska, and Siberia) and south of 60°S (including all of Antarctica). With all the data and the ability to process it, the researchers were able to build a continent-wide seamless terrain map in the Antarctic, with plans to release an Arctic version this winter that will be just as stunning.

With the signs of climate change becoming more apparent, these detailed maps of the polar regions are more significant to understanding the full effects of what’s truly happening. Using these digital elevation models, scientists can see the detailed topography of the land, including individual trees, lakes, roads, and buildings.

“In the past, researchers collected data using expensive airplanes or land exploration at limited times of the year. Now, we are measuring the surface of the Earth at a resolution and geographic scale that no one has ever seen before, and we’ve been doing it for more than a decade,” Porter said.

“We’ve been able to see glacier change, erosion, landslides, and flooding—all in incredible detail over time,” Porter added. “That’s a game changer for everyone who is trying to protect our planet for the future.”

Learn why we recommend BUG ETF to gain exposure to cybersecurity industry.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550873-bug-invest-cybersecurity-concentrated-etf,"TU IS

Cybersecurity is one of our favourite growth themes for a medium-to-long-term investment horizon. Not only has growth in this sector been particularly resilient to the current economic slowdown, but valuations have also become attractive relative to long-term growth prospects. For investors looking for a cost-effective and convenient way to build portfolio exposure to this theme, we think that the Global X Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:BUG) could be a great choice.

Growth Prospects Not Fully Appreciated By Investors

Despite the increase in frequency and cost of data security breaches across government agencies and corporate enterprises in recent years, there is still significant underinvestment in cybersecurity.

So far in 2022, there have already been multiple major cyber attack incidents that have cost U.S enterprises millions in damages. According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report 2022, the average cost of a data breach in the U.S is around US$9.4 million, which is more than twice the global average of US$4.4 million. The T-Mobile (TMUS) data breach in 2021, which affected around 80 million U.S residents, ended up costing the company US$350 million to settle a class action lawsuit. In an SEC filing following the settlement, T-Mobile stated that it would spend US$150 million this year and in 2023 on cybersecurity.

For many years, cyberattacks appear to be specifically targeting large corporations and government agencies due to the massive volumes of personal data held by these entities. However, as these entities beef up their cybersecurity, future attacks will become increasingly more difficult and risky for hackers. Small and medium enterprises with tiny cybersecurity budgets and thus weaker defenses, could increasingly become the next target of choice.

From our perspective, there is enormous scope for growth in cybersecurity spending due to persistent underinvestment over the years. This is in stark contrast to the breathtaking boom in cloud computing and blockchain technologies. Cybersecurity spending has only recently begun to emerge more prominently on the IT budgets of large companies that have come to appreciate the risks and cost of cyberattacks the hard way. As the modern world becomes increasingly more digitalized, interconnected, and data-dependent, we expect cybersecurity spending growth to accelerate.

Cybersecurity Will Be Multi-Layered And Constantly Evolving

The ever-increasing sophistication of information technology that is being applied in more areas of government services and businesses, means that there will be a greater number and variety of connections that could become vulnerable to cyberattacks. The sheer sophistication and scope of detecting and defending against all types of cyberattacks mean that cybersecurity will be multi-layered in nature, requiring uniquely different solutions for different parts of an IT infrastructure. Furthermore, as new technologies are added to existing infrastructure, cybersecurity solutions will need to constantly evolve to meet new challenges and requirements.

This multi-layered nature of cybersecurity could present a difficult problem for investors: there is unlikely to be a single cybersecurity company, not even a handful, that will end up dominating the industry. Just like how diverse the software industry has become, the same is likely to happen to cybersecurity. Therefore, the odds are stacked against the stock picker who is looking for that one big winner. Instead, we think that the optimal way to execute this bullish view on the cybersecurity theme is to invest in a concentrated basket of leading companies that are dominating in their respective areas of cybersecurity.

Global X Cybersecurity ETF

According to fund information provided by Global X, BUG seeks to invest in companies that stand to potentially benefit from the increased adoption of cybersecurity technology, such as those whose principal business is in the development and management of security protocols preventing intrusion and attacks to systems, networks, applications, computers, and mobile devices. The fund seeks to provide returns that correspond generally to the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Indxx Cybersecurity Index.

BUG is one of the most concentrated among liquid cybersecurity ETFs with more than US$50 million in assets under management, including First Trust Nasdaq CEA Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR), iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (IHAK), and ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK).

BUG is heavily concentrated on large cybersecurity software companies with a portfolio of just 24 holdings with net assets of US$1.11 billion. As of 27 October, BUG's top 5 largest holdings make up close to 39% of the portfolio: Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD), and CyberArk Software (CYBR).

Global X

We like BUG's concentration on cybersecurity software companies (57.5%) which enjoy several advantages over other categories of cybersecurity companies. Software solutions can be deployed more rapidly and are more scalable than hardware-supported solutions. More importantly, software companies offer a differentiated solution that is less likely to face direct competition.

Global X

Valuations And Expense Ratio

BUG's portfolio valuation at 54x P/E and 9.2x P/B may seem extremely expensive, but we note that this could be misleading for investors. It is extremely challenging to value growth companies that are in the very early stages of a multi-decade boom. Not only do some of BUG's holdings have very little earnings or even suffer losses due to the need to invest heavily in R&D, but many are also spending heavily on sales and marketing to expand market share. Thus, revenues at some of these companies could be growing at rates above 20%-30% annually with little earnings to show.

To be sure, investing in cybersecurity is certainly going to be more risky compared to investing in a mature industry. We acknowledge this risk and recommend that investors consider their own risk appetite and investment objectives in deciding if the cybersecurity theme is a suitable investment for their portfolio.

BUG's expense ratio is moderately high at 0.5%, but this is generally in line with its peers.

Seeking Alpha

Trading metrics for BUG are healthy with low and stable spreads, healthy volumes, and the fund trading close to NAV.

In Conclusion

We like BUG's concentration on cybersecurity software companies and we see enormous scope for growth in cybersecurity spending due to persistent underinvestment over the years.

On the surface, BUG appears to be grossly overvalued based on regular measures comparing share price to earnings and book value. However, relative to the sector's long-term growth prospects, we view the risk-reward as attractive.

Andrej means that the business model is not set up where a lot of money is invested and it does not take complete capabilities for Teslabot to be a financial success.

This was the case with autopilot and full self driving software. Full self driving is still in beta but the Tesla self driving program is already profitable. Tesla has sold over $5 billion of full self-driving software. Tesla defers the accounting recognition of 50% of full self driving software sales. Tesla has about $2.8 billion of deferred revenue. This means that Tesla could have in the range of $5 billion of full self driving sales. There is also deferred revenue from Cybertruck and Semi deposits.

Tesla also has many billions in autopilot sales and sells the cars including the cameras and hardware for autopilot and self driving for an overall gross profit of 30%.

This is something that Elon Musk has down with SpaceX as well. The reusable boosters were tested as part of profitable satellite launch missions. The boosters would normally be destroyed but SpaceX tried to land them after they had successfully completed profitable missions.

Waymo and Cruise are competing in self driving and Waymo started before Tesla on self driving. Waymo makes a few million dollars on self driving ride sales.

In mid 2022, Cruise has $3.7 billion in cash at the moment and a $5 billion credit facility from GM’s financial arm for buying automated Cruise Origin EVs from the automaker. Cruise has quarterly losses of $500 million.

Aurora Innovation, a startup co-founded by Chris Urmson, Google’s former autonomous-vehicle chief, has lost more than 85% since last year and is now worth less than $3 billion.

Ford funded Argo AI and Ford had to write off $2.7 billion when Argo failed.

Meta is not getting to rapid profitability with partial Metaverse capabilities. Meta (Facebook) is betting the company on the success or failure of the Metaverse. Meta has spent $9 billion in the first 9 months of 2022 on research and development of the Metaverse. Meta has also increased property and equipment spending by over $9 billion just in the last 3 months and they used almost $10 billion of debt for this purpose.

Reality Labs is where Meta is researching the Metaverse. They have reported that they will increase operating losses to reach long term profits from the Metaverse.

At Connect 2022 this month, Meta announced the Quest content store has surpassed $1.5 billion in purchased VR content since its launch in 2019, representing continued but decelerating growth likely due mostly to market seasonality.

In Mid-2022, Meta’s Quest 2 headset eclipsed 14.8 million units sold mark according to new data provided by the International Data Corporation. there are some hardware sales but almost no content sales. Metaverse will be profitable only with massive amounts of content sales relative to hardware.

Overall spending on video games (in general not just VR) in September decreased four percent year-over-year from $4.26 billion to $4.07 billion. Spending on video game content dropped seven percent from $3.68 billion to $3.41 billion, while video game hardware sales increased 19 percent percent from $410 million to $490 million.

Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft have video game and content sales that are several time more than hardware sales. Meta has hardware sales for their VR headsets but almost no software and content sales.

Nintendo is a US$52 billion company. Facebook could by buying Nintendo instead of making the Metaverse investment. Sony has a market cap of about US$85 billion. Nintendo makes about $8 billion per year in profit. Sony makes about $11 billion per year in profit.

Tencent owns Supercell which makes Clash of Clans. Tencent is the leader in video game revenue. Tencent is the world’s largest video games publisher. They makes with League of Legends and PUBG Underground. Tencent also has enterprise IT services including cloud computing and AI, as well as financial services. Tencent’s metaverse strategy to focus first on games, but then expand into other fields.

Apple will soon be introducing a VR headset.

VR seems to be extending existing competition in video games and video conferencing. This is like IMAX and 3D movies were extensions of regular movies.

All of Meta’s spending does not guarantee that they will be the long-term winner in VR headsets or VR games.

Meta and Zuckerberg should have spent the time to figure out a profitable path to competing and developing their version of the Metaverse. They could have gotten stronger in video games by buying profitable video game companies. Zuckerberg thinks they can win in the 3D version of video games and conference calling when they are lower than tenth place in the 2D versions. You are not playing any video games from Meta or doing any conference calling with their non-VR tools. Meta is weak in all of the non-VR versions of things they expect to win when they go VR (Virtual reality). Meta thinks just spending a lot of money for this hail Mary bet on VR will win. Tens of billions of dollars spent now and the next few years will magically payoff when VR becomes huge in X years. When VR becomes huge Meta thinks they will win and not companies who are leaders in video games now.

Highlights from the interview:

Q1. How has been the overall journey of Netweb Technologies so far?

Answer: Sandeep Lodha and I founded Netweb on September 22, 1999, while the world of networking was being reinvented, with the goal of transforming the landscape of technology in India. We were compelled to deliver a unique product and service to India. We went into a broad spectrum of networking as one thing led to another. We started delving into the server-building components with the cascading effect. Netweb currently offers a number of software and hardware-based solutions in Server, Workstation, Storage, Supercomputing, Cloud, and AI. Our journey in HPC started with being part of project Kabru which was the fastest academic supercomputer of that time, now we have more than 500 installations and have several pieces of software and solution to make HPC deployment and management easier. Currently, we are offering customized private 5G solutions and we will be rolling out other products and solutions on 5G very soon which are getting developed in our 5G lab centers.

Q2. Where have you set up the lab and what’s the purpose of setting up these labs?

Answer: Currently we have two labs one R&D lab in Hyderabad and one in Delhi The purpose of setting up these labs is to come out with the products and end-to-end solutions for setting up the entire 5G setup in organizations and the other use cases.

Q3. How big is the private 5G market and how much do you plan to target?

Answer: Today Global market is already deploying Private 5G. According to Polaris Market Research, the global Private 5G Network market is estimated to be valued at USD 924.4 million in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 40.9% during the forecast period (2021-28) which is almost 41% of a growth rate. Our targets are not set up yet as its a big and highly growing market and we’re still in the process of developing the products and solutions for private 5G also it is a very recent thing in India and the use cases of 5G are still getting defined however we’re already working on one of its use-cases in Africa, we should get our first deployment done there in a very short period of time.

Q4. What can be the use cases of 5G in India?

Answer: Some of the assumed early adopters in India would be:

1. Ports and Airports –There are already clear indications of the investments in the spectrum for usage in this use case. Supply chain management was always a formidable use case and with Ports and Airports, the tracking and movement of the materials as well as other critical equipment will become much more convenient.

2. Defense – The wide coverage, high throughput, and low latency bundled with added security features that Private 5G will offer is going to be one of the most important use cases for its immediate deployment for defense purposes.

3. Retail – With the huge growth in the retail industry there are added issues to further streamline the issues of stocking, movement of wares, warehouse management, and supply chain management. Private 5G can solve any such issues for them.

4. Manufacturing – This had been a global favorite for Private 5G, and it should be not too different for India. While the IoT and Robotics will take some time, 5G is going to be a big enabler to the possibilities of creating a smart manufacturing space. Other use cases like Conditions based monitoring (CBM) will make them early adopters.

5. Hospitals & Hospitality – Hospitals have a good amount of monitoring devices for patients as well as many pieces of equipment which need to maintain for critical requirements. Private 5G can prove immensely helpful for such use cases.

6. Remote Connectivity – Private 5G will play a big role in providing really good broadband facilities in remote areas. for example, providing very fast internet connections at panchayat levels. It’s going to provide good bandwidth and low latency.

Q5. How do you plan to fulfill this upcoming rapid demand for private 5G?

Answer: We’re working on the various aspects of the technology to have more products and solutions to provide the complete 5G solution. We are focusing on making our products and solutions more India-centric and also on the localization of the products so as the demand comes we’re able to provide end-to-end solutions and products to our customers.

Q6. How has the cloud been at the core of Telecom’s digital transformation and how this sector is leveraging intelligent technologies like Artificial Intelligence, and High-Performance Computing?

Answer: 5G is surely going to revolutionize telecom, apart from a sea change in the radio side of the technology there has been a tremendous change in the underlying technology to complement the scope. A major part of these technologies will benefit from cloud solutions on the edge as well as the core. 5G itself is quite digitized with on-demand scaling, it’s getting into the new use cases and customer bases. The major source of revenue for Telecom will now come from machine-generated data. For any meaningful analytics and insight, data is the most important component. Hence AI workload will be a much-integrated technologies part of the 5G offering which will need to be tackled at Edge as well as core and the base of Cloud-based technology with microservices and other technology are just going to make this work.",cloud computing,trak.in

Big Tech Goes to War | Foreign Affairs

What happens when tech companies stop providing an essential good or service in a war zone? Managing uncertainty is a known challenge in conflict but the role that tech companies are playing in Ukraine is introducing new dynamics. Elon Musk is wavering on how long he will continue to provide Starlink services, which have become the backbone for Ukrainian communications. Other cybersecurity and satellite companies have also stepped in to assist in Ukraine. But companies operate according to different interests than national governments. It is time for the US government to establish new methods of communicating and coordinating with corporations to ensure independent private sector decisions do not introduce unnecessary instability into conflicts. Additionally, experts in government can help companies prepare for potential geopolitical blowback.

Intel and the $1.5trn chip industry meltdown | The Economist

While the CHIPS Act is increasing supply, new export bans targeting China are decreasing demand and American-listed chip businesses are losing revenue. Although the chip industry is known to be cyclical, government intervention is pushing this cycle to extremes. This year, the combined market value of US companies in the chip business has declined by more than $1.5 trillion. Moreover, inflation rates are suppressing consumer demand for chip-powered goods like PCs and smartphones. As a result, more chip manufacturers are looking to break into new markets from cars to cloud-computing data centers to networking gear. But efforts to diversify may not be enough to make up for lost Chinese markets. National security-driven policies to increase domestic capacity could end up harming the American chip industry.

Meta files to dismiss FTC suit over Within acquisition | Axios

Earlier this month, the FTC modified its original complaint against Meta’s acquisition of Within–a virtual reality fitness startup–to focus on decreased competition in the market for virtual reality exercise apps. Meta filed to waive the FTCs request for a preliminary injunction that would block the acquisition until the case is resolved. The tech company argues that the FTC’s lawsuit “relies on pure speculation of a hypothetical future state” while the FTC points to Meta’s market power at all levels of the virtual reality sector as evidence that the acquisition represents anticompetitive behavior. A hearing is scheduled for December but it’s possible the judge may rule on Meta’s request before then. FTC critics argue the case against Meta would be tough to win but supporters favor the signal to slow down acquisitions in emerging fields.

Meet the Army of Robots Coming to Fill In for Scarce Workers | The Wall Street Journal

Aging populations, labor shortages, rising costs of human labor, and increasingly capable robots are leading to a spike in the adoption of industrial and service robots. According to the International Federation of Robotics, half a million industrial robots were installed across the globe last year–22% more than the previous record set in 2018. From 2020 to 2021, the number of service robots installed annually also increased by 37%. Moreover, the amount of time it takes for a robot to pay for itself is decreasing. But this trend is not without downsides. In the short term, more automation can lead to job loss and smaller workforces. In industries experiencing high rates of robot adoption, trade unions are engaged in negotiations to protect members’ employment. While a “roboconomy” is growing, the rate of robot adoption will be metered by the fact that the world is optimized for human labor. Increased autonomy will also require changes to working conditions such as wider and unobstructed grocery aisles for cleaning robots.

How the FBI Stumbled in the War on Cybercrime | ProPublica

In an excerpt from “The Ransomware Hunting Team: A Band of Misfits’ Improbable Crusade to Save the World from Cybercrime,” authors Renee Dudley and Daniel Golden describe the FBI’s shortfalls in addressing cybercrime. The Bureau suffered retention and cultural challenges as it sought to solve technical crimes without making many changes to its organizational structure or training requirements. In 2015, Director James Comey met with a group of Cyber Division agents leaving the Bureau for more lucrative private sector jobs to gain insight into their experience and perspectives. While cyber crimes, especially ransomware, were on the rise, these agents were treated as second-class citizens and often had to spend significant time training non-technical agents assigned to the Cyber Division. Moreover, the FBI’s reluctance to partner with outside experts prevented it from augmenting its limited internal resources. While the 2021 attack on the Colonial Pipeline heightened ransomware in the Bureau’s order of priorities, fundamental reforms to support and grow cyber talent have not followed.

Antony Blinken’s Silicon Valley visit underscores US cybersecurity concerns | The Guardian

Secretary of State visited Stanford University and Silicon Valley this week in a push to encourage cyber diplomacy and more US government-tech collaboration. His visit comes at a critical time: cyber risks are on the rise; attacks increased by 31% from 2020 to 2021. Analysts expect that Blinken’s priority topics with tech executives were warnings of the continuing potential for Russia-sponsored cyber attacks related to the war in Ukraine and US election interference. There is a need for increased public-private information sharing. However, the American public’s confidence in big tech is on the decline in the midst of a push for more regulation. Greater collaboration with the government could further threaten companies’ public image as citizens worry about digital privacy.

U.S. security officials worry about homegrown election threats | Reuters

In the lead up to the midterm elections, government officials are more concerned about domestic disinformation campaigns and homegrown threats than foreign interference. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly notes there are no credible threats to US elections infrastructure at this time, but “the current election threat environment is more complex than it has ever been.” Since the 2020 election, far-right influencers have spread the majority of election disinformation. A majority of Republican voters still believe Trump won the 2020 election and have threatened, harassed, or assaulted poll workers. Government agencies are working with social media companies to investigate threats and clamp down on domestic disinformation.",cloud computing,hoover.org

Read why it's hard to justify a long position in BABA.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550893-alibaba-beijing-sends-message,"Kevin Frayer/Getty Images News

At the beginning of this week, Alibaba’s (NYSE:BABA) stock experienced one of the greatest declines in its history, as the reelection of Xi Jinping for the third term as the general secretary of CCP along with the election of loyalists into the Politburo Standing Committee disappointed investors. Last week I’ve already highlighted what the company’s investors should expect in the foreseeable future, as Beijing begins to double down on policies that include new lockdowns and a redistribution of wealth, which would more than likely negatively affect China’s private sector.

Just a couple of days ago, China has already implemented new travel restrictions in some of its big cities to prevent the spread of Covid-19 there, while at the same time Beijing has continued to actively expand its reach in the digital payments industry to strengthen its grip over the Chinese society. This has direct negative consequences for Alibaba, as its commerce business has already shown to be vulnerable to lockdowns earlier this year, while the rise of the digital yuan along with Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions threatens to undermine the company’s dominant position in the digital payments and cloud computing businesses.

Therefore, as bullish investors continue to believe that Alibaba is a bargain, especially at the current price, this article aims at presenting additional arguments that undermine the bullish thesis and give more reasons to believe why Xi Jinping’s China has become uninvestable for international investors.

Prepare For More Disruptions

When I was writing my previous article on Alibaba, the 20th National Congress of the CCP was still ongoing and at that time it was still unknown who will become a part of the party’s main governing body, which is called the Politburo Standing Committee that includes 7 people along with the general secretary. After that article was submitted, news broke out that the pro-market reformists were sacked from the newly formed Standing Committee and the people who would replace those reformists are considered to be Xi Jinping’s loyalists.

It was reported that the role of the Premier, which is the most important person in the CCP after general secretary Xi Jinping himself, will go to Li Qiang, who is the chief of the Communist party in Shanghai. Li Qiang got his position at the Standing Committee unexpectedly fast by breaking the party’s tradition by not serving as a Vice Premier before getting a higher role, and he’s also the person who was blamed for the bad handling of Covid-19 lockdowns in Shanghai earlier this year. Nevertheless, the international press and countless experts on China were saying that Li Qiang would become the party’s Premier mostly due to his loyalty to Xi Jinping, as he’s more than likely to help the general secretary to implement the policy of common prosperity on the mainland.

To understand why is this a pretty significant development to the markets and to Alibaba in particular we should look at Li Qiang’s predecessor, a man named Li Keqiang, who served as the party’s Premier for the previous two terms. Back in March, Li Keqiang was the one to reassure the tech sector of its importance to China. Then in May, he has been saying to the tech companies that the government supports them, the platform economy, and also supports their desire to raise capital not only at home but also abroad. At the same time, the Wall Street Journal, by citing its own sources in Beijing, also reported that Li Keqiang was Xi Jinping’s main economic fixer and a person who advocated for the easing of the crackdown against China’s tech sector.

As Li Keqiang along with the outgoing members of the Standing Committee are about to be replaced by Xi Jinping’s loyalists, it’s more than likely that we would see additional interferences from the state into China’s private sector, which is more than likely going to negatively affect Alibaba and its peers. In my previous article on the company, I’ve already mentioned how Alibaba is about to spend ~22% of its liquidity to help Xi Jinping implement his common prosperity vision, and as the general secretary continues to call for the redistribution of wealth, it’s hard to imagine how Alibaba would be able to thrive in this new reality.

Alibaba’s Digital Payments Business Is Already Under A Threat From Beijing

We shouldn’t forget that the crackdown against Alibaba started back in late 2020 when the Chinese regulators stopped the IPO of Ant Group, in which Alibaba has a 33% stake, while the rest at that time was owned by Alibaba’s founder Jack Ma and a number of his close associates. Back then, the Wall Street Journal reported that Xi Jinping himself got personally involved in the process, which in the end resulted in more government interference in the company’s affairs, a record fine, and billions in shareholder value destruction.

One of the biggest advantages of Ant Group is the fact that its major product Alipay is one of the most popular digital payment systems in China along with Tencent’s (OTCPK:TCEHY) WeChat Pay. Alipay is used not only within Alibaba’s ecosystem of products and services but also among a wide range of online and retail places. However, there’s an indication that this Ant Group-Tencent duopoly is about to end.

The Rise of The Digital Yuan

In 2020, the People’s Bank of China started trialing China’s central bank digital currency called the digital yuan. In a way, the digital yuan is a paperless version of the fiat currency issued by the People’s Bank of China that could be considered a universal digital legal tender. At the same time, the People’s Bank of China has also released a digital yuan app similar to the Alipay app in order to give Chinese citizens the ability to collect and transfer digital yuans themselves, which makes both of the apps direct competitors in the digital payments business.

The problem for Ant Group, and subsequently for Alibaba, is the fact that Alipay’s business model is fee-based, under which it charges fees on each transaction in order to make a profit. Considering that the People’s Bank of China doesn’t have any merchant fees or service charges within the digital yuan app, it makes its own offering more attractive for merchants and consumers without directly forcing them to adopt the new payment method in the first place.

Thanks to this, Beijing is able to take away the power from the private sector and its ability to harness customer data, while at the same time it gives the state the ability to fully control the flow of money transfers. The latest data shows that the transaction volume of the digital yuan has suppressed $14 billion in the last couple of years since the trial started, as over 6 million merchants already began using it.

The trial itself is expected to last for the next couple of years before the full adoption and the People’s Bank of China also plans to use digital yuan for cross-border payments, which is also more than likely to undermine Alipay’s expansion strategy in Southeast Asia.

Considering this, it’s safe to say that digital yuan represents an existential threat to Ant Group and it’s more than likely to also decrease Alibaba’s ability to improve its own financials in the long run. After all, if we look at Alibaba’s latest earnings report for Q1, we would see that Ant Group is the only major equity investment that continues to generate profits for the company in the current environment, but the Y/Y growth in profits is already negative and it could become even worse going forward.

Geopolitical Pressure Is Not Going Away As Well

Even though Beijing allowed the U.S. inspectors to audit the books of the Chinese-based firms, Alibaba continues to face far greater geopolitical challenges, which it’s unlikely to overcome due to them being outside of its control. In my latest article on the company, I focused mostly on highlighting the domestic challenges that Alibaba would face with the reelection of Xi Jinping and ignored the geopolitical aspect of the 20th National Congress. Now is the time to address it as well.

Considering Xi Jinping’s aggressive and confrontational rhetoric during the National Congress, there’s every reason to believe that the general secretary is preparing China for a potential conflict with the United States. By not ruling out the use of force in order to take Taiwan and making it clear that Sino-American relations won’t improve anytime soon, it’s safe to assume that Alibaba has all the chances to become one of the biggest casualties of the potential confrontation, as some of the geopolitical risks already started to materialize.

One of the downsides of Alibaba is that its AI projects rely on chips designed by Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC). Considering the latest White House chip restrictions implemented earlier this month, there are questions about whether Alibaba would be able to realize its latest AI projects and enhance its cloud computing capabilities, as China is not known for designing and producing high-end chips. At the same time, a week ago it was reported that the Biden administration already explores additional export controls that could hamper Alibaba's ambitions in the AI field even more. In addition, there’s always a possibility that with the worsening of relations, the U.S. Department of Defense could follow on its warning and add Alibaba and its peers to the list of Communist Chinese Military Companies, which is something that it backed off from doing back in 2021.

With that in mind, it’s safe to assume that Alibaba’s AI and cloud computing initiatives could be in danger. What’s worse for the company is that the cloud business was one of the few biggest positives from the latest Q1 report, as it generated $2.6 billion in revenues, up 10% Y/Y, while the core commerce business didn’t show any growth during the period. As a result, with additional geopolitical headwinds, there’s a risk that it won’t be able to perform as well in the future due to its reliance on Western components, which are going to be harder to obtain due to the worsening of Sino-American relations in the foreseeable future.

The Bottom Line

After the recent depreciation, Alibaba’s stock hasn’t become a bargain in my opinion even if the fundamentals suggest that it did. We shouldn’t forget that after Beijing began its crackdown against the company, its stock price entered a distressed territory, which prompted Alibaba’s bulls to say that the business is now undervalued. However, it didn’t help the stock to rebound, as the shares continue to depreciate to this day and currently trade below the 2014 IPO levels.

Considering this, it’s safe to assume that such a rebound is unlikely to happen today, as Beijing has given a clear indication to the world and the markets that it plans to strengthen its grip over China’s private sector. This would undoubtedly have greater negative consequences for Alibaba in the foreseeable future since it’s unlikely that the business would be able to outperform the state in industries in which Beijing has already become the company’s direct competitor. Therefore, I stick with my opinion that Xi Jinping’s China has become uninvestable and it’s hard to justify a long position in Alibaba even at the current levels given the latest developments.",cloud computing,seeking alpha
253,Will Web3 Replace Web2,https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/images/csharp-corner.png,31/10/2022,Will Web3 replace Web2?,https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/will-web3-replace-web2/,"Introduction

Today, internet has become part of lives as any other essential need. As much as we love the internet, it's not without its flaws. Its not actually the internet but some bad actors that have manipulated it. Our dependence on centralized web 2.0 platforms has led to huge monopolies and data breaches that have put our personal information at risk. Web3 was created to address these problems by creating a trustless and decentralized internet with ownership of our own data.

The key fundamental difference between Web3 and Web2 is, centralization vs decentralization. In Web2 world, the infra, applications, and data is stored on centralized systems (hosting servers and cloud) that can easily be manipulated by anyone who has access to these systems. In an ideal Web3 world, this may not be possible. The idea behind Web3 is, only the owner of data/content will have control over their content and data. It is upto the owners who they want to give access to their content and data. For that, they may very well earn something in return.

Now, let's get back to the question. Will Web3 replace Web2? If you look at the history of computers and technology, every 15 years or so, there is a major shift in Web technology and right now, we are going through one of those shifts. We started with Web 1.0 in 1989 and 15 years later in 2005, Web 2.0 started. Now we are enterning in Web 3.0 era. Let's take another example. We started with big punch card machines as computers, start building software using console applications. Then Windows UI change the way we use computers and work with data. Then came Web and mobile. While we are in this Web and mobile era, cloud native is another technology that is growing. Does that mean we don't need Windows UI apps? OR will we stop using mobile apps? NO.

So, in short, Web3 will not completely replace Web2. Both world will live side by side for a long time,

If you are not familiar with Web3 and want to learn more about it, please check out What is Web3.

Web3 replaces trust with security

Web3 is a new web that replaces trust with security.

The Web2 was built on trust, where users trusted websites to be secure and not steal their information. This meant that websites could collect personal data from users like usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and more without providing any proof of identity as long as they said they had a privacy policy on their site. This system allowed for the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter where your friends could connect with others and share photos or videos but also allowed for high-profile hacks like those at Equifax in 2017 which exposed millions of people’s personal information including names, addresses and Social Security numbers (SSNs).

The Web3 is different because it uses blockchain technology to provide an immutable record of transactions between two parties who are confident they know who each other are due to cryptographic signatures/private keys instead of trusting a middleman like Google or Facebook which may have bad intentions or even just go out of business someday leaving you with no way to access your account again after being locked out forever!

Web2 is data centralized, Web3 is data decentralized

Web2 is data centralized, Web3 is data decentralized. The difference is that while Web2 is owned by a single entity and can be manipulated at will, Web3’s decentralized nature prevents anyone from manipulating the network.

This means that with Web3 you will have greater privacy as well as better control over your own data than ever before.

In today’s Web2 world, Twitter can go and manipulate data of number of transactions, users, authentic vs fake accounts, and analytics. I’ve experienced Google provided me with false data when running Google Ads. While Google said, they sent thousands of users to our website, we saw very less users coming from Google. On another website, we saw ton of traffic coming from south Asian countries while Google reported very less traffic from those countries. We have seen Facebook charging advertising fees for clicks while those clicks were generated by fake users. We have seen financial data is being manipulated by greedy companies again and again.

Ideal Web3 world is supposed to solve these problems where data is manipulated by businesses and people who have access to the data.

Web3 enables digital ownership

Web3 enables digital ownership. All transactions are recorded on a public network, so no one can take away what you own.

Web3 enables digital economy without intermediaries. You don’t need to trust any third parties like banks or governments to transact with each other—everyone just needs an internet connection!

This is great news because it means that we can finally have a more democratic society where everyone has access to financial services and opportunity, regardless of geography or socio-economic status.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies and Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are great examples of digital ownerships. If you own a digital asset in Web3, no one can come and claim that from you.

Web3 enables digital economy without intermediaries

Yes, it is. And this is a great thing. Let's take a look at how it will help the world change, and why we're excited about it taking over.

Web3 is a decentralized internet that empowers individuals with control over their identities and assets, which allows them to transact directly on the internet (without requiring an intermediary). It also enables digital economies; people can create tokens for anything they want, such as virtual currencies and intellectual property rights. The result? A digital asset economy where anyone can buy things on the internet without middlemen taking their cut along the way - no more credit card fees or bank fees!

In ideal Web3 world, everyone owns their digital wallets that stores digital assets including cryptocurrencies. Each user gets an address. If I need to pay someone for a service or product, I can send him/her digital currencies direct to their wallet. There is no intermediate party involved. While this may not be a major problem in developed countries, but for developing countries, this is a major plus where not only people can save money but can also transact direct almost in real-time.

Web3 empowers metaverse

Metaverse is a digital (virtual) world that is made of digital identities, digital assets, and digital economy. Metaverse is the new way people will interact and will do things on the internet. Metaverse uses avatars and digital identities to represent users and digital currency is used to transact for digital assets in digital economy.

If you want to learn more about metaverse, please read What is Metaverse.

Web3 technologies

Web3 is the next internet. It is not just one technology. It involves how the internet is built, run, and owned. Some of the key technologies of Web3 include decentralization, metaverse, micropayments, digital assets, and digital economy.

To learn more about these technologies, check out What is Web3.

When will Web3 replace Web2?

This is an interesting question. History teaches us a lot. Let’s take a few of these examples.

First credit card was issued by Diners’ Club in 1950. Visa was founded in 1958 but even today, 88% of US consumers spend cash from time to time. Did credit card replaced cash? It’s been 72 years since the credit card was issued.

Mainframe computers were introduced in 1950s but still there are businesses that reply on and use mainframe computers.

Windows UI applications were introduced in late 1990s. More than two decades later, many businesses are still running on Windows applications.

Tesla was incorporated in 2003 and 20 years later, we only have about 2.2% of cars that are fully electric.

As you can imagine from the above examples, while Web3 may be the next kid of the block, Web2 and centralized systems will be here for decades. As a matter of fact, cloud computing is still evolving and growing, and it has not done yet. Before we see a full Web3 boom, we will still have to go through the cloud boom.

Conclusion

Web3 is knocking our doors, but the question remains, will Web3 replace Web2 and when. But we must not forget that when new technologies are developed and evolve, there are many bumps on the way, and it takes time. While Web3 is being built (infrastructure), more and more applications will start testing under the hood technology, make mistakes, learn from them, and fix them. This is how it works.

But in the meantime, Web2 technologies such as cloud, AI, machine learning, robotics, data analytics, mobile apps, and smart everything will continue to flourish. As we have learned from the past, there may not be a full replacement of Web2 by Web3 but the both worlds, Web2 and Web3 will live side by side.",cloud computing,c-sharpcorner.com

Park Seong Hwan

Good morning, and good afternoon and evening to those calling in from abroad. This is Park Seong Hwan, the Head of IR, SK hynix. Welcome to the SK hynix 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call.

Before starting the conference call, allow me to introduce the executives present here with me today. First, Kevin Noh, Chief Marketing Officer; Kim Woo-Hyun, Chief Finance Officer; Park Myoung-Soo, Head of DRAM Marketing; and Park Chan-dong, Head of NAND Marketing. Let me issue a disclaimer that all outlooks presented by the Company are subject to change depending on the macroeconomic and market circumstances.

With that, we'll now begin SK hynix earnings release conference call. Kevin will first present the earnings for the third quarter of 2022, followed by the Company's plan and market outlook. There will then be a Q&A session with the executives.

Noh-Jung Kwak

Good morning. Allow me to first report to you the Company's performance in the third quarter of 2022. The third quarter saw deteriorating macroeconomic conditions due to high inflation and interest rate hikes. This led to a rapid decline in customers' memory demand, and the Company's bit shipments of both DRAM and NAND fell quarter-on-quarter.

Prices also fell at a faster pace than expected, resulting in third quarter revenue of KRW10.98 trillion, down 20% quarter-on-quarter despite the strong dollar. Third quarters generally see a pickup in market conditions with favorable seasonality. But this year, the market environment remains weak with almost unprecedentedly soft demand. While demand for consumer products such as PCs and smartphones is weakening further, procurement demand from servers also softened as customers try to work down their inventories. The Company tried to maximize its sales by expanding sales to mobile customers who introduce new models and to hyperscale customers who had relatively deeper pocket, but DRAM bit shipment fell by a mid-single-digit percent, lower than previous guidance, and ASP fell by around 20% quarter-on-quarter.

For NAND flash, the Company aim to offset the weakness in consumer product demand by expanding sales of eSSD, but the bit shipment fell short of the guidance, falling by low teen percent quarter-on-quarter, including Solidigm sales volume and by high single-digit percent when excluding Solidigm.

ASP also fell by more than 20%, both for SK hynix alone and for the integrated entity. As for profitability by product, the 1A nanometer DRAM and 176-layer NAND products showed a smooth ramp-up during the quarter, reaching stable yield rates and expanding the sales share of these leading-edge products, which in turn led to unit cost reductions for both the DRAM and NAND. However, such cost reductions were insufficient to offset the fast decline in prices.

Operating profit in Q3 was KRW1.66 trillion, down 61% from the previous quarter. Operating profit margin was 15%, falling from 30% of the previous quarter. Depreciation and amortization in Q3 was KRW3.57 trillion, increased by KRW0.81 trillion quarter-on-quarter. EBITDA in Q3 was KRW5.22 trillion, and EBITDA margin, 48%.

There was nonoperating profit of KRW27.7 billion. This includes net interest expense of KRW121.3 billion and a net foreign currency related gain of KRW132.7 billion that was driven by the transaction gain on accounts receivables and translation gain on Kioxia investments despite a translation loss on foreign currency-denominated debt due to the strong dollar. Pretax income was KRW1.68 trillion with corporate tax expense of KRW0.58 trillion. Net profit was KRW1.1 trillion with a net profit margin of 10%. Consolidated cash balance at the end of Q3 was KRW7.21 trillion, down by KRW0.28 trillion from the previous quarter.

Interest-bearing debt was KRW22.02 trillion, increasing by KRW2.64 trillion compared to a quarter ago. Debt-to-equity ratio and net debt-to-equity ratio at the end of Q3 was 32% and 22%, respectively, rising from the previous quarter.

Next is the Company's market outlook and plans. Contrary to expectations earlier in the year, the memory market in the second half continues to struggle with demand contracting sharply. Rising interest rates in major countries in response to inflation, in combination with the strong dollar, are heightening concerns of a recession, weighing down on both consumption and investment. Demand deceleration is being felt more severely in IT products due to the base effect of strong growth during the pandemic. As such, demand growth for DRAM and NAND for the year are expected to drop to unprecedentedly low levels being low to mid-single-digit percent and around single-digit percent, respectively.

Given the current environment, the Company's bit shipments for DRAM and NAND in Q4 are expected to be similar to that of Q3. PC shipment growth, which had recorded high growth in the past two years is now expected to be down by mid-teen percent with correction likely to continue into next year. Smartphone unit shipment is also expected to fall by a high single-digit percent due to lengthening replacement cycles and the impact of COVID-19 lockdown. But given the economy sensitive nature of consumer goods, demand for low- to mid-end products are falling steeply, while demand for high-end and flagship models launched in the second half remains relatively solid. Thus, increase in memory content per phone is offsetting the slowdown in smartphone unit shipments.

For servers, demand remains relatively healthy compared to other applications this year, but demand in the second half is being affected by investment reduction by corporate and inventory correction by the customers due to macroeconomic uncertainties. Nevertheless, growth in cloud services, such as AI and big data analytics as well as investment by big tech companies, are projected to continue and thus, servers will continue to drive overall memory demand.

Although the ongoing uncertainties are making predictions increasingly difficult, the demands of DRAM and NAND are estimated to grow by low teen percent and mid-20%, respectively, next year. Meanwhile, new applications such as AR and VR devices and content increases from price elasticity are possible upside factors for memory demand.

Against the sharp demand decrease, memory suppliers have begun taking actions such as cutting back on CapEx and adjusting utilization rates. However, as there is a time lag for the impact to materialize, the current supply-demand imbalance is expected to persist for the time being. In light of such market environment, the Company is aggressively cutting back on next year's capital spending to align supply with demand.

This year's CapEx is likely to close at around high KRW10 trillion, which is higher than that of last year, while next year's CapEx will be reduced by more than 50% compared to that of this year. The rate of reduction is as aggressive as what the industry had back in 2008 and '09 during the global financial crisis.

Given the high levels of inventory expected throughout the industry at the end of the year, the Company will minimize investment for wafer capacity and even look into delaying certain investments for tech migration. In order to effectively respond to the rapidly changing demand environment, the Company is also planning to reduce production of relatively low margin products.

Moreover, we are reconsidering our product mix and equipment allocation, which may sacrifice some of the wafer capacity in the near term but will improve efficiency of our fab operations in the long term. Though the Company's DRAM and NAND wafer production next year will be reduced compared to this year and the pace of migration to the leading-edge technology nodes will also be slower than what was originally planned.

Yet, we will maintain investments that are critical to mass production of new products, like DDR5, LPDDR5 and HBM3, which will be the drivers of the future demand growth so that we remain fully ready to support our customers' demand.

Next, let me explain the Company's technology road map. For the 1A-nanometer DRAM and 176-layer NAND, both yield improvement and ramp-up are continuing smoothly. By the end of Q3, the 1A-nanometer accounted for around 20% of total DRAM production and the 176-layer, 60% of total NAND. In particular, the share of the 176-layer has gone up considerably in all applications, contributing to improvement in cost competitiveness. The Company also completed the development of the 238-layer NAND in August this year.

With the significantly improved NAND and SSD competitiveness, the Company aims to close the gap with the market leader while seeking to respond to the upcoming market downturn by focusing on creating business synergy and collaboration with Solidigm.

The DDR5 market is finally expected to grow in 2023 in terms of the ecosystem and market demand. This has been held back by the delay in a CPU launch, but that gave time for the ecosystem to prepare and for demand to be built up. The recent market situation has lowered the price burden as well, which is likely to stimulate faster transition to DDR5 by server customers. The Company will secure leadership in DDR5 market based on its full lineup of leading-edge 1A-nanometer products, including high-density products like 3DS.

Regarding the recent U.S. government's restriction on semiconductor equipment export to China. The Company has received a one-year waiver for licensing requirements to move equipment into China. The Company will work closely with relevant stakeholders, including governments, customers and partners in different countries to prepare against external uncertainties and to ensure business continuity.

Throughout this year, a multitude of factors have magnified uncertainties, and the memory industry is now facing a market downturn we have never seen before. But at the same time, the Company today is not what it was in the past. And we will live up to our role as a global semiconductor leader by striving to maintain stability in the ecosystem.

Last is the Company's ESG management activities. In July, the Company published its sustainability report 2022 and announced the ESG strategy framework, PRISM. PRISM is a new and more developed initiative that includes all social value 2030 goals the Company announced last year, while also incorporating new requests by relevant stakeholders.

PRISM consists of five pillars: Pursue, Restore, Innovate, Synchronize and Motivate. It explains the reason and purpose behind the Company's pursuit of ESG management as well as the detailed goal.

The first pillar, Pursue, relays the ultimate purpose of ESG management. The Company practices ESG management to create economic value as well as social value and thus, create a happier world and a brighter future for all. To that end, the Company will try to protect the earth by restoring the environment, create a better environment by developing innovative and future-oriented technologies, which are captured in the second and third pillars, Restore and Innovate.

Achieving all of this requires cooperation from not only the Company's employees, but all like-minded partners. That is why the fourth and fifth pillars of PRISM, Motivate and Synchronize, set goals to muster collective efforts of internal members and external stakeholders.

Under these five areas, the Company disclosed around 20 quantifiable goals to be achieved by 2030. In addition, the Company also published a separate TCFD report for the first time this quarter. It contains an analysis of the risks and opportunities related to climate change as well as an estimation of potential financial impact on the Company.

The Company will provide regular updates to our progress towards these goals and will transparently disclose the process of our unique ESG management efforts based on PRISM. By doing so, the Company will try to exert a positive influence and help create a brighter future. Thank you.

With that, we're now ready to take your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Now Q&A session will begin. [Operator Instructions] The first question will be provided by Doh Hyunwoo from NH Investment Securities.

Doh Hyunwoo

I have two. They are about the inventory, investment reduction as well as production cut. Now first, about the investment cutback. So the presentation did explain a bit about the plan, but can the Company elaborate a bit further about the details? For example, what is going to be the extent of the investment cutback?

And also, what is going to be the portion between the, let's say, infrastructure versus equipment and also between new investment versus investment into tech migration?

And second question is pertaining to production cut. So again, the question is what is going to be the share between DRAM and NAND? And also, is the production cut going to be in the form of reduction in the wafer input? Or is it going to be suspension of some equipment utilization?

Unidentified Company Representative

Now please understand, first off, that it is not going to be easy for me to give you the details about the proportion of production cuts or investment cutback by different categories and for all of our investments.

Now having said that, now in terms of the total CapEx, so compared to this year, including the investment year-to-date as well as the remaining investment until the end of the year, so compared to the investment for the year, we expect the CapEx to go down by around 50% next year.

So that is the business plan that we are currently preparing. In other words, CapEx reduction by slightly over 50%. We are also considering some scenarios where the CapEx reduction could be higher than that. But for now, the plan is to be slightly over by 50%.

And in terms of the investment reduction between infrastructure versus equipment, I would say that they are going to be roughly proportional. So it's not going to be like investment is going to be maintained in infrastructure while it is cut back in equipment. So that is not the case. So it is going to be proportional.

And likewise, for DRAM and NAND, although the investment cutback on NAND is going to be slightly higher than on DRAM, again, they are going to be roughly proportional. And then for the production cut, now given that the demand is slowing down in the industry overall, now what we are going to do is try to reduce the production on low-margin products.

So these are the products where the demand, to begin with, is not very strong, but we would produce them first and then look for demand later. And as a result, they tend to be low margin. So we would be reducing the production of these products first. And we are currently reconsidering the wafer input. So we would be reducing the input into the fabs as a way as the approach toward production cut.

And another approach that we are considering and already implementing is something that we were not able to do during the upturn. In other words, in order to enhance the efficiency in a fab, we could reallocate the equipment inside one fab or reallocate the product mix between the fabs. So in the long run, it would serve to enhance the efficiency of our fab operations, while for the short term, it would also have the effect of reducing production.

Operator

The following question will be presented by Lee Sei Cheol from Citigroup.

Lee Sei Cheol

Now my question is pertaining to the U.S. restrictions against the semiconductor equipment in China. So this was also mentioned briefly during the presentation, but the Company also has some fabs in China. So I wonder whether the U.S.' restrictions against the equipment going into China would have an impact on the Company's fab operation strategy. And does the Company now plan to expand its investment in other geographies, including the U.S.?

Now as we all know, there are geopolitical issues that are also affecting businesses' decision-making process these days. And yes, there is also the restrictions against the equipment being brought into China. So for a company that has operations in China, I would say that these restrictions can also be painful.

But as also was explained earlier, the U.S. government did a grant one-year waiver on licensing requirements for the Company's China fab operations. So not just for the Company but also for other players, too, that have operations in China. And so this one-year waiver, we believe that it also applies not only to -- so it also applies to the development that is currently underway in the fab. So we believe that this would also be applicable to -- at least to some of the investment for the development that is currently underway at the fab.

And also for the one-year waiver, we are expecting and hoping that, at least, there would be a one-year extension thereafter. But again, this is not certain given the high level of geopolitical uncertainties these days. So this means that what we used to take as common sense in business, for example, to produce out of the most efficient and cheapest region then to supply globally. So this used to be the business common sense. And now on top of this, we have other layers of factors that we have to consider, which is magnifying the uncertainties from the business perspective as well.

Now having said that, I do believe that it would be essential for us to diversify our production basis down the road for the mid- to long term. But the short term, for us to change production basis at this time will not be easy, as you can imagine.

The following question will be presented by S. K. Kim from Daiwa Capital Markets.

S. K. Kim

I have questions about the demand. Currently, there are ongoing concerns about the demand deceleration. And in terms of the server demand, for example, the demand for DDR5 and HBM3, so what is the Company's outlook for the demand on the server side?

And also for next year, new applications are expected to be launched, for example, the XR device. So how does the Company foresee these new applications to affect the memory demand? So does the Company expect these new applications to be the driver of new demand growth?

Unidentified Company Representative

Well, in response to your questions, I would like to provide my answer in three ways. So one is with regards to DDR5 demand. So server demand plus the overall demand, and then the HBM3 demand, followed by the new applications, which could potentially be growth drivers.

Now first, about the DDR5. So out of the server demand, we expect this to take up over 20% share by next year. And by the end of next year, it is expected to reach over 30%. And likewise, for PC, it would be -- it would -- its share would be around 30%, and it is bound to go higher as the year gets closer to the end. And in addition to that, for the DDR5, based on our strength in performance as well as our finished product portfolio and customer qualification process, the Company plans to increase the sales of DDR5 that would outperform the market trend.

And for the HBM, out of all segments, HBM market grew the fastest this year at a pace of 50% Y-o-Y, and we expect the pace of growth next year to be even faster. But the HBM segment was also affected by the macro condition in the global economy. So the sheer size is not as big as we had expected. But we believe that the HBM segment will continue to grow, and especially for the Company, based on our performance, quality and the collaboration satisfaction from the customers and the SoC partners, the Company will maintain overwhelming leadership in this segment.

In addition to DDR5 and HBM, the Company also has an advantage in LPDDR5. So we have performance advantage, and we also have our collaboration advantage with the high-end segment phone makers as well as SoC partners. So based on these advantages that we enjoy, we will continue to expand the HBM segment for the Company. And we believe that we will be able to -- the product will be able to help stabilize demand. And for new applications like XR and VR devices and also in the automotive segment, we believe that the devices are going to have the potential to increase bit shipment in addition to the PC and smartphones.

So for the XR and VR devices, although these set shipments currently is not too big, they will be increasing by about 30% next year. So the set shipment of these devices is expected to grow by 30% next year. And for the medium to longer term, this trend is expected to continue.

And also for the automotive segment, for example, the attachment on ADAS. Now in this case, we believe that the attachment rate is going to double in five years' time compared to what it is today. And in terms of the memory content, so when we look at the 10-year time horizon, then we believe that there is going to be an increase in memory content by high multiples compared to what it is this year. So by around 5x multiple.

And also, when we look at the other related industries, so in addition to the in-car memory, there is also the network and edge computing and also hosting. So when we look at the other sectors as well, then it is highly likely that the growth is going to continue.

The following question will be presented by Nicolas Gaudois from UBS.

Nicolas Gaudois

Yes. Just coming back to how you will manage your operations in China going forward. Beyond the U.S. restrictions, there is also currently the lack of availability of EUV lithography tools into China due to how the Dutch government is applying Wassenaar Arrangement, and it's arguably unlikely to change. So that places a time line in terms of what you'll be able to do in terms of tech migration in the Wuxi fab, as you eventually would move otherwise to one- and five-nanometer.

With that in mind, can we be confident that you have the flexibility in strategic options, including the possibility of moving back tools to Korea, if needed, over time?

And secondly, you have seen, obviously, downside in DRAM and NAND flash shipments to customers, as did your peers, in the course of Q3. Do you believe that we're now at the stage where destocking at the customer's level is sufficient for bit growth to stabilize in the near term, and you just guided for bit growth to be flat Q-over-Q in Q4? And if so, would you assess when looking at combined upstream and downstream inventories that we may have passed a peak level already of combined inventories?

Unidentified Company Representative

Now regarding the first question. Now the Wassenaar agreement, as far as I understand, now this is based on unanimous decisions or consensus; meaning, that it is -- it has the kind of a structure where imposing regulations would not be easy. So I do believe that the current situation comes down to issues between certain countries.

Now for the EUV and in the Wuxi fab, now it is a very cautious forecast, but it appears, at this time, that it is unlikely that the EUV will be able to be entered into our DRAM fab in Wuxi. But again, I'm being very cautious here. So given that situation, then lagging the EUV equipment, then in terms of the DRAM tech expansion, now we could still go ahead with it with some of the EUV layers being backed up in Korea. So if this is a scenario, then I do believe that, at least until into the late 2020s, there will not be any critical issues in operating our DRAM fab in Wuxi, although there would be some increase in cost and perhaps a bit of complexity.

But now, let's say, currently, there are new restrictions in place with one-year waivers. And right now, we are hoping for a yearly extension. But assuming that the waiver is not granted anymore, meaning, that if it comes to a situation where we have to receive tool-by-tool licenses, then as you would know, by the nature of the semiconductor equipment, this would create a very difficult situation for us to bring in the equipment. So if that does transpire, then the difficulty in not being able to bring in EUV into the Wuxi DRAM fab would probably occur earlier than the late 2020s.

So to wrap up my response to this question. Now if the issue is that we are no longer able to operate the fab in Wuxi, then this actually is not in the realm of strategic flexibility. I believe that, that would fall under contingency plan. So let's say, if the time comes when it appears, it is difficult to maintain operations of the fab in Wuxi, then we might have to sell off the fab or equipment or bring in the equipment to Korea. So we are looking into various scenarios.

But again, this would amount to contingency. So this would be tantamount to an extreme situation. So we are currently hoping that we will be able to maintain our fab operations without such contingency.

Unidentified Company Representative

And to your second question about the inventory. Now at the -- so for the inventory at the industry, so both on the supplier side and the customer side, the inventory level is higher than average, and we expect the high inventory to remain into the first quarter of next year, especially given the seasonality in the first quarter. So we believe that it will peak around the first quarter of next year. But the customers are currently trying to work down their inventory first. And also from the supply side, the suppliers have also reduced their production ramp-up capacity.

So we believe that after reaching the peak, then the inventory level across the industry will start to come down.

The following question will be presented by J.J. Park from JPMorgan.

J.J. Park

Now the prices for both DRAM and NAND are expected to keep declining in the second half of the year. But now when we look at the past trend, then along with the price decline, there is also price elastic growth in content. So what does the Company foresee in terms of the content growth per application next year?

And also looking at the bit shipment in the third quarter and the guidance for the fourth quarter, it appears as if there is going to be DRAM and NAND inventory carry forward next year. Then the Company's guidance for next year's bit shipment is much higher. Then what would be the guidance for production growth next year? So I would expect that the production growth will fall below the level of the bit shipment growth, but what is the Company's expectation?

Unidentified Company Representative

Now first about the content growth projection. It was also mentioned in the presentation that, yes, with declining prices, there is some expectation of content growth down the road. But then when we look at the past 10-year history of memory prices, then the memory price decline has also slowed down.

So to give you more details, compared to DRAM, the price elasticity is higher for NAND, which has stronger consumer orientedness. Having said that, these days, consumers' purchasing power is also down. So it is unlikely to expect any short-term sharp rebound in content growth.

And by application for PC and smartphones, we expect the DRAM demand to grow by about a low 10% level. And for NAND, by mid- to high-teen percent. And for server, where demand remains relatively solid, the DRAM will be about a 10% level, so mid-10%. And for NAND, it will be over 30%.

But again, looking at history, looking at the past memory downturns, then we do see that the content growth has triggered a transition to high-density memory. So for 2023, there is going to be an increase in PCs -- enterprise PCs. So there is some increase in the sales of enterprise PCs, which have higher memory content. And also for the mobile devices, now there is growing demand for larger screen and also transition to next-generation form factor, which are also increasing demand for higher specifications and higher density.

So yes, the Company is trying to create demand from the customers by offering higher content products. And this will also serve as a promotion point for the customers' products. And this will also be an element of stronger competitiveness for the customers' products.

Unidentified Company Representative

Now as someone who is in the memory industry, for me to be negative about production bit growth is quite awkward and even painful because the business model in the memory industry is that we would try to cut costs by increasing bit growth in both production and sales, and then the saved cost would then be transferred to the customers in the form of lower ASP.

But now I mentioned already that the capacity investment in wafer will be minimized. So the production bit growth is going to be minimal. And then also, there is also the tech migration bit growth. But -- so usually, where we gained bit growth is from the wafer investment and investment into tech migration. But I mentioned already that there is not going to be increase in production.

So the wafer capacity will be reduced, meaning, that the production would also be reduced.

Then the bit growth, the remaining source of bit growth would be investment into tech migration. But for the -- as you would know, the tech -- the bit growth coming from tech migration investment in DRAM is smaller than NAND. So for the DRAM next year, we are looking into various investment scenarios, but we are also reviewing the possibility of perhaps reducing bit growth for next year's production.

Operator

The last question will be presented by Hyun Kim from Meritz.

Hyun Kim

I have some questions about NAND. Now we see that the demand deceleration is much faster in NAND compared to DRAM. And also, when we look at the profitability in the industry, then NAND profitability is lower than DRAM. And now the Company recently increased its NAND exposure through Solidigm, and it appears as if it has struggled quite a bit in the third quarter. So when we look at the numbers, at the bit growth, excluding Solidigm, then it is higher.

So what was the profitability in the third quarter?

And also in the fourth quarter, it is expected that there will be inventory valuation loss and also some provisioning. So what is the Company's expectation or guidance for the future profitability of NAND?

And another question about NAND is about the development. So in the presentation, it was mentioned that the development for NAND is on schedule, and that the Company has completed the development of 238-layer. But as we all know, development has various meanings, and also completion could mean different things. So could you be more specific about your development of 238-layer being complete?

And when does the Company believe that there -- you can go through the customer qualification and start selling to customers? And what is the expected cost reduction to come from the 238-layer?

Noh-Jung Kwak

Now the second question will be answered by Mr. Park Chan-dong, who is the Head of the NAND Marketing, and this is Kevin now responding to the first question regarding Solidigm. Now please understand that given that Solidigm is a nonlisted company, it is difficult for me to give you specific numbers about their performance in the third quarter. But excluding the one-off cost, we were expecting Solidigm to record profit in non-GAAP terms and about KRW200 million deficit or KRW200 million loss in GAAP terms. So that was the expectation in the early part of the year.

But as you know, the market situation has considerably worsened than what was expected in the early part of the year. So as a result, the Solidigm's performance was also lesser than what we had expected. And also, at the same time, Solidigm used to be a -- one division in Intel, but now it has become a stand-alone company. So it is still undergoing the process of standing up on its own. So as it was going through this transition, it was, I would say, hard-pressed to deal with many of the challenges that were arising rapidly from the market.

Now -- but when we look at the overall competition landscape in the NAND market, then it is also true that we do need some adjustment or corrections. And also for SK hynix, we have already gone over the critical mass in terms of the market share. So yes, although it is struggling at this time, I do believe that once we complete the consolidation in the next one to two years, then the strategic benefits out of this will far outweigh the challenges or the issues.

Park Chan-Dong

Next is about the NAND development. Now when we were first introducing the 3D NAND, then at the time, because of our, let's say, lesser competitiveness at the time, we also had some gaps in terms of the cost and the technology. But then starting with the 128-layer, we were able to catch up very quickly in terms of the mass production as well as the cost. And coming into the 176-layer, we were able to stabilize the cost as well as mass production.

So we smoothly went on to mass production for 176-layer. And by the end of the third quarter, it will be -- it will reach 60% of -- it reached 60% of all NAND production. And with the -- so we completed the development of the 238-layer. So we completed the development as we have notified through the SMS two months ago. And the customer sample will start to be provided in the early part of 2023.

And given the Company's know-how in being the first player to apply the double stack and PUC in the industry, we foresee no complications in the development and mass production of the 238-layer. Our plan is to start mass producing 238-layer by the middle of 2023.

The last question will be presented by Ricky Seo from HSBC.

Ricky Seo

Now I have two questions. First is that now we see that the demand deceleration is much worse than expected. And likewise, the reaction by the memory companies is getting more and more aggressive. Now looking at the current picture, then of course, we did talk about inventory earlier, but looking at the overall picture and especially looking at the cycle, then in what part of the cycle does the Company believe that we are in now? And in other words, when does the Company believe that the market situation will begin to recover?

And the second question is about the valuation -- inventory valuation loss. Now given the sharp decline in memory prices, I presume that there would have been recognition of inventory valuation loss. So can the Company share the size of the valuation loss, if possible?

Unidentified Company Representative

I take it as a larger question about where we are as an industry and where is the memory industry headed in the future. Now looking at the memory cycle now, then obviously, yes, it is highly cyclical. And of course, the memory industry itself has gone through many upturns and downturns.

Looking at where we are standing today at this time in 2022, I would say that the current downturn is quite serious for everyone involved in an unprecedented manner because they -- it is mostly caused by the macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical issues. And we need to take a look between DRAM and NAND.

And for the customers, when there is a downturn, then there is a certain benefit to be gained for them in the form of lower prices. But looking at the downturn today, then, of course, obviously, it is painful for the suppliers. But also for the customers, they are no longer in the position to just enjoy this downturn and lower prices because they are saddled with a high level of inventory. And obviously, there would also be some inventory valuation loss, which is also related to the second question. And -- but now looking at DRAM, the number of suppliers is limited and also the customers are going through a hard time as well.

So given the market dynamics here, I do believe that there would be perhaps a stronger force or a stronger power to try to restore the market.

But looking at NAND, it is a bit different. I mean, on one hand, the geopolitical issues are more complicated, and there are many more suppliers, and there's also the price elasticity to consider. So it is much more difficult to predict when the NAND market is going to recover.

So that means the timing of when the macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical issues ease would be when the memory market or the memory industry can also look forward to an upturn. Of course, there is going to be some time lag between the two events, but we would have to wait and see whether the macroeconomic conditions and if geopolitical issues ease in any way.

So given this picture, then hopefully, the market would start to stabilize in the second half of next year. So that is our expectation and hope. But again, due to the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, we cannot rule out the possibility that the current downturn may be -- may last a bit longer than that.

And for the memory supplier to cut back on production and capacity is indeed quite painful because, like I said, what we do is try to gain production and sales bit growth and then achieve cost reduction, then return this to the industry in the form of a lower price. That, I believe, would ensure a healthy and wholesome development of the industry. But bit growth is going to be limited next year and even perhaps none from the DRAM side. So this is by no means a healthy picture that we want.

And -- but again, for DRAM, there will be a strong enough force for restoration sometime next year. So we hope that we will be able to go back to normal, healthy industry in the near future. And likewise for NAND, it would move, I believe, in the same track as DRAM, although it might take longer.

Gaming laptops are a great way to play the latest games when you're away from home, and they are increasingly powerful enough to make great desktop PC replacements for many gamers.

It's no wonder then that gaming laptops are some of the most popular deals during Black Friday, especially because many of the best gaming laptops are also fairly expensive. This is even more true for laptops with RTX 3080 GPUs or high-resolution and high-refresh displays from top brands like Razer, Gigabyte, and Alienware. But with some good Black Friday gaming laptop deals, these laptops can see some dramatic price cuts, sometimes by more than $500/£500.

But even if you're looking for something more in the midrange or budget category, there are still going to be some great cheap gaming laptop deals, and in many cases, you'll be able to find plenty, like the HP Victus 15, that won't force you to sacrifice too much when it comes to hardware or performance.

There are some laptop deals that you'll want to avoid though, and not just on the low end of the price spectrum where you'd expect to find some of the shoddier products. There are going to be plenty of high-end gaming laptops that look great at first glance, but are much less of a deal when you dig deeper into the specs.

As we all get ready for the holiday sales event, there are a whole lot of reasons to expect great deals this year and we'll help you sort out which ones to look for and which ones to avoid.

What to look for in a Black Friday gaming laptop deal

So what should you be on the lookout for when you go Black Friday shopping? There are some key points to remember when it comes to buying a gaming laptop.

First, we're already pushing the bounds of what a great gaming laptop really needs to play the best PC games, since nearly every modern AAA game is targeted at console compatibility first rather than trying to max out what the best gaming PC is capable of handling. The days of asking ""But can it run Crysis?"" have come and gone, honestly.

As such, there's very little reason to turn your nose up at a 12th-gen Intel Core i5 or an AMD Ryzen 6000-series CPU paired with an Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU, since this kind of gaming laptop is more than capable of playing everything currently available at pretty high settings at 1080p.

And since 1080p is what even high-end gaming laptops generally stick with in order to max out the display's refresh rates, you don't need much more than this right now and these are going to see some great price cuts this Black Friday.

Second, keep in mind that on a laptop, a 4K display doesn't really get you that much more than a 1080p in terms of crispness. Yes, you're doubling the pixels-per-inch, so images will be twice as sharp, but the images are also going to be much smaller on a 14- or 15-inch display than they would be on the best gaming monitors pushing 32 or 42 inches across.

Our eyes just aren't able to appreciate the fine details on something as small as a gaming laptop display, especially not when things are blazing across in an action-packed title like Doom Eternal or some competitive shooters. At most, look for 1440p if all you care about is PC gaming. You're not missing out on much by settling for 1080p, but you will likely save a lot of money.

There are a couple of Black Friday-specific considerations to mention as well. First, you're going to see a lot of high-end laptops with very gaming-specific hardware get some eye-popping price cuts this Black Friday.

Here's an example from last year:

(opens in new tab) Gigabyte Aero 15 OLED YD, 15.6-inch 4K AMOLED, Intel i7-11800H, Nvidia RTX 3080, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD | $2,999 $1,899 at Newegg (Instant savings and rebate)

Save $1,100 - Right off the bat, you're saving $800 with this Gigabyte Aero 15 OLED, but with an additional mail-in rebate offer, you can save another $300, bringing the total savings to $1,100. This is definitely one of the best Black Friday gaming laptop deals we've seen, but it ends early tomorrow morning, so you need to move on it soon if you want to save big on this beast.

If you are keen on getting a laptop that can play the latest games with the highest graphics fidelity possible, then you can find some great deals on the best mobile workstations for creative professionals that have all of the same hardware as the most premium gaming laptop, but come with perks like OLED 4K displays that gaming laptops generally lack.

The drawback is that these displays are going to have standard 60Hz refresh rates, since that isn't the kind of thing that creatives really need for their work. Non-OLED displays might also have awful pixel response as well, which make them less suitable for fast-paced gaming.

That said, if you're looking to take in the eye candy at a leisurely pace, then a creative workstation might be a smart way to get a great deal on very powerful hardware. If you're looking to game competitively though, you're going to want to stick to proper gaming laptops with more responsive, higher-refresh displays.

Gaming laptops across the board will see price cuts

(Image credit: Future)

We've been doing this for many, many years now, and we've got plenty of experience watching how the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales events tend to run. The past couple of years has, with the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting supply chain issues, upended things for sure.

There are still some pretty consistent throughlines though, namely that the cadence of gaming laptop releases provides plenty of incentive for retailers to clear out some inventory and make way for newer products with the very latest hardware.

These latter gaming laptops are usually the least likely to see price cuts, but that will still happen, so don't expect the only gaming laptops to go on sale to be those that are one or two generations behind everyone else.

What's more, most of the newest mobile computing hardware, like new mobile processors and GPUs, are announced early in the year, typically around CES. And since most laptop hardware has been on the market for several months now, if not for over a year, we're expecting new mobile CPUs and GPUs to be announced or at least teased in January from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.

That means that demand for the current-gen tech is likely to soften this Black Friday as people wait to see what is revealed next year. As a result, prices on current-gen gaming laptops will have to drop lower to compensate, and you should definitely take advantage of these deeper price cuts.

One of the best ways to see what kind of gaming laptop deals to expect this year is to look at what we saw last year. Thanks to the magic of the internet, we're able to bring you some highlights from our 2021 Black Friday coverage to illustrate.

Things to avoid this Black Friday when shopping for a gaming laptop

(Image credit: Ninma)

No matter what kind of gaming you plan to do, there are a couple of things that you're likely to see this Black Friday that you're going to want to avoid unless the price is absolutely unbeatable.

First, don't look for anything less than 8GB RAM unless you are only planning on casual gaming. Windows 11 is going to take up a lot of RAM, so you're not going to have a whole lot to work with for your other programs, and gaming generally requires a good bit of RAM in order to run smoothly.

If you're looking at high-end devices, make sure that you're not paying extra for ""premium"" hardware from two or three generations ago. If you see a $2,000 gaming laptop with a ninth-gen Intel Core i7 in it, you can get new hardware for roughly the same price elsewhere, and you definitely should.

Another thing you might see a lot of right now is a ""gaming"" Chromebook. Look, don't get us wrong, we love Chromebooks, but Chromebooks typically don't have the specs required for locally installed games (and couldn't run almost any of them even if they did), and cloud gaming is viable but still iffy on a Chromebook. Come back to us next year once we've had a chance to really push the new line of gaming Chromebooks to see what they are capable of before making that kind of jump.

Finally, there is the question of MacBooks. Typically, MacBooks haven't been seen as gaming machines in a serious way and that hasn't really changed even with the latest Apple silicon.

There are plenty of games that you can play on a Mac, mind you, and some of us are actually quite bullish on the Mac's gaming potential in the years ahead. Capcom just released Resident Evil Village on the Mac and other developers are likely to start following suit in the coming years, but we're not there yet and the future of Mac gaming remains to be seen. If you're looking to play all of the latest PC games right now, you're still going to need a Windows laptop.

Gaming laptop spec cheat sheet

One of the most overwhelming things about shopping for a gaming laptop on Black Friday is trying to make sense of the completely incomprehensible specs that manufacturers tend to throw at customers. If you've never bought a gaming laptop before or you're buying one for someone else and you aren't a gamer yourself, it can feel like you're reading a foreign language.

Jeep needs help with the Wagoneer S electric vehicle's official name originally appeared on Autoblog on Sun, 30…",https://www.autoblog.com/2022/10/30/jeep-wagoneer-s-official-name/,"Jeep opened up about its continuing electrification plans in September, sharing details on three battery-electric models and one plug-in hybrid coming in the next two years. One of the EVs was called by its codename, Wagoneer S, Chief Design Officer Ralph Gilles saying the ""S"" stands for ""speed, striking, and sexy."" Based on a Motor Trend report, we could also say the S stands for ""Stumped,"" because Jeep doesn't have a name for the luxury mid-sizer. Brand president Christian Meunier told the magazine regarding a production name, ""We have a few in the basket,"" but Jeep wants crowdsourced help to choose a handle. This won't be a free-for-all; as Ford did with the 2023 Mustang's new Nite Pony black accent package, Jeep will provide suggestions and direction as part of a contest expected to start in the coming month. With the EV's debut scheduled and reservations opening in early 2023, Meunier wants to crown a winner before the end of this year.

As a reminder of the baby being named, the Wagoneer S is a two-row SUV targeting the likes of the Range Rover Sport. Sized a touch smaller than the latest Grand Cherokee and having more than a passing resemblance to one, its inclusion in the Wagoneer family could possibly be to justify pricing that starts beyond even the current top trim $71,000 Grand Cherokee Summit Reserve. Why have Grand Cherokee buyers balk at the MSRP gap EVs demand when you could have a Wagoneer buyer think, ""Hey, that's not bad."" Naturally, this means the Wagoneer S will be powered up and kitted out like a luxury EV. In its most potent form, it will come with dual motors making a combined 600 horsepower, good enough to scoot from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. Kinder driving is anticipated to return a 400-mile range. Standard four-wheel drive and a terrain management system will tackle chunky portions of any route.

Meunier told MT the concept is effectively the production model, so what you see above is effectively what will come to market. It's all kinds of handsome, but we can't wait to answer our questions about what the sloping hatch does to cargo room. Until then, have a long gander at the renderings and see if the muse proffers the ideal moniker.

P…",https://www.autoblog.com/2022/10/30/volvo-ex90-interior-image/,"The march to the November 9 reveal of the Volvo EX90 takes its next step with these renderings of a pared down interior. We'll see soon how it looks once the new materials, textures, colors, and tunnel console are added, but for the moment, there are four elements: An instrument panel with a demure HVAC vent, broken up by a steering wheel, a small, uncovered screen behind the wheel, and an infotainment screen. The portrait-oriented tablet carries over from current Volvo design, so too a three-spoke wheel. Everything else in Volvo's current interior schemes is thrown out, including the knobs and buttons on the center console. It looks like the premium brand's version of the interior we were introduced to in the Polestar 3. Fitting, since both vehicles will ride on the same platform and be built at the same U.S. plant.

The cabin's physical design and the car's technology share a same philosophy, which is, ""What you need, when you need it."" Volvo says that the sensor suite around the EX90 will give the car a 360-view of what's happening outside and inside the car. "" Thomas Stovicek, head of UX at Volvo Cars, said, ""Since the car also understands its surroundings and you better than ever before, we can create an even safer situation by reducing mode confusion, distraction and information overload."" On the infotainment side, we're told this will be done by the vehicle providing contextual options and menus on the two screens. The center screen, which looks larger than the current XC90 unit, performs the roles we've come to expect of it. Autocar spoke with automaker developers and said the screen ""will also show information based on context. If you’re simply driving along, a bar near the bottom of the screen will show media information; if you’re on a call, it will show other controls; if it’s cold, it may show the defrost button, etc.""

This situational knowledge will be especially important as more roads are opened up to hands-free driving and as self-driving capabilities become more capable. Swedish engineers point to the handover from hands-free and autonomous driving back to hands-on driving as a crucial moment. It wants to make that handoff ""effortless and intuitive."" The display behind the steering wheel is where the driver will go first for traditional info like speed and range, also to understand the operational state of the driver aids. Sounds like another take on what Nissan does with the Ariya, color-coding the gauge display to convey how much work ProPilot Assist is doing.

And perhaps we're reading too much into this, but the range display shows 488 kilometers of range on a nearly full battery. Answers to questions will begin arriving in 12 days.",electric vehicles,autoblog

Volkswagen stated several times that they saw a future exclusively with battery cars, but behind the scenes the brand does not dare to commit itself completely. It turns out that they have even quietly filed a patent for a hydrogen car that can drive 2,000 kilometers on a single tank.

Volkswagen has not fallen on the back of his mind either. If the world nevertheless decides that hydrogen is the future, they do not want to miss the boat. Moreover, insights are constantly changing. So judging Volkswagen on things they’ve said in the past, that would also be a bit lame. In any case, the technology is interesting.

This year, Volkswagen, together with the German company Kraftwerk Tubes, filed a patent for a fuel cell. This is a unit that converts hydrogen into energy for an electric motor. According to the German Business Insider, the fuel cell from Volkswagen is a lot cheaper than that of its competitors because it does not use precious metals. There are also other benefits.

The technology is different from the competition

‘The main difference with the fuel cells from Hyundai and Toyota is that we use a ceramic membrane instead of the usual plastic membrane. That is a huge difference’, an employee of Kraftwerk Tubes explains to BI.

This ceramic membrane does not need to be wetted, so it does not freeze in the winter, dry out in the summer or attract mould. These are apparently problems that other hydrogen cars with fuel cells encounter.

According to Kraftwerk, there is another advantage. The fuel cell would generate heat which can be used for heating, but apparently also for air conditioning. This means that no separate electric air conditioning or heating is required, which saves energy. On the other hand, you would say that energy also disappears with residual heat. Due to the high efficiency, a range of 2,000 kilometers is possible.

When will a hydrogen car from Volkswagen come?

Although the patent has been filed with Volkswagen, Kraftwerk also does not want to commit itself exclusively to one brand: ‘Regardless of the manufacturer, our goal is for our technology to be launched in a series vehicle by 2026. We are talking about series of around 10,000 vehicles, distributed over several car manufacturers.’",electric vehicles,ruetir.com

If you're unfamiliar with the concept, a product recall is when a manufacturer realizes that there is a problem with a product or component — whether the problem relates to serious issues like safety, or simply performance and early wear — and issues a notice to buyers of the defective product informing them of the issue and providing recourse. Usually, when a recall happens in motor vehicles, the vehicle is to be taken to the nearest service station as soon as possible to have the defective component replaced or inspected for defects.

Product recalls happen from time to time — no matter how much testing you put into development, cars and motor vehicles are incredibly complex, and you can't possibly anticipate every use case and simulate every possibility. Electric vehicles are often praised as superior because they're simpler, and therefore require less maintenance. By that logic, you might think that EVs would be less likely to be recalled or experience problems. You would be wrong. According to J.D. Power, owners of electric vehicles reported an average of 240 problems per 100 vehicles, while owners of internal combustion engine vehicles reported an average of 175 problems per 100 vehicles.",electric vehicles,slashgear
261,Is Toyota Stock Doomed?,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706270/2023_toyota_bz4x_xle_supersonic_red_002.jpg,30/10/2022,"As Toyota dithers on its approach to electrification, it's falling further behind the world's automakers.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/is-toyota-stock-doomed/,"A recent Reuters report states that to better compete in a booming sector it has been slow to enter, Toyota (TM 1.55%) has temporarily halted the $38 billion electric vehicle (EV) rollout that it had previously announced in order to reconsider its long-term electrification strategy.

A critic of EVs despite rising sales

As I previously noted, the industry's swiftly accelerating move away from internal combustion engines hasn't won over President Akio Toyoda.

Currently, the company holds the top spot in the world for manufacturing gas-electric hybrids. In the third quarter, Toyota sold almost 100,000 hybrids. Half of all hybrid vehicles sold in the United States in 2022 are a Toyota. With that sort of market share, it's little wonder that Toyoda remains among the fiercest opponents of pure battery electric technology. Earlier this month, he told reporters that battery electric vehicles ""are just going to take longer than the media would like us to believe.""

This places Toyota at a disadvantage in its attempts to compete with market leader Tesla, as well as rivals like General Motors and Volkswagen, both of which are stepping up their own electrification efforts. Fully electric vehicles sales have been increasing far more quickly than even skeptics had anticipated, growing to 6% of U.S. auto sales in the third quarter of 2022, up from 2.2% during the same period in 2020.

A change of heart and an about-face

Nevertheless, the company seemed to have bowed to the inevitable in December 2021 when it announced a plan to spend $38 billion to bring 30 battery electric vehicles to market by 2030. But the strategy called for a mix of powertrains, including conventional gas-electric hybrids, plug-in hybrids, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as well as EVs. The company also planned to transform Lexus into a fully electric brand in North America by 2030. As if to prove its intentions for the sector, the company rolled out its first EV earlier this year, only to halt production and recall all of the models to correct a product defect. It restarted production in early October.

Then came the Reuters report, which quotes anonymous sources within the company as saying Toyota is examining whether to change its recently launched electric vehicle platform or engineer a new one.

Why it matters

The fallback is notable for a company that perfected lean production, which led to its dominance of the auto industry. But the company's advantage is one Toyota lags Tesla in establishing the benchmark for EV production costs. The world's automakers have been envying and emulating Toyota for decades, but the company is no longer a leader in electrification. That honor falls to Tesla, which is now the target of every other automaker worldwide.

As Toyota reshuffles its plans and decides what it should build, most of its biggest competitors already sell EVs and have more on the way. Toyota engineers and management realize it's Tesla, not Toyota, that's setting the standard for EV production costs, which is one reason management's is reassessing its electrification plan.

While the company remains among the world's largest automakers, it's going to have to invest billions of dollars in EVs to catch up with leading American, European, and even Korean automakers that are already ahead in the market.

If you own the stock, it remains one to hold as it remains the world's largest automaker. Its market position and profitability should continue. Although it can be challenging to foresee the end of an era, this appears to be it. For those betting on an automaker to lead the EV future, Toyota does not appear to be one to buy now.",electric vehicles,motley fool

For better or for worse, governments the world over have doubled down on plans to electrify the majority of the vehicles running on their roads, even planning to outlaw non-EVs, in some cases. Car manufacturers, too, appear to be jumping on this bandwagon with enthusiasm, if the dizzying array of new EV models being launched at the moment is any indication.

Besides new launches, a lot of attention is being focused on adapting existing vehicles to fully electric operation. The European Union, in particular, is pushing its Clean Vehicle Directive strongly and looking specifically at areas like public transport to lead the charge for change. According to Hans-Georg Herb, the head of EV conversion specialist Elerra, EV conversions on old buses make good economic sense, because a conversion can be completed for between €300,000 and €350,000 ($299,000–$348,000), which is half the cost of a new bus. Thanks to their large size, buses have space for up to eight battery packs, giving them a range of approximately 250 km (155 miles), quite sufficient for urban applications, reports DW.com.

More: What Classic Car Would You Electromod And Why?

Given that EVs typically require less maintenance than internal combustion-powered vehicles, combined with a significantly lower cost per kilometer traveled, this means large potential savings for transport companies.

The question of whether converting personal vehicles to EVs is a practical proposition is a trickier one. Herb believes that practically any vehicle can be converted, but the amount of time, effort, and resources required is very high. Purists may want to cover their eyes at this juncture, as he says that vintage and classic vehicles are good platforms for conversion. They have fewer integrated electronics than more modern vehicles, and in some cases, it can be as simple as removing the combustion engine and gearbox, and fitting a suitable electric motor and batteries.

However, even the simplest of conversions does not come cheap. Herb estimates that a complete conversion on a classic car would set you back around €60,000 (around $59,700) if done through his shop, and the conversion kit alone to fit an electric motor and batteries (without the actual motor and batteries) can be over €10,000($9,955) by itself!

From a purely economic perspective, it does not make sense as classic and vintage cars do not travel the kind of mileage required for the cost of conversion to be recovered, which is something Herb tells his customers often. Nevertheless, there are a growing number of dedicated folk for whom the allure of classic design combined with smooth electric power seems irresistible, and Herb is more than happy to give them what they want.",electric vehicles,carscoops
265,General Motors Remains Undervalued. Should It Be?,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/705344/gm-hq.png,30/10/2022,"GM's entry into businesses affiliated with its core bode well, yet the market remains unimpressed. This could be an investing opportunity.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/general-motors-remains-an-undervalued-should-it-be/,"General Motors (GM 1.27%) produced record adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $7.07 for 2021, and management expects equally impressive results for 2022. Yet GM has lost 42% of its value year to date.

The markets are overacting to concerns over chip shortages and their impact on production. And despite the fact that production and sales of its most profitable vehicles have held up, GM remains the Rodney Dangerfield of automotive stocks, even as it expects to double revenue to $280 billion by the end of the decade.

So far, Wall Street isn't buying it. The concern is that inflation, rising interest rates, and a possible recession and its effects on increasingly cash-strapped consumers will torpedo demand. Such concerns plague all automakers, however, including Wall Street darlings Tesla and Rivian.

But even though General Motors appears well positioned in both autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs), it's not valued as highly by Wall Street.

Profits from software and deliveries

GM is first and foremost an automaker, and its growing line of EVs is becoming a launching point for other businesses. The new vehicles, such as the Cadillac Lyriq and GMC Hummer, depend heavily on software. And the company intends to exploit this to deliver cloud-based consumer services beyond driving, using its new Ultifi software platform, expected to launch on 2023 models.

The company is no stranger to this business; its revenue-generating OnStar embedded telematics system was the auto industry's first in 1997 and has been widely copied since.

GM foresees Ultifi as the basis for applications including autonomous vehicles, something it is launching through its Cruise subsidiary. Its driverless robo-taxis, which had been undergoing testing in San Francisco, began charging fares there in June. The subsidiary is looking to add Austin, Texas, and Phoenix to its service network.

Robo-taxis are expected to generate $1 billion in revenue by 2025, growing to $50 billion in revenue with margins as high as 40% by 2030. But in the first half of this year, Cruise recorded $51 million in sales and an operating loss of $868 million, so profitability is a wait-and-see.

Similarly, BrightDrop, GM's delivery and logistics company, has more than 25,000 orders from FedEx and Walmart for its Zevo 600 and Zevo 400 electric vans. The company is also developing the Trace, an electronic cart that transports goods from the vehicle to the consumer. BrightDrop's fleet management software uses OnStar in concert with artificial intelligence. The company predicts BrightDrop will generate as much as $5 billion by 2025, and double that by 2030.

The newest GM business unit, GM Energy, will offer stationary battery packs, solar panels, EV chargers, and other energy-management products for homes and businesses. GM Energy is expected to help control the experience for its EV buyers and establish a business with consistent revenue flow as it supports the charging of GM's EVs. Beyond that'll, however, this new business segment is sensitive to the renewable energy market business cycle for its profitability. It's also sensitive to weather, as extremes can cause a spike in demand. GMs first storage products are expected to launch next year with the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV.

Fears and opportunity

While every business GM is entering already has its share of competition, the automaker's expanding EV lineup will provide an entry point with related services that provide a backstop against the cyclical auto market.

It's a solid plan that seems to position the company for long-term success with expectations of reliable profitability. Factor in a reinstated dividend and a price not far off its 52-week low, and GM appears to be an excellent buying opportunity.",electric vehicles,motley fool
266,Dow Jones Bear Market: The Smartest Investors Are Buying These Beaten-Down Stocks,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706085/stock-market-info-smartphone-pointing.jpg,30/10/2022,These beaten-down former growth stocks have showed up in the portfolios of select billionaire money managers.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/dow-jones-bear-market-the-smartest-investors-are-b/,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped into official bear market territory at the very end of September, falling just over 20% compared to where it started the year, but has since regained significant ground.

Although the bellwether index is still well within the boundaries of a market correction, the potential for another leg down seems high, with Bloomberg Economics saying the likelihood of a recession within the next year is 100%.

Both Walmart and Target have ""cancelled billions of dollars in orders,"" real estate brokerage Redfin said 60,000 home sales deals were called off in September, and core consumer prices have surged to their highest level since 1982, suggesting another big interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve is in store.

There is no arguing that bear markets are unsettling, and even veteran investors can be shaken out of their resolve to stay the course. Yet it's also undeniable that history shows such conditions are actually when investors should be buying. Every market correction has been followed by a bull market rally.

That's why the smartest investors use the opportunity to go shopping, and lately they've been buying up some of the most beaten-down stocks. Below are a pair of companies that have fallen by up to 96% that billionaires have still been scooping up.

Carvana

Used car ""vending machine"" retailer Carvana (CVNA -38.95%) is the most beaten-up of the bunch, with shares down 96% from their recent high. It has struggled through this rough patch for the auto industry as supply chain issues reduced inventories on new cars, which created outsized demand for used ones that ended up causing prices to soar.

That meant people also began holding onto their existing vehicles longer, and Carvana's inventory of vehicles has declined. It ended the second quarter with 2,865 vehicles, down from 3,149 at the end of December. Fewer vehicles means customers have to select cars that are further away from them, resulting in Carvana relying more upon third-party logistics companies to deliver vehicles to buyers.

Carvana has yet to turn a profit, and it's burning through cash. While it has $1 billion in the bank, it's burned through $850 million in the first half of 2022, meaning it needs to shore up its finances quickly.

Wall Street seems hopeful it can turn around its business and not go bankrupt, assigning one-year price targets significantly higher than where it's currently trading. The consensus outlook is for it to hit over $54 a share, four times above where it currently trades. This may be what attracted the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which acquired a position in Carvana of 520,000 shares in the second quarter worth $11.7 million.

It's not the biggest holding in its portfolio (it's actually one of the smallest), but this suggests it also has confidence it's not on the way out and that the used car market will bounce back.

Rivian

Although the electric vehicle (EV) market has substantial tailwinds behind it for long-term growth, electric truck maker Rivian (RIVN -0.78%) isn't sailing along with it -- and a recall of virtually all 12,000 vehicles didn't help.

Its stock has lost 83% of its value, which seems to have attracted the attention of billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital. He bought 73,723 shares at an average price of around $25.75 per share for a total of almost $1.9 million.

That actually goes against the tide of other hedge fund operators, like Daniel Loeb of Third Point Capital, who had been reducing the large stake he acquired last year only to completely close his position in Rivian in the second quarter. Viking Global Capital also exited the stock at the same time.

That might not have been soon enough to help them, though, as the stock had been falling long before then and has mostly been trading sideways lately. It could be that all the bad news has been mostly priced into the stock, which is what Einhorn likes.

Despite the recall -- and most of the vehicles have been fixed at this point -- Rivian has some competitive advantages in its EV, like Tesla, as its electric truck has already been introduced into the market. That helped it secure a large order from Amazon, though some could argue rushing to market is what caused the recall in the first place.

Like Carvana, though, Rivian isn't profitable and likely won't be on a recurring basis for some time. Tesla also took years to reach profitability. But a possible recession could extend Rivian's timeline to achieve it well into the future.",electric vehicles,motley fool

But some energy experts are concerned that too many all-electric buildings in the city could overwhelm the grid and lead to dangerous outages.

The Adams administration has said electrifying schools will eliminate the use of highly polluting No. 4 heating oil, which will have major effects on the city’s carbon footprint and help clear polluted air from the city’s asthma alleys.

Under the $4 billion initiative, called “Leading the Charge,” the city also plans to install high-efficiency LED lights in 800 schools by 2026. The initiative will prioritize schools located in environmental justice communities, beginning with P.S. 5 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, which will be the city’s first existing school to provide all-electric heating.

""What we are going to do in our school system is the equivalent of removing 26,000 cars from the road — cleaning our air, cleaning our environment,” said Adams.

However, some renewable energy advocates and researchers say fortifying the city’s grid and tackling the transportation sector first would be a better use of the city’s money and time. Among them is Bolun Xu, an assistant professor of earth and environmental engineering at Columbia University.

Xu says New York City’s buildings are major polluters. Their heating and cooking oils contribute to most of the city’s carbon emissions. That’s not only harmful to the climate, but also to public health in general — particularly asthma. But Xu argues there are a few big reasons to focus on the transportation industry and updating the grid first.

Xu’s first point is that electric modes of transport are low-hanging fruit. They’re easier to recharge than entire buildings. For example, school and city buses are only in use for a limited amount of time each day, and can be kept charging for the rest of the time, unlike buildings. He added that once electric vehicles hit their charging capacity, they actually return electricity to the grid, which can help power other things.

“A bus plugged into the grid is basically a great battery,” said Xu.

The grid in general is another concern for Xu. New York City’s grid has its limits — both in terms of the capacity it can handle now, and the potential capacity it can handle in the future.

“You do get to a point that the grid will be the final limiting factor,” he said.

The new EVgo Inc. (NASDAQ: EVGO) fast charging station is located near Lake Merritt. The new station features six 200 kW fast chargers, capable of charging a vehicle up to 80% in 15–45 minutes, depending on the charging capacity of the vehicle.

The new EVgo station adds to the 235 existing public EV chargers in Oakland.

The placement of the new charging station helps fill the void for renters and apartment dwellers who own electric vehicles but have no zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) access. The surrounding neighborhoods of Lake Merritt have some of the highest densities of older apartment buildings in the Bay Area. So most do not have onsite electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) or cannot be equipped with EVSE.

“Since adopting the Equitable Climate Action Plan in 2020, Oakland has made critical strides in fighting the climate crisis while ensuring that the benefits of our actions go first and foremost to Oaklanders who need them most,” said Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf. “This convenient new ZEV site shows our commitment to ensuring that all Oaklanders – including renters – are part of this critical transition.”

Mayor Schaaf was joined by Council President Nikki Fortunato Bas, Shayna Hirshfield-Gold, Oakland’s Climate Program Manager, Arthur Bart-Williams from GRID Alternatives, and Sara Rafalson, EVgo’s Vice President of Market Development and Public Policy, to announce the opening of the new charging station.

“I am thrilled to see this new electric vehicle charging station open in my district, centrally located next to Splash Pad Park, our two thriving commercial corridors on Grand and Lakeshore, and Lake Merritt, the crown jewel of our city,” said Council President Nikki Fortunato Bas. “This addition will not only help residents nearby to conveniently charge their vehicles but will also improve our ability to expand access for all to surrounding amenities in the neighborhood while supporting the city’s goals of equitable and sustainable development.”

“Growing the number of people who drive EVs requires equitable distribution of public fast charging infrastructure,” said Sara Rafalson, EVgo’s Vice President of Market Development and Public Policy. “EVgo focuses on building stations in convenient locations such as near Lake Merritt where drivers can grab a bite to eat, walk through the park, or buy weekly groceries right off a major interstate while charging their EV. We look forward to deploying more charging infrastructure throughout the city of Oakland in order to support the transition to an all-electric future.”

Oakland has a plan to achieve a fully zero-emission vehicle transportation system by 2045. With the addition of the new EVgo station near Lake Merritt, the city of Oakland is that much closer to fulfilling its Zero Emission Vehicle Action Plan.

“The City’s Zero Emission Vehicle Action Plan puts equitable access front and center,” said Shayna Hirshfield-Gold, Oakland’s Climate Program Manager. “Installing public charging stations is a critical action we can take to address barriers to electric vehicle adoption.”

Despite more and more EV charging stations becoming available every day, there are still a few areas that need to be addressed until access to charging stations becomes more widespread. Location, time, and duration are three areas that could use some thought.

That’s what some researchers from North Carolina State University have been researching, and they have developed a dynamic computational tool to help improve user access to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The ultimate goal is to make EVs more attractive while removing some of the charging problems drivers face.

“We already know that there is a need for EV charging networks that are flexible, in order to support the adoption of EVs,” says Leila Hajibabai, corresponding author of a paper on the work and an assistant professor in NC State’s Fitts Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. “That’s because there is tremendous variability in when and where people want to charge their vehicles, how much time they can spend at a charging station, how long it takes to charge their vehicles, and so on.

“The fundamental question we wanted to address with this work is: What is the best way to manage existing charging station infrastructure in order to best meet the demands of electric vehicle users?”

To provide a solution to that question, the researchers looked at it from a user perspective and focused on what important questions EV drivers have, like: How long will it take me to reach a charging station? What is the cost of using the charging station? How long might I have to wait to access a charging station? And what sort of fines are there if I stay at a charging station beyond the time limit?

Using a game theory framework to create a complex computational model, the researchers were able to develop a technique that accounts for all of these factors. The technique was able to do two things: First, it helps drivers locate the nearest charging station to meet their needs. Second, it assists the charging station operators to determine how long vehicles can spend at a charging station to allow for access to the next driver in line wanting to charge their EV.

“These outcomes are themselves dynamic — they evolve as additional data comes in about how users are making use of charging facilities,” Hajibabai says.

With this dynamic technique, a driver looking to charge their vehicle may find that the nearest available charging facility may change if there are no available spaces at the time. Also, the total amount of time users can spend at a charging station may change from day to day depending on how many people are using different charging facilities.

“There’s no clear real-world benchmark that we can use to assess the extent to which our technique would improve user access to charging facilities,” Hajibabai says. “But in simulations, the technique did improve user access. The simulations also suggest that flexibility in when charging station slots are available was a key predictor of which stations users would visit.

“A next step would be to work with existing charging station networks to pilot the technique and assess its performance in a real-world setting.”

Mobilize, a brand of Renault Group along with Renault dealerships, is launching Mobilize Fast Charge network. The ultrafast charging network consists of 200 charging stations, with most of the stations located at Renault dealerships that are less than 5 minutes from a motorway or expressway exit, giving easy access to their ultrafast charging stations that are not too far out of the way to use Mobilize Fast Charge.

Mobilize is planning to install 90 stations in France with there being one ultrafast station every 150 km on France’s trunk roads. Drivers will be able to charge their vehicles 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Mobilize Fast Charge will be one of the most powerful charging networks in Europe, delivering up to 400 kW of charging power. At each charging station, there will be 6 ultrafast charging points supplying up to 400 kW each.

Before long, a worry-free electric vehicle road trip from Hamburg to Seville will be possible thanks to Mobilizes’s strategic placement of EV chargers across Europe.

“One of Mobilize’s objectives is to make mobility cleaner and more accessible. Mobilize Fast Charge is helping by providing all-electric vehicle drivers with access to ultrafast charging points whatever brand they drive. To make this happen, Mobilize is leveraging two of Renault Group’s strengths: its granular sales network and Mobilize Power Solutions’ expertise,” said Clotilde Delbos, CEO, of Mobilize.

Some of the really nice perks that come along with using the Mobilize charging network while charging their electric vehicle, drivers have access to a nice seating area while their EV is charging. Drivers will have access to a Wi-Fi connection, coffee or snack, the ability to charge their phone or laptop, or even the ability to play a video game before continuing their journey.

Also, holders of Mobilize recharge cards can enjoy preferential rates throughout the Mobilize Fast Charge network.

“We are keen to show that it is possible to change the way we think about mobility; that there are down-to-earth, clever solutions that fit everyone’s needs. Mobilize is paving the way for large-scale transformation, with the stated intention of opening the door for as many people as possible to enjoy sustainable, accessible, and affordable mobility,” states Clotilde Delbos.

Mobilize Fast Charge stations will lower their impact on the grid by using a charging mechanism that relies on a smart energy management system combined with stationary storage capacity using electric vehicle batteries and, in some places, solar power from photovoltaic panels.

The powerful storage system is able to deliver a full 600 kW of instantaneous power while charging several vehicles at once. The system delivers ultrafast charge at the best price for EV owners and decreases the cost of connections that have to be made to the grid.

Mobilize Power Solutions conducted preliminary studies to identify the best locations and sizes of each of the stations it will set up and operate to develop the entire Mobilize Fast Charge network.

Mobilize Power Solutions has operations in 11 key electric vehicle markets in Europe: Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Luxembourg.

Tailpipe emissions aside, all cars have a colossal carbon footprint based on the energy used to create them from people travelling to the earliest board meetings, right through production, the use stage in the hands of owners and finally, the end of life.

It’s a bold plan not least because of the timescale it’s given itself but Polestar has lined up an impressive list of partners to help out and one of those is the still fledgling electric scooter manufacturer, Stilride.

Based in what it calls a “semi-secret lair” near Stockholm, Stilride was founded in 2019 by Jonas Nyvang and Tue Beijer with the aim of building elecro-mobility “devices” using a revolutionary method of sheet metal fabrication.

Stilfold, is a folding process the company describes as “industrial origami” and as such, reduces the needs for fixings and in particular welding which consumes a considerable amount of energy and produces CO2 emissions.

We caught up with CEO, Jonas Nyvang to find out more about what the company calls this group of “experienced entrepreneurs, misfits and robots from the automotive, electronics and fashion industries.” After all, for its expertise to be sought by a company the size Polestar, there must be something pretty special going on.

Scandinavia is famous for its design from glass, to jewellery to cars and everything about Stilride is a breath of fresh air. Hyvang and Beijer are old friends, united in their youth by the love of the Mod culture.

“I always loved scooter culture and the Mod scene,” recalls Nyvang. “Tue was into car design and he was always drawing his dream scooters. We would be sitting in a bar and he would sit there sketching scooters on knapkins to impress people,” he grins.

E-motorbike news and review

Both men completed their studies in London, Beijer at the Royal College of Art and Nyvang, taking an MA in design futures at Goldsmith College. I’m “more of a business person,” says Nyvang, who went on to become marketing director of Bjorn Borg Sportswear.

High level stuff then? “Yes, high level,” Nyvang laughs, “but low level can be more fun.” Beijer’s love of scooters endured too. “Years ago Tue showed me a folded bike with a simple, folded, steel chassis made from paper. It excited me as a new way of manufacturing and we still have it.”",electric vehicles,autocar

In fact it's Turkey's first car ever. Critics though say the whole project mainly serves President Erdogan's ambition to be re-elected for another term.",https://www.dw.com/en/turkey-launches-togg-car-the-presidents-prestige-project/a-63595678,"Turkey is making history with the TOGG, its first electric car and the first vehicle ever to be made by Turkey's car industry. But critics say the project's main purpose is to help President Erdogan secure another term.

Turkey has undertaken a range of political and economic measures to boost its independence from other countries in recent years. Now, it is ushering in a major breakthrough for its automobile industry. The first ever Turkish-developed, Turkish-made car — by Turkey's Automobile Joint Venture Group (TOGG) — is going into production.

The new TOGG car factory began operating on October 29. The date carries a clear message as it marks the 99th anniversary of the foundation of the Turkish Republic.

TOGG was first founded in 2018 for the purpose of making Turkey more independent from foreign carmakers. ""It is an important step contributing to the rise of Turkey's car industry,"" according to Emre Özpeynirci, a journalist and automotive expert, who has been closely following the TOGG project.

Plans are for 175,000 cars to be built each year Image: Mustafa Kamaci/AA/picture alliance

The plan for next year is to manufacture some 17,000 to 18,000 electric vehicles at TOGG's factory near Istanbul. The site is designed for a capacity of up to 175,000 cars annually, a target that decision-makers want to reach in the next five years.

Public divided over TOGG

Even though the TOGG factory is beginning production now, it will be a while before the vehicles reach the market. The company projects that the first cars will be ready by March 2023 — a few months ahead of the presidential election.

On June 18 next year, voters will decide whether to keep Erdogan in office or pick someone new to succeed him.

The TOGG car success or failure could influence the vote, as the vehicle is widely seen as a prestige project by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The TOGG automobile has been promoted as the ""people's car."" Indeed, when the project was first launched by Erdogan, people ""expected this would be a car affordable to everyone in Turkey,"" says Özpeynirci.

Critics of President Erdogan und his party, the AKP, are certain he is using TOGG to boost his chances of re-election. ""Of course investments like these are always supported by the state, but if there are political tensions, this will harm the project before [a single] car is even built,"" says Özpeynirci.

""It is a big problem, this car polarizes [opinions],"" says Özpeynirci.

Neither affordable nor practical?

TOGG plans selling its SUV at 900,000 Turkish lira (roughly 50,000€), which is unaffordable for most people in Turkey. Özpeynirci says ordinary consumers could invest no more than 500,000 lira for a new car. In one or two years, a more affordable model will follow.

The high retail price might not be the only disappointment in store for potential buyers. Turkey also lacks the necessary infrastructure for the owners of electric vehicles.

""Turkey's infrastructure is not yet ready to make the switch to e-cars,"" says Automotive Data CEO Hüsamettin Yalçın. Ordinary people, according to Yalçın, should not have to worry about whether there will be enough charging stations en route from Ankara to Istanbul.

While TOGG vehicles are designed and assembled in Turkey, components like batteries, engines and some electric systems are imported. To date, 51% of materials used to build the vehicles are Turkish-made. Industry minister Mustafa Varank has said he wants to raise this to 65% in coming years.

For now, TOGG cars are designed for the domestic market rather foreign buyers. This stems partly from the combination of components used to build the car, which drive up production costs, says Özpeynirci. He says if TOGG succeeds in using 70% Turkish made components, its cars will become competitive internationally.

Evidently, numerous dealers reached out and asked for more time to make their choice. Now, Ford is obliging and providing another month for dealers to make a decision about their future plans, pushing back the deadline to December 2.

“We value our relationship with our dealers and have decided to provide additional time for our dealers who have not decided or asked for more time,” said company spokesperson Marty Gunsberg in a statement to Automotive News.

Ford wants to ensure that dealers who do sell their EVs are well-educated and equipped to do so. To that end, it’s offering two different levels of EV buy-in that dealers can choose from. Notably, neither option will be inexpensive for the dealers in question.

Read: Ford Dealers Will Not Be Required To Sell EVs If They Don’t Want To

The first level is called Model e Certified and Ford estimates that dealers who select it will need to spend up to $500,000. That money will go towards EV infrastructure at the dealership itself. Dealers who go this route will have access to order EVs for customers, but they won’t be provided with EV inventory or demo units.

Conversely, those who go for the second-tier, Model e Elite, will have access to EV inventory, demo units, and a guaranteed allotment each year. Of course, they’ll need to spend up to $1.2 million for the privilege. That includes ensuring that the dealership has at least two DC fast chargers and one that’s specifically for customers.

Moving the deadline back provides more time, especially for dealers who are torn by this decision, and at the same time, it more closely aligns with the Dec 15 deadline set for Lincoln dealers. It’s noteworthy that dealerships that offer both Ford and Lincoln products will be required to invest in both programs as opposed to one or the other.

Ford has made it clear in the past that it won’t force any dealership to make the change or buy into the program. The exclusive benefits for dealers who opt in begin on January 1, 2024.",electric vehicles,carscoops

276,California's gas-car phaseout brings turmoil to mom-and-pop gas stations,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7fd819d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3611x1896+0+843/resize/1200x630!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8b%2F18%2F7857186b47a8a1094658dbf133b2%2F1194175-me-1003-gas-stations-future-cmh-04a.jpg,30/10/2022,"A ban on sales of new gas-powered cars and light trucks is years off, but mom-and-pop gas station owners are already facing a dilemma: evolve for the EV era or sell out and move on?",https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-10-30/la-gas-stations-future,"It was hailed as a landmark decision for the environment: The California Air Resources Board voted in August to require that all new automobiles and light trucks sold in the state be zero emission by 2035.

The move, aimed at tackling climate change, has been cheered by many. Just not mom-and-pop gas station owners.

In interviews with The Times, independent gas station owners said the state mandate will expedite the demise of their businesses. And they make up a significant part of the state’s fueling infrastructure: A little more than 5,000 such stations are scattered across California, according to National Assn. of Convenience Stores data.

“Most of the independents will be put out of business — completely out of business,” said Charles Khalil, who owns two gas stations in the L.A. area and is bracing for a shakeout ahead of 2035. “We are all going to suffer through it.”

He and other owners predict many mom-and-pop operators will, in the years ahead, sell their properties to real estate developers or large gas station chains that can afford to upgrade the sites with electric vehicle chargers. Space limitations and the high cost of installing chargers — a high-capacity version can cost $150,000, including all associated expenditures — make it infeasible for some owners to update their properties for an electric future.

Another local independent gas station owner, Adnan Ayoub, said the zero-emission mandate “is not going to be fun for a lot of us.”

“When the gas [cars] go away, I don’t know how many customers I would lose,” said Ayoub, who operates a station in Glendale and has been in the business for 33 years. “I’m kind of on the way out, looking for something else to do.”

Electric vehicle industry consultant Loren McDonald said the move by the resources board, a powerful department within the California Environmental Protection Agency, may not have much obvious immediate effect. But a significant number of closures will eventually come.

“It will be steady for a few years,” said McDonald, who consults for EV charging companies and convenience store chains, among others. “But ... in the last five years, as we start to approach the 2035 deadline, these owners are going to start bailing.”

How many mom-and-pop gas stations might California lose in the years ahead?

Using five years of annual data from the National Assn. of Convenience Stores, McDonald estimated that nearly half of the state’s 5,081 mom-and-pop gas stations would close by 2035. NACS defines these stations as those that include a convenience shop and are owned by a single-store proprietor — hence the “mom-and-pop” designation. (A caveat about the estimate: McDonald’s model assumes stations will begin closing at a rate of 3% annually, increasing to 6% a year — but over the next 13 years the loss of stations is unlikely to be linear.)

Under the CARB mandate, there will be a tapering of sales of gas-powered cars over the next 13 years: 35% of new autos must be zero emission by 2026, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. (The mandate allows 20% of what the state calls “zero-emission” vehicles to be plug-in hybrids, which can either run on electric batteries or on fossil fuels.)

But owners of vehicles with internal combustion engines will still be permitted to operate or resell them after 2035. With the average lifespan of a car in the U.S. pegged at about 12 years, there will be a need for gasoline for decades to come. Still, that demand will decline dramatically. CARB predicts that the 24 million California-registered cars and light trucks powered by fossil fuels will drop to a bit under 16 million by 2035.

McDonald expects gas stations owners to be affected not only by the new state rule, but also by the proliferation of increasingly efficient gas-powered and hybrid vehicles that achieve ever-loftier miles-per-gallon ratings. Simply put, some consumers will need to fill up for gas less frequently, and others not at all.

Girding for turmoil, gas station owners gloomily point out unresolved issues related to the new CARB rule. For example, how would California generate the electricity needed for the millions of new EVs that would be sold here? (According to the resources board, there are already 1.13 million zero-emission vehicles registered in the state.) And yet even as they raised this and other questions, owners said that they supported changes to help the environment.

Not every gas station operator intends to get out of the business. Take Bob Reed, 80, of San Mateo, Calif. He’s run the same station and service center on Palm Avenue in the San Francisco Bay Area city since 1973. “In my life, I will never sell it, because it took me a while to get this,” he said.

Reed knows a sea change is coming to the industry, but it’s one that his descendants will have to tackle, he said, lamenting: “My son and grandson will be the ones who are going to feel it.”

The real estate play

There’s a saving grace for gas station owners who are anxious over their prospects: location, location, location.

Because stations are typically in high-traffic areas, many are situated on parcels that would be coveted by real estate developers should owners decide to sell. Ronnie Givargis, investment sales broker at commercial real estate services firm Northmarq, said that there is strong demand for these sites, a large swath of which are “located on irreplaceable corners.”

“If your site is located in a desirable area, repurposing the property will be simple and profitable,” he added, noting that such parcels could be ideal for drive-through restaurants, banks and high-volume retailers.

Khalil’s stations are on Santa Monica Boulevard in Westwood and on Beverly Boulevard across from the Beverly Center, the latter a spot known for high gasoline prices. And the 52-year veteran of the business is leaning toward eventually selling to a developer.

“The reason we are holding tight to those locations is just because of the real estate,” said Khalil, who also runs a Torrance-based convenience store marketing consulting firm. “Gas stations are on the best corners, no matter what town, what area. Those people are holding on a bit so they could sell it to developer. That’s what I would do.”

Ayoub said that he also sees the development potential of the site that currently houses his station — but can’t make a move until his contract with a gasoline distributor expires in 2025.

“My options are either to sell to someone else and let them worry about it, or wait until my current contract expires ... and develop the property into something else,” he said.

Not all operators own the parcels their gas stations are situated on, and those proprietors who lease their properties could find themselves in an even more tenuous position than their land-owning peers who may reap a windfall in a sale.

Givargis said he’s noted “individual owners wanting to sell their stations now more than in the past,” and partly attributed this increase to the 2035 mandate. There are, however, environmental contamination issues that can crop up when a former gas station site is repurposed.

“There may be a need to go through a remediation process to clean up the site and make it habitable for future businesses,” Givargis said.

Such parcels might be coveted by real state developers or large gas station chains that would outfit the properties with EV chargers. One local chain is Long Beach-based United Pacific, which owns more than 500 convenience store gas stations and also distributes fuel.

“The larger groups can scale more efficiently and therefore turn better profits than a one-off operator can,” Givargis said.

An electric future

Many of the mom-and-pop gas stations will have a role to play in the EV-only environment — they may just have new owners.

It is not as if some independent owners haven’t tried to keep up with the times. Ayoub said that he had considered adding electric vehicle chargers at his station, but that a quote for the work was not economical.

Indeed, for a mom-and-pop owner, McDonald said the installation of a fast DC charger typically costs about $150,000 including construction and infrastructure work, whereas a large chain could add chargers at a lower per-unit cost due to economies of scale.

Carl Pancutt, chief executive of San Pedro-based Cleantek, an EV charging engineering and construction firm, said that adding a high-powered DC charger can cost from $70,000 to $100,000 for the equipment, and an additional $30,000 to $100,000 for the construction, depending on existing infrastructure. Pancutt, who also heads EV Range, a company that owns and operates an EV charging network, said it could cost more than $500,000 to add four DC dispensers to a site.

There are limited local, state and federal subsidies that gas station owners may tap to defray the cost of adding chargers, but accessing the incentives can require navigating a byzantine bureaucracy — an endeavor that some hire consultants to manage. More aid will soon flow from the federal government — a result of the $1-trillion infrastructure bill signed by President Biden in November.

Despite the high costs, EV Range has worked with some independent gas station owners to add chargers, including one in Walker, Calif. Helping independent gas station owners “provide an amenity to the new wave of drivers is important,” Pancutt said. “And it’s important to them for the next phase of their business.”

Still, once installed, it may take two to five years for EV chargers to become profitable, McDonald said. That’s due in part to their infrequent use. McDonald said that gas station EV chargers are typically used just 5% to 10% of a 24-hour period.

Then there’s the issue of “throughput,” an industry term for the number of customers that can be served at a single dispenser. A gas pump has a much higher throughput than an EV charger, because a gas-powered vehicle can be filled up in 10 minutes or less, whereas it could take more than 40 minutes to charge an electric vehicle to near its capacity using a DC fast charger.

But a potential benefit of a long wait for an EV fill-up is that customers would spend more time at a gas station property. While there, patrons might be inclined to fork over more money in the convenience store, perhaps enticed by fresher coffee and tastier pastries than are typically offered today.

However, to accommodate such visits, owners might need to upgrade their facilities — yet another expense.

“Smaller, local ones — if they see their business is going to be dying in 10 years — they are probably not going to spend the capital to add seating for 10 people inside and outside,” McDonald said.

Besides the matter of cost, there’s another potential issue — one Khalil ran into when he looked into adding chargers to his station near the Beverly Center: a lack of space.

A few years ago, he grew curious about the possibility of converting some of his gas pumps at the roughly 14,000-square-foot station on Beverly. “I said, ‘I will be ahead of the game,’” he said.

But an EV consult who visited the station had bad news. “They tell me, ‘You don’t have enough space to convert your property,’” Khalil recalled.

Pancutt confirmed that EV chargers require significant real estate. For starters, there’s the additional electrical infrastructure, which alone can occupy a piece of land up to three parking spaces in size, he said. Also, the first charger installed must comply with Americans With Disabilities Act standards, necessitating a 12-foot-wide parking stall with a 5-foot-wide aisle. From there, additional stalls would be 9 or 10 feet wide.

“That’s another hurdle,” Pancutt said.

Despite their pique, some gas station owners acknowledged that environmental realities require action.

“If experts say the environment requires we do it, then we move on,” Khalil said. “In the meantime, I am a little bit melancholic about it.”

But Khalil — who has spent more than half a century in the gas station business — is already prepared for the electric future, at least personally.

Investors dumped Chinese stocks in a $6 trillion blowout as Xi shut reformers out of decision making.

China's leader Xi Jinping has tightened his grip on power, shutting out reformers to effectively take sole charge of the world's second-largest economy — and that has rocked markets.

President Xi unveiled a new decision-making team stacked with like-minded political allies and publicly disrespected his business-friendly predecessor at the Communist Party congress last week.

Spooked investors dumped Chinese stocks in a $6 trillion blowout Monday, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, the tightly-managed onshore yuan continued to lose ground to the dollar, having already dropped sharply this year.

The Chinese president has spearheaded a zero-COVID approach to the pandemic and cracked down on the business activities of tech companies like Jack Ma's Alibaba. So the market reacted with concern as Xi made his move, worried that ideology rather than Beijing's brand of capitalism will prevail.

""This sharp consolidation of power is adding to investor unease,"" Mark Haefele, investment chief at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a recent research note.

These four charts capture the chaos that has rocked Chinese markets.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, where many of China's largest-cap stocks are publicly listed, plummeted 6.36% Monday for its biggest one-day fall of 2022.

That's its largest plunge in 14 years, according to Refinitiv data — meaning the selloff was the worst since the 2008 financial crisis.

""Equity valuations, already near a 10-year trough, will likely face more pressure if international investors demand a higher risk premium,"" UBS's Haefele said.

The Hang Seng's fall tested the deep lows it hit during that 2008 crisis. It tanked 1,030 points Monday for its lowest close since 2009, according to Refinitiv data.

The slump was building before the annual congress, as COVID containment policies, a crisis in China's real-estate market and growing fears of a recession all dragged on equities.

China's economy grew 3.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, well off track to hit Beijing's 5.5% annual target. Analysts expect Xi's consolidation of power to fuel further declines.

""We will likely see an intensification of policies that tend to slow potential growth in China,"" Goldman Sachs strategists said in a note. ""We are keeping a very close eye on signals out of Xi's inner circle as we should learn a lot in the next few months.""

Even US-listed companies are watching the slowdown, with Tesla cutting the price of its electric vehicles in China by 9% in view of cooling consumer demand.

Meanwhile, the tightly-managed onshore yuan has kept sliding against the rapidly appreciating US dollar. It fell near a 15-year low Tuesday, after the People's Bank of China set its midpoint at the lowest level since 2008.

The central bank ""fixes"" the currency within a set range of levels against the dollar. But the yuan has still dropped 17% year-to-date as jumbo-sized Federal Reserve interest rate hikes attract foreign investors to the greenback.

Under Xi, the People's Bank of China has tended to favor softer yuan fixes, allowing the currency to depreciate. The renminbi will likely fall further now, strategists said.

""The sudden jump in daily fixing to above 7.16 after capping it below 7.12 throughout the Congress was interpreted by the market as tacit approval for a weaker yuan,"" SEB head of Asia strategy Eugenia Victorino said.

A slide in the yuan weighs on China's economy by driving inflation higher, because when a country's currency weakens, its imports become more expensive. That could leave China's central bank embroiled in a ""reverse currency war"" with the US.

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks US-listed companies mostly doing business in China, fell 14.4% Monday – and it has now crashed 43.9% year-to-date.

Alibaba, the largest US-listed Chinese stock by market value, fell 12% Monday, and about 46% this year so far. Fellow Chinese giants Baidu and JD.com have seen a similar plunge.

CFRA told investors to sell their Alibaba stocks Tuesday, arguing that Xi's ousting of his predecessor was a turning point.

""The downside risk has fallen to the floor as Hu Jintao was carried out the door,"" the research firm's John Freeman said.

Previously, attempts to make tetrataenite in the laboratory have depended on extreme and impractical methods, but the researchers say they have found a way to bypass those prior techniques by using phosphorus. In a research paper published in the journal Advanced Science, they suggest there is a possibility to produce tetrataenite artificially and at scale without any specialized treatment or expensive techniques.

“Rare earth” is a misleading term that is sort of an inside joke among organic chemistry aficionados. It refers to a group of elements on the periodic table. “Noble gases” is another term that has little meaning except to organic chemists. In truth, “rare earth” elements aren’t all that rare in the grand scheme of things, but extracting them and purifying them is a challenge.

Rare Earth Materials And Permanent Magnets

The real reason why this news is important is that rare earth materials are critical to making the permanent magnets that are an essential component of the electric motors that the transition to an emissions free economy depends upon.

The sticking point is that China, with it predilection for dominating so many of the manufacturing processes for making electric vehicles, solar panels, and other critical technologies needed to address an overheating planet, controls over 80% of the world market for rare earth elements.

We know the danger of allowing tyrants in Saudi Arabia and Russia to control our access to fossil fuels. That experience suggests letting China be the gatekeeper for the new technologies we need to transfer away from relying on fossil fuels may be similarly fraught with danger in the future.

Professor Lindsay Greer of the materials science and metallurgy department at Cambridge University tells Innovation News Network, “Rare earth deposits exist elsewhere, but the mining operations are highly disruptive, as you have to extract a huge amount of material to get a small volume of rare earths. Between the environmental impacts and the heavy reliance on China, there’s been an urgent search for alternative materials that do not require rare earths.”

One of the most promising alternatives for permanent magnets is tetrataenite, an iron-nickel alloy with an ordered atomic structure. The material forms over millions of years as a meteorite slowly cools. This offers the iron and nickel atoms enough time to order themselves into a particular stacking sequence within the crystalline structure, resulting in a material with magnetic properties similar to those of rare earth magnets.

In the 1960s, tetrataenite was artificially formed by blasting iron-nickel alloys with neutrons, which allowed the atoms to form the desired ordered stacking. However, this technique is unsuitable for mass production. “Since then, scientists have been fascinated with getting that ordered structure, but it’s always felt like something that was very far away,” Greer says.

Over the years, many scientists have attempted to make tetrataenite on an industrial scale, but the results have been disappointing. Now Greer and his colleagues from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and the Montanuniversität in Leoben, have found a potential alternative that avoids these extreme methods.

Taking A Closer Look

The team studied the mechanical properties of iron-nickel alloys containing small amounts of phosphorus, which is present in meteorites. Inside these materials were a pattern of phases that indicated the expected tree-like growth structure called dendrites.

“For most people, it would have ended there: nothing interesting to see in the dendrites, but when I looked closer, I saw an interesting diffraction pattern indicating an ordered atomic structure,” said first author Dr Yurii Ivanov, who completed the work while at Cambridge and is now based at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa.

Initially, the diffraction pattern of tetrataenite looks like the structure expected for iron-nickel alloys, namely a disordered crystal not of interest as a high-performance magnet. But when Ivanov looked closer, he identified the tetrataenite.

According to the team, phosphorus allows the iron and nickel atoms to move faster, enabling them to form the necessary ordered stacking without waiting for millions of years. They were able to accelerate tetrataenite formation by between 11 and 15 orders of magnitude by mixing iron, nickel, and phosphorus in the right quantities. This meant the material was able to form over a few seconds in a simple casting.

“What was so astonishing was that no special treatment was needed. We just melted the alloy, poured it into a mold, and we had tetrataenite,” says Greer. “The previous view in the field was that you couldn’t get tetrataenite unless you did something extreme, because otherwise, you’d have to wait millions of years for it to form. This result represents a total change in how we think about this material.”

Although the research is promising, more work is needed to decide whether it will be suitable for high performance magnets. The team is hoping to collaborate with major magnet manufacturers to determine this.

The Takeaway

Why do we write about topics that are not yet out of the laboratory stage? Because the breakthroughs happening in labs around the world today will be critical to the transition away from burning fossil fuels as the basis of the global economy and human existence.

New types of batteries that are lighter, more powerful, faster charging, less expensive, and kinder to the environment are being researched in hundreds of laboratories all around the world as you read this. We don’t know where the breakthroughs will occur but we know they will come, just as those first crude internal combustion gasoline and diesel engines became the ultra-sophisticated machines that power hundreds of millions of vehicles today.

There are electric motors that do not rely on permanent magnets, but in general they are more costly than permanent magnet motors. If there is a way to duplicate their performance with inexpensive materials that are readily available to all manufacturers without one country dominating the supply chain, that is good news for us all.

The odds are, by 2030 electric cars will have taken a quantum leap forward as more and more new innovations become commercially available. We can’t wait!

It seems like every day I see something in my aviation news feed about some sort of new “flying car” being built by some random startup that says it’s revolutionising transportation. These vehicles are neat, but call them what they really are: electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Because they’re not flying cars.

Publications have been promising for decades that one day soon we’ll avoid traffic with flying cars. Science fiction has cemented the idea that the future is the flying car. In 1940, Popular Science notes, Henry Ford predicted that someone would combine a plane with a car. Moulton Taylor proved Ford correct in 1949 with the first flight of the Aerocar, an aircraft with detachable wings that could be driven on the road.

Taylor would be far from the last to combine planes and cars into one.

The term has also become extremely popular with the developments of personal eVTOLs. As the name implies, these are electric aircraft capable of vertical takeoffs and landings. Most promise to revolutionise how you get around. Despite endless headlines, even from the New York Times, none of these vehicles are really flying cars.

Take the Jetson One for example.

Photo: Jetson Aero

This eVTOL generates news as a flying car, and Jetson’s goal is to make everyone a pilot. It recently made its debut, and it’s already sold out for 2022. It looks like good fun, but there’s really nothing “car” about it. This is a VTOL that you take off, fly for less than 20 minutes, then land. At $US92,000 ($127,714) with a weight limit of 91 kg, “everyone” is optimistic.

The Opener Blackfly gets the same flying car distinction despite similar flight characteristics.

Photo: Opener

Opener goes even further than Jetson, advertising a future where you save on travel expenses by flying an eVTOL, and governments save the money they’d have used maintaining infrastructure. Opener calls itself “the future of transportation.”

There are too many of these to count from the SkyDrive SD-03, the Lift Hexa, the Next iFly, the HoverSurf Hoverbike S3 and so many more. Some of these exist as real, tangible vehicles, some not.

No matter what the companies and papers tell you about ushering in a new era or starting a revolution, their products are legally incapable of living up to the promises.

Those eVTOLs fall into the FAA’s ultralight category. This removes the necessity for their pilots to have licenses, widening the buying market. However, ultralights have a lot of restrictions. You can’t fly them over any congested area of a city or town. You can’t fly them at night. They don’t have much range. And the people flying them may not know how to avoid traffic or how to make radio calls necessary to fly in some airspace.

That means these eVTOLs have little practical use. That’s not a revolution. It’s a toy. There’s more freedom and more practicality flying an old Cessna 172 than the pilot of what’s touted as the future. And I don’t have to worry about a catastrophic propeller failure chopping me like a salad.

Bigger eVTOLs have more practicality but require proper licensing, and you can still forget the idea of flying out to lunch.

Photo: Airbus

Some of the companies developing these are more realistic, saying they’re for the kinds of shuttle services that helicopter airlines took a swing at long ago.

The closest vehicles to the promise of flying cars are roadable aircraft. Today, these include the Terrafugia Transition and the Klein Vision AirCar. Both of these are planes that can fold their wings and drive on the road. Of course, they aren’t exactly on point, as taking off requires first getting to an airport.

Photo: Klein Vision

You can’t buy them, either, and driving them on the road may not be legal where you live. However, they’re about as close as you’re going to get to avoiding traffic by flying.

It looks like eVTOLs are here to stay for a while and that’s fine; a lot of these vehicles look like an absolute hoot to fly. But let’s call them what they are instead of making them appear to be something that they’re not.

The challenge needs all his talent – and more,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/owning-twitter-elon-musk-takeover-social-media-platform-8239482/,"Last Thursday, after months of uncertainty, Elon Musk closed his $44-billion deal to buy social media platform Twitter. Musk wasted no time getting down to business, removing four top executives of the company including chief executive officer, Parag Agrawal and chief financial officer, Ned Segal. But the culmination of the deal has put Twitter in an unknown space — as a privately owned, global public platform. In an increasingly polarised world, where platforms, including Twitter, often come under criticism for the decisions they take and, at times, they don’t, and when there is a growing push back by governments against Big Tech over the governance of global public platforms, the new owner has his task cut out.

Also in Express Opinion | Dear Elon Musk, five reasons why you can’t run Twitter like Tesla or SpaceX

Both Tesla and SpaceX, companies that have propelled Musk to the top of the global rich lists, have been pioneering initiatives. Both have been industry leaders, revolutionising the electric vehicles segment and the aerospace industry. They have benefitted consumers by bringing down costs, and lowering entry barriers. In both these areas, Musk has displayed an uncanny ability to not only articulate a bracing vision, but to ensure its fructification. But Twitter is another animal. As one of the most widely used social media platforms in the world, it lies at the intersection of society, politics and government. And considering the critical role it plays in the dissemination of news and the shaping of global public opinion, it wields immense power. However, its decisions in the past, including the manner in which it effectively blocked former US President Donald Trump, have been considered to be shrouded in opacity, with many accusing the platform of not being either accountable or transparent in its decision-making process.

Also Read | Under Elon Musk, how Twitter will change as a private company

While it’s too early to pronounce judgement, turning Twitter private may perhaps reduce the transparency and scrutiny that comes naturally from being a publicly listed company. The veil of secrecy that comes with being a privately owned company as well the sheer indispensability of social media platforms in itself warrant a more robust and elaborate system of checks and balances and far greater transparency and accountability. More so when there is the possibility of conflict of interest. After all, the new owner has business dealings with governments across the world, even those who are not receptive to his views on free speech — Musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist. This has triggered both enthusiasm and alarm. How he addresses the contentious issues of hate speech and disinformation will be keenly watched. The takeover, which comes at a tumultuous moment — with the West facing acute economic turmoil while a war rages on in Europe and an ambitious China aggressively charts its own trajectory — is, inarguably, a moment of disruption.

281,California's gas-car phaseout brings turmoil to mom-and-pop gas stations,https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/59e6864e339799fcf686fe96b8c9fb3c,30/10/2022,"A ban on sales of new gas-powered cars and light trucks is years off, but mom-and-pop gas station owners are already facing a dilemma: evolve for the EV era ...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/californias-gas-car-phaseout-brings-120027966.html,"Gas station owner Charles Khalil believes a forthcoming mandate that all cars sold in the state be zero emission will imperil mom-and-pop operators such as himself. (Christina House / Los Angeles Times)

It was hailed as a landmark decision for the environment: The California Air Resources Board voted in August to require that all new automobiles and light trucks sold in the state be zero emission by 2035.

The move, aimed at tackling climate change, has been cheered by many. Just not mom-and-pop gas station owners.

In interviews with The Times, independent gas station owners said the state mandate will expedite the demise of their businesses. And they make up a significant part of the state's fueling infrastructure: A little more than 5,000 such stations are scattered across California, according to National Assn. of Convenience Stores data.

""Most of the independents will be put out of business — completely out of business,"" said Charles Khalil, who owns two gas stations in the L.A. area and is bracing for a shakeout ahead of 2035. ""We are all going to suffer through it.""

He and other owners predict many mom-and-pop operators will, in the years ahead, sell their properties to real estate developers or large gas station chains that can afford to upgrade the sites with electric vehicle chargers. Space limitations and the high cost of installing chargers — a high-capacity version can cost $150,000, including all associated expenditures — make it infeasible for some owners to update their properties for an electric future.

Another local independent gas station owner, Adnan Ayoub, said the zero-emission mandate ""is not going to be fun for a lot of us.""

""When the gas [cars] go away, I don't know how many customers I would lose,"" said Ayoub, who operates a station in Glendale and has been in the business for 33 years. ""I'm kind of on the way out, looking for something else to do.""

Electric vehicle industry consultant Loren McDonald said the move by the resources board, a powerful department within the California Environmental Protection Agency, may not have much obvious immediate effect. But a significant number of closures will eventually come.

Story continues

""It will be steady for a few years,"" said McDonald, who consults for EV charging companies and convenience store chains, among others. ""But ... in the last five years, as we start to approach the 2035 deadline, these owners are going to start bailing.""

How many mom-and-pop gas stations might California lose in the years ahead?

Using five years of annual data from the National Assn. of Convenience Stores, McDonald estimated that nearly half of the state's 5,081 mom-and-pop gas stations would close by 2035. NACS defines these stations as those that include a convenience shop and are owned by a single-store proprietor — hence the ""mom-and-pop"" designation. (A caveat about the estimate: McDonald's model assumes stations will begin closing at a rate of 3% annually, increasing to 6% a year — but over the next 13 years the loss of stations is unlikely to be linear.)

Under the CARB mandate, there will be a tapering of sales of gas-powered cars over the next 13 years: 35% of new autos must be zero emission by 2026, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. (The mandate allows 20% of what the state calls ""zero-emission"" vehicles to be plug-in hybrids, which can either run on electric batteries or on fossil fuels.)

But owners of vehicles with internal combustion engines will still be permitted to operate or resell them after 2035. With the average lifespan of a car in the U.S. pegged at about 12 years, there will be a need for gasoline for decades to come. Still, that demand will decline dramatically. CARB predicts that the 24 million California-registered cars and light trucks powered by fossil fuels will drop to a bit under 16 million by 2035.

McDonald expects gas stations owners to be affected not only by the new state rule, but also by the proliferation of increasingly efficient gas-powered and hybrid vehicles that achieve ever-loftier miles-per-gallon ratings. Simply put, some consumers will need to fill up for gas less frequently, and others not at all.

Girding for turmoil, gas station owners gloomily point out unresolved issues related to the new CARB rule. For example, how would California generate the electricity needed for the millions of new EVs that would be sold here? (According to the resources board, there are already 1.13 million zero-emission vehicles registered in the state.) And yet even as they raised this and other questions, owners said that they supported changes to help the environment.

Not every gas station operator intends to get out of the business. Take Bob Reed, 80, of San Mateo, Calif. He's run the same station and service center on Palm Avenue in the San Francisco Bay Area city since 1973. ""In my life, I will never sell it, because it took me a while to get this,"" he said.

Reed knows a sea change is coming to the industry, but it's one that his descendants will have to tackle, he said, lamenting: ""My son and grandson will be the ones who are going to feel it.""

The real estate play

There's a saving grace for gas station owners who are anxious over their prospects: location, location, location.

Because stations are typically in high-traffic areas, many are situated on parcels that would be coveted by real estate developers should owners decide to sell. Ronnie Givargis, investment sales broker at commercial real estate services firm Northmarq, said that there is strong demand for these sites, a large swath of which are ""located on irreplaceable corners.""

""If your site is located in a desirable area, repurposing the property will be simple and profitable,"" he added, noting that such parcels could be ideal for drive-through restaurants, banks and high-volume retailers.

Khalil's stations are on Santa Monica Boulevard in Westwood and on Beverly Boulevard across from the Beverly Center, the latter a spot known for high gasoline prices. And the 52-year veteran of the business is leaning toward eventually selling to a developer.

""The reason we are holding tight to those locations is just because of the real estate,"" said Khalil, who also runs a Torrance-based convenience store marketing consulting firm. ""Gas stations are on the best corners, no matter what town, what area. Those people are holding on a bit so they could sell it to developer. That's what I would do.""

Ayoub said that he also sees the development potential of the site that currently houses his station — but can't make a move until his contract with a gasoline distributor expires in 2025.

""My options are either to sell to someone else and let them worry about it, or wait until my current contract expires ... and develop the property into something else,"" he said.

Not all operators own the parcels their gas stations are situated on, and those proprietors who lease their properties could find themselves in an even more tenuous position than their land-owning peers who may reap a windfall in a sale.

Givargis said he's noted ""individual owners wanting to sell their stations now more than in the past,"" and partly attributed this increase to the 2035 mandate. There are, however, environmental contamination issues that can crop up when a former gas station site is repurposed.

""There may be a need to go through a remediation process to clean up the site and make it habitable for future businesses,"" Givargis said.

Such parcels might be coveted by real state developers or large gas station chains that would outfit the properties with EV chargers. One local chain is Long Beach-based United Pacific, which owns more than 500 convenience store gas stations and also distributes fuel.

""The larger groups can scale more efficiently and therefore turn better profits than a one-off operator can,"" Givargis said.

An electric future

Many of the mom-and-pop gas stations will have a role to play in the EV-only environment — they may just have new owners.

It is not as if some independent owners haven't tried to keep up with the times. Ayoub said that he had considered adding electric vehicle chargers at his station, but that a quote for the work was not economical.

Indeed, for a mom-and-pop owner, McDonald said the installation of a fast DC charger typically costs about $150,000 including construction and infrastructure work, whereas a large chain could add chargers at a lower per-unit cost due to economies of scale.

Carl Pancutt, chief executive of San Pedro-based Cleantek, an EV charging engineering and construction firm, said that adding a high-powered DC charger can cost from $70,000 to $100,000 for the equipment, and an additional $30,000 to $100,000 for the construction, depending on existing infrastructure. Pancutt, who also heads EV Range, a company that owns and operates an EV charging network, said it could cost more than $500,000 to add four DC dispensers to a site.

There are limited local, state and federal subsidies that gas station owners may tap to defray the cost of adding chargers, but accessing the incentives can require navigating a byzantine bureaucracy — an endeavor that some hire consultants to manage. More aid will soon flow from the federal government — a result of the $1-trillion infrastructure bill signed by President Biden in November.

Despite the high costs, EV Range has worked with some independent gas station owners to add chargers, including one in Walker, Calif. Helping independent gas station owners ""provide an amenity to the new wave of drivers is important,"" Pancutt said. ""And it's important to them for the next phase of their business.""





Still, once installed, it may take two to five years for EV chargers to become profitable, McDonald said. That's due in part to their infrequent use. McDonald said that gas station EV chargers are typically used just 5% to 10% of a 24-hour period.

Then there's the issue of ""throughput,"" an industry term for the number of customers that can be served at a single dispenser. A gas pump has a much higher throughput than an EV charger, because a gas-powered vehicle can be filled up in 10 minutes or less, whereas it could take more than 40 minutes to charge an electric vehicle to near its capacity using a DC fast charger.

But a potential benefit of a long wait for an EV fill-up is that customers would spend more time at a gas station property. While there, patrons might be inclined to fork over more money in the convenience store, perhaps enticed by fresher coffee and tastier pastries than are typically offered today.

However, to accommodate such visits, owners might need to upgrade their facilities — yet another expense.

""Smaller, local ones — if they see their business is going to be dying in 10 years — they are probably not going to spend the capital to add seating for 10 people inside and outside,"" McDonald said.

Besides the matter of cost, there's another potential issue — one Khalil ran into when he looked into adding chargers to his station near the Beverly Center: a lack of space.

A few years ago, he grew curious about the possibility of converting some of his gas pumps at the roughly 14,000-square-foot station on Beverly. ""I said, 'I will be ahead of the game,'"" he said.

But an EV consult who visited the station had bad news. ""They tell me, 'You don't have enough space to convert your property,'"" Khalil recalled.

Pancutt confirmed that EV chargers require significant real estate. For starters, there's the additional electrical infrastructure, which alone can occupy a piece of land up to three parking spaces in size, he said. Also, the first charger installed must comply with Americans With Disabilities Act standards, necessitating a 12-foot-wide parking stall with a 5-foot-wide aisle. From there, additional stalls would be 9 or 10 feet wide.

""That's another hurdle,"" Pancutt said.

Despite their pique, some gas station owners acknowledged that environmental realities require action.

""If experts say the environment requires we do it, then we move on,"" Khalil said. ""In the meantime, I am a little bit melancholic about it.""

But Khalil — who has spent more than half a century in the gas station business — is already prepared for the electric future, at least personally.

He drives a Tesla Model X.

What Are Capital Goods?

Capital goods are physical assets that a company uses in the production process to manufacture products and services that consumers will later use. Capital goods are also known as fixed assets since they tend to be long-term investments that stay with the company for many years. Examples of capital goods include:

manufacturing equipment

vehicles

buildings and land

computers

industrial machinery

other large-scale items that are used to produce goods and services

Capital goods can be divided into two categories: durable capital goods and non-durable capital goods.

Durable Capital Goods

A durable capital good can be defined as an asset that is designed for long-term use in a particular industry or market. A car is one example of a durable capital good since it is designed to be used for many years. Other examples of durable capital goods include computers, machinery, and tools.

Non-durable Capital Goods

Non-durable capital goods are investments that are useful to a business but don’t last for very long. Examples of non-durable capital goods include machinery, tools, and computer equipment. Additionally, non-durable capital goods often come with a relatively low initial cost, making them an attractive option for businesses that are operating on a tight budget.

Capital Goods Company Sectors

Capital Goods vs Consumer Goods

Capital goods are man-made products a business uses to produce consumer or other capital goods. On the other hand, consumer goods are products used by consumers. Capital goods include items like buildings, machinery, and tools. While examples of consumer goods include food, appliances, clothing, and automobiles.

So, what’s the difference between capital goods and consumer goods? Capital goods produce other goods, while individuals use consumer goods for personal consumption. This distinction is important because it ultimately affects a company’s bottom line.

Investing in capital goods can be risky because there’s no guarantee that the resulting products will sell. On the other hand, consumer goods are more likely to sell because people will always need and want them. Therefore, businesses must carefully consider which type of good to produce before making any decisions.

Capital goods vs. Consumer goods is a question of risk versus reward. Capital goods may be riskier, but they also have the potential for higher rewards. Consumer goods are less risky but also have lower potential rewards. It’s up to each business to decide which type of good is right for them.

I suppose if Top Gear were a car it would be powered by a frenetic three-cylinder engine. It would be supercharged and turbocharged, still with plenty of go, though misfiring at times. It would have a slightly weary superstructure, suffering from a little metal fatigue and the odd spot of corrosion. Nothing serious, you understand, but in need of attention.

So the first of the latest series (its 33rd) is very much the typical formula, with all its strengths and weaknesses. The lucky trio of presenters – Freddie Flintoff, Chris Harris and Paddy McGuinness – get to explore the car culture of Thailand, which is just as fascinating as you’d expect. Funnily enough, I reviewed the new Isuzu D-Max pick-up myself recently – a tidy enough drive for a diesel commercial vehicle – but never dreamt it could be raced and rallied with quite the aplomb it clearly is in the beautiful jungles of Indochina.

They sell more pick-ups per head in Thailand than anywhere else in the world, and make large numbers of these simple beasts of burden, so it’s a bit of a national symbol, and the Top Gear lads have their usual quota of fun in them. Obviously, they try to break their respective Isuzu, Toyota and bespoke BMW pick-ups by overloading them and driving them up a mountain, but that sort of puerile lark is what you expect on Top Gear.

It puts me in mind of one of the infamous Top Gear specials from a few years ago, featuring the previous generation of presenters, when Jeremy Clarkson and his sidekicks went to Burma and just took the mickey out of the place, lobbing in at least one racist joke. By contrast, Flintoff et al are much more respectful, indeed awed, by the people they meet, and there isn’t much condescension.

They are rightly impressed by the “Formula Hmong” wooden go-kart hill racers of the country’s deep interior, whose vehicles are powered by gravity and adrenaline. Harris, the only proper driver of the three, comes off and hurts his hand, a timely reminder to us all that mucking about with cars (even the sort without engines) is a dangerous game.

Harris is also put in charge of a 2,000 horsepower electric supercar, the Croatian Rimac Nevera. It outruns a Lamborghini Aventador, and thus proves the actual superiority of the new technologies – also something the “old” Top Gear could never quite bring itself to admit. It’s refreshing.

Poor old Flintoff caught Covid during filming, so McGuinness and Harris got on with the rest of it, but it isn’t for that reason that the show feels a little like it’s firing on only two of its three cylinders. There’s not enough variety in the elements to change the pace – to go up and down the gears, so to speak. No “cool wall”, no star in a reasonably priced car, no celebs to be gently mocked. The banter, the wit, the camaraderie between the three presenters can and should make the show stick together much better. The spark isn’t igniting the mix, and the joshing just doesn’t get going.

Even when Harris and McGuinness are togged out like gimps for the go-kart racing, the obvious opportunities for childish humour go begging. There’s not much wrong with Top Gear, and still a lot that’s right – such as the sharp editing and routinely gorgeous cinematography – but it could do with a service and perhaps a model refresh.",electric vehicles,independent

Michael Gove has urged people to judge the Government “by our actions” on the environment, as Rishi Sunak’s shunning of Cop27 was criticised as “disgraceful”.

The Prime Minister last week insisted he must focus on the “depressing domestic challenges” rather than go to the United Nations conference in Egypt next month, drawing widespread criticism, including from within the Tory ranks.

But on Sunday, allies of Mr Sunak indicated he was considering attending after all, the Financial Times reported. Downing Street was contacted for comment.

It is absolutely so wrong that Rishi Sunak is not going because the UK is still the holder of the Cop presidency Green Party MP Caroline Lucas

The King, who was advised by No 10 not to attend Cop27, will host a reception marking the conference on Friday, with Mr Sunak due to say a few words, Buckingham Palace announced.

Cabinet minister Mr Gove defended the Government’s record on the environment after its climate tsar Alok Sharma suggested the Prime Minister’s snubbing of the conference could signal the UK is deprioritising green issues.

“I know that across Government we want to field the strongest possible team at Cop but there are strong pressures on the Prime Minister’s diary,” Mr Gove told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme.

“Even more important than who goes is what we do,” he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, saying the UK is the “fastest” decarbonising economy in the G7 and is moving towards electric vehicles and renewable energy.

“Judge us by our actions,” he said.

Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said Mr Sunak should be rethinking his decision not to attend the Sharm El-Sheikh summit.

She told Ms Kuenssberg: “It is absolutely so wrong that Rishi Sunak is not going because the UK is still the holder of the Cop presidency. Symbols matter.”

Asked about reports that Boris Johnson could attend Cop27, she said: “If it embarrasses Rishi Sunak to reverse his disgraceful decision and actually get there himself, all and good.”

Former Conservative chancellor George Osborne added his voice to the backlash, saying Mr Sunak had “mishandled” the situation.

Touting the Tories’ environmental record, he told Channel 4’s The Andrew Neil Show: “Why trash that because you don’t want to get on a plane to Egypt?”

Mr Sharma, the outgoing Cop26 president who was recently demoted from Cabinet, told the Sunday Times he was “pretty disappointed that the Prime Minister is not going”, saying attendance would send a signal about the UK’s “renewed commitment on this issue”.

The King’s reception at Buckingham Palace on November 4, on the eve of the UN conference in Egypt, will “bring together over 200 international business leaders, decision makers and NGOs to mark the end of the United Kingdom’s presidency of Cop26 and look ahead to the Cop27 summit in Egypt,” the Palace said.

Guests will include US climate envoy John Kerry and Mr Sunak will “say a few words”.

Michael Gove has urged people to judge the Government “by our actions” on the environment, as Rishi Sunak’s shunning of Cop27 was criticised as “disgraceful”.

The Prime Minister last week insisted he must focus on the “depressing domestic challenges” rather than go to the United Nations conference in Egypt next month, drawing widespread criticism, including from within the Tory ranks.

But on Sunday, allies of Mr Sunak indicated he was considering attending after all, the Financial Times reported. Downing Street was contacted for comment.

It is absolutely so wrong that Rishi Sunak is not going because the UK is still the holder of the Cop presidency Green Party MP Caroline Lucas

The King, who was advised by No 10 not to attend Cop27, will host a reception marking the conference on Friday, with Mr Sunak due to say a few words, Buckingham Palace announced.

Cabinet minister Mr Gove defended the Government’s record on the environment after its climate tsar Alok Sharma suggested the Prime Minister’s snubbing of the conference could signal the UK is deprioritising green issues.

“I know that across Government we want to field the strongest possible team at Cop but there are strong pressures on the Prime Minister’s diary,” Mr Gove told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme.

“Even more important than who goes is what we do,” he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, saying the UK is the “fastest” decarbonising economy in the G7 and is moving towards electric vehicles and renewable energy.

“Judge us by our actions,” he said.

Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said Mr Sunak should be rethinking his decision not to attend the Sharm El-Sheikh summit.

She told Ms Kuenssberg: “It is absolutely so wrong that Rishi Sunak is not going because the UK is still the holder of the Cop presidency. Symbols matter.”

Asked about reports that Boris Johnson could attend Cop27, she said: “If it embarrasses Rishi Sunak to reverse his disgraceful decision and actually get there himself, all and good.”

Former Conservative chancellor George Osborne added his voice to the backlash, saying Mr Sunak had “mishandled” the situation.

Touting the Tories’ environmental record, he told Channel 4’s The Andrew Neil Show: “Why trash that because you don’t want to get on a plane to Egypt?”

Mr Sharma, the outgoing Cop26 president who was recently demoted from Cabinet, told the Sunday Times he was “pretty disappointed that the Prime Minister is not going”, saying attendance would send a signal about the UK’s “renewed commitment on this issue”.

The King’s reception at Buckingham Palace on November 4, on the eve of the UN conference in Egypt, will “bring together over 200 international business leaders, decision makers and NGOs to mark the end of the United Kingdom’s presidency of Cop26 and look ahead to the Cop27 summit in Egypt,” the Palace said.

Guests will include US climate envoy John Kerry and Mr Sunak will “say a few words”.

The car had press stops in New York City, Boston, Detroit, San Francisco, San Jose, and Los Angeles - with Sono aiming to stir up interest in the US auto market.

The total range should provide 190 miles on a full charge, with solar power helping contribute around 5,400 miles per year - so drivers can expect around 10-15 miles per day of solar-powered driving. Of course, that's an average number daily, weather, parking location, and other factors could impact solar power generation.

The outer shell of the car has 456 solar half-cells and EV power is generated by a 54 kWh LFP battery. Almost 190 miles of range can be charged in a half hour using a Level 2 DC fast charger.

Here is what Laurin Hahn, co-founder and CEO of Sono Motors, had to say at a press event earlier this month:

""Solar electric vehicles represent a new frontier in zero-emission mobility, enabling convenience, more range on a single charge, and greater independence from charging infrastructure. We are tremendously excited to bring Sion to the United States for the first time and to showcase our vision of the future of solar transportation.""

Sion will be released in Q3/Q4 2023 in Europe, with more than 42,000 reservations and pre-orders already recorded, according to Sono. The car doesn't qualify for a US federal tax credit since it's assembled overseas, but it still is one of the cheaper ways to jump into the current EV market.

Truthfully, it's been hard enough for automakers to convince drivers to adopt EVs - even though sales are increasing - so a solar EV might be a bit of a stretch at the moment. However, a lower customer price point and the ability to charge at home might be enough to entice some drivers to roll the dice.",electric vehicles,tweaktown

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Day Trading Stocks To Buy.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) are a few of the stocks that day traders should consider monitoring daily, as they’re all heavily traded and prone to wild price swings.

With the wealth of technical analysis now available to the average investor through many sites and the ease of performing trades instantly online through various investment platforms or banks, day trading has soared in popularity, with many people making careers out of the practice.

Day trading consists of buying into and selling out of stocks during the same day, with the goal being to exploit brief periods of volatility in stocks to make a profit. Given that, day traders typically play stocks with a high beta, or volatility, which means they are likely to see wider swings during a typical trading session than the average stock, and therefore offer greater profit potential for day traders.

In addition to volatility, the best day trading stocks are also those which are heavily traded, which likewise increases the likelihood that those stocks will experience greater price swings during any given period of time.

Other top stocks for day traders include those that are “in play” on any given day, usually fueled by a specific catalyst. These stocks tend to trend in one direction throughout the day on higher than usual volumes, making them ripe for profiting off of even after the initial surge. Needless to say, day traders have a lot to pay attention to each day and plenty of opportunities to make money.

Naturally, we can’t know which stocks will trend on any given day, but we can look at the historical trading activity of stocks to determine which ones are likely to provide opportunities on any given day, regardless of external catalysts.

The following list comprises 11 such stocks, all of which have average 3-month daily trading volumes of over 10 million and 5-year monthly betas of at least 2, making them at least twice as volatile as the average stock.

11 Best Day Trading Stocks To Buy

11. Canopy Growth Corporation (NYSE:CGC)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 12

Average 3-Month Daily Volume: 11.9 million

5-Year Monthly Beta: 2.02

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) are some of the best stocks for day traders to consider playing, as they feature high betas and daily trading volumes. Another is medical marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corporation (NYSE:CGC), shares of which are down by 69% this year.

Canopy Growth Corporation (NYSE:CGC) represents a cautionary tale when it comes to the explosive growth that was once expected of the marijuana industry and many of its players. The company’s revenue fell by 19% during its Q1 of fiscal year 2023, and is down by 8% over the past three years. If not for the company’s rapidly growing BioSteel sports beverage line (which has no marijuana component), the company’s sales declines would be even worse. Canopy Growth has also failed to grow its margins over the years, even as it’s shifting its product mix to more premium items.

Hedge fund ownership of Canopy Growth Corporation (NYSE:CGC) has fallen during each of the last three quarters and by 37% overall since the end of 2020. Several of the largest long positions in the stock also happen to consist of put options, which means several funds are banking on CGC shares tumbling even further in the future.

10. Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE:CCL)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24

Average 3-Month Daily Volume: 60.1 million

5-Year Monthly Beta: 2.06

Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE:CCL) is the owner and operator of a fleet of cruise ships, which are just now beginning to return to nearly full capacity, hitting 95% during the September quarter. Shares nonetheless remain near two-decade lows as the company continues to slog its way through its current debt woes towards what is expected to be an eventual return to profitability. Carnival recently upsized its latest debt issuance, offering $2.03 billion in senior priority notes as opposed to the anticipated $1.25 billion worth.

Hedge fund ownership of Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE:CCL) fell to an all-time low at the end of Q2 and has fallen by 49% since the end of 2020. Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp and Sander Gerber’s Hudson Bay Capital Management were a couple of the funds to unload their CCL stakes during Q2.

Despite not owning the stock, Miller Value Partners expressed surprise that Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE:CCL) had fallen beneath its March 2020 lows (where it yet remains), as detailed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:

“Amazingly, some companies like Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE:CCL) (CCL, which we don’t own) made it back to its March 2020 lows when business was shut down with no sign of return. Carnival already resumed positive operating cash flow generation and disclosed stronger than historical bookings for 2023 at higher prices. The market focused on fear of recession and refinancing risk posed by higher rates.”

9. XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24

Average 3-Month Daily Volume: 18.3 million

5-Year Monthly Beta: 3.34

XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) designs and manufactures smart electric vehicles and parts, as well as electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft through its affiliate XPENG AEROHT. The latter company just completed the first public flight of its XPENG X2 flying car earlier this month in Dubai. The two-seat carbon fiber vehicle is equipped with both autonomous driving and flying capabilities. XPeng manufactures its vehicles at a fully-owned plant in Zhaoqing, and is in the process of building two additional production plants in China.

While XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) is in the process of developing some impressive vehicles, its second quarter results left something to be desired. Sales were up 97% year-over-year to $1.1 billion thanks to the introduction of the P5 sedan during the previous year, but were flat sequentially. Meanwhile, vehicle margins slid by 190 basis points to 9.1% and the company’s net loss more than doubled to $403 million.

Hedge fund ownership of XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) has ticked down by 23% over the past two quarters, which could have as much or more to do with it being a Chinese stock as opposed to the firm’s own fundamentals. Nonetheless, one of the company’s biggest rock star bulls, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management, also sold off its XPEV stake during Q3.

8. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25

Average 3-Month Daily Volume: 44.1 million

5-Year Monthly Beta: 2.0

NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) is yet another Chinese EV stock that features on this list, and one of three EV makers in total, as stocks in the sector remain highly intriguing to investors, but extremely volatile. NIO, which manufactures EVs and parts, as well as EV charging stations, grew deliveries by 29% during Q3, though that included the first shipments of its ET5 sedan. There are broader concerns that the Chinese EV market may be experiencing weakness given Tesla’s move to cut prices there, in addition to Xpeng’s flat sales quarter-over-quarter. NIO’s net loss also widened during Q2, hitting $412 million.

Like XPEV, hedge fund ownership of NIO has also dipped by 23% over the past two quarters. On the other hand, while she sold off her fund’s stake in XPEV during Q3, Cathie Wood held on to ARK’s position in NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) during the quarter, though trimming it by 7%. Andrew Dalrymple and Barry McCorkell’s Aubrey Capital Management also hiked its position in NIO by 18% during the quarter to 751,000 shares.

Horos Asset Management discussed the Chinese regulatory environment as it relates to NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) and other U.S.-listed Chinese stocks in the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:

“At the beginning of April the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) announced possible changes in its regulation that would allow this inspection by foreign auditors, provided that the companies previously communicate to this body the state secrets that would be exposed, as well as the sensitive information that they might have to hand over, and the subsequent audit is carried out in a framework of collaboration with the CSRC. In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio, have just started trading on this stock market.”

7. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26

Average 3-Month Daily Volume: 35.7 million

5-Year Monthly Beta: 3.3

Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) operates two data analytics platforms, one which primarily serves government customers, and one which serves commercial enterprises. The company’s stock was aggressively bid up during its first few months on the market, topping $35 per share, but has since crashed to just $8.54.

Investors are now unwilling to overlook the company’s slowing growth, particularly in its government business, which has fallen from 66% year-over-year growth to just 13% in the span of five quarters. The company’s operating margin has trended down during that time as well, falling from 31% to 23%. While CEO Alex Karp projects revenue growth to re-accelerate slightly over the next few years, hitting $4.5 billion by 2025, analysts aren’t as bullish, projecting just $2.37 billion in sales next year.

Hedge fund ownership of Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) slumped by 27% during Q2 to hit its lowest level since the company’s September 2020 IPO. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management sold off 60% of its PLTR position during Q3 while Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP unloaded its entire stake in the company during Q2.

Tao Value also unloaded its Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) holding within the last year, noting in its Q4 2021 investor letter that it felt the stock was a bubble risk:

“We have no new position this quarter and have made below changes to our portfolio. We also sold Palantir (PLTR) as I identified it subject to high retail bubble risk (using above method) and are not part of our core “Mindful Compounder” holdings.”

6. Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 28

Average 3-Month Daily Volume: 22.2 million

5-Year Monthly Beta: 2.76

Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG) is an offshore drilling provider that specializes in operating rigs in deepwater and other challenging environments. Given its substantial debt load of over $7 billion and the fact the company remains unprofitable, it’s a risky stock to own even in a strong oil price environment, but the upside potential is driving volatility in the stock, making it a great day trading stock to play.

RIG shares have been extremely volatile this year, being up by over 50% at one point, but slumping heavily later in the year to be down by over 20% year-to-date at that point. They’re currently trending up again and are 19% in the green in 2022.

The smart money has been buying into Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG) more frequently in recent quarters, pushing ownership of the stock up by 74% since the end of 2020. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management owns the largest long position of 30 million shares, while Joe Dimenna’s ZWEIG DIMENNA PARTNERS added RIG to its 13F portfolio during Q2.

Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) rank among the best stocks to buy for day traders. We’ll check them out in the second half of this article, linked to below.

First, the intriguing bit. For years Jaguar Land Rover has acknowledged it needs a baby Land Rover. Think 2WD at less than £30k, and possibly a 4WD version at nearer £40k. Either way, it must be raised, rugged and with a chunky, tank-like body protecting it and its mostly young urbanite occupants.

Good news: such a vehicle made its world debut at the Paris Motor Show, where it was the star.

Bad news: sadly, it had zilch to do with JLR. However, those who’ve been prevented from buying the overdue little Landie they crave can soon order the all-new Renault 4 instead. At or below £30k, it comes with a pure-electric motor, not one of those old-school petrol or diesel lumps.

An added twist here is that before being installed in the top job at JLR, Thierry Bolloré lost his job as CEO of Renault. Time for him to approach his former employer to cheekily ask if it will kindly, under licence, produce a few Renault 4s in British racing green, and wearing subtle Land Rover badges? Alternatively, the French firm could simply upstage JLR by selling limited-edition Range Raver versions of its imminent Renault 4, I’d argue.",electric vehicles,autoexpress
289,5 Top Stocks for November,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/706543/a-person-looks-at-a-computer-and-smiles-while-holding-a-tablet-and-leaning-on-a-desk-that-consists-of-color-pallets-various-writing-utensils-and-other-materials.jpg,30/10/2022,"A dynamic blend of growth, value, and dividend stocks worth considering now.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/30/5-top-stocks-for-november/,"One of the greatest challenges of being a long-term investor is enduring market cycles. It can be downright perplexing to see individual stocks and sectors go from in favor to out of favor on a whim. But steep sell-offs and volatility can present impeccable buying opportunities for patient investors.

As a recent example, note that in 2020 the three worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500 were energy, real estate, and financials. The reverse was true the following year, as energy, real estate, and financials were, in order, the three best-performing sectors of 2021. While investors shouldn't expect these kinds of rapid reversals over the short term, it's worth noting that sharp price movements aren't always grounded in fundamentals and can have nothing to do with a core investment thesis.

Bear markets have historically presented impeccable buying opportunities -- but only for companies that have what it takes to overcome obstacles and grow over the long term. Here's why Microsoft (MSFT 3.33%), Ford Motor Company (F 1.88%), The Trade Desk (TTD -5.94%), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -0.80%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 1.82%) stand out as five compelling buys now.

Indispensable software products and cloud services

Trevor Jennewine (Microsoft): Microsoft saw its share price tumble more than 7% following its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2022). Revenue rose 11% to $50.1 billion, a big deceleration from 22% growth last year, and earnings fell 13% to $2.35 per diluted share. Worse yet, guidance came in short of Wall Street's expectations, as CFO Amy Hood said weak PC demand would persist into the second quarter, negatively impacting revenue from Windows and Surface devices. Hood also said ad spend on LinkedIn and Bing Search would likely suffer too.

However, things aren't as bad as they seem. Revenue actually climbed 16% when unfavorable foreign exchange rates are stripped out, and earnings climbed 11% when adjusted for a one-time tax benefit last year. Additionally, temporary economic headwinds may put pressure on Microsoft in the near term, but they leave the long-term investment thesis unchanged. That means short-sighted shareholders who sold the stock have created a buying opportunity for patient investors.

The bull case for Microsoft is straightforward. The company offers a range of mission-critical software and cloud services, and it has achieved a strong presence in several end markets. Most notably, Microsoft 365 brings together industry-leading tools like Office 365 for productivity, Power BI for business analytics, and Teams for communication and collaboration.

Microsoft is also a strong contender in several cybersecurity verticals -- access management, endpoint protection, security information, and event management -- and its security customer count jumped 33% to 860,000 in the most recent quarter. That puts Microsoft in front of a large growth opportunity, as the cybersecurity software market is expected to increase at 12% per year through the end of the decade, reaching $500 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.

Finally, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud services provider. It trails Amazon Web Services by a wide margin, but it has twice as much market share as the third-place contender, Alphabet's Google Cloud. That bodes well for the future. Grand View Research estimates that cloud computing spend will grow at about 16% annually to approach $1.6 trillion by 2030.

Currently, Microsoft's share price sits 32% off its high, marking its greatest drop in the last decade. That's why this stock is worth buying in November.

This long-term growth story is intact

Neha Chamaria (Ford): With Ford shares losing more than one-third of their value in 2022 so far, investors were pinning hopes on the auto giant's third-quarter numbers for some respite. Unfortunately, Ford reported a huge net loss for the quarter and trimmed its forecast for adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the full year.

Yet, Ford just made a smart business move, and while that may have driven its Q3 losses higher, it shows how management is focused on high-growth areas even if it means making some tough decisions. Also, it's not that Ford isn't growing at all, which is why you'd want to give Ford stock a serious look while the market harps on near-term blips.

Ford is facing a problem with supply, not demand. At the end of September, Ford had nearly 40,000 vehicles in inventory that couldn't be sold because of a shortage of parts. Yet it still grew its revenue by 10% year over year in Q3 on robust demand and expects supply challenges to ease in the coming quarters. In fact, Ford expects its wholesale shipments -- or units sold primarily to dealers -- to rise 10% in 2022. Also, Ford's adjusted EBIT guidance of $11.5 billion for the full year still translates into nearly 15% growth over 2021.

In short, Ford may not be growing as fast as investors want it to, but it is growing at a decent pace despite the macroeconomic headwinds. Ford's electric vehicle (EV) sales are booming as well -- they tripled year over year in the month of September, with its F-150 Lightning pickup truck selling like hotcakes. And to double down on viable autonomous technologies, Ford will now build Level 2 and Level 3 self-driving technologies internally even as it announced plans to shut down Argo AI. It looks like a prudent move as Argo AI was focused on Level 4 technology, and so far, fully self-driven technology has proven to be more difficult than expected to develop and commercialize.

A big write-off on its Argo AI investment may have hit Ford's bottom line in Q3, but that shouldn't detract you from the steady growth in Ford's shipments, EV sales, and cash flows. Not to mention its growth plans.

Booming business amid a sectorwide slowdown

Anders Bylund (The Trade Desk): I love to buy shares of excellent companies while they are cheap. That's a key ingredient in the classic investing mantra to ""buy low, sell high."" It's even better when the company's business is booming, even though Wall Street tossed the stock in the bargain bin due to a systemic weakness in the relevant sector. A mismatch between expected weakness and robust results sets the stage for wealth-building returns in the long run.

That's exactly what I see in The Trade Desk right now. The stock trades roughly 40% lower year to date as investors wrestle with widely reported slowdowns in online advertising sales. The market reaction makes sense at a glance, since The Trade Desk makes its money by running automated digital ad campaigns on behalf of other companies.

However, The Trade Desk's business is firing on every available cylinder. Sales increased by 35% in the second quarter, compared to the year-ago period. Revenue, free cash flows, and cash reserves are skyrocketing, often leaving analyst estimates in the dust:

The secret to The Trade Desk's success in a weak market is simple. Penny-pinching marketing campaign managers want to make the most of every ad-budget nickel in these challenging times. That's what The Trade Desk does best, adding data-driven value to its clients' advertising efforts.

The company is set to report third-quarter results on Nov. 7. These reports don't always send share prices skyward, even when The Trade Desk presents impressive surprises on the top and bottom lines. Still, we are most likely about to get our hands on yet another piece of evidence that this company can thrive in a difficult market. Whether you buy The Trade Desk now at a deeper discount or wait for cold, hard financial gains in the earnings report, early November looks like a great time to pick up a few shares.

Rising from today's modest starting price, this stock can make you plenty of money in the long run.

A winner with even better days ahead

Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): As 2022 winds down, the odds of the U.S. entering a recession appear to be increasing. Many, if not most, stocks will probably decline during an economic downturn. However, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an exception. It's the kind of stock that's likely to thrive in a recession.

Vertex is certainly defying the bear market right now. The biotech stock has soared more than 40% year to date. I think this winner has even better days ahead.

All Vertex needs to do to continue growing its revenue and earnings is snag additional reimbursement deals and regulatory approvals for its existing cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs. That shouldn't be very difficult, in my view.

The company and its partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, hope to soon file for regulatory approvals of exa-cel in treating rare blood disorders beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. I think the prospects for Vertex to have another future blockbuster in its lineup with the gene-editing therapy look bright.

Vertex's pipeline also features three other promising late-stage programs. It could have yet another powerful CF therapy with the triple combination of VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561. Non-opioid pain drug VX-548 has tremendous potential. Inaxaplin (VX-147) could be an effective treatment for APOL1-mediated kidney disease, an indication with a larger patient population than CF.

A recession wouldn't cause Vertex's CF therapy sales to decline. Neither would macroeconomic issues impact the company's drug development programs. With the signs pointing toward the economy potentially heading south, I think Vertex is an ideal stock to buy in November to weather the storm.

Procter & Gamble's consistency is unrivaled

Daniel Foelber (Procter & Gamble): Currency weakness and inflation are taking a sledgehammer to the performance of U.S.-based companies -- particularly conglomerates with international exposure. Procter & Gamble (P&G) generates just over half of its sales from outside North America. A strong dollar means that international sales are effectively discounted relative to domestic sales, which impacts profitability.

In its Q1 fiscal 2023 presentation, P&G forecasted a staggering $3.9 billion in full-year fiscal 2023 headwinds due to inflation, commodity, and currency-related factors. The $3.9 billion translates to an earnings per share (EPS) headwind of $1.57, or 27% of its full-year forecast.

Despite this challenge, P&G is still forecasting flat to 4% core EPS growth in fiscal 2023, which is incredibly impressive given the impact of the headwinds discussed. P&G plans to distribute $9 billion in dividends in fiscal 2023 and will likely raise its dividend for the 67th consecutive year. However, it's buying back less stock, with direct share repurchases at an estimated $6 billion to $8 billion compared to $10 billion in fiscal 2022.

P&G's consistency deserves a premium valuation, no matter the market cycle. Even in the face of challenges, the company generates ample free cash flow to support a growing dividend and buybacks. After all, free cash flow used on dividends and buybacks is effectively cash that the company doesn't need to run the core business. Investors would be hard-pressed to find a company that is better insulated from economic headwinds than Procter & Gamble. Its 22.9 price-to-earnings ratio isn't all that inexpensive relative to the rest of the market. But the quality of its dividend (yielding 2.8%) makes P&G one of the most reliable ways to generate passive income.",electric vehicles,motley fool

Environmental, social and governance investing is becoming increasingly popular. In the first half of this year, a net $120bn flowed into ESG funds globally against a net outflow of $139bn across broader market funds.

In addition, many investors are now focusing on the ESG credentials of individual companies before deciding whether to buy them.

Clearly, there are opportunities for some stocks to capitalise on trends such as the world’s push to achieve net zero status. However, in Questor’s view, it is crucial that investors do not lose sight of their core investment principles when accommodating ESG-related factors into their decision-making.

For example, they should not overlook obvious fundamental weaknesses in stocks, such as the lack of an economic “moat” to protect them from rivals or excessive debt, just because they score well on ESG metrics.

Fortunately, the FTSE 250 company Weir offers the best of both worlds. It is a fundamentally sound company that is well placed to benefit from rising demand for metals, such as copper and iron ore, that are used extensively in renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicles.

The company provides innovative engineering solutions to mining companies that improve their efficiency and environmental credentials. Demand for its products is likely to rise as miners seek to reconcile the inherent conflict between ramping up production to satisfy the world's net zero drive and meeting the increasingly onerous environmental standards that are being implemented across the industry.

Weir's competitive advantage over rivals should be maintained, and even extended, by its growing spending on research and development. It has risen from 1.3pc of revenue in 2020 to 2pc of sales in the first half of the current year and allows the company to improve the digital capabilities of its products.

Last year's acquisition of an artificial intelligence specialist, Motion Metrics, helps to further differentiate its offering and increase its competitive advantage. The disposal of its oil and gas business, also in 2021, gives it a focus on the future as the world transitions to the use of cleaner forms of energy.

Story continues

In terms of fundamentals, the company's financial position is sound. Its net-debt-to-equity ratio of 53pc and net interest cover of more than six highlight its capacity to withstand a period of rapid monetary policy tightening. Its financial standing also provides sufficient flexibility to make further acquisitions should falling asset prices make opportunities more plentiful.

Its latest half-year report showed that it had been able to offset higher input costs during a period of rampant inflation so that gross margins were maintained. It also announced an efficiency programme that will seek to deliver £30m in annualised savings by 2025.

With more than three quarters of revenue coming from recurring “aftermarket” sources and operations across a wide range of regions and metals, it has a relatively solid business model that could be invaluable during an uncertain period for the world economy. More details on its recent performance will be included in a third-quarter trading update scheduled for release on Wednesday.

Since being tipped by this column in July 2018, the company's shares have fallen by around 20pc. They have been hit by a challenging global economic outlook that has prompted a weaker period of performance for the stock market, as well as company-specific events such as a cyber attack in September last year.

The shares now trade at about 17 times forecast earnings. While this makes them expensive relative to many other medium-sized companies, Weir offers impressive long-term earnings growth potential as the world economy recovers and demand for the metals needed in the future increases.

Clearly, ESG-related factors are a major part of its long-term growth story and are likely to boost its bottom line. Crucially, though, the company has sound fundamentals and a sustainable competitive advantage that cement its status as an attractive investment opportunity.

A replacement for the XC90 seven-seater SUV, it’s supposed to usher in a new era of electrification for the Gothenburg-based company in a way the C40 and XC40 Recharge haven’t.

We still don’t know what the fully-finished EX90 will look like—although we do have a pretty good idea, thanks to the Concept Recharge from last year and several patent images of the real deal—nor any technical details. We don’t know how much power or torque it will make, nor the size of the battery, nor its range.







European patent images of what is likely the Volvo EX90. Source: EUIPO

What we do know is that the car will be offered with bi-directional charging (similar to the Hyundai Ioniq 5‘s vehicle-to-load function, or V2L), which will be able to power other electric devices and even your entire house, such as during peak hours when electricity tariffs are at their more expensive.

We also know that Volvo will ditch real leather in favour of a new Nordico material made from recycled PET bottles, along with sustainable backlit wood panels certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and optional wool upholstery. Most recently, the company revealed the EX90’s minimalist interior, which features a massive portrait touchscreen and a slim instrument display. These run a minimalist interface that is promised to provide clear and concise information and minimise distraction.







Buried in almost every press release, however, is a small but significant proclamation: “The Volvo EX90 will be hardware-ready for unsupervised autonomous driving, meaning that in the future the car can ultimately be able to drive for you.” Volvo seems to be taking an leaf out of Tesla’s book—the latter sells a Full Self Driving Capability package that doesn’t actually drive the car by itself.

Tesla’s approach has been met with strong opposition from vehicle safety groups and regulators, so why is Volvo—a company renown for its safety-first philosophy—going down the same route? Let’s take a closer look.

The hardware behind the claim

A growing number of new vehicles come with at least a forward-facing camera to see the world, providing basic driver assistance features like autonomous emergency braking and lane keeping assist. In some cars, this is augmented with a front radar to offer adaptive cruise control; similar sensors on the rear corners give you blind spot monitoring. The EX90, on the other hand, adds a standard-fit lidar sensor at the top of the windscreen, joining the eight cameras, five radar sensors and 16 ultrasonic sensors.

You already have lidar sensors on Pro models of the iPhone and iPad, which use lasers to scan a room and deliver better augmented reality experiences. In the Volvo, however, the lidar sensor provide a detailed view of the road ahead, detecting pedestrians up to 250 metres ahead and objects as small as a tyre 120 metres ahead. All this while at highway speeds and weather day or night; the company claims this could result in a nine per cent accident reduction and a 20% reduction in serious crashes.

But the EX90 doesn’t just scan the road ahead—it will also feature a driver monitoring system, using two cameras pointed right at your face to determine if you’re distracted, tired or intoxicated. If it detects that you’re not paying attention to the road ahead, it will try and alert you with warnings that get progressively more aggressive, and if all else fails, it will pull over to the side of the road and turn on the hazards.

Another safety feature—one that’s not related to autonomous driving—is the addition of a radar sensor on the inside of the car, claimed by Volvo to be a world first. This system is meant to prevent children or pets from being forgotten in cars; US government data shows that since 1998, more than 900 children have died after being left in hot cars.

Typically, cars with rear seat reminders will try and guess if an occupant is in a rear seat by detecting whether a rear door has been opened or whether a rear seat belt has been fastened. Volvo’s system, however, is precise enough to be able to detect the sub-millimetre movements of a sleeping toddler. If there is a person or animal has been left behind, the EX90 will prevent itself from being locked and turn on the air-conditioning—as long as there is enough charge left in the battery.

How Volvo’s approach differs from Tesla’s

Volvo obviously isn’t the first company to claim that its cars are “hardware-ready” for “unsupervised” autonomous driving. Tesla grabbed headlines back in 2016 that its cars would have all the hardware necessary (eight cameras, one radar, 12 ultrasonic sensors) to fully drive themselves, even though its Autopilot system—while advanced for its time—was far from capable of such a feat.

We’ve learnt since then that the company’s claim was, in typical Elon Musk fashion, complete horseshit. Not only did Tesla subsequently update the hardware multiple times (to be fair, these were CPU changes that could be retrofitted free of charge), but it also charged a whopping USD15,000 (RM70,800) for the Full Self Driving package and took a full four years before it finally released the functionality—and only in beta form at that.

Even then, Tesla’s assertion of complete autonomy was optimistic at best, and it took regulatory pressure to force the company into including language in its manuals and support documents saying that its cars could not, in fact, drive themselves. In a way, Volvo’s latest claim has shades of Tesla to it, but there are a couple of notable differences.

The Luminar lidar sensor to be installed on the EX90

Firstly, Volvo isn’t charging extra for this equipment—everything the company says will enable full autonomy is included as standard. It’s also not releasing a “beta” of its autonomous driving functionality onto unsuspecting owners, as it will only make it available to the public once it has passed its own safety verifications and achieved the necessary regulatory approvals. In other words, it will be the finished product.

Most importantly, Volvo only made the claim after adding a lidar sensor, considered to be essential for autonomous driving. This not only makes the car “see” better (as it can precisely measure the distance to an obstacle and isn’t limited by the available light), but it also adds another layer of redundancy to the cameras, radar sensors and ultrasonic sensors that are already available.

Contrast this with Tesla—Elon Musk has not only called lidar an expensive “fool’s errand”, but the company has even resorted to removing radar sensors on its cars, claiming that its camera-based Tesla Vision system is able to serve the same functionality. That was last year, and since then, there’s been a spate of “phantom braking” incidents, where its cars simply brake for no apparent reason—often because the cameras detected vehicles in the oncoming lane.

Couple this very dangerous behaviour with the more than a dozen accidents involving Autopilot in the US (some of them fatal) and it’s no surprise that the country’s Department of Justice has recently launched an investigation into the carmaker. This will be centred around the company’s dubious marketing claims that hint of complete autonomy—something that stretches all the way back to 2016.

Volvo doesn’t exactly have a spotless history of its own when it comes to autonomous driving. The company made the news in March 2018 when a test unit of the XC90, developed by Uber, struck and killed a pedestrian walking her bicycle across the road in Tempe, Arizona.

This caused the state governor to almost immediately suspend Uber’s self-driving tests, and the company would only resume limited tests (in a different state) in December that year before selling the operation in 2020. It should be noted, however, that the autonomous technology was developed entirely by Uber and the XC90’s own safety systems were disabled for the tests.

In any case, the real fool’s errand would be to try and predict the kind of hardware we will eventually rely on for fully autonomous driving, as Tesla’s increasingly fraught efforts have shown. We all know technology moves fast, and given that self-driving cars are still years away from reality, a lot can change between now and then. Still, we can at least applaud Volvo for fitting the barrage of sensors as standard, helping to move the world closer to autonomy.",electric vehicles,soyacincau.com

With the hatchbacks, especially in the entry-level segment, seeing lukewarm sales this financial year compared to the pre-COVID times, Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) affirmed that going forward it will be sharpening its focus on Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) across segments than towards small cars run on internal combustion engines (ICE). Besides, it will launch the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) variants of some of the existing petrol-driven models.

“In the second quarter (of this FY), hatchbacks have shown growth, but that is limited to the festival season. I don’t see this segment’s growth continuing subsequent to this quarter and early next year. This simply means the ability of people, whether in urban or rural areas, to buy hatchbacks has eroded. By next year, there will be a degrowth in the hatchback segment,” R.C. Bhargava, Chairman, MSIL, said post Q2 FY2022-23 results announcement.

The country’s largest passenger vehicle-maker stated that sales of entry-level cars will continue to degrow as consumers’ disposable income has reduced due to higher prices and inflationary pressures. However, it must be mentioned that this phenomenon does not seem to have adversely impacted the spending power of buyers who are aiming at SUVs.

Its overall market share, which was at 51 per cent in FY2019, has gone down to 41 per cent during this September quarter.

“The small car segment has been declining (since FY2018-19) and has lost around 26-28 percent of numbers during this period,” added Bhargava.

Maruti Suzuki also acknowledged that volumes in the entry-level car segment are declining as prices have surged due to regulatory requirements around safety and emissions and higher cost of inputs. When asked how the company is planning to re-engineer its small cars in order to comply with safety norms, he maintained that the auto industry body has been discussing this matter with the government.

“The industry is taking up this question as to what would be a realistic date of not only implementation of six airbags, but also of installing the three-point seat belts at the rear seats,” stated the chairman of MSIL.

Meanwhile, MSIL on Friday reported a rise of 334 percent year-on-year (YoY) in standalone net profit at Rs 2,061 crore in Q2 FY23 on the back of record volumes of its newly-launched SUVs, Grand Vitara, and Brezza, during the quarter.

“Compared to the earlier composition, there will be a higher percentage of sales in the upper end of the market compared to the lower end and we will be adapting our product portfolio accordingly,” added Bhargava. However, he didn’t share what kind of models will be introduced. He was also categorical that MSIL had no plans to phase out any small cars from its product portfolio.

MSIL has garnered 75,000 units of confirmed bookings for the Grand Vitara, of which a little over a third (25,500 units) is from strong hybrid variants. So, out of pending orders of 60,000 units, 20,100 units is for the strong hybrid variant (about 34 percent).

“Aggressive product strategy and heightened focus on the SUV segment will undoubtedly help Maruti Suzuki make a strong comeback and regain its lost market share. We have seen in the past too, its ability to understand the market and consumers is unparalleled, and the company has always bounced back with more power and emerged as a winner,” said Puneet Gupta of S&P Automotive.

MSIL, meanwhile, has not given up on the challenge of hitting the two-million sales mark.

“The major determinant of our ability to succeed is semiconductor availability. There is a constraint of semiconductors, fundamentally from one company. And that is affecting four of our models,"" revealed Bhargava.

Bhargava did not concur with the industry perception that Maruti Suzuki is late in foraying into the electric passenger vehicle segment (slated for 2025 roll-out).

""We are localizing the components, looking at the infrastructure development in the country. An electric vehicle customer should not face issues,"" he said.",electric vehicles,moneycontrol

In addition to the 2027 goal, the group wants additional federal government support for electric buses, trucks and other commercial vehicles for Australian business.

Expanding the pool

Labor plans to expand the range of new EV models costing less than $60,000 available in Australia from eight to something closer to the UK’s market, where consumers have at least 26 options.

Last week’s budget included $275 million for construction of a national electric vehicle charging network and EV exemptions from fringe benefits tax and the 5 per cent import tariff.

“We know Australians want the transition to electric vehicles to speed up,” Mr Jafari said. “Our most recent data shows a 65 per cent leap in EV sales over the past year.”

IKEA Australia fulfillment sourcing manager Brendan Groll said consumer transport was just one part of the challenge.

“A strong, national EV strategy with targeted policy for the freight and logistics sector will enable the retail sector to accelerate its contribution to transport emissions reductions, enabling sustainable delivery options for Australians.”

Key crossbenchers including Sydney independents Zali Steggall, Kylea Tink and Sophie Scamps have called for new fuel efficiency standards, as well as for a minimum target of 76 per cent of new cars sold to be electric by 2030.

About 1.5 per cent of cars sold in Australia are electric or hybrid, compared with 17 per cent in the United Kingdom and 85 per cent in Norway.

What is it? A five-door battery-powered SUV. It’s of great interest because it comes from a Chinese brand which, although new to these shores, is vying for the mantle of the world’s biggest EV producer. BYD made 641,000 EVs in the first six months of this year, compared with Tesla’s 564,000 (though to be fair, Tesla’s huge Shanghai plant had to lock down because of COVID-19 in that period).

The Atto 3 includes adaptive cruise, adjustable ambient lighting, electric assist on seats, and more.

What does it cost? A “standard range” Atto 3 is $44,381. The long-range model tested here is $47,381, plus direct on-road costs (there is no “dealer delivery” fee). BYD and fellow Chinese maker MG offer Australia’s cheapest EVs, though in both cases you are still paying a big premium for battery power over internal combustion. More EVs, some potentially cheaper again, should come here from BYD and other Chinese brands during 2023.

What makes it go? A single motor sending 150 kW and 310 Nm to the front wheels. The official WLTP range for the premium model is 480 kilometres.

The BYD Atto 3 looks unremarkable but it has a trick up its sleeve: it can charge other cars and equipment.

Why would you want it? Because it is surprisingly good in many ways, with lavish equipment levels (glass sunroof, good cameras, adaptive cruise, adjustable ambient lighting, electric assist on seats and tailgate, and plenty of tech). The interior is colourful and highly adventurous. The exterior design is modern if unremarkable (and thereby less likely to polarise than the interior). The Atto 3 has vehicle-to-load capabilities, meaning it can power other equipment or even recharge another car, albeit slowly.

Performance is lively enough (the weight is a quite reasonable 1680 kg) though without a Tesla or Polestar-like kick in the back, and the ride is comfortable, particularly in the large and well-shaped front seats. There are three drive modes though none give enough regenerative braking for one-pedal driving. Its BYD-built Blade batteries use a lithium-ion phosphate chemistry, and it looks likely Tesla will use them in some models. The boot is a good size, though there’s no under-bonnet cargo area, which is odd, as there seems to be room with some repositioning of ancillaries.

The build quality is decent, and the equipment levels exceptional for this price.

Why wouldn’t you? Although the Atto 3 is supposedly built on a bespoke EV platform, neither its packaging nor proportions use it to maximum effect. It’s front-drive for a start, which is never a good arrangement for a torquey EV motor. It’s easy to chirp the front wheels, particularly on the cut-price Atlas Batman (!) tyres fitted to our car. The interior space, too, is nothing special for an EV of this size (4455 mm long). The infotainment is pretty basic (there are promises of over-the-air updates), and the information shown on the tiny digital instrument panel will challenge the eyesight of older drivers. The handling’s only so so, and not at all helped by those tyres. And having Build Your Dreams – the extension of the corporate acronym – written across the tailgate is a bit much.

And in conclusion It’s a pleasant surprise how accomplished the Atto 3 is. There are significant caveats: an unknown brand, a troubling warranty (which excludes some major things from its six-year coverage) and a new controversy about whether it can be legally registered as a five-seater. On the other hand, it’s sharply priced for an EV, with decent build quality on the demo car and more equipment than some luxury vehicles at twice the price. It provides another reminder of how big a force the Chinese industry will be on this market in the very near future.",electric vehicles,australian financial review

As California, New York, and other states move to phase out the sale of gasoline-powered cars, public officials routinely echo the Biden administration’s claim that electric vehicles are a “zero emissions” solution that can significantly mitigate the effects of climate change.

TRENDING: Extend 'pandemic amnesty'? The answer is NO

Car and energy experts, however, say there is no such thing as a zero-emissions vehicle: For now and the foreseeable future, the energy required to manufacture and power electric cars will leave a sizable carbon footprint. In some cases hybrids can be cleaner alternatives in states that depend on coal to generate electricity, and some suggest that it may be too rash to write off all internal combustion vehicles just yet.

“I have a friend who drives a Kia he’s had for about 15 years,” said Ashley Nunes, a research fellow at Harvard Law School. “He called me and said, ‘Hey, I’m thinking of buying a Tesla. What do you think?’”

“I said, ‘If you care about the environment, keep the Kia,’” Nunes said.

Nunes’ advice points to the subtle complexities and numerous variables that challenge the reassuringly simple yet overstated promise of electric vehicles. Few dispute that the complete transition to EVs powered by cleaner electricity from renewable energy sources will have a less dire environmental impact than today’s gas-powered automotive fleet. But that low-carbon landscape exists on a distant horizon that’s booby-trapped with obstacles and popular misconceptions.

In the meantime, the growing efforts by governments in this country and abroad to ban people from buying a transportation technology that has shaped modern society for the past century is prompting some electric car advocates to warn against using best-case scenarios to promote unrealistic expectations about the practicalities, costs, and payoffs of EVs.

Adding up the environmental costs and benefits of electric cars requires complex computer modeling to calculate an EV’s lifetime carbon footprint, which depends on a host of assumptions and inputs. The cradle-to-grave analysis must factor in industrial processing, refining, manufacturing, recycling, and electricity generation. The upshot: More greenhouse gases are emitted in the manufacture of EVs than by the drilling, refining, smelting, and assembly for gas-powered cars, which means it can take several years of driving an EV before there is any benefit to the climate.

The linchpin of the EV revolution is California’s 100% ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars, SUVs, and light trucks, which is scheduled to go into full effect in 2035 and expected to be adopted by other states. California’s mandate includes a phased-in ban on the sale of new hybrids, which only recently were considered technological marvels. California will restrict the sale of plug-in hybrids to just 20% of total EV sales, a significant cap for low-emissions vehicles that are nearly as popular with environmentally conscious California consumers as all-electric EVs.

But public demand is lagging, and until that changes, governments will have to incentivize consumers to buy electric cars. Currently EVs appeal to a narrow demographic: affluent, educated, coastal, and liberal, with the highest enthusiasm among 35- to 45-year-olds, according to research by James Archsmith, who researches energy and environmental economics at the University of Maryland, and his co-authors. Their research concludes that under some scenarios, achieving a 50% market share for EVs in 2035 would require paying subsidies in excess of $30,000 per electric car, totaling in the trillions of dollars, and that achieving more modest penetration targets could cost public treasuries in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

The electric car’s biggest disadvantage on greenhouse gas emissions is the production of an EV battery, which requires energy-intensive mining and processing, and generates twice as much carbon emissions as the manufacture of an internal combustion engine. This means that the EV starts off with a bigger carbon footprint than a gasoline-powered car when it rolls off the assembly line and takes time to catch up to a gasoline-powered car.

One of the big unknowns is whether EV batteries will have to be replaced. While the EV industry says battery technology is improving so that degradation is limited, if that assurance proves overly optimistic and auto warranties have to replace expensive battery packs, the new battery would create a second carbon footprint that the EV would have to work off over time, partially erasing the promised greenhouse-gas benefits.

With governments now in the business of mandating electric vehicles, the battery challenge assumes a global scale. The majority of lithium-ion batteries are produced in China, where most electricity comes from coal-burning power plants.

The process of mining critical minerals is sometimes described in language that evokes strip mining and fracking, an inconvenient truth that is beginning to attract notice. “Electric cars and renewable energy may not be as green as they appear,” a 2021 New York Times article noted. “Production of raw materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel that are essential to these technologies are often ruinous to land, water, wildlife and people.” The Times has also warned that with global demand for electric vehicles projected to grow sixfold by 2030, “the dirty origins of this otherwise promising green industry have become a looming crisis.”

To address this disquieting dependency on a foreign power, the United States and other nations are seeking to break China’s near-monopoly on battery production. The Inflation Reduction Act states that under a phase-in starting in 2024, EVs with battery components or critical minerals sourced from “a foreign entity of concern,” which includes China, can’t qualify for the maximum allowable tax credit of $7,500. The United States is pumping in more than $100 billion to create an entire industry in this country. Just last week, President Biden announced the American Battery Materials Initiative, awarding more than $2.8 billion for 20 battery manufacturing and processing plants to develop and produce domestic lithium, graphite, nickel, silicon oxide, plus critical components and facilities.

Over time, a typical EV will catch up and outperform gas-powered cars on greenhouse gas reductions, because electric cars are cleaner to drive. But the amount of mileage that must be driven for the EV to break even on CO2 emissions depends on a host of assumptions and variables. Some researchers say that the EV’s emissions benefits are vastly overstated – by 600%, according to one study – because the variables used for comparison make an EV look better on paper than it performs in real-life situations.

All of these CO2 metrics could come into play in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s recently proposed rule that would require publicly traded companies to disclose the greenhouse gas emissions they produce directly, as well emissions produced indirectly through their supply chains around the world. While the implications aren’t clear yet, the new rule could standardize CO2 disclosures and transparency on EV carbon impacts, but some say that such calculations are nearly impossible for global contractors, and automakers would have to rely on the same kinds of estimates and modeling that are used now. Echoing a common concern, EV battery maker Nikola Corp. told the SEC that “some climate data is not readily available, complete, or definitive.”

As a result of these uncertainties, many consumers don’t understand the complexity of these analyses and may assume that their electric cars are literally zero-emissions, or that what matters most is that EVs are better for the environment and the precise degree is not that important.

Zeb Hallock, president of Tesla Owners Club of NC Triangle in Raleigh, said in an email exchange that he and his wife both drive Teslas, a Model S that replaced a Nissan 350Z in 2014 and a Model 3 that replaced a Toyota Prius in 2018. The Hallocks’ Teslas are charged at home at a cost that he estimates is equivalent to paying 47 cents for a gallon of gasoline. He said by email that the public supercharger network “in some areas of the country can rival the cost of gasoline,” but this is not a concern because the Hallocks do most of their charging at home.

When asked about the greenhouse gas deficit of electric cars, Hallock speculated that most EV owners believe the carbon footprint of an EV is minimal and they don’t think much about it. “A small number of owners don't care at all about environmental benefits and purchased a Tesla for the superior performance and the fact that it's American made and uses cheap domestic fuel,” he said. EVs: Centerpiece of the Agenda

But in the universe of climate activism, purported environmental benefits make EVs the international centerpiece of meeting the 2015 Paris Climate Accords to limit the rise of global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial levels. Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gases in the United States, accounting for more than a quarter of all CO2 emissions, and more than half of those emissions come from passenger cars, pickup trucks and SUVs that are now being slated for replacement by electric vehicles.

EV advocates are optimistic that in the coming decades electric cars will become cleaner as power grids are ""decarbonized"" and the industrialized world reduces its reliance on CO2-spewing fossil fuels, primarily coal and natural gas. Exactly how much cleaner is not easy to pinpoint. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, about 60% of the nation’s electricity was generated from coal and gas in 2021. In its Annual Energy Outlook, the agency projects those two fossil fuels will generate 44% of U.S. electricity by 2050.

But those percentages can be misleading. Even as the relative fuel proportions change over time, overall electricity demand is going up, so the total amount of fossil fuels actually burned in the mid-21st century goes down by only about 5%, according to EIA estimates. Future greenhouse gas emissions will depend on the number of EVs on the road and how electricity is generated, and those forecasts swing wildly. The EIA forecasts a mere 18.9 million EVs on U.S. roads in 2050, which is very conservative compared with advocacy group EVAdoption’s prediction of more than 25 million EVs on U.S. roads by 2030, only eight years away. BloombergNEF forecasts 125 million EVs on U.S. roads in 2040, up from 1.61 million at the end of last year, which would constitute about half the cars in this country.

“They're making these forecasts that are basically licking your finger and sticking it up in the air,” David Rapson, a professor of energy economics at the University of California, Davis, who analyzes electric vehicle policy, said about California forecasts, which also applies more broadly. “Nobody knows what's going to happen.""

“To think that we are going to completely eliminate these by far dominant sources of energy and transportation services in our economy in the next 13 years is a fairy tale,"" said Rapson, who has authored papers challenging optimistic projections.

“They want to articulate a vision of hope and ambition that is pushing society towards a solution to climate change,"" Rapson said. ""That vision is going to run into massive constraints.""

Rapson, who believes the state’s unrealistic goals will still advance EV adoption even if they fall short of their targets, said the California Air Resources Board regulations come with a huge loophole: In their current form they don’t prevent the buying and selling of used cars, and they don’t prevent California residents from buying a new gasoline car in another state. The rules could be modified in future years to make it costly to register new cars bought out of state, but in their current form they create an escape valve for citizens who resist electric cars.

Even in the trendsetting auto market of California, which accounts for 40% of all EV purchases in this country, EVs accounted for only 12.5% of all car sales last year, and represent less than 2% of all the cars in the state, indicating that gasoline automobiles remain more popular. Banning the sale of new gas-powered cars “will likely be a boon to that industry and to used-car dealers in the state,” predicts James Sallee, an energy economist at UC-Berkeley.

He predicts that California’s mandate will only make gasoline vehicles more valuable, as people hold on to them and extend their lifetimes through care and maintenance, the unintended consequence of government policy making something scarce.

California Air Resources Board regulations would fine automakers $20,000 for each combustion engine car sold in violation of the restrictions, but residents could get around the EV mandate by buying used gasoline cars in the state and new gasoline cars out of state, unless California tightens its regulations to disincentivize its residents from buying the cars they prefer to own.

“As currently constructed,” Sallee wrote, “California residents would be free to import ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles from out of state, even after the mandate is fully phased in.”

Despite the skeptical outlook of some EV researchers, the general tone of EV advocates is marked by enthusiasm and optimism. According to David Reichmuth, a senior engineer in the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Clean Transportation Program, the motives of EV critics are often tainted: “Some of the opposition will come from auto companies that want to delay the transition to electric vehicles, but others will be from fossil fuel interests or climate deniers.”

In his blog, Reichmuth noted: “The important thing is that you know that this is familiar and worn-out disinformation, designed to sow doubt and confusion.”

“There’s some questions about how quickly can we get there, and there’s a lot of details that will get worked out,” Reichmuth said in phone interview.

“But if you look at the big picture – if the [auto] industry says that’s where we’re going, if the climate science says that’s where we need to go, and you look at other countries around the world that are going in the same direction, too – it does seem really likely that we can make this work.”

Despite the obstacles, the Union of Concerned Scientists predicts that California’s new EV regulations will result in about half the cars in the state in 2035 being “zero-emission” models, increasing to nearly 90% of cars on California roads by 2045.

The Union’s analysis undercuts its claim of zero emissions. Running the numbers on the mileage it takes for an EV to become cleaner than a new gasoline sedan in terms of burning off its CO2 deficit and pulling ahead in greenhouse gas reductions, the organization determined this summer that an EV’s break-even point is 21,300 miles, or 22 months, based on average annual driving. For pickup trucks, the EV pickup pulls ahead at 17,500 miles, or 17 months, when compared to the average new gasoline pickup truck.

Those calculations are consistent with a Wall Street Journal analysis conducted last year by University of Toronto researchers, who determined that a 2021 Tesla Model 3, with an 82 kWh battery, would have to drive 20,600 miles to break even on greenhouse gas emissions with a 2021 Toyota RAV4 with a 30 mpg rating.

Reuters conducted a similar analysis and got much more favorable results. Reuters last year concluded that a Tesla Model 3 would need to drive just 13,500 miles to exceed the CO2 emissions benefits of a Toyota Corolla. The Reuters analysis crunched the numbers on a Tesla with a 54 kWh battery, considerably smaller than the Tesla power pack in the WSJ analysis, producing less greenhouse gas emissions during mining, processing, and assembly. Still, Reuters noted that in countries like China and Poland, where coal is the primary energy source used to generate electricity, the same Tesla 3 with the smaller battery would have to be driven 78,700 miles to reach carbon parity with the Corolla, showing how much difference a power grid’s fuel mix can make.

Not all studies are that kind to EVs. Some automakers, such as Swedish manufacturers Volvo and Polestar, have run their own numbers based on what they call conservative, precautionary estimates that suggest the payback period even under ideal conditions – 100% renewable wind energy – would be much longer: about 30,000 miles of driving. The payback would be closer to 70,000 miles in parts of the world where the power plant energy mix includes dirty fossil fuels. The expected lifespan of the Swedish cars in these studies is about 125,000 miles, which means that some drivers will reap greenhouse gas benefits for only half their electric vehicle’s expected usage.

One of the least understood factors that determine an EV’s greenhouse gas benefits is the alternative vehicle to which the EV is compared. Some researchers have noted that this “reference vehicle” is often a hypothetical car that gives the EV an illusory advantage.

“To our knowledge, there is not an awareness of the importance of these modeling choices, despite the large implied emission abatement differences,” UC-Davis energy economist Rapson and colleague Erich Muehlegger wrote in a recent paper. They contend that the EV is typically compared to the U.S. “fleet average,” a statistical composite that averages out the fuel efficiency of all cars purchased in a given year, including SUVs and pickup trucks.

But that’s not what happens in real life. Rapson and Muehlegger found that Californians who took advantage of financial incentives to buy Teslas would likely have bought plug-in hybrids or conventional hybrids without the incentive, not an average car or a gas guzzler, and comparing a Tesla to the average car skews the results. They contend that as a result of the sloppy comparison, the CO2 benefits of Teslas are overestimated by 600% in California. That overestimate would be considerably higher in parts of the country where the EVs are charged with less clean electricity derived from a higher mix of fossil fuels. Cleaner Gasoline Cars

The cleaner the car that the EV is replacing, the longer it takes the EV to catch up on CO2 emissions, and the existing gas car in the garage can be optimal because a new gas car comes with a carbon footprint from metals processing and manufacturing.

That’s why Nunes, the Harvard Law fellow, advised his friend to keep his Kia. Nunes was comparing the greenhouse gas effects of a new Tesla to a 15-year-old Kia that’s driven only about 4,000 miles a year, and concluded that at that rate it would take his friend more than a decade to burn off the Tesla’s carbon footprint.

According to research by Nunes and others, many EV owners use their electric car as a secondary vehicle, logging fewer miles and requiring more time to break even on CO2 emissions. Comparing four different scenarios, he concluded that the requisite break-even mileage for an EV with an 85 kWh battery is either 28,069 miles or 68,160 miles, and it would take the EV owner between 2.73 and 10.49 years to drive that distance, depending on a variety of circumstances. In all of Nunes’ scenarios, the alternative to buying an EV was either buying a new gasoline car or driving the old gas car.

Another major factor is the CO2 level of the electricity used to power EVs. The U.S. Department of Energy concludes that hybrids are actually cleaner than EVs in six states, but the key to that analysis is that it’s based on combining all the energy sources – such as natural gas, hydropower, wind farms – used to make electricity in those states. Another way of assessing the environmental impact of EVs is to look at the extra demand EVs put on a regional power grid, requiring power generation that comes primarily from fossil fuels. From this perspective, assuming more coal-fired and natural gas-burning electricity added to the grid, hybrids would generate less CO2 than EVs in several dozen states, according to a recent study.

“It’s long past the time to retire the phrase ‘zero emissions,’” said Tristan Burton, a computational mathematician who co-authored that study. “If you market something as a zero emissions vehicle, then people out there will think it’s really zero emissions.”

But critics say the project's main purpose is to help President Erdogan secure another term.

Turkey has undertaken a range of political and economic measures to boost its independence from other countries in recent years. Now, it is ushering in a major breakthrough for its automobile industry. The first ever Turkish-developed, Turkish-made car — by Turkey's Automobile Joint Venture Group (TOGG) — is going into production.

The new TOGG car factory began operating on October 29. The date carries a clear message as it marks the 99th anniversary of the foundation of the Turkish Republic.

TOGG was first founded in 2018 for the purpose of making Turkey more independent from foreign carmakers. ""It is an important step contributing to the rise of Turkey's car industry,"" according to Emre Özpeynirci, a journalist and automotive expert, who has been closely following the TOGG project.

Plans are for 175,000 cars to be built each year Image: Mustafa Kamaci/AA/picture alliance

The plan for next year is to manufacture some 17,000 to 18,000 electric vehicles at TOGG's factory near Istanbul. The site is designed for a capacity of up to 175,000 cars annually, a target that decision-makers want to reach in the next five years.

Public divided over TOGG

Even though the TOGG factory is beginning production now, it will be a while before the vehicles reach the market. The company projects that the first cars will be ready by March 2023 — a few months ahead of the presidential election.

On June 18 next year, voters will decide whether to keep Erdogan in office or pick someone new to succeed him.

The TOGG car success or failure could influence the vote, as the vehicle is widely seen as a prestige project by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The TOGG automobile has been promoted as the ""people's car."" Indeed, when the project was first launched by Erdogan, people ""expected this would be a car affordable to everyone in Turkey,"" says Özpeynirci.

Critics of President Erdogan und his party, the AKP, are certain he is using TOGG to boost his chances of re-election. ""Of course investments like these are always supported by the state, but if there are political tensions, this will harm the project before [a single] car is even built,"" says Özpeynirci.

""It is a big problem, this car polarizes [opinions],"" says Özpeynirci.

Neither affordable nor practical?

TOGG plans selling its SUV at 900,000 Turkish lira (roughly 50,000€), which is unaffordable for most people in Turkey. Özpeynirci says ordinary consumers could invest no more than 500,000 lira for a new car. In one or two years, a more affordable model will follow.

The high retail price might not be the only disappointment in store for potential buyers. Turkey also lacks the necessary infrastructure for the owners of electric vehicles.

""Turkey's infrastructure is not yet ready to make the switch to e-cars,"" says Automotive Data CEO Hüsamettin Yalçın. Ordinary people, according to Yalçın, should not have to worry about whether there will be enough charging stations en route from Ankara to Istanbul.

While TOGG vehicles are designed and assembled in Turkey, components like batteries, engines and some electric systems are imported. To date, 51% of materials used to build the vehicles are Turkish-made. Industry minister Mustafa Varank has said he wants to raise this to 65% in coming years.

For now, TOGG cars are designed for the domestic market rather foreign buyers. This stems partly from the combination of components used to build the car, which drive up production costs, says Özpeynirci. He says if TOGG succeeds in using 70% Turkish made components, its cars will become competitive internationally.

The government wants EVs to account for 30% of anticipated vehicle production in 2030.

The Excise Department is mulling a subsidy to support the production of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, aiming to reduce the price of EVs, says director-general Ekniti Nitithanprapas.

He said the price of the battery accounts for around 50% of an EV's total price. The subsidy is meant to make EV prices more competitive with fossil fuel-powered vehicles.

The department's consideration of a battery subsidy follows the government's recent launch of tax and subsidy measures to support EV usage. It has yet to finalise a subsidy amount for the battery scheme, Mr Ekniti said.

The department is contemplating many options for the measure, including providing a subsidy for the entire production process, starting from the use of raw materials to the end-production process, he said. Another option is to subsidise the price of the whole battery.

Mr Ekniti said a subsidy is in line with the government's recent focus on clean energy. These batteries can also be used in other industries.

In addition, the department is considering a measure to handle EV battery waste in the future, he said.

The government wants EVs to account for 30% or 600,000-700,000 units of total anticipated vehicle production by 2030.

This means a large number of EV batteries will be in use and when discarded, these batteries could affect the environment, said Mr Ekniti.

The government's recent tax subsidy for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) covers passenger cars with no more than 10 seats and a maximum recommended retail price of 2 million baht.

BEVs with a battery capacity of 10-30 kilowatt-hours (kWh) receive a subsidy of 70,000 baht per unit.

BEVs with a battery capacity of 30kWh or higher receive a subsidy of 150,000 baht per unit.

The government also provides a subsidy of 150,000 baht for locally produced BEV pickups with a maximum recommended retail price of 2 million baht and a battery capacity of 30kWh or higher.

A BEV motorcycle with a maximum recommended retail price of 150,000 baht can receive a subsidy of 18,000 baht.

This BEV subsidy measure has registered 25,000 units.

A total of 10 BEV manufacturers have signed up for this 2.9-billion-baht subsidy scheme. Participants are required to sell discounted BEVs to consumers.

Last week Mr Ekniti said the department will begin offering this subsidy in the first quarter of next year, covering 500 units.",electric vehicles,bangkok post

Experts in car removal, Melbourne-based auto recyclers It Matters To You, explains why this is a significant step toward a greener auto industry.

Research is increasingly revealing that the way forward towards sustainability in the automotive sector in Australia is not by way of electric vehicles as was once thought, explains It Matters To You. Instead, experts are pushing for an uptake of green hydrogen fuel, which requires a much lower volume of rare earth materials to manufacture and releases significantly fewer carbon emissions than electric vehicle manufacturing has been proven to.

Although the technology required to mass produce green hydrogen exists and is readily available, governments have been slow to implement it. Clara Energy and H2FA have taken matters into their own hands and are now developing their own refuelling sites, one in Truganina, Victoria, and the other in Tarcutta, New South Wales, which is halfway between Sydney and Melbourne.

It Matters To You reports that a representative from H2FA stated that this move will ""decarbonise heavy freight and ultimately lead to the complete displacement of diesel for green hydrogen."" The building of these refuelling sites will be the first time Australia has produced and distributed green hydrogen at this scale, marking a significant step towards sustainability for the industry.

The Tarcutta refuelling station is set to open in 2025 and will be powered primarily by solar energy. Four more hydrogen refuelling sites are planned along the Hume Highway between Victoria and Sydney and will help Australia along its way to net zero.

By being highly competitive in the industry and expanding its customer base, I believe the company can increase its market share in the coming years, which can ultimately expand its profit margins. Observing the current market trends and growing demand for EVs, I think the company's growth can sustain for a longer period of time as the automotive revolution can cause drastic changes in the automobile industry in this decade. After considering all these factors, I believe this acquisition can act as a primary catalyst to accelerate the company's growth by enhancing its capabilities in the competitive market.

What is the Main Risk Faced by APTV?

Availability of Raw Material

The company uses various raw materials for production, such as electronic components, semiconductors, petroleum-based resins, chemicals, copper, and other materials. Reasons such as mechanical breakdowns, strikes, fires, explosions, electrical outages, or logistical complications due to climate change, weather, delayed customs processing, and natural disasters can cause disruptions in the supply of such raw materials and increase the raw material prices. Also, this disruption can lead to decreased production and shipping levels, which could increase its operating cost and further stress the company's profit margins. Additionally, if there is a delay in delivery, the customers can seek to recoup all of their expenses from the company, which can lead to a reduction in profit margins.

Valuation

Recently, the company acquired Interconnect Solutions which can enhance the capabilities of the company in the coming years. I think this acquisition can drive growth and strengthen APTV's position in a competitive market. After considering all these factors, I estimate the company's EPS for FY2023 to be $5.08, giving the forward P/E ratio of 17.82x. The forward P/E ratio of the company is higher compared to its sector median of 12.98x. However, the company has always shown a tendency to trade above the sector median, as APTV's 5-year average P/E ratio is 32.95x. The rising demand in the market for the automotive market can lead to a rise in raw material costs and put pressure on profit margins. Hence, I think the company might trade below its 5-year average in the coming years. After considering all these factors, I estimate the company might trade at a P/E ratio of 27.5x, giving the price target of $139.70, representing a 54.3% upside from the current share price of $90.54.

Conclusion

The electric vehicle market is expected to grow to a large extent in this decade which has intensified competition in the industry. Identifying the need to compete in the market, the company has recently announced the acquisition of an 85% equity stake in Intercable Automotive Solutions. Its capabilities can benefit the company to gain a competitive advantage and further accelerate its growth. The company is exposed to the risk of supply chain disruptions which can further increase raw material prices and decrease production levels. The forward P/E ratio of the company is higher compared to its sector median of 12.98x. However, the company has always shown a tendency to trade above the sector median, as APTV's 5-year average P/E ratio is 32.95x. After analyzing all the above factors, I assign a buy for APTV.",electric vehicles,seeking alpha

""India is a growing market and there is a huge business potential here. For most of the abroad, this is a good market to enter into. It is a wise decision for any company to come to India,"" Hisashi Takeuchi, MD, on the Tata-Airbus project

Over the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat initiative taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Takeuchi said, ""Two months back in August, in Gujarat we marked 40 years of Suzuki Motor Corporation in India.. like this setup and what we can say is .. this is a collaboration of Japanese working culture and Indian working culture and the match is perfect. I hope that this kind of good matching will help the industry to grow further.""

Speaking further on future plans of Suzuki in India, he said, ""We have expanded our Gujarat operations with EV production and battery factory we set up in Gujarat. Also at the same time, in Harayana's Kharkhoda we have already started construction of our new factory there.""

As India-Japan ties touch 70 years, MD highlighted, ""We are celebrating 70 years of our cooperation. We have a long history of progression between the two countries. The combination of these two cultures is a good match and will be strengthened further in future.""

On the bullet train project in Gujarat, he said, ""Bullet train project in Gujarat is a very very important project. It's a national project and Japan is strongly supporting it. I am hoping that it becomes a huge success.""

This comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of C-295 transport aircraft manufacturing facility in Gujarat's Vadodara Sunday.

Earlier, Lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong leadership, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida attributed the success of Maruti Suzuki to the people and the Indian government.

While attending an event virtually in Gujarat's Gandhinagar to mark 40 years of Suzuki Motor Corporation in India, the Japanese PM Fumio Kishida Minister, ""We owe the success of Maruti Suzuki to the support of the people and government of India. Recently the Indian economic growth has been further accelerating due to various assistance measures for the manufacturing sector, guided by the strong leadership of PM Modi.""

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the success of Maruti-Suzuki signifies the strong India-Japan partnership. PM Modi on Sunday laid the foundation stone of the Maruti Suzuki Vehicle Manufacturing Facility for Haryana and Suzuki EV Battery Plant for Hansalpur in Gujarat at the event in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.

Recalling former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to take India-Japan ties to another level, Prime Minister said, ""In the last eight years, this relationship between our two countries has reached new heights.""

""Today, from the bullet train in Gujarat-Maharashtra to the Rudraksha centre in Banaras, many development projects are examples of Indo-Japan friendship. And when it comes to this friendship, every Indian definitely remembers our friend, former Prime Minister Late Shinzo Abe.""

He expressed hope that in continuation of Abe's legacy, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will take forward the relationship between the two nations. ""When Abe Shan came to Gujarat, the time he spent here is fondly remembered by the people of Gujarat. Today PM Kishida is taking forward the efforts he made to bring our countries closer,"" PM Modi said.

PM Modi stressed that the relations that exist between Gujarat and Japan have always been higher than only diplomatic ties. ""I remember when the Vibrant Gujarat Summit was started in 2009, since then Japan has been associated with it as a partner country,"" the Prime Minister said.

""The success of Maruti-Suzuki also signifies the strong India-Japan partnership. In the last eight years, these relations between our two countries have reached new heights,"" he added.The Prime Minister further spoke extensively about the benefits of electric vehicles. ""One of the great features of electric vehicles is that they are silent. Be it a 2-wheeler or a 4-wheeler, they don't make any noise. This silence is not only about its engineering, but it is also the beginning of a silent revolution in the country.""

India has announced in COP-26 that it will achieve 50 PC of its installed electrical capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030 and we have set a 'Net Zero' target for 2070, PM Modi added.

PM Modi was present along with Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel to mark the 40th anniversary of Suzuki in India.

307,The Electricity Is Too Damn High,https://washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nov-22-ElectricCar-Goozner.jpg,30/10/2022,"High prices at corporate-owned EV charging stations could cripple the spread of climate-friendly transportation. We need to help the mom-and-pops compete.
The post The Electricity Is Too Damn High appeared first on Washington Monthly.",http://washingtonmonthly.com/2022/10/30/the-electricity-is-too-damn-high/,"Electric vehicle owners face a gnawing fear every time they take a long road trip. Will they run out of juice before finding the next charging station? That fear has a name: range anxiety.

During my first long trip in an EV earlier this year, range anxiety was a real concern. While I found charging stations using PlugShare, a trip-planning smartphone app, my new car came dangerously close to running out of power before I reached one in the parking garage at a fancy shopping mall, less than a mile off the interstate. My wife and I enjoyed a relaxing meal at the food court while the charger took 40 minutes to refill the car’s battery.

But I had a new worry as I pulled away from the electron pump. The roadside charging station, run by the for-profit company EVgo, charged nearly three times the price I pay for electricity at home. During two charging sessions (coming and going), the station charged an average of 45 cents per kilowatt hour in addition to the $5 monthly fee I had to pay for their “low cost” plan. The average residential rate for electricity in the U.S. is under 14 cents per kilowatt hour. Compared to $4.50 per gallon for gasoline, my EPA-rated 112 MPG-equivalent EV was getting about 40 miles per gallon on the road, significantly less than the hybrid I had just traded in.

Unless that price comes down significantly, the U.S. will have a difficult time meeting the Biden administration’s goal of EVs reaching 50 percent of vehicle sales by 2030. The recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act contain tens of billions of dollars in new incentives to help people buy EVs. It established a major program to build a network of charging stations across the U.S. and plans to invest a substantial share of the money in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The auto industry is betting heavily on a rapid shift toward EV adoption. Every major car company is building new assembly and battery plants.

The auto industry is betting heavily on a rapid shift toward EV adoption. But will people buy EVs if the price per mile at the electron pump is no different than what they pay at the gasoline pump now?

But will people buy EVs if the price per mile at the electron pump is no different than what they pay at the gasoline pump now? Tens of millions of American households will not have the chance to charge at home, where electricity prices allow owners of energy-efficient EVs to shave two-thirds of the cost off their daily commute. They will be dependent on the private operators of the new charging stations.

Deploying EVs quickly and broadly is mandatory if we’re to succeed in slowing global warming. It will establish the U.S. as the leading competitor in the emerging global EV manufacturing industry, which China now dominates. But the key to achieving those laudatory goals is ensuring that the pocketbooks of middle- and lower-income Americans are taken into account as we make the switch.

Right now, the emerging policy framework is ignoring price. But there’s still time to change course—by encouraging small businesses, nonprofits, and local governments to compete with national chains in the EV charging station market, and by directing state utility commissions to establish rate structures that lower prices at the electron pump.

The people without an at-home charging option will include those without off-street parking; those who live in homes without garages or who can’t afford to upgrade their homes to accommodate the 240-volt line needed for at-home charging; those who live in buildings where landlords or condo associations won’t or can’t afford to install the necessary infrastructure; and those whose employers don’t set up workplace charging stations. This group, disproportionately poor and working class, may decide to leave the lower-priced EV models that will soon be rolling off assembly lines sitting on dealer lots. Why switch when the price of the daily commute or around-town travel stays the same?

“If we want to expand access to EVs to folks with lower incomes, price really matters,” John Howat, a senior policy analyst for the National Consumer Law Center, told me. “Whether it’s through state attorneys general or some other regulatory entity, it is appropriate to ensure that the price of electricity is affordable for drivers and the charging companies don’t realize a windfall profit.”

Early next year, state highway departments will begin doling out $5 billion in federal construction grants to finance up to 80 percent of the cost of building new fast-charging stations along the nation’s interstates and other major highways. Another $2.5 billion is available for grants to build stations away from these major corridors, with a special emphasis on disadvantaged neighborhoods and rural areas.

The impetus for the initial program is to eliminate the range anxiety on long-distance trips that inhibits many would-be EV buyers. There are only 6,000 fast-charging stations in the U.S. today. The federal program is a down payment on the estimated $35 billion that must be invested in 1.2 million open-to-the-public chargers by 2030 to meet expected demand, according to a McKinsey & Co. report.

The U.S. Department of Transportation’s proposed rule for the expanded network, released last June, says the new chargers should be “convenient, affordable, reliable and equitable.” The rule requires standardization of plug-in ports and convenient methods for payment. Ports must also work 97 percent of the time, which has been a huge problem for the nascent industry. A recent study of chargers in the San Francisco Bay Area found that nearly a quarter of the region’s 657 chargers were out of order.

The rule also sets Buy America guidelines for the equipment and requires union-like wages for the work. And, in line with President Joe Biden’s Justice40 executive order, it establishes the goal of investing 40 percent of the money in disadvantaged and rural communities.

But to meet the law’s affordability goals, the Department of Transportation, run by the former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, limited its proposed guidance to pricing transparency, claiming that this will “protect the public from price gouging.” The comments on the proposed rule from the companies running the existing charging networks—the ones most likely to take advantage of the government grants—suggest that they have other priorities.

“We strongly urge the government to avoid a state-by-state price regulation system,” Tesla and EVgo, which run two of the largest existing charging networks, and ChargePoint, which operates 1,500 stations and sells equipment for charging stations, said in a joint statement. “While we recognize the public investment at the heart of the program, it has also been designed to support, not supplant, an existing competitive market.

“The current economics of EV charging, driven largely by EV adoption, rely heavily on recouping capital investments over the useful life of chargers as utilization increases. Potential state limits on this return would chill private investment,” they wrote.

In plainer language: The price of filling up an EV battery at the new, government-funded stations is going to depend on how fast the venture capitalists and other investors can generate positive returns on their portion of the investment in a nationwide EV charging station network. Those pricing priorities could mean that anyone who visits a privately owned charging station, even if it is built substantially with government funds, will wind up paying electricity prices much closer to the current price of gasoline than to what they would pay if they could charge their car at home.

Failure to bring those prices down will eliminate one of the biggest incentives for rapid adoption of EVs, which all the major car companies are banking on. New EV prices are expected to fall dramatically over the next few years as battery technology improves. Early adopters ditching their old EVs for newer models will soon create a robust used EV market. More importantly, new incentives will make those used EVs more affordable for lower-income Americans, who will be allowed to use tax credits to purchase used EVs next year. And the law allows the credits to be taken directly off the price at the car lot.

But if the day-to-day cost of operating those vehicles is no different than the cost of their existing internal combustion engine cars, why should they bother to make the switch? Sure, there are reduced maintenance costs. But few people think about those kinds of long-term expenses.

As we saw earlier this year when gasoline prices surged, what people care about most are their immediate fuel costs. For a family that drives 13,500 miles per year, the U.S. average, buying a new or used EV and paying 20 cents per kilowatt hour, which is half the rate currently charged at many private EV charging stations (and would still be 46 percent more than the average cost of home-based charging), would save about $700 a year compared to paying $4 per gallon for gasoline. To put that in perspective: Reasonable prices at the electron pump will save the average four-person family who buys a new or used EV enough money on annual fuel costs to pay their grocery bills for more than a month.

Why is the price so high? To answer that question requires a quick primer on EV charging. There are four levels of charging. If you plug your EV into a standard 120-volt wall socket (Level 1 charging), it takes about two days to bring a 300-mile range EV from under 20 percent to 80 percent full, which manufacturers recommend for prolonging battery life. No EV owner who plans to use their car for a daily commute can get by with just a home-based Level 1 charger.

Install a 240-volt line at home (Level 2), and charging time drops to five or six hours—adequate for almost all home charging needs. If their local utility offers residential time-of-day pricing, drivers can save money by charging overnight.

For long-distance travel, commercial EV fast chargers (Level 3) use higher-voltage direct current, which reduces charging time to under an hour. Installing superfast chargers (Level 4) reduces charging time to under 15 minutes. The initial aim of the government program is to build a national network of Level 3 and 4 chargers. The estimated cost for building Level 3 or 4 charging stations with at least four ports ranges from $300,000 to $1 million.

Yet commercial operators of EV stations with Level 3 and 4 chargers say the cost of construction isn’t the major reason for their higher rates. Rather, they claim that their prices are driven by the high rates utilities charge them for electricity, which include the additional demand charge that regulated utilities levy on all commercial and industrial customers. Utility demand charges, which are based on the peak electricity usage during a billing period, are designed to ensure that utilities have adequate resources to build and maintain the generating capacity needed to avoid blackouts when demand peaks. But unlike factories, shopping malls, or commercial office buildings, whose peak demands for power extend over many hours and occur on predictable schedules, peak demand at a charging station occurs sporadically; it may take place only a few times a day, for brief periods of time.

“Rate reform is essential to making the charging industry economically viable,” says Matthew Nelson, the director of government affairs for Electrify America, the Volkswagen subsidiary that currently operates 800 EV fast-charging stations across the U.S. and has plans to open 1,000 more by 2026. The company agreed to invest $2 billion in EV charging stations as part of its 2016 settlement with the United States and California for cheating on diesel emissions. “There are some markets where the cost of electricity is above $10 a gallon of gas equivalent,” Nelson told me.

Numerous state utility commissions are considering rate reforms, and Colorado has already made changes. ComEd, which serves the Chicago area, has submitted a plan to the Illinois Commerce Commission that “would help alleviate the upfront cost of installing new charging infrastructure by offering an alternative to demand-based rates,” a spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

But there is also a technological solution, which would not only lower rates but also help reduce the need for new generating capacity to meet EV demand. The new EV stations could install large storage batteries, which are already commercially available and are an allowable construction expense under the Transportation Department’s proposed rule. Storage batteries could be charged late at night when electricity is cheapest and stations see little use, and then drawn down when EV driver demand is at its peak, thus avoiding high demand charges.

In addition to price, mass adoption of EVs will depend on deploying charging stations convenient to where people without access to home-based charging live and work, making them as ubiquitous as gas stations are today. That will require convincing landlords, high-rises with multistory parking lots, shopping and strip mall operators, employers, churches—indeed, anyone with a large parking lot—to install appropriately sized charging stations with a mix of Level 2 and Level 3 ports. Existing gas station franchisees, most of whose profits come from selling soda, candy, and cigarettes, not gasoline, might also be willing participants if someone helps them get into the mix.

Getting these stations built will be especially important in lower-income neighborhoods where there will be fewer home chargers. The infrastructure bill addressed that need by including an additional $2.5 billion for non–highway corridor EV station building grants.

While for-profit networks like EVgo and Electrify America will be the likely operators of many highway corridor stations, it remains an open question who will take advantage of the additional grant money, especially since much of it will be earmarked for disadvantaged communities. To date, most of the big retailers that have set up charging stations, like Whole Foods and Walmart, have partnered with the for-profits.

Reasonable prices at the electron pump will save the average four-person family who buys an EV enough on annual fuel costs to pay their grocery bills for over a month.

That doesn’t have to be the case. The U.S. has a long tradition of nonprofits getting into the electricity game, ranging from the municipally owned utilities set up during the Progressive Era to the massive rural electrification and hydroelectric dam projects built during the Great Depression. Today, more than 2,000 cities and towns in 49 states draw their power from publicly owned utilities. The one in seven Americans who live in those communities enjoy rates that are 4 percent lower on average than surrounding communities served by their for-profit counterparts, according to the American Public Power Association.

The Biden administration’s infrastructure and climate change bills have provided a golden opportunity to open the next chapter in that story. City and town governments and nonprofit neighborhood economic development and housing groups are well positioned to take advantage of the flood of money about to pour into the nation’s EV charging infrastructure. They know the local employers, landlords, retailers, churches, schools, and empty lots that can provide convenient sites. State governments looking to incentivize EV adoption can help them come up with the 20 percent match funds that are needed to draw the federal grants.

With no-cost capital and sharply reduced demand charges, these nonprofits could offer electric charging at half the price currently being charged by the for-profit chains, and still have sufficient cash to maintain and service their stations after paying their electricity bills. They will go a long way toward helping the Biden administration meet its Justice40 goals. And they will provide competition to the for-profit charging industry, which will lower rates for all drivers when they hit the road.

But the time to act is now. The Biden administration has already approved the EV charging station programs outlined by the states, which are now preparing their program rollouts. You can bet that the for-profit EV charging station chains are gearing up to apply for grants.

By this time next year, with the 2024 election on the horizon, the Biden administration will be anxious to make sure that projects funded by its signature legislative victories are visible to the public. As happened with the stimulus package that helped end the Great Recession, shovel-ready projects will move to the head of the line.

There are many reasons for working-class Americans to fear the coming EV revolution. While 150,000 jobs are expected to be created in new assembly plants and battery factories by 2030, states that depend on making parts of internal combustion engines and transmissions (Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana are the three largest) will see many of those jobs disappear over the next decade. The same will happen to a significant portion of the jobs maintaining and repairing internal combustion engine vehicles, which will affect nearly every city and town in the U.S.

The country needs to learn from the mistakes made during the deindustrialization era, which stretched from the mid-1970s until now and devastated many regions of the country. We need to adopt robust income support, training, and economic development policies for the workers, families, and communities that lose jobs during the transition.

But as consumers, working-class Americans—like all Americans—have a lot to gain by making the switch. EVs are much less costly to drive when the electricity is appropriately priced. The changeover will extend the purchasing power of every household, not just through reduced fuel prices but also through sharply reduced long-term maintenance costs. Families across the economic spectrum will benefit from reduced health care costs by eliminating the number one cause of air pollution, which is the major driver of the rising asthma rates in the U.S. (And EVs are fun to drive. You’ll never have to worry again about being able to accelerate fast enough to enter the highway.)

Widespread EV adoption will greatly benefit the climate of the planet, the competitiveness of the country, and the quality of life and economic security of individuals and families. But the nation will come up short on each of those goals if, in crafting the policies for rolling out this new technology, policy-making elites ignore the needs of middle- and lower-income Americans.",electric vehicles,washington monthly

""Demand has been well supported this year with a significant ramp up in supply.""Two-wheeler makers, too, saw improved sales across urban, semi-urban and rural markets, especially at the entry level where demand has been depressed for nearly three years due to a rise in acquisition, insurance, and running costs since the transition to BS-VI emission standards.The country's largest two-wheeler makersaw retail sales go up by 20% over the corresponding festive period of FY22, led by high demand across key states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Karnataka.""A positive turnaround in customer sentiment in the just concluded 32-day festive period, starting from the first day of Navratras till the day after Bhai Duj, has also enabled the company to register a significant gain in its market share,"" the company said.",electric vehicles,the times of india

311,"After The Russian Withdrawal, Memories Of Resistance And Collaboration Linger In A Ukrainian Village",https://gdb.rferl.org/08b90000-0a00-0242-162a-08dab1bad431_w1200_r1.jpg,30/10/2022,"Some residents of Shevchenkove tell Schemes, the investigative unit of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, how they withstood torture and threats to resist collaboration with the Russian forces occupying their village in Ukraine's Kharkiv region. Others describe what…",https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-schemes-russian-occupation-kharkiv/32107783.html,"SHEVCHENKOVE, Ukraine -- Aside from gutted buildings and twisted scraps of military hardware, the liberated village of Shevchenkove, like others in northeastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region, now lives with an intangible but harrowing reminder of more than six months under Russian occupation -- the stories of those who resisted the invaders and those who cooperated.

In the still-turbulent wake of the Russian withdrawal, reporting by Schemes, the investigative unit of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, reveals how survival of the occupation often came down to a stark personal choice in the face of factors as dire as torture and intimidation and as mundane and meaningful as family ties.

Shevchenkove police chief Volodymyr Yaroshenko made his choice, under harrowing circumstances, about a month after Russian troops rolled into town on the day Moscow launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine, February 24.

Recruiting a Moscow-loyal police force in Shevchenkove, a sprawling village of about 7,000 people on the road from Kharkiv to Kupyansk, a key logistical hub for the Russian Army, appeared to be a priority for the invaders.

On March 23 or 24, several Russian soldiers interrogated Yaroshenko in the boiler room of the village council building, he told Schemes in an interview late last month. Traveling in a stolen Ukrainian police car and a local farmer's Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, seven of them then brought him to a hangar on a nearby farm.

There, he said, they tied his hands and suspended him from a crane -- and as he dangled overhead, they beat him with a blunt object that looked like a bat.

""They wanted me to cooperate with them and to order the police officers to go to work,"" Yaroshenko recounted. The soldiers, he continued, told him that 20 local police officers had agreed to work with the occupiers but were ""'waiting for your command.'""

""I categorically refused,"" Yaroshenko said.

Eventually, he said, the Russian soldiers lowered him to the ground and untied his hands. They gave him ""two to three days to think"" over whether to cooperate.

Yaroshenko alleged that they threatened to bring his young daughter to the hangar next, telling him ""'either you will hang and she will watch or vice versa.'""

The police chief made his decision -- he slipped out of the village and into Ukrainian-controlled territory without the Russians' knowledge. ""For several months after my 'conversations' with them, I could not feel two fingers on my left hand and two fingers on my right hand,"" Yaroshenko said of his treatment by his captors.

Yaroshenko managed to get his wife and daughter out, as well, settling temporarily in a Ukrainian-controlled area in the Kharkiv region. For him, it was a decision not to run away or flee ""but to leave.""

Not all local police did the same.

After Ukrainian forces retook Shevchenkove on September 8, prosecutors found left behind lists of employees of the so-called Department of Internal Affairs of the Kharkiv Oblast Temporary Civil Administration, the name adopted by the Russian occupation authorities. The Russian military police appear to have abandoned the documents in a building they were using that formerly housed the local branch of the Kupyansk district prosecutor's office and a courtroom.

The lists include people who were full-time police officers when the Russian occupation began and those who began to work with the police during the occupation, said Eduard Myrhorodskiy, chief prosecutor for the Kupyansk district.

That roster includes at least 10 men who were either former or active police officers in Shevchenkove when the Russians seized control of the village on February 24, according to one current police officer and a local resident who reviewed the list at the request of Schemes. During the occupation, these men worked for the Russian-allied police in positions ranging from traffic inspector to criminal investigation officer.

Schemes tried to contact the men via their Ukrainian phone numbers and on social media but received no responses. Myrhorodskiy said he had information indicating that the men ""escaped"" to Russia after the Russian forces withdrew from Shevchenkove -- an account echoed by local residents.

As of September 30, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the country's domestic intelligence agency, was conducting 178 investigations related to instances of suspected cooperation with the occupation authorities in the Kharkiv region, some of them involving multiple people, Oleksandr Kuts, head of the regional SBU office, told Schemes. He said that 32 suspects had been detained so far, some occupation-era mayors or police chiefs.

""They cooperated in different ways. Some were collaborators, some just provided some assistance, some were openly traitors,"" Kuts said.

One Shevchenkove resident who said she was forced to work at the local police station during the Russian occupation recognized the de facto new police chief, Vitaliy Mikhalyov, as a former classmate. An official document obtained by Schemes confirms Mikhalyov served as the police chief for the occupation authorities in Shevchenkove.

Before Russia's February invasion, the 33-year-old Mikhalyov was a police officer in Shevchenkove.

""We used to get along fine. We went to the same school,"" recounted the woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Yaroslava, citing security concerns. But in his new role as police chief for the occupation, she said, Mikhalyov's attitude changed.

""It's like he doesn't know me at all. [He would say,] 'Shut up, why are you coming here?' -- like that, even though we used to be friends.""

That connection with Mikhalyov did not benefit Yaroslava, who said she was detained for three days ""for no reason at all."" During this time, she claimed, a police employee, striking her shoulder with a rubber baton, ordered her to name local residents who had fought against Moscow-backed separatists in the war that erupted in 2014 in the neighboring Donetsk and Luhansk regions -- the Donbas -- and became part of the broader conflict following the February invasion. Apart from one man who ""comes and goes,"" she said, she knew no one.

""They treated you not like a person but like a dog,"" Yaroslava said. She charged that the ""people's police"" -- as the occupation police called themselves -- gave her no food or water during her three-day imprisonment, and regularly humiliated prisoners.

Upon her release, the occupation police ordered Yaroslava to work at the district police station for 15 days, citing a ""new law, new regulation,"" she told Schemes. Starting at 8 a.m. each day, she cleaned up the station, fed its prisoners, and weeded the grounds. An extra 15 days were added to her punishment when she showed up 30 minutes late on her last day.

She was compelled to sign a statement saying that she had no complaints about her treatment and that ""I want to help,"" Yaroslava said, adding that an officer on the force warned her that refusal to do so could lead to consequences for her three children.

Ihor Reutskiy, the deputy police chief in Shevchenkove, experienced such threats as well.

When the Russian occupation of Shevchenkove began on February 24, Reutskiy said, he and his fellow police officers remained at their posts and ""performed our official duties as best we could, monitored the movement of columns of military equipment, and transmitted data to our servicemen and leadership.""

But on March 18, Russian soldiers came to Reutskiy's house -- likely the result of leaked information, he believes.

""Under the threat of physical violence against me and my family, they took me to their car and brought me to [the premises of] an agricultural enterprise, where they tied my hands, lifted me up with an electric winch, and began to strike me with weapons,"" Reutskiy said -- a scene very similar to what Yaroshenko described; it was likely the same hangar.

The soldiers hit him with rifle butts, bats, and wooden sticks, ""trying to force me to cooperate,"" he said, adding that he refused to comply.

Neither Yaroshenko nor Reutskiy could specifically identify the Russian military unit whose members kidnapped and beat them.

Some of the men who beat him understood Ukrainian, Reutskiy said, leading him to believe that while some were Russian soldiers, others were fighters from the separatist forces in the Donbas. In addition to those groups, Ukrainian authorities say that Russian fighters in the area during the occupation included military police, officers of the military intelligence agency known as the GRU, and potentially others as well.

The soldiers who abducted him had weapons of higher quality than those normally used by ordinary Russian servicemen, Reutskiy added.

Shown photos of the uniforms and weapons used by both Russian military intelligence and private Russian military companies, Reutskiy stated that the soldiers who beat him could have been from the GRU or a private military company linked to it.

Survivors and eyewitnesses have given numerous accounts of torture and other abuses at the hands of members of the Russian invasion force, and other forms of evidence have also emerged following the withdrawal of Russian troops from areas they have held in northern, eastern, and southern Ukraine.

""Russian forces and others operating under their command routinely tortured detainees during their six-month occupation of Izyum,"" Human Rights Watch said in a report focusing on a Kharkiv region city that lies about 50 kilometers south of Shevchenkove and was also recaptured by Ukrainian forces in September.

Agreeing to work with the occupation authorities, though, was not always a matter of threats and violence. For Mykhaylo Stryzhko, family ties played a role.

Stryzhko, 24, went from being a stable employee to head of Shevchenkove's maintenance department after the Russian military made his father, Andriy Stryzhko, a blacksmith known for his nostalgia for Soviet rule, the chief administrator of the village.

Videos on Facebook show Andriy Stryzhko chairing a meeting or, in one instance, tearing down an official Ukrainian emblem. The elder Stryzhko is believed to have fled to Russia when the Russian military withdrew from the village.

His son, Mykhaylo, is being held in pretrial detention at a Kharkiv jail on suspicion of collaboration with the Russians over his role in Shevchenkove's occupation administration. If tried and convicted, he could be sentenced to five to 10 years in prison, be deprived of his property, and face restrictions on employment and other activities.

He is currently in custody through November 19, but his detention can be extended by court order.

In its October 12 notice of Stryzhko's detention, the Kharkiv region prosecutor's office alleges that Stryzhko ""followed all the Russian leaders' instructions,"" including organizing the installation of ""pro-Russian propaganda billboards"" intended ""to boost the occupiers' fighting spirit.""

The document does not state Stryzhko's name and an embedded photo blurs out the suspect's face, but the cited work location, job title, and activity match Stryzhko's own statements.

In an interview with Schemes on September 29, Stryzhko defended his actions, saying that the main task his job during the Russian occupation entailed was distributing aid, including ruble-denominated financial handouts, to Shevchenkove residents.

""I was supporting people to whom I'd given out humanitarian aid,"" he said, adding that ""if we hadn't brought them the aid, half of them would have died.""

Before the interview, the younger Stryzhko signed an agreement to talk with RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service journalists about his experiences during the occupation. A representative of the SBU, which is charged with investigating his activities, was present during the interview, as required by law. Stryzhko's government-appointed defense attorney did not attend.

Once the Russian occupation began, Stryzhko said, his parents urged him to return to Shevchenkove from the village where he had been living, which was also in the Kharkiv region but remained under Ukrainian control.

Stryzhko said that when asked to put up billboards in Shevchenkove that proclaimed ""We're one nation with Russia"" -- a false and highly contentious claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made repeatedly -- he connected the request with humanitarian assistance, saying that four vehicles carrying aid had been promised to Shevchenkove but only two had arrived.

Though Stryzhko maintains that the Russian and Ukrainian people are ""different,"" he said he associated the concept of ""one nation"" with his relatives who live in Russia. ""I support them,"" he said of his relatives. ""Many [Russians], I don't support.""

Once Russian forces withdrew from the village, Stryzhko said he expected Ukrainian officials would question him about his activities, but not put him in detention. ""I knew that they'd have conversations with me, but like -- not prison,"" he said. ""If I'd known how severe it would be, I might have left.""

Yet now, Stryzhko feels only ""emptiness"" when he thinks of the Russian forces. ""I'm left with nothing at all, as far as I understand,"" he explained.

""No home, nothing. My family is scattered. What can I feel?""

We’re asking readers to keep a record of how much they earn, what they save if anything, and what they’re spending their money on over the course of one week.

Are you a spender, a saver or a splurger? We’re looking for readers who will keep a money diary for a week. If you’re interested send a mail to money@thejournal.ie. We would love to hear from you.

Each money diary is submitted by readers just like you. When reading and commenting, bear in mind that their situation will not be relatable for everyone, it is simply an account of a week in their shoes, so let’s be kind.

Last time around, we heard from a 27-year-old graphic designer on €45K living in Dublin. This week, an electrical engineer on €115K living in the northeast of the country.

I am a married man in my early 40s with four kids (three now living at home full-time) living in the northeast of the country. I work in the food manufacturing sector for quite a large company that has plants across Ireland and Europe.

My job involves travelling to these plants, although since Covid hit, the travelling is a lot less. When I do travel, my day-to-day expenses are covered. My working week can vary a lot and since Covid, I get to work from home more often.

We own our own house and have a relatively small mortgage due to both of us working hard from an early age and saving extensively in our younger years. This allowed us to build our own house two years ago. We both put ourselves through third-level education later in life while working full-time. Thankfully, this has paid off for us both.

In my spare time, I restore vintage vehicles whenever I have any time! For exercise I enjoy walking but to be honest, it’s not enough. At 42 years old, I can’t get away with the odd walk…

What I learned –

After keeping the money diary for a week, what I have noticed is that while travelling, my eating habits are erratic and I am definitely going to try and prepare more for when I travel.

I enjoy working from home. It’s a much more balanced lifestyle and the cost of travel is higher now. The expenses I receive barely cover it all with vehicle wear and tear.

Between myself and my wife, the grocery bill is a lot higher than I expected. Popping in and out to shops on the way home from work results in unnecessary purchases. We might try online shopping again!",electric vehicles,thejournal.ie

Before Annette provides some insights into the drivers of the group's financial results in the third quarter, Christian will comment on the main developments and the overall performance. Finally, we will discuss our outlook for the full year '22. And as always, after the presentation, we will look forward to answering your questions.

But before Christian starts, let me remind you that you can find all relevant documents on our website, www.traton.com/ir. And finally, let me make you aware of the disclaimer on Page 2 of our presentation.

With that, I hand it over to Christian.

Christian Levin

Wonderful. Thank you very much, Lars, and good morning, good day, good afternoon to everyone in the call as well from my side. And then we shift slide, great. I would like to start with a few highlights from this quarter. Starting with Navistar. Navistar just launched its brand-new international S13 Integrated Powertrain at a live event in August in Las Vegas. The new powertrain offers up to 15%, which, in our industry, is huge, 15% gain in fuel efficiency benefit for our customers and a game changer for Navistar and the international brand.

Importantly, it is based on our Common Base Engine, the CBE and was designed using the modular system approach. The TRATON Modular System enables efficient cross-brand development and production, while still allowing for regional and brand adaptations. In what is a first for Europe, Scania and the heavy logistics are piloting the use of fully autonomous vehicles to transport commercial goods in regular traffic conditions between different logistic hubs.

The pilot will see the autonomous truck drive between Södertälje and Jönköping in the southern part of Sweden, a 3-hour journey of around 300 kilometers. The first and the last mile are being handled manually. Let's go now Volkswagen and Volkswagen Truck & Bus that are also entering into the era of autonomous vehicles and it's currently testing its first vehicle. It will be used by harvesters in fields and sugarcane crops in the area of Sao Paulo providing greater productivity and efficiency in real operations.

Staying with Volkswagen in addition, Volkswagen Truck & Bus started exporting the e-delivery vehicle, but first electric truck, 100% developed and produced in Latin America. So in Mexico, 5 units of the vehicle have been delivered to operate in the beverage distribution of the Grupo Modelo, which is an affiliate of the Anheuser-Busch InBev Group.

MAN celebrated the exhibition premier of the new series prototype of the new MAN eTruck at the IAA transportation in September in Hanover. The MAN eTruck will be delivered to customers from 2024 and is, due to its high charging capabilities suitable for heavy long haulage transport with daily ranges of between 600 up to 800 kilometers per day.

Last but not least, Scania has announced far-reaching measures to decarbonize its supply chain by 2030. Together with Scania suppliers, we have outlined an ambitious industry-leading strategy to eliminate the largest carbon emission sources from the most common production materials and batteries.

The 2030 target is 100% green batteries, 100% green steel, 100% green aluminum and 100% green cost iron in production. This will have a significant impact since all put together, these materials represent more than 80% of the carbon emissions from our vehicle production materials.

As you can see, we are moving ahead despite an extremely challenging geopolitical and economic environment. That brings me into Page #5. The war in Ukraine, unfortunately, is continuing with severe effects on the global economy. Meanwhile, it is common understanding that key economies are entering into recession, which is poising high risk for the industrial outlook.

In Europe, energy security and gas supply risks remain the key area of concern and the center of the political debate. But at the same time, truck demand remains robust. Demand for transportation capacity remains high. We continue to see strong replacement needs with an elevated average fleet age and customers are waiting for new trucks up to 1 year. As a result, also the demand for used trucks and their pricing levels continues to be on the high side.

Supply chain bottlenecks remain every day's reality in the entire industry. While the situation in semiconductor supplies have gradually eased, supply chains for imported raw materials and pre-products remain tight and are partially disrupted, especially logistics capacity bottlenecks have further intensified throughout the third quarter for both inbound and outbound transport.

Prices for input materials, pre-products and energy continue to rise resulting in unprecedented inflationary pressures. As a result, companies across sectors face significant wage demands. This surge in inflation has put consumers, industrial goods and governments under strong pressure. As one consequence, we see fast increase of interest rates.

But rest assured, that our Traton team and all our brands continue to work hard to offset these effects with our strong product offerings, our improved pricing and our better product mix. And the third quarter is a strong evidence that we are successfully doing so.

So moving into Slide #6 and the key facts of our performance in the third quarter. By the way, the first quarter, where we have -- we're quick cleaning of the consolidation effects from the acquisition of Navistar in the summer of 2021. So incoming orders, as you can see, at almost 92,000 vehicles in the quarter is on a relatively high level. However, they are 6% below the very strong third quarter of 2021.

Our unit sales improved significantly by 16%, coming up to almost 80,000 vehicles. Sales revenue increased more sharp by almost [indiscernible]. And alongside the higher volumes, we benefited from our pricing initiatives and our product mix as well as a strongly growing vehicle service business across all brands.

Adjusted operating results came in at €549 million, corresponding to an adjusted return on sales of 5.2%. So strong improvement compared to the second quarter this year and last year's third quarter and a good achievement given the highly challenging environment that we are currently operating in.

Finally, the net cash flow for TRATON Operations in the third quarter amounted to a plus of €61 million. And Annette will provide more background on the cash flow, but all the other figures in just a few minutes.

On to Slide 7, where you can see the recent development in incoming orders and unit sales in comparison to the medium-term trend. Following a low second quarter, we experienced a strong comeback of incoming orders. MAN recorded exceptionally high order intake, catching up from the production stops in the spring.

At the same time, our brands continued to be restrictive in accepting orders, in particular, Scania, because of already high order backlog and long delivery times well into next year and in order to limit risks from volatile and rising product costs. Our book-to-bill was clearly above 1, reaching 1.2 in the individual quarter. Momentum is also positive in our unit sales, supported by easing headwinds in the supply chain, production levels improved.

Nevertheless, unit sales were still held back by the shortage of semiconductors and other supplied components and especially by constraints in outbound logistics capacity. Most importantly, the market outlook for the remaining quarter in 2022 and the year ahead remains robust, and we continue to see strong demand from our customer, which are placing orders despite the up to 12 months long lead time.

So why is that despite a macro environment that is characterized by geopolitical turbulence, high inflation and a looming recession? Well, there are a number of reasons. The industry is still heavily supply-driven as the continued shortages in raw materials and pre-products prevent high deliveries. And the elevated fleet ages with significant needs to replace rundown fleets in many markets create a high demand, not only for new vehicles, but also for the vehicle service business.

Further, freight demand is far ahead of available transport capacity. As a result, freight rates continue on a high level. Our connected vehicles' industries are showing high utilization of our equipment, except for markets bordering to Russia. Of course, that doesn't mean that the transport industry will not be affected by the global economic downturn. For sure, it will, but it's not foreseeable for our business so far.

Despite the challenging environment, we're not losing focus when it comes to be the first -- to the first of our 4 strategic pillars to be the responsible company and the sustainable transport of the future. This was evidenced by Traton's appearance at the IAA Transportation Fair in Hanover few weeks ago. Our European brands, Scania and MAN showed their way forward to battery. [indiscernible] its slot latest next-level battery electric trucks for regional long haulage.

And for the first time, MAN revealed its all-electric large sales truck and open order book for the vehicles that will be delivered to customers as from 2024 onwards. And not to forget, electrification is also playing an increasingly important role in the bus sector, and today with strong momentum compared to trucks.

All our brands have a very competitive product offering already in the market today. For example, the MAN Lion's City E, the winner of the prestigious Bus of the Year award this year, where the prize was handed over to MAN during the IAA Fair. The MAN electric bus went into cereal production already in 2020 and a total of over 1,000 orders have been received to date, a success story that moves and it's far from over, which brings me then to Slide #9.

We continue to expand our already broad and competitive electric product portfolio across a wide range of different applications. Already today, we make a difference. In the third quarter alone, we delivered more than 400 full electric vehicles, bringing the number close to 1,300 in the first part of the year.

Yes, figures are still relatively low, and we're just starting the race towards fully sustainable transport. But when we talk to customers, they are really interested. Because we can help them to achieve their sustainability ambitions and especially because battery electric vehicles are becoming and, in some applications, already are a more cost-efficient alternative to ICE.

So demand is growing amongst customers. In total, we received orders for 526 electric vehicles in the third quarter and 1,622 in the first 9 months. Meaning the book-to-bill ratio in the third quarter continued to be well above 1, and our customers' interest in battery electric trucks at the ERR was huge, giving us confidence that we will continue to grow this momentum.

So moving into Slide #10, and this is my final slide. As most of you already know, we have added a new component to our TRATON Way Forward strategy called Strategy Execution. A crucial part is the introduction of a group-wide implementation of the TRATON Modular System. And also here, we are making strong progress. The start was made with the introduction of the extremely efficient group-wide powertrain, the CBE presented by Scania last year.

It is the world's most sustainable powertrain with a 13-liter Common Base Engine offering up to 80% of all its fuel savings compared to the already very economical former predecessor engine. And later on, in August this year, Navistar launched the International S13, which is its version of the Common Base Engine, with amazing results and up to 15% less fuel consumption compared to its predecessor.

It also offers better efficiency, better reliability and sustainability as well as increased service and solution offerings and therefore, represents what is a major milestone for Navistar's future, which triggered very positive feedback from customers and the specialized press, and most importantly, strong interest in already now placing orders. The International S13 will be delivered to customers from late summer next year.

And the next member of the Traton family will follow in the coming years in 2024, MAN is planning to launch the CBE, and later followed by Volkswagen Truck & Bus in 2028.

And with that, let me hand over to Annette. Annette the floor is yours.

Annette Danielski

Thanks, Christian, and a very warm welcome to everyone on the call from my side. I'm now on Slide 12, which shows incoming orders in unit development for the third quarter with minus 6% incoming orders that's slightly below the high comparison base in the prior year quarter. As already mentioned from Christian, MAN orders bounced back to more than 34,000 units, more than twice the level in the second quarter, which has suffered from the production stops.

But despite, MAN and Navistar and especially Scania continued to be restrictive in accepting orders. Order intake at Volkswagen Truck & Bus was robust. Still the development of order intake is more driven by supply and the ability to produce and deliver rather than by demand.

Our unit rates were significantly up by 16%. This was supported by a credit easing of supply chains audited and improved production levels. Nevertheless, existing pressure on the supply chain and temporary disruption continued to affect production levels. In addition, we are facing constraints in outbound logistic capacity, holding back deliveries of vehicles to customers.

Moving to Slide 13. In our sales revenue development with a separate physical service business contribution. Sales revenue increased by nearly 1/3, clearly exceeding limited growth. On a side note, Traton's revenue exceeded €10 billion mark for the first time on a quarterly level. Besides the higher unit debt, this was especially due to very strong pricing mix.

In addition, Sales revenue from vehicle service business again delivered double-digit percentage increase across all brands. With a 21% share of total sales revenue, the vehicle service business makes a major contribution to the company's success. We continue to invest and now further expand our service business to drive growth as well as taking advantage of a stabilizing effect on trading sales revenue and earnings.

Moving to Slide 14 and to our operating side and profitability. Although here, we have seen a positive momentum in the third quarter. The adjusted operating result came in at €549 million, a strong improvement of €354 million compared to the third quarter last year. This corresponds to an adjusted return on sales of 5.2%.

The increase was mainly driven by a higher volume and the cost per improvement and the capacity utilization. In addition and importantly, with the successful execution of our pricing initiatives, we were able to compensate for the significantly increased tire costs for raw materials, energy and boarding components as well for logistics services in the quarter as well as the first 9 months of the year.

As announced in September, we recorded significant onetime impairment related to the disposal of business activities of MAN Truck & Bus and Scania in Russia. In total, operating results were impacted by a onetime effect of about €600 million. As a result, the operating results, as booked, declined by €238 million year-on-year to minus €52 million in the third quarter.

Let us have a look at the brand's performance on Slide 15. Sales revenue at Scania Vehicles & Services improved strongly by 24% year-on-year, mainly benefiting from higher volumes, price mix effects and significant growth in the vehicle service business. Scania's adjusted return on sales, nevertheless, was 0.1 percentage points lower at 7.6%. Volumes and the margins are still held back by supply shortages and tight logistic capacities. In addition, material price inflation, higher cost for projects in production, logistics and R&D had a counteracting effect.

Now move to MAN. Thanks to the positive price effects and strong growth in the vehicles service business and average increased sales revenue by 9% to €2.8 billion. Even so, unit sales were below last year's level. However, the adjusted return on sales decreased by 1.1 percentage points to 1.5%, mainly driven by lower production utilization and higher material and energy prices. This was partly offset by improved margin in the used vehicle and vehicle service business and continued benefiting from this execution of the realignment program as well as a strict cost management.

Navistar showed a very compelling third quarter performance with an increase in sales revenue by 77% year-on-year and improved return on sales by 3.4 percentage points to a level of 5.9%. The development was mainly driven by strong increase in unit sales, leading to a better-fixed cost absorption through higher production utilization as well as strong implementation of pricing initiatives.

Despite slightly lower unit sales, year-on-year, Volkswagen Truck & Bus achieved a 42% increase in sales revenue. Again, improved pricing was a major factor. The brand also benefited from favorable exchange rate movements. Overall, Volkswagen Truck & Bus was able to more than compensate the strong increase in material prices and recorded an impressive 11.6% return on sales in the third quarter. This corresponds to an increase of 2.4 percentage points year-on-year.

Let us have a quick look at the segment performance in the third quarter on the next page. In total, TRATON Operations, with some of our brands, recorded sales revenue of €10.4 billion, up by 31% year-on-year. Adjusted return on sales came at 5.8%, corresponding to an improvement of 80 basis points.

Financial Service continued its strong underlying performance and increased sales revenue by 23%. The segment recorded an adjusted operating result of €71 million, a similar level as in the first and the second quarter. Adjusted return on sales at 22% was on a good level. However, the margin was 7.7 percentage points below the exceptionally strong prior-year quarter.

Corporate items reduced the group's adjusted operating result of €128 million. Please bear in mind that this number includes the effects of the purchase price allocation, which stood at €85 million in the third quarter. Excluding the purchase price allocation, Traton's adjusted operating results would have totaled €634 million and an adjusted return on sales of 6%.

On Slide 17, and the net cash flow, now again referring to TRATON Operations. Cost cash flow at €1 billion in the third quarter improved versus prior-year level and the second quarter mainly as a result of a better operating performance. [indiscernible] movement remains a significant headwind.

We recorded a further buildup of inventories related to the ongoing supply bottlenecks for boarding components and logistics shortages as well as higher trade through filling this. In total, net cash flow for TRATON Operations was slightly positive at €61 million. This leads me to the net debt, which is on Slide 18.

Compared to the second quarter 2022, the net debt position of TRATON operation increased by around €350 million to €3.3 billion. With a slightly positive net cash flow, the increase was mainly due to exchange rate effects. We included the net debt position for corporate items to provide a full picture of TRATON GROUP's net debt position, excluding the financial service business.

Corporate items added €4.1 billion which brings me to a total net debt of a level of €7.4 billion at the end of the third quarter and slightly up compared to the second quarter. Our ambition for the final quarter of the year and the priority for next year is clear, to release a significant part of the cash tied in working capital and to improve the net debt position of the group.

Moving on to the full-year outlook, starting with the truck market. As already discussed, our markets continue to be robust. It is expected that our core markets will continue to grow in 2022 with expansion rates varying from region to region. Most market forecasts have seen an increase of the truck market in Europe in a range between 0 up to 10% for the year 2022.

The South American market current estimated range between minus 5% to up plus 5%. For North America, market participants continue to be more optimistic. Truck market growth within the region is forecasted. -- let me remind you that there are still a high degree of uncertainty and significant geopolitical and economic risks. This leads me to this next slide, the financial outlook for the TRATON GROUP in 2022.

As always, our financial outlook is based on our latest internal planning, the market expectations and our performance to date. We confirm our expectations for unit sales and project a substantial year-on-year increase. At the same time, we continue to expect a very sharp increase in sales revenue in the fiscal year 2022.

Further, we confirm the benefits of our expected range of adjusted operating return on sales of 5% to 6%. However, in a still highly uncertain volatile environment, and given the ongoing supply chain challenges and taking into account the performance in the first 9 months, we anticipate ending the year more towards the lower end of this range. Our guidance is including the effects from purchase price allocation, which is expected to range between €300 million to €320 million. This is above our prior expectation due to changes in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate.

We confirm that our net cash flow of the TRATON Operations is expected to range between €700 million and €1 billion. Please note that this does not include the mentioned cash out in connection with the EU antitrust proceedings.

Now let me hand back to Christian for his final remarks.

Christian Levin

Thank you very much, Annette. Before we then enter into the Q&A session let me summarize the key takeaways of today's investor call. In the third quarter, in a continued highly challenging environment, Traton delivered a robust financial performance and continued the stringent execution of the strategic agenda.

We recorded a high level of incoming orders, improved unit sales and strongly increased sales revenue backed by a gradually improved supply chain. The momentum in adjusted operating results and profitability is positive, even though it has still been held back by supply constraints and relatively low production utilization throughout the quarter. Our net cash flow returned to positive territory despite further significant buildup of working capital. Net debt remained stable at a high level.

While we continue to see high risks in our environment, we confirm our outlook for the full year and expect improved earnings momentum and net cash flow in the final quarter of 2022.

Lars Korinth

Thank you, Christian and Annette. Let us now open the floor for the Q&A. Emma, can you take over from here?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. The first question is from the line of [indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs.

Daniela CR de Carvalho e Costa

It's actually Daniela. If I may ask 3 questions. So first, I just wanted to check on your slide where you had the EV orders and helpful to hear you talking about the launches. But the orders seems to have start to go down. Can you comment on, like, is there anything specific there and you see the strong reversal of that? Just a little bit surprised to not see sort of more of an upward momentum there. And I know it's small numbers, but just any color there would be interesting.

Second question, just wanted to check in terms of, like, when we think about next year, wage negotiations, where are those, in your view, coming out to? And contrast that maybe with pricing ability to still price further up next year given the market outlook you just flagged.

And then the third one is just, I know you don't guide on '23, but to the extent that you -- some of your peers have put numbers out there, it sounds like Europe and the U.S., broadly similar-ish to 2022. Are there any observations on why you think that could be materially different for those scenarios, if you can elaborate as we look into '23.

Christian Levin

Okay. Thanks, three good questions. And obviously, I'm going to start the question here with the orders. So we have -- as we say here in this reporting, we have been a little bit restrictive in taking on orders and that's particularly in the Scania brand. And we -- we've had -- we introduced this strategy or tactics rather around last summer. So in the comparable figures from last year, you have -- you don't have that way of working.

So the way we work now is that we basically only accept orders that are within 12 months. And then we open up month by month. And whereas in the other brands, we work more with a completely open order book. And you see the very good bounce back of MAN, for instance, orders in -- coming into the order book after the complete stop in production where we, of course, also have to stop order intake.

But why are we doing that in Scania? Well, on top of the general complications, we all live in with difficulty to predict product costs and therefore, difficulty to get pricing exactly right. We also are introducing the completely new driveline and that is -- I mean that might not sound big, but that is changing more than half of all the components on the vehicle, changing both engine gearbox, rear axle, after treatment and a lot of software engine control systems.

So -- and with that, we're also changing a number of suppliers. So we have an additional complication on the Scania and that makes us additionally restrictive when it takes -- when it comes to taking on orders. So what I can say is that the demand is still there. And when we open up a new month, we get very fast response from our importers and dealers and quickly fill up these orders. So when it comes to the demand, as we say, it continues to be strong.

Daniela CR de Carvalho e Costa

Apologies, I might not have been clear maybe on my question. I was asking about Slide 9 on your EV orders. It's a fairly small number. So I take the point on Scania on...

Christian Levin

Okay. Sorry for that.

Daniela CR de Carvalho e Costa

No worries. It's helpful anyways to know about Scania.

Christian Levin

Yes. Sorry. Thanks for clarifying. I didn't get the EV part. So yes, when it comes to EVs, we are clearly at the beginning of an S curve. And we are further or soon going to see a rapid increase as the TCO parity is coming closer in more and more applications. So what we, of course, see is an effect in Europe, for Scania of the ongoing energy crisis because of the war Ukraine. Where many customers are, today, hesitating, because they don't see where electricity prices are going to end up.

And of course, they also suffer price increases that we had to introduce, because of the very high raw material prices affecting batteries. So there is a little bit of short-term cool down on electric vehicles. We see, on the other hand, higher demand for the hybrid solutions. And my best estimation is that this is just going to be a short-term effect.

I think as Europe especially realizes that the dependency on fossil fuels from markets outside Europe is not sustainable in any way, we're going to see political initiatives in order to make it even more attractive to change over. So there might be a short delay to -- the catch-up effect is really hitting this market, but we are absolutely sure it's coming, and we continue to invest in both R&D and production equipment to be ready when the effect is coming. But I would like to hand over also to Annette to…

Annette Danielski

Yes, Thank you very much, Christian. Another thing is really, when you go with the bus, this the main tender. So we have orders there. A big -- a few tenders there, and not. And we should remind you that this big program in the U.S. from the government that we have €5 billion program out of electrified bodies.

We have a lot of customers applying for this program with incoming orders will come later. So we have also, here, not always a swing up. So also the bus is more a tender-driven business. So you will see also there a little bit up and down whether the tender comes in or not, and we are really hopeful that we will see increasing rates in the next month.

Christian Levin

Okay. I think the second question was on wages development. Maybe Annette you take that one.

Annette Danielski

Still, we -- as we mentioned, we are very able to price the increases in inflation here.. And now it's upcoming the new contracts on wages. So we're also working on this with our union colleagues in close discussion. And we believe that we are able to price it, but it could be a gap when the inflation is in and then we can really realize the prices with the full order book. As we mentioned in the last call, we have scheduled order. We have deferred charges with the delivery of instrument, but the gap could open a little bit and could be delayed that we can pass it through. But I'm very positive that we can do this.

Christian Levin

And then on the third part of your question, which was around the total markets. We also see a stable outlook for Europe and for North America. Where we do see the market coming down is in Latin America where we have a new legislation coming into Brazil, the economic, like, which is basically Euro VI. So there, we see a slight downturn. We're not guiding on specific numbers, but I think that is the tendency that we see. And of course, North America and Europe are also based on the very strong order books that we see.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, we kindly ask you to limit your questions to two only. The next question is from the line of Miguel Borrega with BNP Paribas.

Miguel Borrega

The first one just on Navistar. Can you provide us the FX tailwind on adjusted EBIT for Q3? And then also a little bit more color on what is really driving the surge in volumes over recent months? I mean 8,000, 9,000 units a month. You haven't seen that since 2019. Is this the new normal in terms of production rates? Can it go higher? Or will it normalize a little bit from here? That's question number one.

And then the second question, I was quite interested in the autonomous where you mentioned some pilots in Scania. Are you testing to effectively removing the driver entirely? And if so, how soon? And how different would this partnership be from the one that you have with TuSimple. I know they are mostly in the U.S. But apart from that, any differences in the software, the partnership?

And if I can squeeze in 1 more question, just with regards with your majority shareholder, have you had any recent conversations about their position? How are they seeing the execution of the plan and any other more comments.

Annette Danielski

So I can start with Navistar, with rising, here, so sure, we had positive translation effect due to Europe and euro to U.S. dollar, but this is a positive impact, but it's not so high as mentioned. We have seen that the production level now at Navistar goes up and we see a little bit better supply chain. They have still missing parts, but we see that it's really improving and that we have higher production rates and S13.

If they have a decent sales volume, they can make a good result. And that is you say, proved in the Q3 and this is a positive sign for us and a very good sign on the, mainly, startup. The talks with our majority shareholders are ongoing and very positive, but ongoing talks, as I mentioned already in the half-year closing. We're on good track and good communication with them and working on possible solutions.

Christian Levin

Okay. To add on the autonomous technologies and in Scania in particular. So yes, you're right. So we're aiming on full driver-out. Of course, this is a promising technology that, as someone said, remains promising. We can't really say when we have the whole -- all the conditions in place to really take the driver out but we're learning fast. We're learning every day.

And that example I gave you, we do have a logistics experience that we're doing now in Europe as the first one of all brands in the market is giving us more and more learnings. So we're absolutely aiming also in real traffic conditions driver-out. We are already operating, as you know, in mining, so in closed areas without the driver. So that's where we're aiming. Thanks.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Michael Jacks with Bank of America.

Michael Jacks

My first question is just on order intake in North America. Given the 12-month lead times, and I'm referring more to the market share rather than Navistar specifically, do you think that order intake levels reflect some pre-buy positioning ahead of COP 2024 regulations potentially? That's my first question.

My second question is on Financial Services. Can you please just comment on the impact of rising interest rates on monthly lease payments for customers and whether or not you think this could become a restrictive factor in the months ahead? And then maybe just one small add-on to that as to whether or not there are any indications that you may need to tighten up on lending standards there.

Annette Danielski

So first, for the order intake in the U.S., I think we are sure there are already some orders for COP24, we've got, but still, the demand is very high when you follow [indiscernible] high demand still on transportation. And also the fleet is in the U.S., very odd. There are also replacement needs. So it's a mix, I think, of everything, demand tightens, replacement needs and COP24 ahead of us. So both -- I think this really drives the incoming orders in the -- from my point of view.

Christian Levin

And if I can add also that we see the transport rates, even if they came down from the most extreme levels, remain on a historically very, very high level. And -- which we'll also be earning from transport companies continue to be on a good levels. So that is also not restricting order intake. Let me see the second that was on Financial Services.

Annette Danielski

Yes. I did not get 100% the question on Financial Services.

Christian Levin

I think it was on whether the higher interest rates are restrictive in the Financial Service business and whether we would give up a part of our cushion to push that. Okay…

Michael Jacks

Sorry, the second part of that is just whether or not you would need to tighten up on lending standards there because overall conditions in the marketplace -- in the marketplace are tightening up.

Christian Levin

No, I wouldn't say that we see any of that. Of course, we see that the interest rates are rising. We are passing that on to customers. We see that competition is still fierce, and there is still capital available. So no such sign, Michael.

Michael Jacks

And then maybe just on the first one. Sorry, Lars, just coming back on that. Just in terms of the impact of rising interest rates on monthly lease payments for customers, is that significant? Is there also a financing portion on other services that get bundled into those monthly repayments? Or is it just on the selling price of the truck?

Annette Danielski

It's not bundled, and it's more on the price in my point of view.

Christian Levin

Yes. As you know, I mean, if you sell an operating lease, you have the whole package in. And there, of course, it has an impact. But given the price increases that we are already pushing through on the basic vehicle, this is a very small proportion that is coming on from the financing costs as part of that operational lease. So Annette is right.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Klas Bergelind with Citi.

Klas Bergelind

Christian, Annette and Lars, Klas at Citi. So first on Scania, delivery is in line with what I thought, but the margin is again on the weak side. I thought the margin would be up more quarter-on-quarter with the high deliveries. And to what extent, Christian, is driven by extra cost inflation from supplier compensation linked to energy as we've seen at some of your peers? Or is it wages? It looks like more cost inflation quarter-on-quarter in a bridge, keen to understand what the drivers are for starter.

Christian Levin

Yes. Thanks, Klas. So what's happening in Scania is that we're working really, really hard to continue to increase our production output. We have, in the third quarter, a good run, but we couldn't invoice all of it as it was stuck in outbound stock. So a lot of restrictions there to actually push the vehicle through the system and, of course, further on by the fact that we own the majority of the dealers.

So that was not -- we expected better, to be honest. And then we continue to struggle with supply chain bottlenecks. So September was very good, and we are long -- we're out of the semiconductor shortages, but we have other shortages that are hitting us as we gradually increase production. So I think we'll have to unfortunately leave with further restrictions. And I doubt that we're going to see the 10,000 mark per month throughout the fourth quarter, but probably have to wait until next year. But that's what we see.

When it comes to order intake, I mean, it is continued deliberate action not to fill up the complete order book for next year. We first want to finalize the ramp-up of the new so-called Scania Super, the Common Base Engine with a complete driveline, because the changeover of supplier base between the 2 programs. So it's just one complication too many to have, both the ramp-up, the change-over of suppliers on the very long order book to handle at the same time. So therefore, we have taken this drastic decision to only open up for a month at the time.

And then your last question is, of course, what we're working very hard on and what is making me most frustrated and that is the margins. I mean we see very good price increases. We see very good mix effects by prioritizing the high-priced markets, and we still don't see the vehicle margins where they should be.

On one hand, it's, of course, the effect of not utilizing the capacity that we have with full manning and full investments in our factories. And on the other, it is, of course, cost increases as you're into. And it's partly on the product where we have cost increases, we have the energy that is a very sharp increase, but we also have component cost increases from suppliers, partly based on energy cost, but also raw material costs, which we're trying, of course, to fence off but don't completely manage.

So -- and then, of course, we have a general cost situation in Scania, which we are addressing now, where we see that, okay, if we can't get out the volume, then we have also to address the general fixed cost level which we're also working in order to get the performance back where it should be. So that's -- I think that's a few -- I mean there's more to it. But to give you a flavor of what we're fighting within Scania.

Klas Bergelind

Yes. No, I get it. My second and final one is then on Navistar and the underlying margin. It looks pretty solid, no major FX boost. Volumes are higher, but could still be higher if it wasn't for the bottlenecks. So what level do you think Navistar would have delivered at this quarter on a more normalized volumes? The backlog is still quite big. I'm trying to understand how much the margin drag was because of bottlenecks. Because if you think about this, your target is 9%, I mean, are we underlying almost there? I don't know if this is possible to quantify, Christian.

Christian Levin

Yes. I mean we -- as you know, we are investing in a new production facility in San Antonio and Texas, which is perhaps Navistar's additional complication that is partly influencing the ability to ramp up. But of course, we're aiming to do about 10,000 per month. And with that kind of volumes, we are definitely going to see a much higher EBIT figure. And yes, we had a taste here in the third quarter and particularly in September, where we had a really, really good run and a really strong EBIT performance in the individual months. So you're right, we're expecting more on both.

Lars Korinth

Thank you, Klas. We have to cut back to 1 question per question, please, because we're running already out of time. We're really sorry for that, because of hard cuts today. Yes, Emma, please.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Nicolai Kempf with Deutsche Bank.

Nicolai Kempf

Nicolai here from Deutsche Bank. Well, if I have to limit down to one, I would just ask about the suppliers that you may have supported in the third quarter. You know that one of your Swedish competitors had some troubles on the margin side because they supported suppliers here. Have you done something similar?

Annette Danielski

Now, so we really watch very closely and work closely together with our suppliers. And starting already with the cohort, we have really good connection with the supplier, watch them -- the health of the supplier and we don't see this as a major impact. It's normal that we have with this increase in prices. Our supplier also struggle, but we find ways together how to solve it.

And I think this is on our watches. We are not blinded there, but we work together in the brands and find the best solution together. And I think this is a very on-topic. The other thing is really how much we then also can pass on to the pricing with all the discussions that is ongoing and get it closer.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Anthony Dick from ODDO BHF.

Anthony Dick

I had a question on Scania. My question was you mentioned the order book extending out to 12 months, which seems a bit longer than most of what your peers are doing right now. So with costs still fluctuating quite a lot, how do you manage the pricing on that order book to manage that with viability looking out for 12 months out?

And then in terms of the production, you mentioned the issues with the ramp-up of the Scania Super. Could you give us an indication when you expect these issues to dissipate? And could you share with us what this Scania represents of your -- Scania Super represents at your Scania sales today?

Christian Levin

Let me start then from the end there. You asked the question on how much is Scania Super represents right now or in this quarter, rather. It's 14% of the sales. And we are, right now, building more than 100 per day. So it's increasing rapidly. But yes, we are behind the plan. And that's -- as I said, that's one reason why we are limiting the number of orders to make sure that we can -- we're not making customers disappointed because, of course, there is a high pressure on us to deliver the Scania Super with the fuel saving. So that's where we are. So that's sharing.

I mean -- and the complications are many. We are ramping up a new foundry, brand-new. We're ramping up new suppliers. For instance, when it comes to the famous engine control system that has been limiting us in the current series, if you remember throughout the spring, we're changing some of the key suppliers there. Okay. I think I stop there with respect to time.

Operator

In the interest of time, I hand back to Lars Korinth for closing.

Lars Korinth

We can take another 1 or 2 questions, of course.

Operator

Okay. We will move on with Erik Golrang with SEB, please.

Erik Golrang

My question would be on battery cells. You had a competitor saying that it starts to become a high-volume battery cell manufacturer by the end of the decade, given your electrification plans. What's your thinking on that topic right now? And if you're going there, do you think you have the balance sheet to manage it?

Christian Levin

Yes. Thanks, Erik. Well, it has nothing to do with the balance sheet, even if it might have been a restriction. Now we have not classified the battery cell as such as a core component that we need to manufacture in-house. We have classified it as a strategic component. It means that we want to have full control of the design and the chemistry in it, but we are perfectly happy with having supplier partners delivering the components into our own module and pack production which we have them classified as core.

Operator

Final question is from the line of [indiscernible] with UBS.

Unidentified Analyst

Just a very quick question. On the Scania backlog, how many of these have you actually managed to convert into the new Super line orders? And when you have done so, I imagine you've been able to negotiate a higher price.

Christian Levin

I didn't get you. I think that is the point. What do you mean? Whether we get higher prices for the new -- sorry?

Unidentified Analyst

For the -- from converting any, like, existing older Scania model orders into the new BA orders, if you've managed to convert them? And if so, have you managed to increase the price? So negotiate a higher price for that engine?

Christian Levin

We -- if I get you right, of course, we get the higher price for the 80% fuel saving. And we're turning around somewhere around 5%, 6% price increase on the Super platform. But when you say conversion, of course, as since we launched this driveline already last year, the majority of our customers would like to have it.

The restriction is rather our ability to supply. So in many cases, we have had them to finalize on the current driveline instead and the penetration rate, as I said earlier, on the new one was 14% in the quarter, but we are, throughout the first half of next year, planning to come to 100%. So that's the plan. So by mid-next year, we should be done with the introduction.

Operator

This concludes the Q&A, and I hand back to Lars Korinth for closing comments.

Lars Korinth

All right. Yes. Thank you, Emma, and thank you for everyone in the call, and of course, also for you, Christian and Annette for answering all the questions. Thanks for the interest and the good discussion. And I'm pretty sure that there are still remaining questions because we were running out of time, and I apologize that it's very close in the end.

Please reach out to us in the Investor Relations team in case of any questions or remarks, and I wish you all a very nice remaining day and a nice weekend because it's starting today. Thank you for joining us today and stay safe. Bye-bye.

317,Trucking Industry and Environmentalists Spar With Regulators as California Prepares to Phase Out Fossil-Fuel Trucks,https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/GettyImages-1424142784-1020x585.jpg,30/10/2022,There’s fiery opposition from environmentalists and truckers as state regulators consider a proposal to ban gas-fueled truck sales and make large trucking firms convert to electric within two decades.,https://www.kqed.org/news/11930562/trucking-industry-and-environmentalists-spar-with-regulators-as-california-prepares-to-phase-out-fossil-fuel-trucks,"Air board staff estimate that truck drivers and companies would pay higher upfront vehicle prices now but expect those costs to go down as more models enter the market, eventually bringing the cost down to that of a conventional truck.

When comparing diesel and electric trucks in 2035, staff project that buying and operating an electric semi-truck over its life span, for example, could range between $765,000 and $1.1 million compared to a gas or diesel truck, which could cost between $919,000 and $1.2 million. These totals exclude state and federal subsidies that some companies could receive to help them pay for a truck.

Staff also said lower maintenance and operational costs would save fleet operators money over time.

Though trucks represent just 2 million of the 30 million registered vehicles in the state, they are the largest single source of air pollution from vehicles. Heavy-duty trucks spew 70% of the state’s smog-forming gases and 80% of carcinogenic diesel pollutants, according to the air board.

Air board member and Democratic state Sen. Connie Leyva of Chino acknowledged the disproportionate air pollution toll many communities have faced and the state’s role in that inequity.

“This is probably a little inappropriate, but my takeaway was that we do bad s--- to poor people,” she said. “Most of what’s happening is happening in poor areas of the state.”

Sam Wilson, senior vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy organization, said the air board needs to tighten the rule to get more emission reductions from the most polluting trucks to avoid the damaging effects of diesel exhaust.

Speeding up rules for big trucks?

The proposal has different deadlines for phasing in new sales of electric models, varying based on the size and type of truck, until all are electric by 2042. In addition, the requirements for converting fleets would not apply to smaller companies that operate fewer than 50 trucks, unless they were using a larger company’s trucks. They could keep their trucks as long as they want under the proposal, although their new purchases would have to be zero-emission by 2040.

Wilson said the requirement for fleet operators who manage some of the largest and most polluting trucks — such as long-haulers, big rigs and semis — should be put on a faster electrification timeline, with a phase-in starting date in 2027 rather than 2030.

He also said the proposal threshold of 50 trucks should be lowered to 10 trucks for these fleet operators, given the outsized role large trucks have in emitting deadly soot pollution. A fleet of 10 tractor trucks emits about three times as much nitrogen oxide — a smog-forming pollutant — and about the same amount of fine particulate pollution as a fleet of 50 delivery vans, according to air board staff’s estimates.

“There’s a difference in the amount of pollution that is emitted between a plumbing company that has 50 vans, for example, and a hauling company that has 50 tractor trucks,” he said. “In order to account for this, a fleet of tractor trucks should have a compliance threshold of 10 rather than 50 just to account for the extremely disproportionate impact that they have.”

Randolph, the board chair, said it would be “counterproductive” to pursue some actions that environmentalists were calling for, including reducing the fleet size or moving up timelines for some truck classifications, suggesting that it “might create more burden than is necessary” for the trucking industry. She did, however, support the idea of moving up the manufacturer production timeline, which many board members also agreed with. The board directed staff to assess that possibility and other changes to the rule to address charging, grid and vehicle availability challenges.

“We as a board should discuss the possibility of an earlier 100% sales to 2036 and really push manufacturers to step up and make these vehicles available,” she added.

Other states set to follow?

A coalition of representatives from several states, including New York, Washington, Wisconsin and Connecticut, urged the board to adopt the rule and said they would move to implement it in their states, too.

“The board’s approval of the advanced clean-fleet regulations will enable New York and other states to adopt those regulations to support the needed transition to zero-emission transportation and cleaner, healthier communities,” said Jared Snyder, deputy commissioner for air resources, climate change and energy at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

Although California legislators have no direct say over whether the board adopts the rule, dozens of lawmakers weighed in on the proposal — and vastly disagreed about it.

In a letter to the air board (PDF), a group of state legislators, including Democratic Sens. Nancy Skinner of Berkeley and Josh Becker of Menlo Park, and Assemblymember Cristina Garcia of Bell Gardens, agreed with environmentalists. They note that these changes are achievable due to this year’s massive $54 billion climate investment, which includes $10 billion in state funding to rapidly deploy electric vehicles and charging stations.

The climate package allocates billions for electrifying medium- and heavy-duty trucks, including $1.1 billion for zero-emission trucks, buses, off-road equipment and fueling infrastructure and $400 million for charging stations at ports. Truck drivers and companies could receive additional benefits through the federal Inflation Reduction Act, which includes a 30% tax credit for zero-emission commercial vehicles and charging stations.

But in a separate statement, some legislators including Democratic Assemblymembers Blanca Rubio of Baldwin Park, Carlos Villapudua of Stockton and Rudy Salas of Bakersfield — especially those from rural areas or with high concentrations of fleet operators in their districts — sided with the trucking industry, saying the proposal is too “aggressive” and places many financial burdens on fleet operators. They also said the plan fails to address many technical challenges, such as the toll electric trucks will have on the grid as power demand grows, and the fast-charging needs of heavy-duty rental vehicles like water and dump trucks that operate in remote locations.",electric vehicles,kqed
318,Is The IEA Too Optimistic About The Energy Transition?,https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2022-10-28_jw3qwbvu8t.jpg,30/10/2022,"In its latest World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency stated that thanks to the energy crisis rattling the world right now, demand for fossil fuels would peak, speeding up the transition to renewable energy.

But is this just a case of wishful thinking?

The IEA—for the first time ever—sees this happening—across all of the scenarios it devised for its forecast. According to even the Stated Policy Scenario—usually the most conservative of the scenarios—demand for fossil fuels would begin permanently declining in the mid-2020s “by an annual average roughly equivalent to the lifetime output of a large oil field.”

Coal will be the first to go—and in just a few short years from now. Following that comes the end of natural gas, which will plateau by 2030. Oil, meanwhile, should be squeezed out by the influx of electric vehicles.

But will it, really?

The energy crisis that began last year in Europe with short gas supplies fully unfolded this year after Russia slashed exports of the commodity to the EU. This disruption has pushed demand for fossil fuels higher than it was before the pandemic.

At the time, BP was forecasting that peak oil had already occurred in 2019. According to the oil major, oil demand would never again return to 2019 levels. On to of that, everyone who’s anyone in forecasts said that coal demand would never grow globally again, and gas would be a bridge fuel to the renewable energy future. Then gas started getting demonized along with oil as dirty and inappropriate. But that was then—before the crisis.

Now, coal demand has risen because of the gas squeeze in Europe, with countries reopening mothballed coal-powered plants, boosting oil production, and even converting gas-fired power plants to coal for the winter.

Politicians—along with the IEA—seem to believe that this is a short-term demand boost that will expire the moment gas markets return to normal. The problem with this belief is that gas markets will not return to normal in a week or even a month. In fact, it is unlikely that gas markets in Europe will ever return to normal because normal means getting 40 percent of the EU’s gas from Russia.

With new U.S. LNG supply slow to come online and replace the lost Russian pipeline flows, we could see strong coal demand for a few more years. And then China and India, and other Asian economies will continue using coal because it will remain cheaper than gas, especially liquefied gas, whose price has been driven sky-high by thirsty European buyers.

On the subject of oil demand, the IEA appears to believe that EVs will kill it beginning in the mid-2030s. Yet this would necessitate the production, sale, and use of many millions of EVs, which is far from certain because of the looming shortages in the metal and mineral world.

Warnings about copper supply have been coming from the mining industry and from analysts for months now. Trafigura was the latest to add its voice to them, saying earlier this month that global copper stocks had fallen to dangerously low levels, equal to about 4.9 days of global consumption. By the end of the year, Trafigura said at an FT event, this will be reduced to 2.7 days.

“It is not accidental that the EU has decided to bring forward the target of doubling its solar capacity from 2030 to 2025. All that requires a lot of copper,” Kostas Bintas, Trafigura co-head of metals and minerals trading, said.

“Look at electric vehicles everywhere, [the numbers on the road] are surprising to the upside. That’s a lot of copper too. As a result, we’ve been drawing down stocks throughout this very difficult year.”

What all these warnings are suggesting is pretty simple: there may not be enough raw materials for all the EVs—and solar farms and wind parks—that need to be sold to kill oil demand and usher in the renewable energy future.

According to the IEA, the transition is a matter of energy security, and the war in Ukraine has highlighted that and would likely act as a catalyst for a quicker transition. Indeed, the more locally produced energy a country has, the more secure it is. The problem is that the forms of renewable energy chosen to drive the transition are not very good at providing energy security.

The latest to make that clear was Goldman Sachs’ Jeffrey Currie, who told CNBC this week that some $3.8 trillion was invested in renewables over the past decade, and this massive investment only moved the share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix from 82 percent to 81 percent.

Now, Currie went on to note, this share might well be back at 82 percent because of the energy squeeze that has spurred more coal consumption. He also pointed out that the investments in renewables have been in capacity, but the capacity utilization factor of wind and solar installations tends to be quite low. This is what prevents wind and solar from providing the energy security the IEA’s Fatih Birol was talking about.

The International Energy Agency has become quite notorious in the past few years as a champion for the energy transition rather than an energy agency open to all forms of energy. Its emphasis on the transition needing to happen as fast as it can and it having zero causal links with the energy crisis has drawn some skepticism, most notably after the publication of its Road Map to Net Zero.

At the time, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister mocked the plan calling it “La La Land.” Interestingly, since the publication of the road map, demand for fossil fuels has indeed increased and has prompted the IEA itself to call for more investment in them after saying in the road map that we had no more need to invest in additional oil and gas production.

Like that road map, this latest WEO might go down in history as the latest IEA installment of wishful thinking rather than a reflection of any remotely plausible reality.

To tackle San Jose’s housing and homelessness crisis, Chavez wants to expedite construction of affordable units and make it easier for the state to appoint guardians for those on the streets who can’t care for themselves.

San Jose has too many “barriers to building housing in appropriate places,” Chavez said. “So one is, I would change those rules.” Chavez suggested expanding the number of times the city council can reevaluate the general plan that determines where housing can be built.

In an interview at her San Jose election headquarters with the Peninsula Press on Oct. 25, Chavez said that if elected, she would streamline the housing permitting process, expand mental health services, and foster a more robust and inclusive police department. The Peninsula Press interviewed her opponent, Matt Mahan, Oct. 20.

Chavez, 58, serves on the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors. She previously served as a member of the San Jose City Council and served as vice mayor in 2005 and 2006. She also served as the executive officer of the South Bay AFL-CIO Labor Council.

A goal to 'treat housing like medicine'

To meet the needs of people experiencing homelessness, Chavez said she supports a “housing-first model.” This strategy, she said, contrasts with approaches that require people to achieve sobriety before receiving access to housing.

Chavez said she instead wants to “treat housing like medicine” — providing those experiencing homelessness with secure housing first, while simultaneously offering services such as addiction treatment and job training to “help them stay housed.”

Chavez said that as mayor, she wants to ensure that people experiencing homelessness receive access to services more quickly.

“We’ve got to get much, much faster … we have got to get to same-day access,” she said.

“We’re not there yet, but we’ll get there,” she added.

Chavez’s mayoral opponent, Mahan, has expressed his support for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recently passed Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Act, which created a new judicial framework where first responders and family members can petition a judge to order treatment for people experiencing severe mental illness or addiction.

While Chavez largely supports the CARE Act and its new court systems, she said the state’s powers should extend further, especially in terms of conservatorship — court-appointed guardianship for adults deemed unable to care for themselves. The state’s current strict limitations on conservatorship constrain cities’ power to mandate treatment.

“My fear is that we are telling people that CARE Court’s going to be a solution when, in fact, we’ve not changed the rules around conservatorship enough to provide the ability to conserve someone — even when they so clearly, clearly cannot make decisions for themselves,” Chavez said.

While Chavez acknowledged lenient conservatorship laws had enabled abuse in the past, she also said that changes in legislation are necessary if CARE Court is going to be effective.

“What I think is the pendulum swung so far in one direction that it really has impeded our ability to help people that we know need the help,” Chavez said, adding that she hopes the city will invest in analyses that will better enable the judicial system and members of the public to intervene when someone needs care while still protecting that person’s civil rights.

Mahan told the Peninsula Press he supported 90-day periods of mandated care for people experiencing chronic homelessness and addiction. When asked if she agreed with that, Chavez said, “The city of San Jose doesn’t have the power to do that. That’s just, that’s not a real thing.”

'We need to build faster and more of everything'

Chavez supported Measure A, a $950 million housing bond passed in 2016, to provide funding for 4,800 affordable housing units across Santa Clara County. High inflation and increased building costs have slowed down housing projects in San Jose, and if elected mayor, Chavez said she wants “faster and more” affordable housing developments.

For people in a wide range of income brackets, housing affordability is a problem.

“You have to make $54 an hour here to be able to afford an apartment,” Chavez said.

“Measure A and all the work that we’re doing as a county is really imperative to stabilizing and sustaining people,” she added. “But the root cause is building more housing, making the permitting process move faster.”

She pointed to her time on the San Jose City Council when there were four opportunities each year to rezone properties for housing development. Now that chance comes annually. If elected mayor, she said she wants the city to make the rezoning process more accessible and efficient.

“We have to change those rules while we don’t slow down the pipeline,” she said.

To address the dearth of housing for professionals such as teachers, nurses and firefighters, Chavez said, the overall housing shortage needs to be addressed.

“We need to build faster and more of everything,” she said.

She said that due to the high cost of living in San Jose, many working people are just a paycheck or two away from homelessness.

Part of that is ensuring reliable employment. Chavez urged San Jose, Santa Clara County and private entities to partner and create a jobs training consortium to help low-income individuals find jobs that provide mobility and stability rather than short-term employment. She cited Caltrans as a good example of an employer that trains new hires and after a provisional period evaluates them for possible permanent jobs.

Tailoring police responses to community needs

Chavez has campaigned for expanding the police force to respond to the growth of San Jose’s population.

“When I served on the city council 16 years ago, we had 200 more police officers … than we do today. We have 100,000 more people,” she said.

Chavez said the shrinking police force has meant longer wait times for responses to calls dealing with emergencies such as assaults or missing children.

“We used to get to those calls in less than 10 minutes, and now we’re at 20,” she said. “So, there is no, in my opinion, no denying that we absolutely need to continue to restaff the police department.”

Chavez said she is conscious of the issue of systemic racism within the police force. Recent reporting by the Marshall Project, as well as state audits, found instances of bias and excessive force in the department.

The San Jose Police Officers’ Association and local civil rights activists have endorsed Chavez.

“That’s really important because to get both of those parties engaged, they have to trust that there’s going to be a process that they’re all going to be heard in,” she said.

She said that although changing the police culture will take time, she is excited for the opportunity to work with different coalitions “to decide what we want the culture of these institutions to be and then make it so.”

Working towards carbon neutrality in San Jose

Last November, the city of San Jose pledged to become carbon neutral by 2030. While Chavez supports the goal, she points to two critical areas in which she believes progress must be made: energy storage and electric transportation.

“Becoming fossil free is going to be our ability to store energy,” Chavez said.

Chavez said she supports research and development of battery technology to support renewable energy’s storage and on-demand release. Without sufficient energy storage, guaranteeing the energy needed to power the region is not possible during periods of high demand or when renewable sources are unreliable, such as overnight or in winter.

However, energy storage is only half the battle. As of spring 2022, more than 50% of San Jose’s carbon emissions come from private automobiles or other transportation sources. Chavez pointed to the need for expanded electric transportation options.

“I want to support the infrastructure development for transportation, including making sure that we’re moving our Valley Transportation Authority’s bus fleet onto electric vehicles.”

According to data from the city of San Jose’s Vision Zero Task Force, 2022 is on track to be the deadliest year on record for traffic crash fatalities — including pedestrians and cyclists — since at least 2011.

Chavez said more enforcement was needed. “Something happened during COVID-19 where people started driving aggressive and angry, and without enforcement, people know that they’re not going to get pulled over,” Chavez said.

LUXURY WOMEN TO WATCH 2023



Amy Astley

Global editorial director and U.S. editor in chief

Architectural Digest

New York

""My proudest achievement in luxury is definitely breathing new life into the sleeping beauty that was Architectural Digest""

What do you like most about your job?

There is no doubt that my favorite part of my job is the day the photo-shoot film — and/or the video — arrives.

As the team and I spend months — even years — tracking projects, it is very gratifying to have the final results in our hands.

I am always excited to share these images with our audience on all our many platforms: print, social, web and video.

Usually, the photographs exceed my expectations. It is always a moment where I feel great pride in our team, as it takes a village to produce content of this quality.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Communication is so important, especially as Architectural Digest is a global brand and we work closely with our fellow ADs in many other markets and time zones.

Architectural Digest is so much more than simply magazines now. Fresh content is appearing daily on the sites, the many social accounts and YouTube, along with in-real-life events, so there are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of platforms.

The operations are complex and there is a lot of content being shared. Fortunately, our teams have a lot of goodwill toward one another and we are very nimble. That helps tremendously.

What is your work priority for 2023?

My top priority for 2023 is to continue to develop Architectural Digest globally as one unified team sharing content seamlessly and efficiently.

I have big digital goals for each of Architectural Digest's seven markets, especially around traffic, audience and video. So this process has to be perfect.

Architectural Digest's buzzy videos and features often go viral, and for 2023 I am really focusing on creating major cultural moments that resonate with consumers along with the industry.

What is your proudest achievement?

My proudest achievement in luxury is definitely breathing new life into the sleeping beauty that was Architectural Digest.

I feel that we have preserved and, in fact, increased the prestige and authority of the product, while also creating cultural buzz and relevance with a fresh and inclusive editorial vision and a thriving digital presence which have won Architectural Digest an ever-increasing and younger digital audience.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

In 2023, luxury is certainly evolving to include meaningful experiences.

At Architectural Digest, especially post-pandemic, we see a real hunger for special in-real-life events, both for consumers and trade.

I am very focused on how Architectural Digest can offer this to readers and to the trade.

I think you see the extension of this in high-end home design, too. People want special pools, gardens, spas, gyms, Pilates studios, screening rooms, yoga and meditation spaces — places to either gather or to be alone and to have a transformative experience.

Stephanie Bennett

Cofounder/president

Diamond Spas Inc.

Frederick, CO

“My priority will be the same as it has been for the past 26 years: making sure Diamond Spas is producing an exceptional, quality product that stands out from other pool and spa manufacturers in the industry”

What do you like most about your job?

Diamond Spas offers a customized product built to client specifications. Therefore, no one project is like the next.

It is incredibly rewarding to walk through the fabrication department and witness the amazing products being built.

Seeing the collaboration between the clients and our design team, then moving forward through engineering and fabrication is an added bonus. The end result is a stunning hand-crafted aquatic product, unique like each one of our clients.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

As with all businesses, supply chain issues were complicated to navigate through during the pandemic.

Diamond Spas fared well, but it was a constant stress ensuring we had metal, jets, pumps, spa controls, et cetera.

We utilize the best manufacturers in the industry for all of our pool and spa equipment. These manufacturers worked closely with us and made Diamond Spas a priority in getting the product needed to build our product. I feel fortunate to say we never missed a ship date.

Thankfully, our inventory stock is back up to 100 percent. Keeping a close eye on the supply chain will be an ongoing task and will continue through 2023.

What is your work priority for 2023?

My priority will be the same as it has been for the past 26 years: making sure Diamond Spas is producing an exceptional, quality product that stands out from other pool and spa manufacturers in the industry.

Our product line is artistic, sophisticated and caters to the needs and stylish preferences of our clients. Our goal has always been to exceed client expectations.

What is your proudest achievement?

My proudest achievement is manufacturing an upscale aquatic product that is sustainable.

The entire Diamond Spas’ product line is produced from recycled sheet metal, stainless steel or copper. The recycled content for new stainless-steel sheets lies between 75 to 80 percent.

Our copper sheets come from 95 to 99 percent recycled copper. All Diamond Spas vessel shells are 100 percent recyclable making them fully sustainable.

Stainless steel and copper are wonderful materials to work with. They are eco-compatible, aesthetically appealing and highly durable.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

I believe high-end consumers will continue to invest in outdoor living. These living areas are becoming more extravagant with deluxe outdoor kitchens, multiple pools, spas, cold therapy pools, swim spas, fire features, water features and audio systems.

I believe our clientele will continue to want luxury aquatic products designed and fabricated to meet their personal wants and needs.

Diamond Spas can fabricate any shape, depth, seating arrangement, infinity edges, glass walls, et cetera. The list of what we are capable of fabricating is endless.

I have found that our clientele appreciates the numerous possibilities made available to them when working with the Diamond Spas’ team. We admire their creativity and look forward to making their visions become a reality.

Lucrezia Buccellati Wildenstein

Co-creative director

Buccellati

New York

“Using unique sources of inspiration and working to see them come to life through our one-of-a-kind pieces is a true testament to luxury craftsmanship”

What do you most like about your job?

I love expressing myself through design. I also love finding inspiration in the beautiful jewelry I am surrounded by: recent collections, pieces from the archives or new designs that I am working on.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

While it is exciting to continue to find ways to inspire younger generations, it is certainly a balancing act to retain the timeless DNA of Buccellati, while also adapting to the latest trends.

What is your work priority for 2023?

For 2023, our goal is to further expand the market in the United States and strengthen the awareness of Buccellati among new, engaged audiences and clients.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

My proudest achievement so far has been working to bring masterpieces from the art world into our jewelry.

Using unique sources of inspiration and working to see them come to life through our one-of-a-kind pieces is a true testament to luxury craftsmanship.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

In 2023, I believe that offering a unique client experience will continue to be a great focus for luxury.

With that, I foresee a higher demand for custom and bespoke pieces, with a celebration of extraordinary, one-of-a-kind and special luxury items at the forefront of client desires.

Brisa Carleton

CEO

Grace de Monaco

New York

""Luxury connoisseurs are no longer simply focused on products that meet the highest standards of design and creativity, but are now demanding sustainability, transparency and a greater global conscience from the brands they love and choose to purchase""

What do you most like about your job?

It is a privilege to lead a purpose-driven luxury brand that represents such an iconic legacy.

Princess Grace's impact and influence live on not only through her timeless style, which inspires Grace de Monaco, but also through the example she set as a philanthropist and humanitarian.

We have an incredible team at the Grace de Monaco who are equally passionate about our exquisite products, and we take great pride in the fact that all revenues from the sale of Grace de Monaco products support Princess Grace’s wish to nurture the brightest stars of tomorrow in theater, dance and film through the Princess Grace Foundation.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

The biggest challenge we faced was creating an entirely new luxury brand that lives alongside established, centuries-old luxury houses globally.

It's incredibly important to us that we stay true to Princess Grace's ethos. During her lifetime she was passionate about supporting young artists and pursuing modern design, so we spent a lot of time ensuring that our fragrances and silks reflect a modern aesthetic that she would have wanted for today, rather than staying tied in the past.

We are fortunate to be working with top French luxury designers, many of whom have a personal link to Monaco, so we are able to obtain real authenticity in everything we create.

What is your work priority for 2023?

2023 is going to be an exciting year for us.

The Grace de Monaco team has worked tirelessly to produce our initial product offering and bring it to market in record time, despite the industry being upended due to inventory and supply chain issues over the last two years.

We launched initially with Neiman Marcus and have a roster of the world’s renowned luxury retailers to follow.

Our priority is the global expansion of our brand as our new partnerships come to life in the U.K., Middle East and Asia.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Launching the first-ever luxury brand created entirely for good is our greatest achievement to date.

We created a new business model as a modern way to continue to fund the Princess Grace Awards program whose mission is to uphold her legacy and her passion for supporting emerging artists.

Grace de Monaco is wholly owned by the Princess Grace Foundation, overseen by Prince Albert of Monaco, [and] which supports emerging artists in theater, dance and film.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

Luxury connoisseurs are no longer simply focused on products that meet the highest standards of design and creativity, but are now demanding sustainability, transparency and a greater global conscience from the brands they love and choose to purchase.

I see this emphasis on purpose and positive impact becoming even more important in 2023 and into the future.

Ayesha Coker

Vice president of marketing

Porsche North America

Atlanta

“Even during the current transformational push for electrification and new technologies within the automotive industry, we prioritize our customers, meaning we must continue to meet and exceed their expectations”

What do you most like about your job?

There is nothing like seeing the excitement and joy of someone after having taken the wheel of a Porsche for the first time. Without exception, it warms my heart to see that instant emotional connection that people feel from driving our sports cars.

So, for me, the most gratifying part of the role is creating those unique and memorable luxury brand experiences that’ll last a lifetime.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Since assuming my new role overseeing marketing for the U.S., one challenge I have encountered is balancing my new executive committee duties with staying closely engaged with my team, dealers and customers.

While navigating this new territory, I have been fortunate to have a strong and dependable team, which has given me the leeway to prioritize what requires my input while delegating other responsibilities where needed.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Next year marks our 75th anniversary. To celebrate this milestone, we are planning several events that will excite our customers and fans of the brand.

Most noteworthy is our signature event, Rennsport Reunion VII, which is a family reunion of sorts, where we will all gather at Laguna Seca near Monterey, California to celebrate the racing heritage, new products and experiences of Porsche.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

After building a 12-year career with a brand and team you love, I would have to say my recent promotion to vice president of marketing for Porsche Cars North America is one of my greatest professional achievements. To achieve this goal with a global luxury brand that you believe in and have grown with over the years is truly a privilege.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

For Porsche, taking the customer experience to the next level is the benchmark that we continue to push in a competitive luxury segment.

Even during the current transformational push for electrification and new technologies within the automotive industry, we prioritize our customers, meaning we must continue to meet and exceed their expectations.

Emilie Cotter

Chief communications officer

Audi of America

Washington, DC

“Luxury is at its best when we curate the meaningful connection points between our values, our products and our people”

What do you most like about your job?

Audi of America and the automotive industry, at large, is in the middle of a massive transformation.

I love that my job gives me the opportunity to create new pathways forward and build teams to advance such significant progress.

Audi’s focus is to lead the way to an electric, more sustainable future, and communications is a powerful catalyst for that change.

Not only are we driving customers to an entirely new experience with electrification, we are also bringing together key stakeholders and acting as a bridge to drive meaningful progress in the business.

Working in the premium category means that we get to do all of that while delivering unique experiences.

One of the great joys of my job is delivering moments that make people feel special and cared for. I want them to remember Audi as a brand that brings a little memorable magic as well as a fantastic experience through our vehicles.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Without challenge you cannot grow, so I spend a lot of time thinking about the current roadblocks as well as what might be ahead.

My job is to guide teams, to do the right things at the right time, to push the business on the right path and also looking forward to steer the strategic direction that will set the communications framework for the longer term.

That balance of solving immediate business needs while setting the stage for the future is an ongoing challenge that I really love.

What is your work priority for 2023?

My top priority for 2023 is sustainable acceleration – moving at speed and scale while taking care of my team. As a brand, our goals and objectives are bold, and we want to push forward aggressively.

I am really aware we need to achieve these ambitions in a way that also places a premium on our people.

Now more than ever, teams need explicit support to build in time and space to create, think and rejuvenate while managing the needs of the business.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I am proud to work for Audi and there are so many programs I could mention – from Monterey Car Week to our exceptional dinner series with noma, the launch of our Malibu Design Loft and the creation of our first-ever Audi City Guide.

But what I am really most proud of is that our work has a purpose.

Luxury is at its best when we curate the meaningful connection points between our values, our products and our people.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

There is no singular definition of luxury. It evolves and morphs with trends, cultural moments, economic shifts and individual perspectives. Sometimes it is scarcity, other times it is badging or even the freedom of time and space.

In 2023 I believe “discovery” will play a big role in luxury – as time continues to be limited and digital algorithms dictate much of what we see online.

I think experiences, artists and creators off the beaten path will become even more coveted. And as someone who loves to seek out the unexpected, I cannot wait.

Haein Dorin

Senior vice president of operations

Highsnobiety

New York

“Working with incredible brands like Gucci, Saint Laurent, Burberry and many more, I am proud to say each production and project we execute continues to innovate from the previous season to evolve with our audience.”

What do you most like about your job?

As the general manager and U.S. lead in operations, being able to nurture, grow and support talent across the organization is my passion. Connecting the right individuals across the organization to collaborate and cultivate our best work with brands and editorially.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Highsnobiety, as a rule, never stops looking to the future and, as a result, is continually evolving as a business. It is the best kind of challenge to continue to match that evolution at every step.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Being connected to more brands that are searching for their brand to be rediscovered, and reach the cultural pioneer.

We have had some amazing projects with a variety of brands and have had the opportunity to show up in culture and encourage discovery of the story behind the brand and we would like to continue fostering that growth.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Each story we cover and brand we help reach the cultural pioneer becomes our proudest achievement.

Our team continues to innovate and push the envelope for each project we deliver.

Working with incredible brands like Gucci, Saint Laurent, Burberry and many more, I am proud to say each production and project we execute continues to innovate from the previous season to evolve with our audience.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The evolution of luxury is something our team is constantly thinking about. A few years ago, we launched a white paper called ""The New Luxury,"" taking a look at some of these pretty seismic shifts which have been taking place in the space.

The work was really well-received by the industry, which was fantastic to see, and so we partnered with Boston Consulting Group to continue to put out forecasting and observations about the luxury space, most recently releasing the ""Luxury 3.0"" white paper earlier this summer.

Julie Faupel

Founder/CEO

REALM Global

Jackson, WY

“At the end of the day, REALM’s commitment is to ensure that we are providing tools and connections that optimize the results for our constituents and their clients and producing those outcomes will stay strongly in our purview through 2023”

What do you most like about your job?

I love being a community builder.

Enabling connections that help people thrive in their personal and professional lives is so exciting.

I think that the power and importance of networking has never been more profound and we have a unique opportunity to define how future communities assemble, interact and influence.

The REALM membership is not only a very unique community, but it is also comprised of other “builders” who inspire me with their creativity and desire to shape the future of belonging.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

I think that we are in a period where technology is exacerbating the speed and pace of change more than ever and the importance of connection and communication is critical.

Working in a virtual environment, keeping up with the demands of growth across multiple geographies in tumultuous times is challenging.

Our membership performs at the highest level of service in our industry, and they are constantly elevating. Maintaining those same standards within REALM is our commitment and we take that responsibility very seriously.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Our focus is bringing REALM to other luxury verticals that help to support the purpose and network of trusted advisors.

We have had so much fun in 2022 as we have been able to physically convene again and we are excited to welcome other complementary disciplines to the community, both in-person and virtually.

At the end of the day, REALM’s commitment is to ensure that we are providing tools and connections that optimize the results for our constituents and their clients, and producing those outcomes will stay strongly in our purview through 2023.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I am humbled that I have had the opportunity to manifest an idea into something that no longer is being shaped by only me and my perception of luxury.

For me, REALM is the luxury achievement that has resulted in connections with people that inspire me and challenge me to be better in all respects of my life – what a gift.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

There are so many divisive factors that have shaped our latest chapter in history.

Now, as we are all emerging from a truly transformational time, luxury has an opportunity to bring people even closer together, convening communities and taking down silos.

I see luxury as being technology and innovation-enabled but more human than ever.

Jennifer Fay

Owner

Linen Alley

Jackson, WY

“My priority is fine tailoring the balance between the unparalleled innovation in design and the mastery and sophistication of crafting your own personal sanctuary with the unique combination of luxury bedding and luxury mattresses”

What do you like most about your job?

My favorite part of my job always has been and is still discovering and sourcing the world’s finest, most inspired products. Never settling for the ordinary, daily striving to achieve and maintain our legacy as a luxury brand, our distinctive sense of place in Jackson Hole.

My enduring mission: supplying form and function, beauty and comfort together. I cocreated Linen Alley 18 years ago, crafted to provide an elevated shopping experience that is today still rooted in my personal ethos on styling.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

The biggest challenge by far is market volatility and waning consumer confidence.

Coming off the supply chain issues in 2021 and one of the hottest economies, there was huge motivation to maintain a backstock of inventory to meet immediate demand.

But in 2022, with global turmoil and recession fears, it is finding balance. How much and what to inventory to meet these two conflicting demands is very challenging.

What is your work priority for 2023?

I sell the crafted luxury of the everyday. My priority is fine tailoring the balance between the unparalleled innovation in design and the mastery and sophistication of crafting your own personal sanctuary with the unique combination of luxury bedding and luxury mattresses.

As restful sleep takes center stage, the importance of spoiling your senses in dreamy comfort is my everyday priority.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

The story of Linen Alley is a history of serving the community I was born in and love. A store built by women, run by women, beauty and comfort are woven into every fiber of what Linen Alley has to offer.

We have achieved the finest selection and most exquisite collection of products available; impeccably curated by my dream team of capable women with a combined 50-plus years of textile experience. This unparalleled combination is my proudest achievement.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

Luxury has always been synonymous with quality. As prices climb for lower-end pre-luxury items, customers are more conscious about the value of what they buy.

Luxury providers like Linen Alley have a prime opportunity to legitimize and define the authenticity of what luxury is and why the investments in craftsmanship and quality are not just for the most exclusive population. [It is about] form and function, everyday luxury that makes your life better.

In some spaces, like your home, luxury items that perform as exceptionally as they look are being realized as a crucial part of a more healthy and happy life.

Candice Fragis

Luxury brand consultant

London

“We were at the forefront of what is now called the circular economy with the aim of de-stigmatizing older season product and re-educating the consumer about quality versus seasonality”

What do you like most about your job?

The diversity of working across a range of businesses and brands, working from the start of the creative process through to the commercial growth strategies. This has evolved within my clients from traditional retail and brands to digital fashion and AI technology.

Sustainability has always been a passion and focus for me from the start of my career. I am now able to be selective with which clients I onboard and only engage with businesses who share that passion, so we are ultimately working towards a common goal of making the industry more conscious and responsible.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

As a consultant, my role is now to advise and help rally teams to make changes and move in new directions without having the full accountability of actioning those changes.

Having notoriously been in very hands-on roles, it can be difficult to step aside and watch how that advice lands.

That said the upside is I too am always learning, from how different teams and businesses navigate change and interpret these strategies, which provides growth and opportunity for me personally.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Helping brands and businesses be more authentically conscious in their product strategy, their core DNA and subsequent messaging whilst incorporating truly sustainable endeavors to their existing and upcoming roadmap.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Being a founding member of launching The Outnet back in 2019 with Natalie Massenet and Stephanie Phair.

We were at the forefront of what is now called the circular economy with the aim of de-stigmatizing older season product and re-educating the consumer about quality versus seasonality.

This is something that is now very well understood and a core proposition for most brands and luxury businesses, yet at the time it was incredibly disruptive within luxury fashion.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The continued focus on unique brand experiences whilst creating community, direct customer focused service, personalization and digital authentication coupled with digital-twin NFTs.

Linsey Gallagher

President/CEO

Visit Napa Valley

Napa, CA

“The biggest challenges for our organization and our nearly 500 hospitality partners often come in the form of circumstances out of our control, such as the pandemic, wildfires and earthquakes, but it is how we respond to these outside influences that makes me proud to be part of Napa Valley’s travel and hospitality industry”

What do you most like about your job?

There are many aspects of this role that keep me challenged and motivated.

I have the great privilege of working with a broad range of partners all working at the top of their professions at our resorts, hotels, our country’s leading wineries and restaurants to tell the story of Napa Valley.

I feel honored to be a steward of the Napa Valley brand on the world stage. And there is nothing more rewarding than getting to work and contributing in a positive way where I live — and play.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

The biggest challenges for our organization and our nearly 500 hospitality partners often come in the form of circumstances out of our control, such as the pandemic, wildfires and earthquakes, but it is how we respond to these outside influences that makes me proud to be part of Napa Valley’s travel and hospitality industry.

It never ceases to amaze me how our community comes together during these times with a common goal to respond with a solutions-oriented mindset.

Most recently, we combined efforts with our Napa Valley wine and agriculture industries to fund 24/7 wildfire sensor cameras to help keep our community safe during the remainder of this year’s wildfire season.

It is the type of collaborative approach that preserves Napa Valley as the world class destination that it is.

What is your work priority for 2023?

The hospitality industry, in general, was one of the hardest hit during the pandemic and has yet to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels for many destinations.

As a rural, four-season destination with a reputation for a best-in-class hospitality experience, Napa Valley fared better than many destinations and was a bright spot in California’s overall recovery.

So, in 2023, my priority for our organization is focused on accelerating Napa Valley’s continued economic recovery. That includes not only promoting Napa Valley with marketing initiatives that reach our ideal visitor, but also supporting the industry with smart and thoughtful programs that inspire careers in the Napa Valley, shine a light on the sustainability efforts undertaken by our county, hospitality industries and contribute to solutions that make our community a better place to live and work, such as housing, transportation and recreation.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Coming out of the pandemic, the strength of the Napa Valley brand on the world stage allowed us to recover ahead of the curve, winning back more than our fair share of visitors.

Simply put, today’s consumer is willing to pay a premium for the Napa Valley experience and we cannot take that for granted.

For the luxury-minded traveler, Napa Valley was their first, and often their second, trip once they felt ready to travel. But it is often the surprise and delight of our rustic elegance and experiences when visitors come here that creates loyal consumers, who count Napa Valley among their favorite repeat destinations.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

There were several silver linings coming out of the pandemic.

In today’s world full of unknowns, time spent with family and friends is the new luxury.

With its scenic beauty and slower pace, Napa Valley is ideally situated to be the backdrop for those meaningful luxury experiences.

Kimberly Grant

Global head of restaurants/bars and senior vice president of food and beverage

Four Season Hotels and Resorts

Washington, D.C.

“What is relevant today may or may not be as relevant in the future and our job is to always differentiate between trends that are fleeting versus ones that will stand the test of time”

What do you most like about your job?

I love the relentless pursuit of excellence – taking what is very good to great, and what is great to epic.

As the global head of restaurants and bars at Four Seasons, I am fortunate to lead and inspire the best team of hospitality craftspeople in the world.

To be honest, it is hard for me to call it a job, it is more like a life-long passion – I rarely think of myself as “having a job.”

Working hard and excelling have been my life’s craft and fashion.

Beginning my career as a server, where I ultimately became president of the publicly traded restaurant company after 21 years there, helped foster an appreciation and focus on deeply entrenched culture and standards of excellence.

I am proud of my journey and love that I get to play a small part in helping others do the same.

There is tremendous pride and passion in the Four Seasons mission and value system, it is simply wonderful to be a part of.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

There are many near-term challenges in the hospitality industry, especially now post-pandemic.

However, long-term my team’s biggest challenge is anticipating the future needs of our guests.

In most of our projects, we begin working on the curation of the restaurant and bar portfolio within the hotel as early as five years before opening.

Our success is driven by our ability to be forward thinking, bold and innovative in not only the design of the food and beverage outlets, but also the cuisines they feature and the format they are provided.

What is relevant today may or may not be as relevant in the future and our job is to always differentiate between trends that are fleeting versus ones that will stand the test of time.

What is your work priority for 2023?

We are focused on improving the single view of our guests from a restaurant and bar perspective.

Our restaurants and bars are an important gateway to the Four Seasons brand and serve as the heartbeat of many of our hotels around the world.

That said, many of our restaurants and bars also compete directly in the local dining scene and have become dining destinations in their own right.

Our efforts in 2023 focus around understanding the needs of not only guests staying in our hotels, but also guests who travel and live in the market and frequent our restaurants and bars. These groups are equally important to our overall business model and may not always have the same needs or communication preferences. This is a capability we want to further refine, and plan to do so through tech capabilities, CRM, data and insights, and more.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Leading by example.

I have been fortunate along my career journey to have had many mentors that saw potential in my abilities and gave me the opportunity to learn and grow.

My most trusted mentor exposed me to the luxury sector and offered me the opportunity to serve as a friend, advisor and board member to Blackberry Farm.

But he also demonstrated early in my career that women have no career limits.

By the 1990s, he already had accomplished women on our board of directors, and most of his executive team, of which I was a part, were women.

For the last five years, I have been serving on the board of PFGC, a Fortune 200 public company.

And now at Four Seasons, I feel like I have joined yet another industry-leading organization that is committed to valuing inclusivity and belonging as a key differentiator in our success.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The concept of frictionless experiences is something I see emerging and evolving in 2023.

Luxury and ultra-luxury products and experiences are more costly than ever. The Cost of Living Extremely Well Index (CLEWI) took the biggest jump since 2008 and is nearly double the U.S. Consumer Price Index.

The luxury consumer is paying more for the same products and experiences, and frictionless moments are what will differentiate and balance the value equation in my opinion.

People with means are willing to pay for quality and excellence, but the need and expectation for accessing the product, service or experience easily and seamlessly – that is what money cannot always guarantee.

At Four Seasons, luxury is truly our love language – and that means delivering experiences that minimize friction and create those “forever” moments for our guests.

Rani Grube

Managing director

Chateau du Sureau

Fresno, CA

“Providing luxury service requires staying two steps ahead of the guests who consistently create hospitality challenges through their diverse personalities and expectations”

What do you most like about your job?

There is a degree of gratification that can only be achieved by leading a team that garners respect [by] providing exceptional hospitality. This is ongoing and consistent and the satisfaction it brings me never gets old.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Providing luxury service requires staying two steps ahead of the guests who consistently create hospitality challenges through their diverse personalities and expectations. But this is what true world-class hospitality is all about, and as the leader of a team of service professionals, it is my duty to inspire them to do the best that can be done.

What is your work priority for 2023?

The future of hospitality does not rely on the physical amenities that a hotel provides. One can find the facilities, services and amenities that they require at numerous establishments throughout one’s travels.

What differentiates properties now, and in the future, lies in the hands of the personal attention bestowed upon every guest. I believe in 2023 this will become more and more apparent, and I intend to continue to make it my mission to staff and train my team with this as my top priority.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

My proudest achievement is to be able to receive my returning guests who insist on including me as part of the special moments and anniversaries they celebrate with us. It is a heartwarming privilege.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

As stated earlier, the personal service provided by the property will become more prominent when one defines true luxury travel.

Marci Hirshleifer Penn

Global personal shopping director/women’s buyer

Hirshleifers

Manhasset, NY

“Nowadays, a new campaign shoot or collection is not just that – it is a huge story that the brand is telling”

What do you most like about your job?

I love the way a great outfit can really transform a person’s self. It adds this little spark when it is done right, so I love seeing that moment in my clients and being there for a lot of their special life moments.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

My job is very on, on, on and I love that about it.

I love working with my family every day and making sure my clients are happy with their purchases and the help we give them.

That being said, my biggest challenge is knowing when I need to switch off and take a second with my family or myself.

Now, I am incredibly lucky to have a team of two women and myself who really love what we do as much as I do and we are able to share that load.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Getting back to fashion week.

This year is the first year since COVID-19 we have traveled for fashion week and we are slowly getting back into that routine. I miss it so much and my clients really love that inside access, so next year is all about that.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

My proudest achievement in luxury is how incredibly driven and strong my family is as a unit.

This is around the 112th year our store has been operating and it is such a testament to my mom and her two sisters and my uncle and cousins.

We all work really hard in our respective fields throughout the store, and we all take such pride in how the store operates. Here’s to another 112 years.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

I think luxury is evolving in storytelling, which is organically what Hirshleifer has always been about.

Nowadays, a new campaign shoot or collection is not just that – it is a huge story that the brand is telling.

I think a big reason why a lot of physical retail stores did not work out in the past is because there was not that storytelling.

My family and I are in the store five days a week, we are on the floor, we are talking to clients and I think that really shows.

“The luxury industry expresses the highest values of a society at any one time – the more we spend on investing in our own growth, the better choices we will make”

What do you most like about your job?

Designing and bringing experiences to life in beautiful nature-based settings around the world.

Our brand of hospitality is about discovering magic in everyday life and evoking a sense of greater interconnectedness.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Defining and executing our vision of “good growth” – growing our footprint and positive impact at the same time, whilst minimizing the negative impact of our operations and the travel industry.

Given our founding origins in the tin mine transformation of Laguna Phuket, we aim to be an exemplar for the “green transition” of our generation.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Evolving our branded experiences and business model into the digital arena and creating purposeful value for our loyal Banyan Tree community.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Defining it in the light of personal growth, and conscious choice and consumption.

The luxury industry expresses the highest values of a society at any one time – the more we spend on investing in our own growth, the better choices we will make.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

Nature as luxury, a return to the wild and harnessing the mind are megatrends we see continuing, and which we have begun to create with Banyan Tree Escape and Banyan Tree Veya.

Guia Llamas

Hotel manager

Baccarat Hotel

New York

“My focus will be on maintaining — or better yet, surpassing — the results we achieved this year and coming up with ideas and initiatives that will add value and continuously differentiate Baccarat Hotel New York from other luxury hotel groups”

What do you like most about your job?

I have been very fortunate to have found what I love to do at the very beginning of my career and even more fortunate to have met individuals who held my hand and walked me through this journey.

In my current role, there are many things that I truly enjoy, but most particularly, building a brand and setting the stage for future Baccarat hotels and resorts, the entrepreneurial spirit and the opportunity to make a difference and to give back.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

The balancing act of making all stakeholders equally happy. I know this is rarely possible but getting to at least 85 percent would be ideal. This keeps me on my toes — heels, actually.

Staying true to the values I was taught and the discipline that I developed certainly helps.

What is your work priority in 2023?

My focus will be on maintaining — or better yet, surpassing — the results we achieved this year and coming up with ideas and initiatives that will add value and continuously differentiate Baccarat Hotel New York from other luxury hotel groups.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I am most proud of being part of the pre-opening team of Baccarat Hotel New York. Everything I experienced there was truly special including working with the designers, going to the maison and manufactory in France, seeing the artists install their work, listening to the Baccarat craftsmen passionately talk about the crystals, collaborating with the team in putting the standards together and witnessing the hotel come to life as each chandelier and all crystal pieces were installed.

I have previously opened hotels under different brands but nothing compared to the extent of this opening. I still get goosebumps when I look back at this experience eight years ago. It was indeed rewarding, both personally and professionally, and it has stayed with me after all these years.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The traditional definition of luxury in terms of quality and value will remain.

However, the audience will be wider or may be different considering the younger generations that have emerged in the top-tier market segment. The focus will continue to shift to include social responsibility.

While we all believe human contact is important in the luxury world, increased digital services and technology will undoubtedly come into play.

I anticipate more collaborations amongst luxury brands.

We have started seeing this evolution now and I can only imagine this becoming stronger and more evident in the coming years. I am excited.

Jennifer Locke

CEO

Crimson Wine Group

Napa, CA

“There is very little tolerance or room for missteps, so we are hyper-focused on brilliant execution on all aspects of commercial business and increasing our wine quality”

What do you most like about your job?

I like creating and being part of high-performing teams that galvanize around a shared mission, goal or objective.

I have worked in siloed, blame-game companies, and I much prefer working with talented, collaborative and kind coworkers, like the ones I have at Crimson.

We put the physical and mental wellness of our people first — not reopening wineries unless it is safe to do so, allowing employees to work remotely as needed, et cetera.

This emphasis on wellness and collaborative culture has helped us grow our business significantly and execute major structural changes to wholesale partnerships and commercial teams during the COVID-19 era, when a lot of our competitors have lost share. And, of course, our wines.

It is an honor to steward the properties in our portfolio, and I take great pride in knowing that what we create brings our customers joy.

Our wines are shared across family dinner tables, uncorked in Michelin-starred restaurants, carefully saved by collectors for special occasions and glasses are raised at important milestones.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

I started at Crimson two months before the COVID-19 lockdown and not long before major California wildfires impacted our team and harvest, threatening both the lives and livelihoods of our people.

As CEO, my job is to look forward and prepare for the future — to focus on the organization’s vision and mission.

It has been challenging to lead the team through the external pressures of the last few years, while also gearing up the company for the future.

All the change, hardships and uncertainty have helped build our resiliency, though, and made restructuring our teams and wholesale route-to-market perhaps a bit easier, or at least not as daunting, in retrospect.

I am pleased with our overall performance and am focused now on implementing our long-term strategic plan.

What is your work priority for 2023?

The number one commodity in the luxury space is time. We want our customers to feel like their time with us is well-spent and enjoyable.

To bring our unique brand identities to life, we design luxury experiences online, in stores and in-person that all share the same brand DNA and messaging.

It seems simple, but executing at a high level takes the entire team to be aligned, including our external partners.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

While the wine segment is under a fair amount of pressure from premium spirits and RTDs, the high-end, luxury wine segment is growing.

At Crimson, we are investing and repositioning our core luxury brands, and taking share from competitors in the process.

While some in our industry have stalled or retrenched, we have invested in and upgraded our tasting rooms, vineyard properties, wine quality, customer-service technology and wholesale partnerships.

I am proud of how we have leaned into our luxury brand proposition and made sure it is delivering.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

In the wine space, the next 24 months will be a defining time for many brands.

Many wineries are coming off shorter vintages and significant channel swings, from off-premise to ecommerce and then to on-premise, as customers returned to restaurants and bars.

Those wineries that have strong brand affinity and reacted to the consumer’s desire to channel-shift over the last two-and-a-half years should have, hopefully, built brand equity.

That was our goal at Crimson. We have taken prices in line with our categories but are carefully watching our re-order rates by channel and account.

Our more established brands, like Pine Ridge Vineyards and Seghesio Family Vineyards, tend to do very well in times of turmoil.

With inflation and uncertainty in the economy, the well-established brands that best deliver on the value proposition usually prevail.

There is very little tolerance or room for missteps, though, so we are hyper-focused on brilliant execution of all aspects of commercial business and increasing our wine quality.

Molly Melville

Brand ambassador

The Macallan

New York

“Getting to be a part of a movement which challenges mindsets and pushes boundaries of centuries old traditions is also something I thrive at and I am proud to be a part of that journey”

What do you most like about your job?

The Macallan has given me so many opportunities to connect with people from all walks of life through my storytelling, whether it be introducing individuals to The Macallan or sharing a dram of whisky with lifelong fans.

Educating those not only about a passion of mine, but also [about] my home of Scotland is a dream come true.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Being a young female in a male-dominated industry has been my biggest challenge.

However, getting to be a part of a movement that challenges mindsets and pushes boundaries of centuries-old traditions is also something I thrive at, and I am proud to be a part of that journey.

What is your work priority for 2023?

My work priority for 2023 is to continue finding new ways to be inclusive in an exclusive industry. Using social media is a great tool that allows me to make new connections.

I aim to bring fresh ideas and new opportunities to introduce The Macallan to an evolving and diverse clientele.

I am also very lucky to have the opportunity to partner with inspiring individuals and look forward to partnering with more in 2023.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Launching our exclusive Distil Your World New York in the iconic Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Plaza is my proudest achievement in luxury.

Originating from a rural area in Speyside, Scotland, I never imagined I would be center stage of one of New York's major landmarks toasting to over 200 people with an awe-inspiring skyline view featuring the Empire State Building as the backdrop. It is a memory I will cherish forever.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

Luxury is constantly evolving and in order to engage with a new generation of luxury consumers, a strong focus on sustainability is vital. I am grateful to be part of The Macallan whose recent sustainability efforts reflect these values.

For example, The Macallan has a new energy efficient distillery in Speyside which helps protect the environment and supports biodiversity. We now have 90 percent electric vehicles on the estate and electric car chargers for our guests and employees.

Additionally, sustainability continues to be at the forefront for The Macallan through their global partnership with Bentley Motors, where the two work together to create a more sustainable future by unveiling their first product collaboration concept: The Macallan Horizon, the inspirational and highly innovative limited-edition single malt whisky.

Tina Necrason

Executive vice president for residential

Montage International

Irvine, CA

“There is a transformation occurring within luxury between both the classic and established consumer and a new luxury consumer”

What do you most like about your job?

What I like most about my job is having the opportunity and flexibility within my residential business discipline to work autonomously, which allows for growth and is a stimulant to challenge ourselves to think outside the box – whether it is related to processes, implementing new programs, enhancing our offerings or working with our talented teams on their development. It can all be achieved while being fully supported by our core business partner within our hospitality enterprise. It is incredibly inspiring and dynamic to work within this type of environment.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

The greatest challenge in my work is managing business growth and mitigating risks of volatility in our luxury real estate environment. It is critical to the success of our overall business to maintain the integrity of our core service standards and practices to enrich the lives of our owners.

Each day having the agility to move between strategic and tactical initiatives as we continue to grow our portfolio — all within a competitive landscape — while carefully managing all of the daily and critical aspects of my role, can be difficult to delicately balance, alongside all of the unexpected situations that might arise in the midst of it all.

Every significant challenge, however, brings opportunity.

I thrive in tackling every new situation with laser focus to deliver solutions that will address needs both short and long term.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Looking ahead to 2023, my work priority is planning for new innovations by implementing new real estate offerings.

Each year I look at ways to increase our benchmarks of success, leveraging momentum coming from recent events like Pendry Residences West Hollywood, where we achieved record-breaking real estate prices this summer and going into next year is no exception.

I am planning with our team for the launch of a new real estate product geared towards enhancing the luxury lifestyle offering, but with a fresh view and alternative to our more traditional residential projects. It will provide a new way for brand loyalists and those seeking a personalized approach to fully serviced living, a way to enjoy the benefits of ownership, commensurate with their personal desire for time with their families.

My aim is to try and bring to market a new concept with precision and thoughtfulness around leveraging our core business model.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I was fortunate in the early days of my career to be part of the core team in the concept, creation and execution of a luxury brand extension at The Ritz-Carlton Club, which afforded me the opportunity for an invaluable foundation, that has served me well in every capacity throughout my career in the luxury space.

It truly fueled my passion for luxury and the lessons learned and the great responsibility early on to protect the integrity of an iconic brand. To nurture it, grow it and appreciate all that comes with it has resulted in my proudest achievement to date.

If not for having a role at that time at the inception of the business line, I do not think I would have been exposed or supporting the drive of those valuable lessons and experiences which allowed me to grow. That perspective rooted me in my beliefs and understanding of luxury in many unexpected ways.

This has been an important milestone that I am so grateful to have recognized many years ago and look forward to another pinnacle achievement in the future, whereby I can impact and contribute much more to the world of luxury.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

Based on luxury global trends and the continued demand for goods and services within every sector of luxury, I believe 2023 will bring some new perspective, particularly within some of the more established brands.

The focus over the past few years has been to create more personalized relationships with customers and strengthen brand affinities and experiences.

As the basis related to these movements, I think 2023 might include an enhanced view of focusing perhaps on quality versus quantity and an elevated focus on loyalty, along with customized products and services to meet the needs and desires of the luxury consumer and the insight as to what drives their lifestyle.

In addition, I think we will see the value and interest in perhaps a younger demographic and seek ways to take the principles of a brand and speak to what resonates with a new luxury buyer focused on both short-term and long-term aspects.

There is a transformation occurring within luxury between both the classic and established consumer and a new luxury consumer.

“In a soft market, the brokers who truly know the business are the ones who are going to shine”

What do you like most about your job?

There is always something new around the corner. Every phone call is an opportunity to meet someone new and work with them.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

There is never enough time. Everybody gets 24 hours and you have to be organized and focused to fit in all the showings, marketing, advertising and socializing.

What is your work priority for 2023?

To continue to stay in touch with all my previous clients and friends. To continue on the same path.

I am so blessed, I cannot complain. Business is always a good and I want to find a way to continue serving the people I have worked for in the past 35-plus years.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I have sold some of the most iconic homes and represented some of the most amazing clientele.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

I think there is going to be a correction in the market. It is already starting.

I sell more in the worst market because that's when agents are really able to hone in on their skills.

In a soft market, the brokers who truly know the business are the ones who are going to shine.

“Ironically, the biggest challenge is probably what keeps our work exciting: the dynamic pace at which beauty and wellness moves”

What do you like most about your job?

I am privileged that my job is centered around meaningful storytelling.

I have the unique opportunity to reflect consumer experiences back to them through the lens of prestige beauty, which changes how beauty is represented to everyone.

Developing inspiring campaigns that have a cultural connection to your community is always fulfilling.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Ironically, the biggest challenge is probably what keeps our work exciting: the dynamic pace at which beauty and wellness move.

Staying relevant in such a competitive landscape requires creativity and the ability to meet the growing expectations of consumers.

You not only have to provide exceptional products and services, but your content surrounding that has to be consistent, engaging, authentic – and quick.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Luxury consumers are younger, more financially independent and much better informed, which allows them to often see through the marketing noise.

So, my priority for 2023 is finding new ways to excite and expand our base, focusing on authentic storytelling, enriching retail experiences and technologically-integrated touch points.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I have had a few important moments in my career, but the launch of our Texture Series at Aveda was an especially proud one.

A long history of Eurocentric beauty standards has impacted the way in which Black women relate to, care for and love their hair. This project focused on the expansion of Aveda’s education on textured hair and explored the range of journeys of Black haircare.

To me, Black women seeing themselves reflected lovingly in beauty spaces brings healing and truth.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The face of luxury is certainly evolving, and millennials and Gen Zers are becoming critical growth levers in this sector.

Moving forward, brands will need to provide emotionally engaging, bespoke experiences, both digital and physical, for a younger generation of consumers.

“More of the industry will take building digital and hybrid experiences with their customers to the next level. This trend accelerated during the pandemic out of necessity, but there will be even more innovative ways to do so”

What do you like most about your job?

The people I work with every day and the relationships I have built. I am so grateful to work on products that I love with so many thoughtful people.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

This is such a dynamic industry. Every day is different and the biggest challenge is juggling so many priorities, but it is a lot of fun.

What is your work priority for 2023?

To respond quickly to a changing environment, always keeping the customer at the center of everything we do.

Tastes, trends and behaviors are evolving more rapidly than ever, and we have to be willing to be flexible.

Just because something has always been done a certain way does not mean it is still the ""right"" way.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

At Whatnot, we are building a new way for customers and communities to interact with their favorite products and brands through exciting live auctions. It is rewarding to see people connect over a shared passion.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

More of the industry will take building digital and hybrid experiences with their customers to the next level. This trend accelerated during the pandemic out of necessity, but there will be even more innovative ways to do so.

More of the industry will also continue to embrace sustainability, something that is especially top-of-mind for today's young consumers.

Olivia Steele

Cofounder and president/CEO

Conversation Couture

Austin, TX

“The reason why companies choose Conversation Couture is because they understand we are part of the future of luxury, where technology is one piece and education and upskilling their sales team is the other missing piece of the puzzle”

What do you most like about your job?

For me, it is about the results – the empowerment for the sales specialist that directly affects the sales for the business.

We are empowering the sales specialist to upskill in virtual retail sales.

It is something that has never existed before, and it is giving them the confidence individually where it is so impactful for the businesses. So it is two-fold.

You have the empowerment of your sales specialist knowing how to sell in a one-to-one virtual setting, driving sales in a virtual environment and taking advantage of this new opportunity that directly impacts the business in a positive way. They can see upwards of 30 percent sales increase month-over-month just by upscaling their sales individuals.

If the sales specialists feel confident in their ability to sell in a virtual environment – through live streaming, chat box or virtual in-store experiences or a virtual meeting – it will empower them to want to use the technology that the company has already invested in.

So to me, it is truly a win-win. It is what I love about my job the most, seeing that in action and seeing how positively it affects businesses and individuals.

What is your work priority for 2023?

We are focused on getting as many sales specialists trained and certified as possible.

Luxury is a feeling and customers need virtual experiences that emulate the in-person experience, so they can gain trust in the virtual sales channel.

Our goal is to become the house of retail education, and that is no small adventure.

We are focused on building out our programs and bringing on partners to enhance the programs.

Also, we will continue working with technology companies and partnering with them to educate sales specialists on where the market is moving and provide the skills they need to be successful moving forward in the virtual sales channel. This includes:

Bringing on industry professionals to enhance the coursework and the certification programs.

Matching where technology is going, partnering with technology companies, and continuing to grow the education offerings.

Making sure that the retail sales specialists and companies have the necessary training and development to make sure that they stay relevant in this space of what the customer is demanding in regards to the interactions they're having with the sales specialist in a virtual environment.

My biggest priority is matching all of those things together.

For the retail sales specialist, there is an ample amount of programs in every other facet it seems, like data analytics and marketing. However, virtual retail sales is such a new and exciting piece of where the market is moving.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

My proudest achievement is definitely the fact that I found a gap in the marketplace and created a solution. When I was doing my own shopping online, I realized that the experience was so, so hard, and I knew it could be better.

Finding that gap, executing a solution and delivering that to retail sales specialists and businesses is something that I am going to be proud of forever.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The future of luxury is something that's part of my daily conversations. I think about it this way:

In-person interaction with customers is unlike no other. However, in my world, I interface with technology companies on a daily basis that are creating ways to facilitate human interaction as if it were in-person.

In 2023, we are going to see a really big shift in what the customer expectations are and the experience they're expecting to receive in a virtual setting. I believe it is going to be essential for the luxury sales specialist to be educated on how they can maximize the new virtual sales channel.

There is a lot of talk about the new-age shopper and Gen Z. Right now, the luxury market has a unique opportunity to set the industry standard, including how the interactions in a virtual sales environment will go for those customers: that one-to-one personalized, luxurious, memorable shopping experience.

The reason why companies choose Conversation Couture is because they understand we are part of the future of luxury, where technology is one piece and education and upskilling their sales team is the other missing piece of the puzzle.

It will be exciting to be part of the transformation.

Anne Wilkinson

Design principal

BAMO

San Francisco

“Coming out of the pandemic we saw the idea of wellness take precedence. Now that’s expanding to the idea of wholeness, creating environments where wellbeing and happiness and connecting to other people are central elements”

What do you most like about your job?

I relish the process of creating a new style language for each project, which involves an exciting stage of exploration and discovery.

Finding a talented local artisan or being inspired by unique regional architecture brings me great joy.

Pulling from a wide range of sources, the resulting design vocabulary builds a visual story that is distinct to that place, to the people and the culture that defines them.

I approach every project, whether a luxury resort in Bora Bora, a high-rise residential tower in Bangkok, or a beach house in California, with a fresh curiosity.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Bringing something unexpected to each project is a challenge I put on myself.

Exceeding a client’s expectations, by understanding their needs better than they were able to put into words, is my goal.

Personally, though, not having enough hours in the day is my biggest challenge.

The design industry is constantly reinventing itself and designers need to stay on top of what’s happening in order to stay informed and relevant.

That makes my job challenging, but continually fascinating.

There are so many things I could do, need to do and want to do, that it is important to prioritize how my time is spent.

My work can be consuming, but I am careful to balance that with downtime, relaxing with family and friends.

What is your work priority for 2023?

We have all had this collective “reset” and have come out the other side with new priorities, values and motivations.

At a high level, I am focused on the growth of BAMO, leading the firm into the future.

It is a good point in time to explore new directions. Clients are looking at crossover markets, resetting their own brands and everyone is aligning how we feel internally with how we live externally.

At a micro level, I am excited about traveling again, exploring new artists and resources that may have been developed over the past few years, but remain yet untapped.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

We have worked with so many incredible clients over the years, and my proudest achievements are when a client returns to us for a renovation or a new project.

My first project leading the charge as a principal at BAMO is the Waldorf-Astoria Miami Hotel & Residences, which has been a huge success in terms of both design and in the real estate market with record-breaking sales.

Because of the shared vision and mutual respect developed through that project, I am now working with the same client on several other developments.

Gaining the trust of international luxury clients and elite brands such as Waldorf-Astoria is a great honor.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, a few years ago, BAMO was invited to design space for the Ronald McDonald House at Stanford, which is a home-away-from-home and a cost-effective lifeline for families of children with life-threatening illnesses receiving treatment at the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital.

Not only was this an opportunity to provide pro bono, luxury services for the greater good, but it was a moving experience to talk to the families, and understand how design could impact their emotional wellbeing, to provide comfort, support and inclusivity.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

We have been shifting away from the “traditional” notion of luxury for a while.

Coming out of the pandemic, we saw the idea of wellness take precedence. Now that’s expanding to the idea of wholeness, creating environments where wellbeing and happiness and connecting to other people are central elements.

I think this idea will continue to evolve, and we will look to create opportunities for people to form human connections, travel with purpose and use design as a conduit to enhance and live a more meaningful life.

Alicia Williams

Vice President of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)

Saks

New York

“In DEI work, particularly in luxury, the biggest challenge is demystifying what luxury looks like and who it is for across communities who may have been historically excluded”

What do you most like about your job?

As vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) at Saks, I love being part of a team that values both my presence and voice at the table.

I am empowered to show up to work as myself every single day, and I see that level of authenticity across the company.

Saks has made tremendous progress in DEI, but also recognizes that this is a journey and there is always room for more growth, development and advancement.

Saks CEO Marc Metrick and fellow leaders’ support of our DEI strategy give me the inspiration I need to be innovative and fearless. It is the Saks way.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

In DEI work, particularly in luxury, the biggest challenge is demystifying what luxury looks like and who it is for across communities who may have been historically excluded. There is a lack of trust that extends well beyond the last two years of civil and social unrest.

This means being willing to think outside of the box as we do at Saks, continuing to educate ourselves even in positions such as DEI leader and formulating our strategy in ways that will encourage collaboration and inclusion along the journey.

What is your work priority for 2023?

My work priority for 2023 is continuing to execute Saks’ three-year DEI roadmap, which is focused on our purpose, people, culture and brand.

I am also working toward the next phase of our DEI strategy overall, placing a greater emphasis on advancing equity.

While equality is making things fair, equity is leveling the playing field across luxury, which we are working to do at Saks. This includes how we enact change in policies, metrics and the ways in which we communicate and operate to keep momentum and reinforce our goals in inclusivity and belonging, retention and development and recruiting and hiring.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I am proud to have joined a company that is committed to advancing its pipelines, amplifying racially and ethnically diverse brands, elevating its community service efforts and expanding learning and development opportunities for employees.

Working to further develop our programs, initiatives, onboarding, talent development and recruiting for our most impacted diversity segments and communities in partnership with our marketing, merchandising and people leadership teams has been as inspiring as it is rewarding. Looking ahead, I am excited to see it all unfold.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

As the face of luxury continues to change, so will the way companies define impact in order to stay relevant.

Now and in the future, there is greater demand for fearlessness, accountability and clear definitions of success in support of communities that have been historically marginalized and underrepresented in luxury.

The Chinese automaker has been able to deliver more than 10,000 vehicles here, comprising the Haval H6 Hybrid and Jolion Hybrid crossovers, along with the ORA Good Cat electric car.

According to GWM, the carmaker has over 900,000 followers on social media with more than 100,000 users on its GWM app after two years in the Kingdom. GWM has been highly active with online-to-offline (O2O) network expansion, aiming to reach 80 stores nationwide by the end of 2022 (up from the current 54).

Earlier this month GWM launched the H6 PHEV, the plug-in hybrid version of the H6, which allows users to drive in pure electric mode for 201km in NEDC cycle (approximately 140-150km in WLTP cycle), thanks to its 34kWh lithium battery.

GWM held the world premiere of the vehicle at the Thailand International Motor Expo in Thailand late last year, but the official launch and pricing announcement took part earlier this month. According to GWM, more than 7,000 people signed up during the pre-order period, with 1,241 orders finally placed within the first 24 hours of the official launch.

The Haval H6 PHEV is priced at 1.699 million baht, which is a significant increase over the 1.149 million-1.249 million baht asked for the H6 Hybrid.

But there's a kick. Apart from the first 300 customers enjoying a 50,000 baht discount, those who place orders from Oct 7-31 are also entitled to a 167,000 baht special package that includes low-interest financing, insurance, home charger and installation, free labour and parts for 5 years/100,000km and free 24-hour roadside assistance for five years.

Meanwhile, the standard warranty offered is five years/150,000km (eight years/180,000km for hybrid battery).

Design

The H6 PHEV shares the same 2,738mm wheelbase as the hybrid, but is a tad taller (1,730mm vs 1,724mm) and longer (4,683mm vs 4,653mm).

For the front-end design, the H6 PHEV gets a special ""Star Matrix"" treatment that looks like a combination of the regular H6 Hybrid and Jolion (which takes a lot from the Peugeot design). While the huge chrome radiator grille in the H6 Hybrid offers an elegant appearance, the 3D grille in the H6 PHEV appears modern and more stylish, flanked by intelligent LED headlights.

There's not much difference with the rest of the exterior design, with highlights being the large 1.2m² panoramic glass sunroof, 19in alloy wheels and LED rear light strip. Nevertheless, a nice upgrade in the H6 PHEV is the powered tailgate with kick gesture.

The fuel flap for the H6 Hybrid is located above the rear left wheel arch while the H6 PHEV gets an additional flap on the right side for charging the battery.

As expected, the interior gets gold trim on several components, such as the steering wheel and upper console/door panel, with several upgrades inside as well including the 10.25-inch digital instrument panel display and a 12.3-inch centre touchscreen, head-up display, wireless charger and front passenger seat adjustment buttons for the driver.

The multi-function steering wheel is wrapped in leather but the rest of the cabin gets synthetic leather upholstery. The two-tone colour theme looks well and there's a good amount of soft touch areas. Both front seats are powered and ventilated, offering extra comfort.

Technophiles will appreciate the H6 PHEV's many features that can be operated via smartphone. There also is a comprehensive intelligent safety package, which alerts drivers to potential dangers with a large number of audible warnings.

While Japanese brands are reluctant to automate parking, GWM does offer this function, which comes in handy when having to park in tight spaces.

There's also intelligent cruise control as well as automatic reverse assistant that memorises the last 50m driven and helps you reverse steer out of a narrow passage.

Performance

The H6 PHEV gets a 1.5-litre turbocharged gas engine and electric motor that GWM claims to produce as much as 326hp and 530Nm, which seems questionably high.

It comes with a 34kWh battery (up from 1.69kWh in the H6 Hybrid with 243hp and 530Nm) and has eight driving modes (four in EV and four in hybrid) courtesy of the dedicated hybrid transmission that delivers power to the front wheels (there's no all-wheel-drive option). The gear selector is a dial that looks and feels luxurious.

Floor the throttle and you get decent acceleration for a vehicle weighing 1,881kg (compared to 1,690kg for the H6 Hybrid).

GWM says the battery takes 35 minutes to charge via a DC fast charger (0-80%) and six hours via an AC charger (0-100%).

The most common question for the vehicle is how far can it run in EV mode. The claimed figure of 201km (NEDC), is significantly lower in real-world driving. During the test drive event held by GWM recently, I managed roughly 160km in pure electric mode (mostly highway cruising plus some high-speed acceleration) before the battery level dropped to 10% and the system went back to hybrid mode.

While 160km might not sound good for an EV, it is fine for a plug-in hybrid since the vehicle can run in hybrid mode thanks to the 55 litre fuel tank that can take you several hundred kilometres further. In fact if you commute 50km per day, you can drive it in EV mode for three days on a single charge.

Haval says that the front strut, rear multi-link suspension has been retuned to absorb the extra weight of the battery. There are stabilisers both front and rear, and the improved dampers do a better job in absorbing vibration and shock than those offered in the H6 Hybrid.

All-round disc brakes come with three regenerative settings, plus a one-pedal function when driving in EV mode.

Verdict

The Haval H6 PHEV is an attractive upgrade from the hybrid variant, offering buyers a decent electric range without having to purchase an EV, plus several small upgrades here and there. However, the pricing is also significantly higher than the Hybrid.",electric vehicles,bangkok post
322,Pair Trade Refresh: AutoZone Trouncing Tesla. Time To Book Profits?,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/483661187/image_483661187.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,30/10/2022,AutoZone and Tesla stocks have diverged as I advertised previously. Read more to see why I consider both AZO and TSLA stocks as unattractive right now.,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550915-pair-trade-refresh-autozone-trouncing-tesla-time-to-book-profits,"MCCAIG

Pair Trade Review

Seeking Alpha challenged contributors in June 2022 to come up with articles featuring two stocks that share a commonality; one to buy and the other to sell or short.

The thesis I submitted suggested that AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) stock would outperform Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock for several reasons. Both companies are automotive-related, and acutely affected by economic downturns, consumer spending, interest rates, and inflation, just in vastly different ways. I'll address both stocks in detail below.

After more than four months, AutoZone stock has outperformed Tesla stock by 22%, as shown below. AutoZone has also crushed the S&P 500, while Tesla has pulled about even.

Data by YCharts

One of the reasons that Tesla stock rose through August and September before crashing back to Earth was almost certainly due to its anticipated stock split, as shown below with the split date noted.

Data by YCharts

Upcoming stock splits tend to buoy stocks with a high level of individual investor interest, but the hype dissipates pretty quickly. This is what I wrote in the June article:

The upcoming 3-for-1 stock split may provide a small spark, but the effects of stock splits aren't typically lasting. The stock quickly retreated toward its announcement date price after the 2020 stock split, and then the stock took off afterward with the company's success.

Several things have changed since June. The Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates twice, both companies have reported earnings, inflation has remained stubborn, and Musk has finalized the Twitter purchase, among others.

The valuation of AutoZone has also risen significantly. Is it time to change the thesis?

Why has AutoZone stock gone on a tear?

In April 2022, I wrote that AutoZone could be a beneficiary of inflation. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by 26% since then. AutoZone benefits because the drastic increases in new and used car prices encourage people to keep their current vehicles longer. This means more parts and more repairs.

The chart below shows the extreme rise in vehicle prices.

Data by YCharts

AutoZone crushed market returns coming out of the Great Recession for this reason, as shown below.

Data by YCharts

AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes tells it like this:

...over the last 30 years, there have been four significant shocks to the economy. In all four of those shocks, our performance and our industry’s performance have made a meaningful step up. During those shocks - recessions and pandemics...our business has gone up, and it’s never stepped back down. -Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President, and CEO, on fiscal Q3 2022 earnings call.

Stellar earnings

AutoZone's fiscal Q4 2022 earnings were spectacular. Sales rose 9% year-over-year (YOY), and same-store sales were up 6.2%.

Management managed rising costs exceptionally well. The gross profit margin only fell nominally from 52.8% in fiscal 2021 to 52.1% in fiscal 2022, and the operating margin was even. Diluted earnings-per-share (EPS) rose 23% from $95.19 to $117.19.

AutoZone spent $4.4 billion on stock buybacks in fiscal 2022, reducing the share count by 2.2 million - a reduction of over 9%. This is outstanding. The average purchase price of the shares was $1,964 - far below Friday's closing price of $2,543. The effect of future buybacks will be less with this high stock price.

Is the stock overpriced now?

I still believe in the long-term investment opportunity of AutoZone stock; however, as of Friday, I no longer own shares. The valuation is not attractive at this level for three main reasons:

Last week's rally has put the stock near its highest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in ten years, as shown below.

Data by YCharts

AutoZone is not a growth stock. Therefore it is easier to value using traditional metrics. The big question is, ""would I buy shares at this level?"". The answer is no.

Stock buybacks will be weakened. AutoZone relies heavily on reducing the share count to increase earnings-per-share and the value of the investment. I love buybacks. But fewer shares will be repurchased at this level, and this could hinder EPS growth in 2023.

Management did a tremendous job controlling costs last year. Margins remained impressive despite increased fuel, labor, and other costs economy-wide. Something has to give. I expect at least moderate margin pressures in the coming fiscal year.

I firmly believe in letting your winners run; however, this does not mean being stubborn when a stock gets ahead of itself.

The stock's momentum could continue, but I expect to be able to get back in at a lower price in 2023.

What about Tesla?

Tesla is a revolutionary company. Its rise has been astounding, and the company will be highly successful for a long time.

But that doesn't make the stock a buy for me right now. It's critical to separate the company from the stock. Just as it is above with AutoZone. I love AutoZone's results, but not the stock price.

The macroeconomic picture for Tesla couldn't be much worse. Onrushing competition, a slowing economy, inflation leading to rising interest rates, and demand destruction weigh heavily.

We haven't seen a meaningful retreat in inflation since June, and the Fed appears committed to its current track. There is talk of a ""Fed pivot"" away from raising rates, but many professionals aren't seeing this until the end of 2023.

Elon Musk has been a vocal critic of Fed policy for a good reason. Rate hikes and demand destruction are bad for Tesla's business. Musk also expressed concern that the Fed was risking deflation by continuing its current policy and contends that the Fed is looking back rather than forward:

“The Fed’s decisions make sense if you’re looking in the rear-view mirror, not if you’re looking out the windshield,” Musk said.

He has a point. There are solid arguments that the inflation battle should be fought more on the supply side (investing to increase supply, thereby lowering prices) than by tamping down demand. There is a legitimate risk that the Fed overshoots. But don't expect it to budge.

Interest rates and inflation negatively affect Tesla stock in several ways, including declining consumer demand, margin pressures, and the stock's valuation model.

Consumer demand

Tesla makes a great product, and the stock is priced for massive growth. However, consumers have already stared down nearly two years of rapidly-rising prices. Budgets will continue to tighten, and Tesla has raised its financing rate.

Consumer sentiment is the strongest indicator of future consumer spending and is still below its pandemic and Great Recession lows.

Data by YCharts

Again, something has to give.

Margin pressures

Tesla has margins that most other auto manufacturers can only dream of. But they are under pressure. Sales in Q3 grew 55% YOY. Growth this massive should lead to scaling efficiencies. Tesla has done an admirable job of controlling costs, including by raising prices, just like AutoZone; however, the trend is down. The automotive gross margin peaked in Q1 and has lagged since, as shown below.

Data source: Tesla. Chart by author.

Unlike AutoZone, Tesla is still a high-growth stock and tougher to value. Rising interest rates lower Wall Street's valuation of growth stocks because the future cash flows are less valuable. This could put more downward pressure on the stock.

The bottom line

Tesla and AutoZone are quality companies with bright futures. Electric vehicles will soon be the norm rather than the exception. The market will balloon, but serious competition is coming from all sides, along with the macroeconomic headwinds.

AutoZone could be a net beneficiary of inflation and has historically outperformed during economic weakness. But the stock's recent rise has it near its highest P/E ratio in a decade.

Although each company has a bright future, neither stock is an attractive investment given current conditions and prices.",electric vehicles,seeking alpha

324,Questions abound for China,https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2022/10/31/4505765_700.jpg,30/10/2022,"China has been locked into a zero-Covid policy since early 2020, enforcing aggressive pandemic border controls and implementing public health measures such as mass testing and city lockdowns that have severely affected global supply chains.",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2426260/questions-abound-for-china,"Beijing faces several economic challenges that may ease its draconian zero-Covid policy over time, but Thai operators shouldn't hold their breath.

People watch a live broadcast of Mr Xi's speech during the introduction of the Communist Party of China's Politburo Standing Committee, on a screen at a mall in Qingzhou, in eastern Shandong province on Oct 23. AFP

China has been locked into a zero-Covid policy since early 2020, enforcing aggressive pandemic border controls and implementing public health measures such as mass testing and city lockdowns that have severely affected global supply chains.

Before the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Thai operators were optimistic that these rules would be gradually eased, particularly travel restrictions.

But when the congress closed on Oct 22 with Xi Jinping securing a third five-year term as president, such hopes had dimmed as Chinese leaders said they wanted to continue with zero-Covid to protect people's lives.

China's GDP growth of 3.9% in the third quarter outperformed many forecasts, but questions remain about how long border controls and zero-Covid policies can last, as foreign investors as well as wealthy Chinese start to look elsewhere for a more convenient business environment.

MOVEMENT TO WATCH

Sisdivachr Cheewarattanaporn, president of the Association of Thai Travel Agents, said a definitive conclusion on China's reopening might not happen this year, following the completion of the congress and the new appointments to the politburo standing committee.

He said the Two Sessions meeting next March is important to watch because typically the roadmap for both economic and social policies are announced after this meeting.

""China may ease international travel restrictions at this time, as we've seen this year the mainland gradually softened a few restrictions. But a full reopening might have to wait until longer,"" said Mr Sisdivachr.

He said international flights and arrival numbers from China might pick up over the following year, but it would be mainly from the business sector, not the leisure market.

""There are a lot of Chinese residing in other countries or conducting business with foreigners. The expansion of flights was meant to serve those purposes, rather than mass tourism. The large conferences and meetings from Chinese companies in Thailand recently drew participants from overseas branches, with a small number flying directly from the mainland,"" Mr Sisdivachr said.

Meanwhile, a property agent who requested anonymity said new sales of residential units in Thailand to Chinese buyers have been rising in recent months, largely attributed to China's political uncertainties and strict policies.

""Many of the super-rich in China have sought second homes overseas, including in Thailand, since something happened to Alibaba's Jack Ma and other founders of tech firms. This group is uncertain about its fate,"" the source said.

The top location for Chinese buyers is Bangkok, with units priced between 15-100 million baht, 70% of which were condos. That was followed by Pattaya, with units priced between 5-20 million baht, two-thirds of which were condos.

Phuket came third with units priced between 10-50 million baht, and the majority being villas.

Buyers of houses or villas mostly bought the units through a company they set up in Thailand.

""There will be many more Chinese buying Thai property, particularly houses with land, as the government recently decided to allow foreigners to own one rai of land if they buy Thai bonds worth at least 40 million baht,"" the source said.

Since August 2021, a large number of wealthy Chinese have bought Thai properties as a second home. Part of the attraction is the existence of a Chinese ecosystem in Thailand, particularly various regional Chinese restaurants, said the source.

""More than 90% of wealthy Chinese with a net worth of more than US$10 billion now hold a Singaporean passport,"" said the source. ""Many bought a unit in Thailand and used other passports to get a long-term visa.""

GRADUAL EASING ANTICIPATED

Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said while Mr Xi insisted he would stand firm on the zero-Covid policy, China is expected to relax certain aspects of it to boost the economy.

""China is likely to gradually relax its measures soon, as Beijing already allows Chinese students to travel to Thailand for study, as well as Thai students studying in China. Chinese entrepreneurs who invested in Thailand are allowed to travel in and out the mainland,"" Mr Sanan said.

He said more Chinese businesses and tourists are expected to visit Thailand next year, playing a key role in the revival of the Thai economy.

""The chamber believes China will remain Thailand's main economic partner, both in terms of trade and investments, particularly in electric vehicles [EVs] and bio-, circular, and green industries,"" said Mr Sanan.

""Thailand can be the EV manufacturing base for Chinese distribution in Asean, while China can make use of Thailand's free-trade agreements to boost its exports.""

He said many large Chinese companies are looking to expand their investments in Thailand, citing car manufacturer BYD which recently decided to build an EV production plant in the country.

""Several Chinese companies, especially in supply chain-related businesses, medical equipment, industry and real estate, are looking for a greater foothold in Thailand, but the government needs to improve regulations to facilitate foreign direct investment,"" said Mr Sanan.

He said the chamber recently established a Thai-Chinese working group to work with China's embassy in Bangkok to study trade and investment obstacles, as well as the ways the two governments can support each other.

In addition, the Thailand-China Investment Forum is scheduled in early November before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The forum is intended to strengthen Chinese-Thai trade and investments.

Mr Sanan said Thailand's food industry holds potential, as products such as durian are popular in the Chinese market.

POLICY MOMENTUM

Another five-year term for Mr Xi will put China on a path towards its goal of becoming a modern socialist country, with key socio-economic policies continuing to impact the world economy, said the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).

Mr Xi's draconian zero-Covid policy, whose lockdown measures are blamed for disrupting global supply chains, will remain in place as he said the safety of Chinese people is his priority in dealing with the virus.

Yet Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the FTI, believes this policy may soon be adjusted or terminated.

The zero-Covid policy, with tight travel restrictions to and from China, was especially crucial during the peak of the pandemic and the lead-up to the recent week-long congress, said Mr Kriengkrai.

Mr Xi needed to assure people that he and the party could contain the spread of the virus, he said.

""After Chinese politics becomes clearer, we will see more economic policies implemented. I believe the government may consider ending the zero-Covid policy,"" said Mr Kriengkrai.

Thailand should reap the benefits once zero-Covid is terminated, allowing Chinese to travel outside the country, with this country a favoured destination, he said.

Other economic and political policies under the Xi administration will have a varied effect on the international community, said Mr Kriengkrai.

For example, he expects a push for ""Made in China 2025"", a key state-led policy aimed at boosting the industrial value chain, to gather momentum.

Beijing wants to make the country a world leader in 10 key industries, notably robotics, information technology and artificial intelligence, by 2025.

Mr Kriengkrai believes this policy is not only good for China, but can also help drive the global economy.

The US-China trade war is expected to continue and must be closely monitored because actions by these two powers can affect the global economy, he said.

China's tough stance on Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a breakaway province, will continue, adding to concerns over the impact on global supply chains because Taiwan is a large producer of semiconductors, said Mr Kriengkrai.

Global chip shortages, which show no sign of abating, have already affected industries, notably car manufacturing, he said.

FRIENDLY NEIGHBOUR

Trawut Luangsomboon, chief executive of Jitta Wealth Asset Management, believes the Chinese government plans to facilitate trade with Thailand and support supply chains here in clean energy and the automotive industry.

He said China's economic policy during Mr Xi's third term was revealed at a recent meeting, with a clear indication of the direction of trade and foreign policies.

Mr Xi clarified that under his leadership, China was keen to open up to countries and establish free-trade zones to facilitate foreign investors, along with setting up a free port on Hainan Island and other infrastructure under the Belt and Road Initiative.

China trades with 144 countries and tallied the highest international trade value.

The country is also a major Thai trading partner. In 2021, China was Thailand's second-largest export market, with a value of $36 billion.

In addition, Chinese companies are major foreign investors in Thailand. More than 200 Chinese projects were submitted to Thailand's Board of Investment for promotional privileges in 2021, with a total value of 262 billion baht, followed by Japan with a value of 73.1 billion.

Chinese EV companies invested in Thailand this year. BYD invested more than 17 billion baht, while Taiwan-based Foxconn set up a joint venture with PTT Plc with a value of more than 30 billion baht.

""Thailand has a competitive advantage in the automotive industry's supply chain, and there are more Chinese EV companies looking to invest here,"" Mr Trawut said.

Stable economic growth was frequently mentioned at the recent Chinese leadership meeting, he said. The Chinese government emphasises economic parity with a focus on quality rather than quantity, said Mr Trawut.

""It is clear China's economy will grow by less than 5.5% this year, but even 4-5% growth for the world's second-largest economy is a challenge,"" he said.

However, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is likely to help the economy grow in the future, said Mr Trawut.

He said Thai stock investors can accumulate Chinese technology stocks during this period because the price has dropped considerably. These stocks have the opportunity to grow in the future, thanks to China's innovation policies, said Mr Trawut.

Chinese tech stocks saw an average annual return of 19% between 2012-2021, he said.",electric vehicles,bangkok post

The company will issue full refunds to any buyers. To make matters worse, it looks like this all happened because an adult crashed one.

To be fair, there’s more to the story than that. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the electric toy “fails to comply with the federal mandatory safety standard requirements for youth ATVs, including mechanical suspension and maximum tire pressure.”

Tesla announced a full-size adult Cyberquad during the Cybertruck unveiling, and neither is available to buy. However, in late 2021 the company worked with Radio Flyer to release the Cyberquad for Kids with a $1,900 asking price.

The children’s toy is similar to many other replicas toy vehicles sold by Radio Flyer, with styles including Jeep, a Tesla Model Y, and more. However, the Cyberquad for Kids goes 15 miles on a charge and reaches speeds of 10MPH thanks to a 500-watt electric motor and 288 Wh battery pack.

The Cyberquad for Kids is meant for single riders and has a max rider weight of 150 lbs. Unlike similar toys, it has a full steel frame, adjustable suspension, disc brakes, beefy ATV-style tires, Cybertruck-inspired LED lightbars, and more.

Unfortunately, the CPSC report states two people were riding one, a 36-year-old and her daughter, who then crashed and got hurt. The commission then opened an investigation and determined that the Cyberquad for Kids isn’t a toy but a “youth ATV.” Here’s what the recall notice had to say:

“The Cyberquad lacks a CPSC-approved ATV action plan, which is required to manufacture, import, sell, or distribute ATVs. ATV action plans contain numerous safety requirements, such as rider training, dissemination of safety information, age recommendations, and other safety measures. These ATV safety standards are in place to reduce crash and injury hazards, preventing serious injury or death.”

Essentially, the Consumer Product Safety Commission found that it violates all-terrain vehicle (ATV) federal safety standards for youths. The mechanical suspension and maximum tire pressure weren’t adequate, didn’t meet the correct criteria, and appeared to lack the proper safety label information on a typical ATV.

So, what now? Well, Radio Flyer says Tesla sold nearly 5,000 units through its online store and asks owners to send back the motor controller and drivetrain for a full $1,900 refund. Removing those parts makes the Cyberquad for Kids inoperable.

The Cyberquad for Kids was undoubtedly more advanced than some of Radio Flyer’s other vehicles, including a Tesla Model S for kids, so it makes sense that it requires a higher safety plan. Still, I find it odd that Radio Flyer didn’t consider this during the manufacturing phase.

For now, the Cyberquad for Kids is no longer for sale, and we’re not sure if it will return.",electric vehicles,reviewgeek.com

Overall, we're pleased with our top line performance, which marked our ninth consecutive quarter of record-breaking sales. We were up 3% over last year's with both divisions showing gains. Moreover, sell-through continued to be strong, demonstrating the ongoing health of the marketplace and the continued success of our programs with our customers.

Let me review each segment, beginning with Engine Management. Engine Management sales were up nearly 2% with various moving pieces. After a post-pandemic bump, the Wire and Cable portion of the line has returned to its secular decline down about 5%. But excluding this, the balance of Engine Management was up 3.2%, a combination of pricing actions and generally robust demand. This was also reflected in aftermarket customer POS, which, excluding Wire and Cable, remained positive in the quarter even when compared to outsized growth last year.

Temperature Control continues at its solid pace, surpassing last year's sales by 3.3%. However, I think it's more insightful to look at this segment on a year-to-date basis due to how seasonality can shift demand across quarters. And year-to-date, we are ahead by nearly 11%. This strong performance is a combination of a long hot summer even when compared with last year's record heat, compounded by pricing actions taken during the year. As with Engine Management, customer POS was robust throughout, attributable to the warm weather across the country and our ability to retain in-stock positions during a difficult supply chain environment.

While top line sales remain favorable, margins have presented a challenge. I'll touch on it, and Jim and Nathan will delve deeper. Along with the rest of the world, all year long, we have been experiencing elevated costs across many inputs. The industry has been largely receptive to passing it through, though there is always a lag in timing.

Meanwhile, as discussed on our last call, the rapid increase in interest rates, which affect our receivables factoring programs, is creating a significant headwind. And while we are working diligently to adjust for it, both through cost reduction and pricing initiatives, it's impacting our bottom line, as Nathan will speak to.

So let me talk for a bit about what we've been seeing in the market and how we are thinking about the future. I'll start with our aftermarket business, which makes up about 3/4 of our total revenue. The basic overall backdrop continues to show favorable trends. The vehicle fleet is aging. The lack of new vehicle availability is causing motorists to repair and maintain the vehicles they have. Gas prices peaked and have now substantially dropped, and we were pleased to see it had a negligible impact on miles driven. And while we are heading into a potentially recessionary environment, the aftermarket tends to outperform.

Furthermore, our product categories tend to fare even better during difficult economic times. First off, they are largely nondiscretionary, meaning the vehicle is not operating properly and repair is necessary. And secondly, our products tend to be professionally installed. And while independent garages surely have product choice, they are less inclined than do-it-yourselfers to trade down to lower-grade products as avoiding vehicle comeback is more important than saving cost, which gets passed on to the car owner anyway. Plus we believe that our market strategy, which focuses on the do-it-for-me market, continues to be very well received by the customers.

Additionally, our lesser reliance on the far east for our supply of goods is a major advantage over some of our competitors. It has allowed us to ship at higher levels than many and has helped our direct customers better service their end customers. So while there will always be challenges, the marketplace and our position within it are very strong.

Meanwhile, our specialized non-aftermarket business has remained robust, and we are very excited about where we're headed with the strategy. As we've been discussing on the last several calls, this business focuses on selling custom engineered products into niche on-highway and off-highway end markets such as heavy duty, construction and agricultural equipment, power sports and others. With our recent history of acquisitions in this space, along with many organic business wins, we now enjoy a run rate of about $300 million in sales. Not only is it diverse in the end markets it serves, it's diverse geographically with strong sales in Europe and Asia as well as North America.

A few weeks ago, we finalized another acquisition, Kade Trading, just outside Hamburg, Germany. SMP has a long history with Kade Trading. They have been the European sales arm for our Chinese joint ventures, selling to niche OE customers throughout Europe. Having them be a part of SMP provides a great strategic step forward. They bring the customer relationships, and as we look to integrate the various pieces of this new market strategy, they present excellent cross-selling access. We welcome them to the SMP team.

At this point, I'll hand it over to Jim to review our operations.

Jim Burke

Thank you, Eric. Good morning. Similar to past quarterly calls, I will provide some insight from an operational perspective. The most prevalent headwind we are facing is from inflationary pressures. Material cost increases have been running in the high single digits in 2022 on top of the similar level increases experienced in 2021. Certain product categories, such as electronic components, have increased on average 25% to 30%, and you're actually fortunate if you can procure your requirements. We have seen moderation on commodity-based metals from earlier peaks in 2022, but current year average costs still exceed 2021 levels.

In addition, our material vendors are also experiencing similar labor and overhead increases, inclusive of wages, benefits, utilities and transportation that they are passing on to their customers. On a more positive note, transportation container costs from overseas in Q3 have dropped below $5,000 per container. In addition to the container cost reductions, we are seeing relief at the ports from vessel backlogs. This will allow us to gradually reduce supplier lead times impacting our increased inventory levels.

On our prior second quarter earnings call, I stated that our Q2 inventory levels should have peaked, and I anticipated inventory reductions for the balance of the year. During Q3, inventory levels dropped $17 million, and I anticipate further reductions in Q4. From an operational perspective, we are very fortunate to have our significant North American manufacturing footprint. This has allowed us to better control our flow of goods as opposed to other manufacturers that source 100% from overseas.

Nathan will review our gross and operating margins in more detail, but I want to elaborate on our internal cost reduction efforts besides just pricing to offset these inflationary pressures. Our purchasing, engineering and manufacturing teams together are focused on low-cost sourcing, redesign efforts for substitute materials, reducing costs through manufacturing cell automation, first buy programs and our ESG efforts, reducing energy usage and waste.

These internal cost reduction programs have yielded significant savings, and we are pleased with the sequential margin improvements achieved from the second quarter to the third quarter. However, due to uncertainty, we still are expecting inflation across materials, labor and overhead along with cost increases from higher interest rates.

In closing, we believe our core strategy focused on delivering premium products with superior customer service offers our customers a compelling value proposition. I thank our worldwide employees for their efforts, making us on being a premier supplier in our industry.

Thank you, and I will turn the call over to Nathan for his financial perspective.

Nathan Iles

All right. Thank you, Jim. As we go through the numbers, I'll first give some color on sales and margins for each division, then look at the consolidated results, cover some key balance sheet and cash flow metrics, and finally, provide an update on our financial outlook for the full year in 2022.

First, looking at Engine Management. You can see on the slide that Q3 net sales of $251.7 million were up $4.6 million or 1.9% versus the same quarter last year. But excluding Wire and Cable sales, which have returned to secular decline, sales were up $6.6 million or 3.2%, with the increase being a result of higher pricing and robust demand, as Eric highlighted. For the first nine months, sales in engine of $732.9 million were up 5.8%. But excluding sales of Wire and Cable, year-to-date sales were up 7.6% with the increase driven by sales from acquisitions made last year, higher pricing and strong demand.

Looking at the margin for engine. Third quarter gross margin rate was 26.2%, down 0.9 points from last year mainly due to inflation in our costs, but also due to lower production volumes as inventory levels moderate. Engine's gross margin for the first nine months was 26.5% and was down from last year, mainly as a result of higher material and labor costs from persistent inflation not experienced to the same degree during the first nine months of 2021 and increased transportation expenses resulting from stocking higher levels of inventory.

Before I leave the topic of gross margin for Engine Management, I'd like to point out that the margin did improve by 0.4 points from the second quarter. This improvement was a result of additional pricing pass-through to customers and our cost savings initiatives. And going forward, we expect to continue to take both additional pricing and cost savings actions to address inflation as necessary.

Turning to Temperature Control. Net sales there in Q3 2022 were up $3.9 million or 3.3%. And for the first nine months, were up $30.7 million or 10.7% with the increases mainly reflecting a very strong summer season and higher pricing, both of which helped the division to outpace a record year last year. The gross margin rate for Temperature Control in the quarter was 28.8%, an increase of 0.4 points from last year, while the gross margin rate for the first nine months of 27% was down 0.2 points from last year. The increase in margin for the quarter was mainly due to another record sales year, while the slight decrease for the first nine months was due to cost inflation and some higher transportation expenses related to stocking higher levels of inventory.

Turning to our consolidated results. Our consolidated net sales reflected the growth we saw in each division with the third quarter up 3% versus last year and the first nine months up 7.6% versus last year. Our consolidated gross margin rate was down for the quarter and first nine months for the reasons noted before. But for each of these periods, we were pleased to report higher gross margin dollars on the back of strong sales growth. Additionally, our consolidated gross margin rate did improve from 26.8% in the second quarter to 28% in the third quarter, helped by the strength of the temp control season but also our pricing and cost savings actions.

Moving now to SG&A expenses. Our consolidated SG&A expenses increased for both the quarter and first nine months as rapidly rising interest rates continue to drive expenses from customer factoring programs higher. Our consolidated SG&A expenses increased by $6.7 million in the quarter and included $7.6 million of incremental factoring costs. Of note, excluding these incremental factoring costs, our core SG&A expenses were down $0.9 million and as a percentage of sales would have been better than last year.

SG&A expenses for the first nine months increased by $21.2 million and included $13.1 million of higher factoring costs and $7.2 million of additional costs from acquisitions. Like I noted for the quarter, excluding incremental factoring costs for the first nine months, our SG&A as a percentage of sales would have been better than last year. As we noted in our release this morning, we expect to implement price increases to address the climbing cost of our customers' factoring programs.

With respect to profitability, consolidated operating income, as shown here on the slide, was 8.8% of net sales for the quarter and 8.3% for the first nine months of the year. And earnings per share and EBITDA were lower than last year for the reasons already discussed.

Turning now to the balance sheet. Accounts receivable of $230.4 million at the end of the quarter were up $49.8 million from December 2021 with the increase typical of the seasonal nature of the business and mainly a result of higher sales during the quarter. Inventory levels finished Q3 at $534.3 million, up $65.6 million from December 2021, with the increase of result of higher sales levels this year and a strategic investment in inventory, to both make sure we meet our customers' delivery expectations and to buffer against supply chain volatility. As we work through our peak seasonal inventory needs, our inventory was reduced $17.1 million from the June 30 levels, as Jim noted.

Looking at cash flows. Our cash flow statement reflects cash used in operations in the first nine months of $75.5 million as compared to cash generated of $79.1 million last year, with the biggest driver of cash usage being working capital. Use of cash from working capital mainly stemmed from making strategic investments in inventory as noted, but also the impact of lower accounts payable now that inventories have begun to decline.

Regarding investing activities, we continue to invest in our business and used $19.5 million of cash for CapEx during the first nine months, which was flat with last year. Our financing activities included returns to shareholders in the form of $17.6 million of dividends paid and another $29.7 million paid for repurchases of our stock. Financing activities also included $141.5 million of borrowings, which were used to fund our operations, strategic investments and returns to shareholders. While our borrowings are higher this year, we still finished the quarter with low total debt leverage of 1.7x EBITDA.

Finally, I want to give an update on our sales and profit expectations for the full year of 2022. Regarding our top line sales, we expect full year '22 sales growth in percentage terms to be in the mid-single digits. This reflects both the sales growth we've seen through three quarters this year, and the fourth quarter, we expect to be roughly flat with last year as it's up against a difficult comparison from a year ago and always hard to predict.

With regard to margins and operating profit, you can see from our results that while our gross margin rate is still under inflationary pressures, we did improve from where we were in the second quarter. Additionally, you can see that despite rising customer factoring costs, our SG&A expenses remain well under control. As such, we are maintaining the updated full year expectations we provided in August, which is that for the full year of 2022, we expect consolidated gross margin will be approximately 27% and consolidated operating profit will be in the range of 7% to 8%.

To wrap up, we are pleased to report strong sales growth while even up against a record year last year and gross margin improvement sequentially from last quarter. We thank all of our employees for helping us achieve these results and remain confident in our team's ability to navigate the evolving landscape.

Thank you all for your attention. I'll now turn the call back to Eric to wrap up.

Eric Sills

Well, thank you, Nathan. In closing, let me reiterate that we're pleased with where we're headed. We surely acknowledge that there are many headwinds, including cost increases, supply chain issues and a potential economic downturn, but we view these as relatively short term in nature. As we look to the longer term, we're very excited about our future. Needless to say, technological shifts are heading on our way, but SMP is well positioned to capitalize on them. As we've done for over 100 years, we evolve with automotive technology.

As we head towards vehicle electrification, we are pleased that already about half of our sales are in product categories that are not ICE-dependent, that they're either powertrain neutral, meaning that they are not affected by whether it's an internal combustion engine or not, while other products are specifically targeting these new systems. We're particularly excited about our rapid growth in selling electric compressors to EVs, which is now a global business for us. We are also aftermarket leaders in ADAS products, the advanced safety systems on today's vehicles. And while the market for these products remain in their infancy, we are there with programs as they mature and gain demand.

Meanwhile, as we all know, the aftermarket enjoys the luxury of time. While there is no doubt an acceleration in technology change in new vehicles, it takes many years before they become a meaningful part of the car park and even longer for them to hit their sweet spot. We continue to invest in our company. We have hundreds of engineers focused on new product development and are bringing new technologies into our plants. We've been focused on strategic acquisitions, strengthening our global footprint and gaining access to complementary markets. And I believe we have the strongest team we've ever had. And so we're in a great place to capitalize on our future.

So that concludes our prepared remarks. At this point, I'll turn it over to the operator, and we'll open it up for your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc.

Daniel Imbro

I want to start on the pricing dynamic. I think you all touched on it during the prepared remarks, but continuing to pass through maybe further inflation here in the fourth quarter, and I know it's early, but can you talk about any cadence you expect over the next 6 to 12 months?

Should we expect further price increases to continue into next year? Are you seeing any pushback from your customers, or in turn, their customers? Just trying to think about how you guys think about pricing and further inflation in the backdrop as we move forward from here.

Eric Sills

Sure. And so this has been, as you're well aware, really a moving target over the last many quarters. And so we've been chasing these cost increases, which started out much more about material costs, freight and so on. And now the greatest headwind, as you're mentioning, has to do with the rising interest rates and the implications on our factoring programs and the rest of our debt. And so we're actively working on overcoming these cost increases.

And as I believe all three of us said, it's really a two-pronged approach. It is about our own internal cost reduction initiatives because we do recognize that we bear some responsibility in managing these costs. And a lot of that is in the blocking and tackling type of cost reduction programs that we've always gone after, but that there is also the pricing component of it as well. We are actively working on it. I really can't speak specifically to the cadence, but we believe that there will be more pricing actions to come. And we're going to continue to pay close attention to where the inflation takes us and act accordingly.

I think you asked Daniel about implications to -- I guess, in the market to our customers' customer, and really, what we see -- what we have seen is that our products are largely not price sensitive due to their nature, in that, they are nondiscretionary and professionally installed, which typically means that the car owner, whose vehicle needs to be repaired, they -- I don't want to say that they basically have no choice and typically didn't appreciate what the cost is going to be anyway because it's a nonrecurring type of expense for them. And so these -- so inflation does not tend to destroy any demand at the end market.

Daniel Imbro

That's really helpful color. I appreciate it. And then I just had two on the Temperature Control segment. I guess, first, how are industry inventory levels? You talked about your inventory -- I think, Nathan, in your remarks. But how are industry levels after a pretty strong quarter? You had a warm summer. Are we entering kind of the winter with depleted inventories ahead of next year? Or how does that bode for next year's temperature control?

Eric Sills

Specific to Temperature Control, what we see is that the customer inventories for those that would have visibility in were relatively consistent throughout the quarter, basically showing that their purchases match their sales. And so as we go towards the fourth quarter and the off-season, their inventories are really in pretty good shape.

Daniel Imbro

Great. And then second one on Temp Control. You mentioned synergies from the Kade acquisition and kind of the opportunity in Europe. Can you just help size up like how big the opportunity is in Europe or maybe you provide more color on the potential synergies you see from that business?

Eric Sills

Sure. Well, as we stated in the announcement a few weeks ago when we announced the deal, the Kade Trading is really relatively small. It's about $6 million in revenue, of which we represented the majority of what they were selling with products that we were manufacturing in Asia and that they were selling into the European original equipment market. What we see as the opportunity here is really just another piece to the broader puzzle of our non-aftermarket global business, which is selling into these more niche original equipment channels, whether it's commercial vehicle, which is a lot of what Kade was selling into, or other construction, agricultural and so on.

And so by -- a lot of these accounts are global accounts, which require local support. And since KaDe Klima had a lot of these great relationships and we didn't have our own real footprint into Europe for the Temperature Control-type products, we believe that it will really open some more doors for us because as you can imagine, these types of accounts, they want to deal with the manufacturer. And Kade was really more of a trading company. This allows them to be working directly with us, the manufacturer of the product. So while we don't have any specific targets to speak of, we see this just as another really nice piece to the overall puzzle as we pursue this global niche OE marketplace with all the different products that we now are able to have in our basket of goods.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Scott Stember with MKM Partners.

Scott Stember

In the environment that we're in with interest rates and assuming we have some more to go here, could you just talk about how you view your debt structure going forward? And assuming no change, what could we look -- right now, what is the, I guess, the annualized interest expense number that we should look at? Again, this is just for the credit revolver and the other pieces.

Nathan Iles

Yes. So Scott, it's Nathan. We believe our capital structure is very adequate for where the business is today. We just did a refinancing back in June that gave us a lot of additional capacity, borrowing capacity, really shored up the liquidity position of the Company. So we feel really good about that, and nothing changed on that front.

I think with regard to factoring, in particular, we talked about this on the last quarter's call, I think the way to think about it is with sales that are factored roughly $800 million, each 1% moving interest rates, obviously, is about $8 million. And so if you just look at the interest curves that are out there, that would give you a flavor for where we're at.

Scott Stember

And just a pure interest expense number?

Nathan Iles

Yes. So Scott, I think it's disclosed in the 10-Ks, 10-Qs, but we're on a 30-day SOFR rate. Obviously, our borrowings at the end of the quarter were about $270 million. And so we'll expect to pay down the borrowings as the inventory levels reduce, but that's kind of what we're looking at today for interest rates.

Scott Stember

Okay. Looking at the other 25% of the business specialized, could you maybe talk about how you would expect that to perform in the event that we really do go into a recession next year?

Eric Sills

Sure, Scott. The way we view it is that we really are selling into multiple end markets with a relatively good balance across them. So we're not beholden to any one particular end market such as, say, power sports. So we believe that any volatility you would see in difficult economic times in these end markets somewhat get dampened by that diversification, and so we'll obviously watch it closely. But we feel reasonably comfortable that we have that hedging across the different markets.

Scott Stember

Okay. And just last question, after the Kade acquisition. Just trying to figure out if this is a way to move into heating products? Or is this more just the way to get into AC in Europe?

Eric Sills

Really, what we're seeing is that in the non-aftermarket portion of our business as well as we're going to see it in the aftermarket as well, it's really about thermal controls of all different types. So while it's air conditioning, it is also -- we're seeing a lot of growth and opportunities in battery cooling technologies, engine cooling technologies. And this really began to a degree with this joint venture that we have in China CYJ that's doing these electric compressors, but it's not solely for passenger compartment air conditioning, it is also about battery cooling on heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks and buses. And so this opens the door for these types of programs as well. I think we're going to start seeing the word thermal management a lot more in this space, and it's not just about air conditioning anymore.

Scott Stember

Got it. I guess this ties into the EV market, obviously, right?

Eric Sills

Very much. So we're seeing -- again, this Kade business is quite small, but some of the doors that they're opening for us have to do with cooling for electric vehicles and alternative energy vehicles, where they're not able to just operate with a basic belt-driven compressor air conditioning system off the combustion engine.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret Jordan

In the old days, we used to talk or we used to see Engine Management margins that would bump over 30%, and you used to sort of talk about that having a gradual upward bias. Is that mix structurally different now that those margin levels are off the table? Or is there a potential to get back up to higher margin rates?

Nathan Iles

Yes. So Bret, what we talked about, I think, earlier this year was with the mix shift to the more specialized initial OE business, We thought the margin range would be 28% to 29% rather than up above there. And so when you think about it from a long-term perspective, we would expect to get back into that range when things normalize, whenever that happens. And then to your point, we always have our continuous improvement programs that help us nudge up a bit each year.

Bret Jordan

Okay. Because that was my question, I guess, on the non-OE business, how do you see that shaking out from a margin potential standpoint? It's obviously it seems lower gross but maybe comparable EBIT.

Nathan Iles

Yes, that's right. That's the right way to think about it, lower gross margins but lower operating expenses to service that channel. And so operating profit and EBITDA are really right in line with where the aftermarket has been historically.

Bret Jordan

Okay. And then, I guess, did you say what the contribution of units versus price was in the roughly 3% growth in the quarter?

Eric Sills

I did not say, and there's a lot of moving pieces in there. And we don't have any specific data, but intuitively, I believe it is more about price than unit volume growth.

Bret Jordan

Okay. Great. And I guess one question, I guess, sort of following up on the pricing request to offset some of the factoring expenses. Are you seeing inversely any pressure from your customers asking for price concession, given things like shipping costs have come down and some of the material inputs?

Eric Sills

We're in a competitive market for sure, Bret, and nothing new about that. And so we have ongoing discussions with all of these accounts. We also believe we have very strong relationships with all of them and a mutual understanding of the benefit of the partnership that we enjoy and how that helps us both downstream in the market. So we work closely with them, and that's all I have to report on that.

Bret Jordan

Okay. Great. If I could slip one more question in on power sports because a peer is also involved in the space. Is this strategy to distribute parts through your traditional retail partners? Or is this a completely different customer base that you're selling that product into? I guess is it on the OE side? Is there an aftermarket component to that segment?

Eric Sills

It's completely on the OE side. We have -- there's a little bit of service parts through their dealership network. But no, it's not an aftermarket distribution play at all. It's all about new vehicle production.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Robert Smith with Center for Performance Investing.

Robert Smith

Could you give me some color on what's happening currently in China as far as it might affect you in your relationships?

Eric Sills

Sure. Thanks for the question, Robert. And to remind you and the rest of the audience, we're really there for two purposes. One is to support our North American aftermarket business with low-cost, high-quality products. And as it relates to that aftermarket business, it's a relatively small part of what we do. And we have pretty good amount of redundancy and diversification of supply, so from a risk mitigation-type standpoint.

As it relates to the other purpose of being there, which frankly, I think, is the more important strategic part, it's about servicing the Chinese original equipment market as well as the global market out of there. And we're really extremely pleased with the performance that we've had out of our joint ventures. I continue to emphasize the one that does electric compressors and some -- one of the darling of the bunch, but really all of them are doing very well. And all of them are actually gearing up towards new energy vehicle technology, both in China as well as the global market. And we're certainly paying very close attention to the geopolitical tensions going on right now. And we'll watch that very closely, but we really remain pretty bullish on what we're doing over there.

Robert Smith

Okay. In the non-aftermarket, the acquisition landscape, I assume that your acquisitions are quite opportunistic. And I'm wondering what the -- how do you see the cadence of this going forward? Do you see one or two acquisitions a year? Or how might this develop further?

Jim Burke

Robert, this is Jim Burke. The -- we don't set a target or a goal of completing X number of acquisitions per year or tie it to a specific revenue growth. We're very focused and disciplined in our approach to ensure that it's in the product categories that we're in and possibly expand the channels whether aftermarket or non-aftermarket channels that are there. We have a team that's always evaluating opportunities in the marketplace as they develop and as we look to find and source opportunities. So we're pleased with what we've completed so far and continue to look forward for all the future opportunities, but no specific target that would happen.

Robert Smith

Well, looking at, say, five years, do you have any idea as to what the percentage of category might have in the overall picture? You're at 25% now, I guess.

Eric Sills

We don't have any specific expectation. And frankly, we expect to grow both sides of the business, but we do recognize that in our non-aftermarket area, it presents itself with far greater opportunities largely because we're starting from such a low point, but also because it's more global, it's more diverse. There's so many different end markets to target that we really are just very excited about the potential growth opportunities. Similar to Jim's answer on acquisitions, we don't set ourselves with a particular target. We try to do things prudently and opportunistically and chase the right programs. And so we're excited about the progress we're making, and we see that really the sky is the limit on this area of our business.

Robert Smith

And looking at this, would you say that most will be accretive as far as looking at 12-month period?

Nathan Iles

Yes, Robert. We would expect the acquisitions that we do to be accretive to the bottom line, certainly within the first 12 months, and that's typically what we target.

Robert Smith

Yes. How about the labor picture as far as cost, supply availability and retention? What's happening with you guys?

Jim Burke

Robert, this is Jim Burke, again. We've been facing pressures on there, everybody with the inflationary pressures that we have. But the shortage of labor especially when we were in season, and I'm speaking specifically more towards the distribution end, that was a challenge, securing warehouse distribution, people and specifically specialized drivers that are there. We've got over the hump with the season being a peak season. And again, we're converting many of our temporary workers that we bring on board to full-time employees and offer and show them the benefits of being a full-time employee with the benefits that SMP offers.

Robert Smith

And your retention rates?

Jim Burke

Retention rates, again, we're very focused on that, too. During the -- a couple of years ago and really up until now, the turnover was very high as there was high demand, especially in the warehouse and distribution area offering potentially short-term bonuses for hiring. We've really secured and looked to get a stable workforce that's in place, and again, talk about all the benefits of being a long-term employee. So I believe our turnover rate has been reduced and more in a reasonable environment that we could work within.

Eric Sills

Let me just add one thing to that. The high turnover that Jim was speaking to within our hourly associates tends to be in the most junior of our employees. We find that once our people spend a couple of years with us, they stay with us for life. And we're very proud of that. We're especially proud of that when you look in our salaried and professional ranks. Our turnover has been extremely low during these last couple of years when you hear about some of the challenges that a lot of other companies have had, notions of The Great Resignation and so on. We believe that our employees truly enjoy working with us, and we have not seen that type of turnover that a lot of other companies have spoken to. We're really very proud of that.

Robert Smith

Yes, it sounds good. And just finally, there's been so much written about bringing production back to the United States. Any thoughts on this?

Jim Burke

Robert, Jim Burke. There have been instances that we do bring production back. And we look, too, with automation, where many times where we may have moved to offshore or south of the border was more manual operations. We have looked at introducing automation into the cells and that was one of the points I made about cost reduction efforts, and it's proven to be beneficial. We have better control over the product and the quality that's there. So it is a focused area that we look at near shoring or reshoring opportunities for sourcing and also for manufacturing. We have -- for our JVs in China, we have repetitive duplicate production facilities to be able to handle that volume so that we're covered and minimize any risk exposure also.

Operator

It appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.

Tony Cristello

After cratering in the 2020 Covid Crash, Natural Gas has been enjoying a price surge over the past 2+ years. It went over $9.00 in August 2022, but has declined to the ~mid-$5.00 region since then. Still, it's much higher than it has been in many years:

fnvz

ONEOK Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is one of the larger integrated players in the Natural Gas industry. It engages in gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas in the US. As one of the premier natgas companies, it has benefited greatly from rising natgas prices.

OKE has 3 segments - Natural Gas Gathering and Processing, Natural Gas Liquids - NGL, and Natural Gas Pipelines. The NGL segment is its largest, with ~60% of annual EBITDA, followed by Gathering and Processing, at ~25%, and Pipelines, at ~10%+.

OKE site

Segment Volumes:

The NGL segment had ~ 4.5% overall raw feed volume growth in Q2 '22 vs. Q1 '22; and management is expecting anywhere from ~2% to over 12% average growth for full year 2022, with ~90% of its NGL revenues fee based.

OKE site

OKE's Gathering & Processing segment has benefited from rapidly increasing efficiency over the past several years - it now takes only ~1/3rd as many well connects to produce 3X the amount of processed volumes, with much higher gas-to-oil ratios in the Williston Basin. As of 6/30/22, OKE had 157 wells connected. Management expects to connect 375-425 wells in 2022.

OKE site

OKE's Natural Gas Pipelines are connected directly to end-use markets - local gas distribution companies, electric-generation facilities, and large industrial companies. This segment usually has >95% of its transportation capacity contracted on a fee basis.

OKE site

Earnings:

Q1-2 '22 saw continuing strong topline growth, with Revenue up ~74%. Net Income was up 10.6%, while EBITDA rose ~5% - milder growth rates than in full year 2021. Management greatly expanded Capex in Q1-2 '22, after cutting it back by 68% in 2021 - the 72.5% rise in Capex costs explains the 15.7% decline in DCF, and the sub-1X Distributions coverage factor for Q1-2 '22:

Hidden Dividend Stocks Plus

Looking back further shows a good jump in ROIC in 2021 vs. 2017; and good EBITDA growth through various commodity price cycles since 2013:

OKE site

Guidance:

Management's full year 2022 guidance calls for a Net Income midpoint of $1690M, which would be 6% growth vs. 2021. Adjusted EBITDA's midpoint of $3620M implies 7% growth in 2022.

Diluted EPS guidance of $3.45 to $4.07 calls for a broad growth range of 2.7% to 21% vs. 2021. Q1-2 '22 EPS was $1.79, so OKE needs to generate $1.66 - $2.28 in EPS in the 2nd half of 2022 in order to achieve management's full year 2022 guidance figures:

OKE site

Dividends:

At its 10/28/22 intraday price of $58.34, OKE yielded 6.41%. Its trailing coverage factor is 1.02X, due to higher Capex. It goes ex-dividend on Monday, 10/31/22, and then should go ex-dividend next on ~1/28/23.

Hidden Dividend Stocks Plus

At 8.92%, OKE has one of the better 5-year dividend growth rates in the midstream industry, with a 25-plus record of not cutting dividends.

OKE site

Profitability & Leverage:

OKE's ROA and ROE have both improved a great deal vs. pre-Covid figures, with both much higher than industry averages. EBITDA Margin has declined, as EBITDA growth % has trailed Revenue growth over the last 6 quarters.

Net Debt/EBITDA has improved quite a bit, as has Interest coverage.

Hidden Dividend Stocks Plus

Debt & Liquidity:

OKE has a $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement, which expires in June 2027. It also has access to $1.0 billion, via its “at-the-market” ATM equity program.

As of June 30, 2022, OKE had no borrowings under its $2.5B Credit Agreement and had $135.8M in cash and cash equivalents.

In July 2022, management redeemed the remaining $895.8M of its $900M, 3.375% senior notes due October 2022 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand and short-term borrowings. As of July 31, 2022, OKE had $860 million of short-term borrowings outstanding.

OKE's debt has an Investment Grade Credit Rating of BBB-/Baa3.

Valuations:

At 1.22X, OKE's P/Sales is its deepest undervaluation vs. industry averages, while its P/Book of 4.28X is also lower than average. It has a higher than average dividend yield and EV/EBITDA. While there's no comp for P/DCF, 15.37X doesn't look cheap, vs. valuations we've seen in the past.

Hidden Dividend Stocks Plus

Analysts' Price Targets:

At its 10/28/22 intraday price of $58.34, OKE is 6% above analysts' $55.00 lowest price target, and ~13% below the $67.00 average price target.

Hidden Dividend Stocks Plus

Performance:

Although it has mostly trailed the Midstream industry and the broad Energy sector, OKE has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past month, quarter, year, and so far in 2022. Its total 1-Year return is ~-9.68%, vs. -14.66% for the S&P.

Hidden Dividend Stocks Plus

Parting Thoughts

OKE will report its Q3 '22 earnings after the market closes on Nov. 1, 2022. Given the current environment, you may want to wait for that report. OKE is a well-run company, with a good long term record - we advise waiting for the next market panic before jumping aboard.

328,GWM aspirant reaches Thai market,https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2022/10/31/4505705_700.jpg,30/10/2022,Great Wall Motors (GWM) has been quite successful in breaking into the Thai automobile market thanks to products with a large number of advanced features along with attractive pricing.,https://www.bangkokpost.com/auto/review/2426255/gwm-aspirant-reaches-thai-market,"Great Wall Motors (GWM) has been quite successful in breaking into the Thai automobile market thanks to products with a large number of advanced features along with attractive pricing.

The Chinese automaker has been able to deliver more than 10,000 vehicles here, comprising the Haval H6 Hybrid and Jolion Hybrid crossovers, along with the ORA Good Cat electric car.

According to GWM, the carmaker has over 900,000 followers on social media with more than 100,000 users on its GWM app after two years in the Kingdom. GWM has been highly active with online-to-offline (O2O) network expansion, aiming to reach 80 stores nationwide by the end of 2022 (up from the current 54).

Earlier this month GWM launched the H6 PHEV, the plug-in hybrid version of the H6, which allows users to drive in pure electric mode for 201km in NEDC cycle (approximately 140-150km in WLTP cycle), thanks to its 34kWh lithium battery.

GWM held the world premiere of the vehicle at the Thailand International Motor Expo in Thailand late last year, but the official launch and pricing announcement took part earlier this month. According to GWM, more than 7,000 people signed up during the pre-order period, with 1,241 orders finally placed within the first 24 hours of the official launch.

The Haval H6 PHEV is priced at 1.699 million baht, which is a significant increase over the 1.149 million-1.249 million baht asked for the H6 Hybrid.

But there's a kick. Apart from the first 300 customers enjoying a 50,000 baht discount, those who place orders from Oct 7-31 are also entitled to a 167,000 baht special package that includes low-interest financing, insurance, home charger and installation, free labour and parts for 5 years/100,000km and free 24-hour roadside assistance for five years.

Meanwhile, the standard warranty offered is five years/150,000km (eight years/180,000km for hybrid battery).

Design

The H6 PHEV shares the same 2,738mm wheelbase as the hybrid, but is a tad taller (1,730mm vs 1,724mm) and longer (4,683mm vs 4,653mm).

For the front-end design, the H6 PHEV gets a special ""Star Matrix"" treatment that looks like a combination of the regular H6 Hybrid and Jolion (which takes a lot from the Peugeot design). While the huge chrome radiator grille in the H6 Hybrid offers an elegant appearance, the 3D grille in the H6 PHEV appears modern and more stylish, flanked by intelligent LED headlights.

There's not much difference with the rest of the exterior design, with highlights being the large 1.2m² panoramic glass sunroof, 19in alloy wheels and LED rear light strip. Nevertheless, a nice upgrade in the H6 PHEV is the powered tailgate with kick gesture.

The fuel flap for the H6 Hybrid is located above the rear left wheel arch while the H6 PHEV gets an additional flap on the right side for charging the battery.

As expected, the interior gets gold trim on several components, such as the steering wheel and upper console/door panel, with several upgrades inside as well including the 10.25-inch digital instrument panel display and a 12.3-inch centre touchscreen, head-up display, wireless charger and front passenger seat adjustment buttons for the driver.

The multi-function steering wheel is wrapped in leather but the rest of the cabin gets synthetic leather upholstery. The two-tone colour theme looks well and there's a good amount of soft touch areas. Both front seats are powered and ventilated, offering extra comfort.

Technophiles will appreciate the H6 PHEV's many features that can be operated via smartphone. There also is a comprehensive intelligent safety package, which alerts drivers to potential dangers with a large number of audible warnings.

While Japanese brands are reluctant to automate parking, GWM does offer this function, which comes in handy when having to park in tight spaces.

There's also intelligent cruise control as well as automatic reverse assistant that memorises the last 50m driven and helps you reverse steer out of a narrow passage.

Performance

The H6 PHEV gets a 1.5-litre turbocharged gas engine and electric motor that GWM claims to produce as much as 326hp and 530Nm, which seems questionably high.

It comes with a 34kWh battery (up from 1.69kWh in the H6 Hybrid with 243hp and 530Nm) and has eight driving modes (four in EV and four in hybrid) courtesy of the dedicated hybrid transmission that delivers power to the front wheels (there's no all-wheel-drive option). The gear selector is a dial that looks and feels luxurious.

Floor the throttle and you get decent acceleration for a vehicle weighing 1,881kg (compared to 1,690kg for the H6 Hybrid).

GWM says the battery takes 35 minutes to charge via a DC fast charger (0-80%) and six hours via an AC charger (0-100%).

The most common question for the vehicle is how far can it run in EV mode. The claimed figure of 201km (NEDC), is significantly lower in real-world driving. During the test drive event held by GWM recently, I managed roughly 160km in pure electric mode (mostly highway cruising plus some high-speed acceleration) before the battery level dropped to 10% and the system went back to hybrid mode.

While 160km might not sound good for an EV, it is fine for a plug-in hybrid since the vehicle can run in hybrid mode thanks to the 55 litre fuel tank that can take you several hundred kilometres further. In fact if you commute 50km per day, you can drive it in EV mode for three days on a single charge.

Haval says that the front strut, rear multi-link suspension has been retuned to absorb the extra weight of the battery. There are stabilisers both front and rear, and the improved dampers do a better job in absorbing vibration and shock than those offered in the H6 Hybrid.

All-round disc brakes come with three regenerative settings, plus a one-pedal function when driving in EV mode.

Verdict

The Haval H6 PHEV is an attractive upgrade from the hybrid variant, offering buyers a decent electric range without having to purchase an EV, plus several small upgrades here and there. However, the pricing is also significantly higher than the Hybrid.",electric vehicles,bangkok post

After six months of closure for the rainy season, Koh Lanta is now reopening to the outside world.

Due to mass tourism, Koh Lanta has grown from island communities to an urban sprawl of hotels, restaurants, bars and shops. In 2019, nearly 300,000 tourists poured in. But with the pandemic and suspension of international travel, tourists vanished and businesses came to a halt. However, after more than two years, Koh Lanta is coming back to life again as the country is fully open to foreign visitors.

Regardless of Covid-19, infrastructure development has been under way to prepare for a tourism boom. The Department of Rural Roads finished construction of a 21km two-lane road on the eastern side of Koh Lanta last year. It will also build a new two-lane 2.2km bridge connecting the island to Krabi next year. The landmark project is due to be completed in 2026.

While community residents have hailed the improvement in the standard of living, they have also raised concerns that the new bridge will speed up overtourism and urban sprawl.

""It will boost the economy at the expense of our environment,"" said Auraiwan Kueachat, a local waste recycling business owner. ""Given our small island, overpopulation really affects our environment. For example, it generates a lot of waste per day.""

Koh Lanta consists of 53 islands, but only four of them -- Koh Klang, Koh Lanta Noi, Koh Lanta Yai and Koh Por -- are inhabited. According to an official record, there are 34,000 community residents -- mostly Muslims -- but its hidden population accounts for another 34,000.

Some villagers are making an effort to protect their way of life. Hidden on the eastern side of Koh Lanta Yai, Tung Yee Peng is an age-old community of Muslims. It takes its name after an early settler from Sai Buri, or Kedah, in Malaysia. Nowadays, locals catch fish and grow crops for a living. Protected by law, its community forest covers 1,955 rai of land. Mangrove trees flank a canal that connects to the vast sea.

""We cannot escape tourism, but can choose to design it in our own way,"" said Narathon Hongthong, president of the Tung Yee Peng Ecotourism Community Enterprise.

It is not the first time island communities have come under external pressure. In the 1980s, the government granted concessions to a factory, and more than half of the island's locals were employed to cut mangrove trees to make charcoal. Special rights were scrapped in the 1990s when tourism gained ground and attracted the local workforce. In the meantime, capitalists bought land for development.

A turning point came in 2003 when Narathon returned home and decided to join like-minded friends in creating community-based tourism. Package tours during off-peak hours provide opportunities for tourists to explore the local lifestyle, such as homemade cuisine, music and charcoal boats (local gondolas), at a slow pace. It caps the number of visitors at 100 per day.

""A group of six French tourists stayed with us for three days in 2003. They went to sea, splashed water in the canal and had a picnic on the beach at night. On the last day of their trip, they said they didn't want to leave. It is a reminder of tourism that caters to experience. I think we have everything -- the Sun, the Moon, serenity and nature -- people want,"" he said.

In fact, it is not only island communities but hotels that have taken up environmental stewardship. Surrounded by tropical forest, Pimalai Resort & Spa has been unwavering in the sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the environment. Charinthip Tiyaphorn, a second-generation owner of Pimalai, recounted her childhood experience when the construction of the hotel started.

""In those days, there was no electricity and roads. I came here by ferry. I stayed at a camp and had nothing to do. It was like being a castaway. It was not a memorable experience, but a close bond developed because the resort has grown from scratch and contributed to the island,"" she said.

Charinthip said the tourism boom contributed to an expansion of hotels and resorts, but the fact that they are not high-rise buildings and zoning regulations remain in place still helps maintain the human-nature relationship. The construction of the new bridge will bring opportunities and challenges. When more tourists pour in, they will stimulate economic activity, but pollute the environment.

""Our business is doing well because we sell clean air, a beautiful beach and the forest, and thus must protect it. Also, the impact of climate change is real. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. We should do everything to slow it down,"" she said.

Pimalai has launched sustainability campaigns including beachfront cleaning, zero food waste and water treatment. For a decade, its key to success was in the reduction of waste by 90% and the production of fertiliser. This year, it has released turtles and crabs into the sea. It is now studying the feasibility of transitioning to electric vehicles and implementing a carbon footprint tracking scheme.

""Covid-19 taught us we cannot work alone. Hotels and local communities must join hands to pursue the goal of sustainability,"" she said.

It is also a daunting task for local authorities. Before Covid-19, Koh Lanta was touted as a paradise for foreign tourists. But the advent of the pandemic stunted international travel. Following reopening, tourists are trickling in. Still, the local government is tapping into new opportunities, such as tourists from neighbouring countries like Malaysia.

Nopparat Sriprom, Koh Lanta district chief, took up the post eight months ago. He said the new bridge will be ""a turning point"" that opens up the island to domestic and international visitors. Despite environmental challenges, laws will set the direction of development. City planning and zoning maps are now in place. And there are other regulations for different zones, including the national park, the non-hunting area and the national forest.

""Next year, we will launch the Koh Lanta Declaration to ensure that the protection of natural resources goes hand in hand with tourism,"" he said.

Sustainability apparently has become a permanent fixture, but it is more than environmental protection. Nopparat plans to promote local identity to ensure that communities can take pride in their roots. Next month, an event is scheduled to promote villages that show the potential for community-based tourism.

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Allegro's President and CEO, Vineet Nargolwala. Vineet, please go ahead.

Vineet Nargolwala

Thank you, Leanne. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal second quarter earnings call. Before getting into my prepared remarks, I want to take this opportunity to recognize Allegro's team members in Ukraine. I want to acknowledge the tremendous courage and extend my appreciation for their dedication in the face of very real and ongoing hardship. Our team in Ukraine is an integral part of Allegro's global operations, and we will continue doing all that we can do to support our colleagues and their families during this brutal conflict.

Shifting gears to the overall business. We had an excellent quarter that was highlighted by the team's strong execution to meet continued robust demand despite several crosscurrents in the macroeconomic environment. Revenue was another quarterly record at $237.7 million, representing sustained sequential growth and an acceleration of growth year-over-year.

Our better-than-expected top line performance in the quarter was largely due to continued momentum in our strategic focus areas of e-mobility and select industrial markets and incremental improvement in supply from our foundry partners. Margins also came in strong on the back of operational execution and favorable foreign exchange. This highlights the substantial operating leverage in our model, contributing to significant bottom line growth.

Having now been in the role for 4 months, I want to briefly expand on some of our observations and actions taken to date. On our previous quarterly call, I indicated that my initial plan centered around Allegro getting even closer to our customers, and finding new ways to energize our growth, while also executing better as a team. And that has underpinned the activities of our entire leadership team over the past few months. This has involved meeting with the broad part of our teams and customers including our global sites in Europe, Asia and the America's.

In fact, Derek and I just returned from two consecutive weeks of face-to-face meetings with our teams, customers and strategic partners in Asia. These meetings have underscored the tremendous growth available to us and the opportunities to expand our customer relationships.

As part of our intent to improve customer intimacy, we have created OEM focused business development teams for both, the automotive and industrial end markets. These global teams will engage directly with OEMs and Tier 1s on hard-to-do and mission-critical problems, leverage our global engineering organization to develop solutions and our partner network to deliver that. We have terrific capabilities across the global team, and we will augment and expand our expertise in specific areas and geographies.

For example, today, we are working to establish additional resources in geographies such as Europe and Japan to bring us closer to multiple strategic customers. In further support of this strategy and to accelerate our future growth, we recently completed an agreement to transition our go-to-market approach in Japan that will allow for more direct customer engagement. Going forward, we would directly lead our engagements with Japanese auto OEMs, which is particularly meaningful as the transition to a fully electric future.

In addition, we have commenced a series of steps to accelerate our innovation and enhance the execution of our product road map. This includes establishing a new role and the appointment of Mike Duke as our first ever Chief Technology Officer. Mike will lead a dedicated team to incubate new technologies, both organically as well as through partners, in our strategic growth areas and bring proven costs to scale.

In conjunction with this appointment, we are also pleased to have Suman Narayan lead the execution of our product road maps and customer programs as Senior Vice President of Products. Suman will work closely with our global sales teams to execute our product strategy in the market, as well as with our operations teams on initiatives to improve the customer experience and expand margins.

Also, during the quarter, we successfully closed the acquisition of Heyday Integrated Circuits, an early-stage fabless company. As a reminder, Heyday focuses on the design of fully integrated, isolated gate drivers for applications that leverage high voltage gallium nitride and silicon carbide materials. Heyday not only complements Allegro's existing sensor IC solutions for energy efficiency, it also meaningfully expands our future SAM [ph] to include applications across xEV, solar inverters, data center and broad industrial markets.

While we don't expect material revenue contribution in the near-term, we are fully committed to capitalizing on this opportunity and have appointed one of our most experienced executives to lead the scaling of this disruptive technology and bring it to market. At the foundation of Allegro's success, is our focus on secular megatrends that are driving outsized growth with specific end markets that include e-mobility, data centers, clean energy and Industry 4.0.

While we are primarily developing new technology platforms for e-mobility, we see a great opportunity to leverage our technology as we solve similar problems for customers in our target industrial markets. And across all these end markets, I see a unique opportunity for Allegro that extends beyond providing superior technology and service, the more profound opportunity to enable our customers' transition to a more sustainable future.

Turning to the key highlights for the quarter. We continue to realize growing traction with our new products targeting our strategic growth areas. Design win momentum was strong. Overall demand continued to outpace near-term capacity and we exited the quarter with over a year's worth of order backlog.

Our automotive business had another strong quarter with sequential and year-over-year growth, led by accelerated adoption of our IT solutions for xEV inverter and onboard charging applications. Complementing our traction in vehicle electrification, we saw continued customer adoption of our cross portfolio content in ADAS solutions for advanced steering and braking applications.

E-mobility which represents our xEV and ADAS applications, expanded to a record 41% of automotive sales in the fiscal second quarter, and we are pleased with the balanced contribution of both, our sensing and power products, to this growth. E-mobility design wins increased 68% compared to fiscal Q1. Of note is the teams work directly with a major EV manufacturer to incorporate Allegro's ICs into one of the newest model steering system.

Our industrial business achieved record sales with solid double-digit growth sequentially and year-over-year. Growth was driven by target markets of Industry 4.0, clean energy and data centers. Additionally, data center continues to offer significant opportunities for long-term growth, as highlighted by our two new multiyear design wins in the quarter.

From a product line perspective, we continue to extend our market leadership in magnetic sensors as our innovative and best-in-class products are adopted by automotive OEMs, building out the electrified platforms. We are also very pleased with our power IC business, which grew 21% sequentially and almost 50% year-over-year. We continue to make strides with these products' efficiency story, especially in motors.

I will now turn the call over to Derek to review the financial results and provide guidance for our fiscal third quarter. Derek?

Derek D'Antilio

Thank you, Vineet, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss the financial results, I will provide an update on what we are seeing in our business environment. As Vineet highlighted, we had a great quarter with strong growth resulting from our focus on markets that we believe offer long-term secular growth.

We continue to see robust demand across our strategic focus areas within both, the automotive and industrial markets. We also once again ended Q2 with more than a year of backlog and extended visibility. While we expect our positive trajectory to continue, we do acknowledge, there is increasing uncertainty relating to the broader macroeconomic environment, including pervasive inflation and clear signs of slowing consumer demand. Similar to many peers, we have noted a softening of demand, specific to some of our computer and consumer applications.

However, I would like to emphasize that these end markets traditionally represent less than 50% of our total sales in any given quarter. That said, we continue to be very vigilant and proactively monitor a series of leading indicators for potential changes in demand and supply dynamics across each of our end markets.

We regularly review key metrics, including design wins to ensure our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to have extended visibility into the future, bookings and cancellations, and inventory levels at our distributors and at our end customers. We have seen some increases in inventories at individual distributors and in certain regions. However, weeks on hand is still well below targeted in pre-pandemic levels. In addition, based on recent and ongoing discussions with our OEM customers, we do not believe they are building inventories of our products.

In order to further confirm the integrity of our backlog and ensure that we are shipping the majority of our products into production, we recently opened our reschedule and cancellation window to allow customers with past due orders or orders shippable beyond 180 days to reschedule or cancel orders with certain parameters. This action in Q2 did not significantly change our overall backlog.

Further, cancellations and rescheduled orders were largely within our other end markets such as the computer and consumer segments in the broader industrial market. We believe this is a good health check of our backlog that helps us with efficient order schedule.

From a supply perspective, we still expect 200-millimeter wafer supply to remain tight for the remainder of our fiscal '23. Our supply chain teams continue to work very closely with our fab partners on improvements in future capacity for FY '24 and beyond. In Q2, we are pleased that our wafer ramp with TSMC is progressing well and about a quarter ahead of schedule. And as a result, our shipments in the quarter exceeded our guidance range.

Now turning to Q2 results. Please note that all income statement related measures except sales are stated here on a non-GAAP basis. In Q2, we achieved record sales of $238 million. Our gross margins were 56.2%, OpEx was 28.3% of sales, and EBITDA was 33%. Our business model continued to deliver strong operating leverage with sequential operating income growth of 20%, more than 2x the growth in sales, and EPS was $0.31 per share.

Sales in the second quarter increased 9% sequentially and 23% compared to Q2 of fiscal '22. Sales were above the high-end of our guidance range as a result of the incremental supply from our foundry partners and solid execution at our internal assembly and test facility. Automotive sales increased 5% sequentially and were up 25% compared to Q2 of the prior year.

Within automotive, xEV and ADAS or e-mobility represented 41% of sales, up from 35% a year ago. Industrial sales increased by 20% and were up 33% versus last year. We saw sequential growth in all areas of our industrial market, including data center, which increased another 13% sequentially and around 230% compared to Q2 of fiscal '22. Other sales, which include the computer, consumer and smart home applications also increased in terms of shipment and sales to $32 million and were approximately 14% of sales in the quarter.

Sales through distribution continue to be robust and with 37% of sales in the quarter, consistent with Q1. Sales by geography were again well balanced with 26% of sales in China, 19% of sales in Japan, 24% in the rest of Asia, 17% in Europe and 14% in North America.

Now turning to profitability. Gross margin in the quarter was 56.2%, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Gross margins included a benefit of approximately 120 basis points from favorable foreign exchange which we expect to continue into Q3. Excluding foreign exchange, gross margins were at the high-end of our guidance range and on our previously stated operating model of 55%.

Operating expenses were 28.3% of sales compared to 29.6% in Q1, contributing to our increasing operating leverage. We continue to invest in innovation, particularly in research and development, and sales in our strategic focus areas. Both R&D and SG&A expenses represented approximately 14% of sales, each in the second quarter.

Operating income increased to 27.9% of sales compared to 25.3% in Q1 and 24% in Q2 of fiscal '22. Our operating margin increased by 380 basis points compared to a year ago, continuing to demonstrate the leverage in the model. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 10%, and we expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to now be 12%. This is lower than our previous guidance of 14% to 15% due to recent state tax changes. The Q2 share count was 192.6 million shares. Net income was $59.8 million or $0.31 per share, an increase of 27% sequentially on a comparable sales increase of 9%.

Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended Q2 with cash and equivalents of $303 million. In terms of working capital, DSO in Q2 was 46 days compared to 51 in Q1, and days of inventory were 85 days compared to 81 in Q1, still below our target of around 110 days. From a cash flow standpoint, cash flow from operations was $56 million; capital expenditures, largely for assembly and test capacity was $21 million; and free cash flow was $35 million.

Finally, turning to our Q3 outlook. We expect sales to be in the range of $240 million to $250 million. In Q3, we expect auto sales to grow slightly above the midpoint of that range. Industrial to be in line with the midpoint and sales through our other markets could be flat to down sequentially. We are also increasing our sales growth expectations for FY '23 to approximately 24%, up from our previous guidance of 20%.

From a profitability standpoint, we expect gross margin in Q3 to be approximately 56%, which includes projected favorable foreign exchange into our third quarter. Additionally, we expect operating expenses to be approximately 28% of sales, which includes the first full quarter of expenses associated with the acquisition of Heyday.

For Q3, assuming no changes to tax legislation, we expect our tax rate to be 12%, and we expect that diluted share count to be approximately 193 million shares. Based upon these assumptions, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.33 per share.

I will now turn the call back over to Vineet. Vineet?

Vineet Nargolwala

Thanks, Derek. We are pleased to have delivered record performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, I believe Allegro is at a key inflection point with an incredible opportunity to scale the company. We have a great product portfolio and considerable engineering talent, and there is a very real opportunity to do even more with what we currently have.

The markets and applications that we serve are underpinned by strong secular trends, which we believe will continue to expand and drive growth for Allegro in both, the near term and over the next decade. We acknowledge the challenging crosscurrents in the global economy and have reinforced our situational awareness and management operating system to monitor leading indicators and respond to any changes.

That said, we continue to be very positive on our growth expectations as reflected by our third quarter guidance and increased revenue outlook for fiscal '23, and we are confident in Allegro's ability to outperform underlying markets as we execute our strategies.

With that, we will be glad to take your questions. Leanne?

Leanne Sievers

Thank you, Vineet. That concludes management's prepared remarks, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please review the instructions for asking a question and initiate the Q&A session?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Gary Mobley

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I want to start up by asking about the new revised growth projection for the fiscal year '24 versus '20? It sounds like the incremental contribution or upside, I should say, is coming from additional supply mainly from TSMC, I presume or maybe UMC as well. Maybe if you could just speak to that and as it relates to the outlook into the next calendar year, to what extent is near-term sales being, I guess, governed by lack of supply? And how do you see incremental supply coming on as we progress through the conclusion of this calendar year and as well into next calendar year?

Derek D'Antilio

Yes, Gary, this is Derek. Thank you for the question. So within this fiscal year, we still see constrained on the 200 millimeter, and we continue to get some incremental supply. We're about a quarter ahead with TSMC, which allowed us to ship ahead a little bit in Q2 here, above our guidance range. We are working on incremental supply with -- and we're at about the wafer receipts level on a run rate with TSMC, which turns into full shipment about a quarter later. So that will factor into our Q3 and Q4.

We have been able to get some incremental supply from some of our other partners here for the remainder of fiscal '23, and that's really what's driving this increase from the 20% to 24%. And that's what's been driving it all year when we started with the year just below mid-teens and raised that to 20% and now to about the 24% range. That's really all the incremental supply. The backlog and the demand hasn't really changed, other than the pockets that we talked about. Going into fiscal '24, our supply chain teams are really working pretty diligently with all of our partners on incremental supply, and we're working to align that now with -- certainly, with our past due backlog and to align that with demand.

Gary Mobley

And my follow-up question, I want to ask about your exposure to China from an end-market perspective from a domestic China production standpoint. Curious if you can share with us your best sense of the exposure there with respect to your supply chain and just general China consumer-related demand and the impact that you may experience because of COVID mitigation, export restrictions and all the different headwinds that U.S. companies seem to be dealing with, with respect to China.

Derek D'Antilio

Yes. Gary, I will start with the supply side, and Vineet can talk a little bit about the demand side in China. But our sales in China were pretty robust this quarter. They were 26% of sales. And on the supply side, we do use a subcontractor in China. It's a relatively low percentage of our overall subcontracting. About half of our assembly is done in-house in the Philippines at our facility. The other half is done at subcontract as most of those subcontractors are either in Malaysia or the Philippines, there is one in China to support our Chinese customers. And I'll let Vineet talk a little bit about demand in China.

Vineet Nargolwala

Sure, Gary. What I would add is that demand in China continues to be really strong across our target markets. In automotive, I think everybody is aware, China is already the leading manufacturer of EVs, electric vehicles. And so we're getting great take rate for our products as those platforms continue to grow and ramp. We're also seeing great progress in Industrial 4.0 or factory automation, where increasing automation in the factories in China is resulting in higher take rate for motion control products as well as on clean energy with EV charging.

You also had a question in there around sort of the export climate for China. And obviously, it's an area that we're watching very closely. The export restrictions into China -- involving China have been fluid for a few years. At this point, we believe the actions taken largely target advanced computing and other advanced semiconductor items. Our products are not falling under those regulations today. And given the nature of our supply chain activities and products, we don't expect that these new controls will affect us here in the near-term.

Gary Mobley

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter with Cowen. Your line is open.

Joshua Buchalter

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results and execution. I wanted to double click on gross margins, which improved materially sequentially in the quarter and are expected to sustain in the guidance. I know you called out, FX is providing a tailwind. But anything underneath the hood, whether it's pricing or mix, it also contributed as we sort of try to understand how sustainable these levels are, or was it more -- anything on the cost side as well. Thank you.

Derek D'Antilio

Yes, Josh, this is Derek. Good question. So going from Q1, where we finished at about 54.9% non-GAAP gross margins of 56.2%, that was largely FX kind of when you net everything else. But within that, there's quite a few things that can move gross margin around. Average ASP and mix is probably the biggest determinant of our gross margin right now.

And on the cost side, inflation continues to persist. So we have had pricing throughout the year and throughout last year. But actually, going from Q1 to Q2, pricing was a relatively insignificant portion of that increase in both, sales and gross margin was almost likely volume, and the gross margin piece was largely foreign exchange when you net out the other pieces.

Joshua Buchalter

Got it. Thank you. And I wanted to ask about the banking distribution agreement. In particular, can you walk us through why now was the right time to end that agreement? And I know you talked about the opportunity to work more directly with OEMs. But should we expect you to add any other distribution partners in Japan? And what does this do, I guess, to the long-term opportunity within Japan? Thank you.

Vineet Nargolwala

Sure. Happy to take that, Josh. As I stated in my previous earnings call, our goal is to develop more customer intimacy to really be close to the customers as they tackle some of the hardest problems in the transition to an electrified future. Our change in Japan is a direct result of that initiative. And what it allows us to do is, bring our engineers even closer to our customers' engineers as they start to build out electrified platforms and really transition their entire portfolio to an all-electric future.

You must have seen some reports coming out of Japan around the Toyota Group making, wrapping up their latest EV platform and also contemplating a change in strategy to an all-electric future. The good news there is that we are very close to all of the suppliers that are enabling that transition. And this change would allow us to be even closer to the engineering teams as they build those platforms out. So we're really excited about the change. We've been very pleased with the partnership with Sanken so far, and they'll continue to be supporting on for us. But this change is more about our engineers becoming more directly involved and engaged with our customers' engineers going forward.

Joshua Buchalter

Understood. Thank you, I will hop back in the queue.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open.

Blayne Curtis

Hey, good morning, and great results. Maybe I'll start with just following up on my last question. In terms of the transition, is that a wash, a headwind or a tailwind? I mean, obviously, I'm assuming you've got to ramp down thanking and then put that product somewhere else. So sometimes that has an effect. I'm just curious if we should be thinking of anything for you.

Derek D'Antilio

Yes. This is Derek, Blayne. And from a sort of a profitability standpoint, it's a wash. There might be a little bit of geography between the gross margin line and the OpEx line as we start to bring some of the folks on board there to directly support our customers, and we expect it to be actually an increase eventually on the top line. That's why we're doing this, to get closer to customers and really improve our EV sales and mobility sales in Japan.

Blayne Curtis

Got you. And then I wanted to ask, I thought I heard you say that power was up 21%. And obviously, you've had a good data center tailwind, but it seems to be a lot larger than that. Can you just comment on the strength in your power products?

Vineet Nargolwala

Yes. Blayne, we're seeing a really good strength across our end markets for our power products. Obviously, data center gets a lot of play. It's a big area of focus for us. But when we look at the application of our gate drivers, onboard chargers, in EV charging applications, in the safety comfort and convenience section of our automotive segment, where our motor drivers go into the HVAC systems as well as in-seat cooling. We're seeing some really high take rates there. So we're really pleased with the progress our Power Products segment has made and we continue to be bullish about its future.

Blayne Curtis

Thanks a lot.

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alessandra Vecchi with William Blair. Your line is open.

Alessandra Vecchi

I echo the congratulations on the really strong quarter in this environment. Just one question on the data center to new multiyear design wins you mentioned. How do we think about the products that you're selling into that? Is it -- does it extend beyond 3-phase fans? Or is this a continuation of the strength we've been hearing about for multiple quarters now on that front?

Vineet Nargolwala

Yes, Alessandra, thank you for the question. It is really an extension of the success we've been seeing with our 3 phase -- with our motors with 3-phase fans. The other piece here is the transition to 48:4 as well. So that is also contributing to our success here. And the design wins that we mentioned reflect both those product segments.

Alessandra Vecchi

Okay. And then on the -- as well on the sort of opening of the reschedule and cancellation window, understanding it didn't make much of an impact to the current quarter. Have you seen any sort of decrease or increase in movement through the month of October?

Derek D'Antilio

This is Derek, Alessandra. We have not really -- when we talked about it being a inconsequential decrease in our overall backlog, it was low single digits decrease in the backlog and that includes, of course, having additional bookings, offset by some of the cancellations and rescheduling. So we don't see that having an impact here in the fiscal year '23. And in fact, it's allowed us to really sit back and reschedule some of our own orders internally to make sure we're shipping to the right places and into production and where we have customers asking for things more in the near-term.

Alessandra Vecchi

Perfect. That's really helpful. And then 1 quick last one, if I may, Derek. You guys have done a really good job on the OpEx front, even in the coming quarter with the integration of Heyday and inflation. How do we think about the puts and takes on OpEx as we look to a much higher inflationary environment next year?

Derek D'Antilio

Yes, it's a great question, Alessandra. So we stated in the past, we expect to be able to continue to invest in research and development, first and foremost. And that's where our capital is going right now, into research and development and capacity CapEx. And really within that, we kind of targeted 15% of sales on research and development. We are a little below that right now at about 14%. So I would expect that number could move towards that 15% number if we continue to find the right people, continue to invest in the right technologies. On the SG&A side, I would expect that to go up at but just below inflationary rates, it also includes right now an elevated level of variable compensation, which will reset as we move into fiscal '24.

Alessandra Vecchi

Perfect. Thank you. With that I will go back into queue.

Operator

Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. And our next comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.

Quinn Bolton

Thanks all. I echo congratulations as well. I guess my first question is, some of your automotive competitors, Melexis and Infineon have both talked about starting to see some movement in backlog for the automotive products that they may not be on allocation. And I guess I'm just kind of wondering, as you look across your automotive portfolio, is there any part of the portfolio where you've seen changes in demand or an increase in cancellations or push that activity?

Vineet Nargolwala

Quinn, this is Vineet. Thank you for the question. So demand continues to stay strong across all of our automotive product segments. And in fact, as we look at our quarter-over-quarter backlog change, our backlog has actually gone up for automotive. So at this point -- and I think we've stated this in the past earnings call as well, it continues to be the same now. We are still shipping into our backlog. And so any sort of changes in the -- near-term changes in the market won't really get reflected in our backlog for some time to come as we continue to be supply constrained. So hopefully that answers your question.

Quinn Bolton

It does. Thank you. For Derek, just a couple of questions. One on the foreign exchange benefit that you're seeing here in Q2, fiscal Q3, any sense if current FX stabilizes at current levels? Does that tailwind just then continue? Or how do you think longer term about those 100 to 120 basis point benefit that you're seeing near-term in FX? And second question, just the 12% tax rate for the remainder of fiscal '23, is that a good working assumption now for fiscal '24? Thank you.

Derek D'Antilio

Yes, Quinn, good questions. Thank you. So on the foreign exchange, we sell the majority of our products in U.S. dollars, and we're buying our largest materials like wafers in U.S. dollars. So there's not a lot of exposure on the top line. Really where the exposure comes from is our facility in the Philippines, the peso, which is in the Philippines peso, which is in the gross margin. All those local expenses are in peso. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens, we get that benefit, which you see in our gross margin. So we expect that to continue into Q3.

If that went away, all else being equal, that 120 basis points goes away. And that's why I said, excluding that, we're at the high-end of our guidance range and kind of where our target operating model was of 55%. We certainly don't expect to stop there. We do have some relatively minor operating expenses in pockets of Europe and Asia that are also in local currencies right now that we are benefiting a little bit from the U.S. dollar.

In terms of the tax rate, yes, the 12% is what we expect currently. And that 12% tax rate, we started the year with about a 16% tax rate. And then when the legislative changes with respect to capitalizing R&D, we end up with a benefit of that, bringing us down to about 14% and then some state tax changes here that are permanent, bring us down to 12%. So all else being equal right now with no legislative changes, would be at 12%.

Quinn Bolton

Great. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Group. Your line is open.

Vijay Rakesh

Yes. Hi, Vineet and Derek. Good quarter and guide here. Just a couple of quick questions. On the -- when you look at the -- you mentioned top line was being helped to the TSMC ramp. Just wondering what your mix of TSMC would be exiting calendar '22 here and then calendar '23.

Derek D'Antilio

Yes, great question. So it was above 5% on the receipts exiting fiscal year '22. I will use it in fiscal sort of that's the way we think about it. And then exiting fiscal '23, as I've talked about, we expect to be at 15%. We are at that 15% right now on the receipt side of things, we are about a quarter ahead of the receipts, and we expect those to turn into revenue about a quarter or maybe about a quarter and half. So we will be at that level by our Q4, maybe even in Q3.

Vijay Rakesh

Got it. And if you were to roll that forward, would it again, like double year-on-year kind of or …?

Derek D'Antilio

No. We’ve got a commitment from TSMC that we are comfortable with that, that 15% that they are comfortable with and we are comfortable with. And we are right now evaluating our entire wafer supply for fiscal year '24 and beyond with our supply chain teams to look at a combination of capacity for the right technologies, of course, cost and all those factors.

Vijay Rakesh

Got it. And then on the xEV side, just wondering if you could give us some color on your design win pipeline, how is it growing sequentially or year-on-year? I know you mentioned some big design wins. And also, I think you guys talked about Toyota with their move to EVs. But just if you could give some color on how the design pipeline looks, that would be great. Thanks.

Vineet Nargolwala

Yes, Vijay, thank you for the question. We are really pleased with the progress we are making on our overall e-mobility design pipeline. It's a little hard for us to figure out where some of the advanced ADAS functionality is going. But certainly, anecdotally, we hear, it's largely going into EV platforms. So hence, we are talking about xEV and ADAS together. And our e-mobility design wins increased 68% quarter-over-quarter. So we are ahead of our target.

We continue to be engaged with all the major OEMs as they are thinking about the next generation electric platforms. We are also working very closely with the tiers. So we feel really good about our position and the competitive aspect of our offering, both around accuracy, robustness, and obviously, the economic benefit we provide to our customers.

Vijay Rakesh

Got it. Thanks.

Operator

I’m showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Leanne Sievers for closing remarks.

333,Poland chooses US to build its first nuclear power plant,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/Poland-US-Nuclear-Power.jpg,30/10/2022,"In an effort to burn less coal and gain greater energy independence, Poland has chosen to build a nuclear plant in the US, the first of its kind in the country",https://www.foxnews.com/world/poland-chooses-us-build-first-nuclear-power-plant,"Poland has chosen the U.S. government and Westinghouse to build the central European country's first nuclear power plant, part of an effort to burn less coal and gain greater energy independence.

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said late Friday on Twitter that Poland would use the ""reliable, safe technology"" of the Westinghouse Electric Company for the plant in Pomerania province near the Baltic Sea coast. The exact location remains to be identified.

A strong Poland-U.S. alliance ""guarantees the success of our joint initiatives,"" Morawiecki said.

Poland is planning to spend $40 billion to build two nuclear power plants with three reactors each, the last one to be launched in 2043. The deal with the U.S. and Westinghouse is for the first three reactors of the Pomerania plant, which officials saying should start producing electricity in 2033.

UKRAINIAN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT STOPS OPERATIONS AS SAFETY MEASURE

Poland has planned for decades to build a nuclear power plant to replace its aging coal-fired plants in a country with some of the worst air pollution in Europe. Construction of a Soviet-technology nuclear plant began in the early 1980s, when Poland was in the East Bloc.

Protests by residents and environmentalists, the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine and budget shortages led to the scrapping of the project.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year and its use of energy to put economic and political pressure on European nations have added urgency to Poland's search for alternative energy sources.

IDAHO NUCLEAR LAB RECEIVES 9-FIGURE FEDERAL PAYOUT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES

Polish government spokesman Piotr Mueller said Saturday that the government would adopt a decision at its meeting Wednesday, which will launch environmental approval and investment procedures.

Mueller said the nuclear plant in northern Poland would require improving infrastructure in the area, including roads.

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the project would create or sustain more than 100,000 jobs for American workers.

""This is a HUGE step in strengthening our relationship with Poland to create energy security for future generations to come,"" Granholm said.

""This announcement also sends a clear message to Russia: We will not let them weaponize energy any longer,"" Granholm said. ""The West will stand together against this unprovoked aggression, while also diversifying energy supply chains and bolstering climate cooperation.""

Poland had also considered offers from France and South Korea. Poland State Assets Minister Jacek Sasin suggested there could still be a role for South Korea in the project and more talks are scheduled in Seoul next week.

The crystal-clear waters from the Alps could become increasingly contested as the effects of climate change and glacier melt become more apparent. Italy wants them for crop irrigation in the spring and summer. Swiss authorities want to hold up flows to help hydroelectric plants rev up, when needed.

For the first time in four years, government envoys from eight Alpine countries — big, small and tiny — were meeting under a grouping known as the Alpine Convention, which was set up 30 years ago to help coordinate life, leisure and the limited resources from Europe's most celebrated peaks.

The envoys in Brig, Switzerland, representing pint-sized principality Monaco and small Slovenia as well as powerhouses like France, Germany and Italy, focused attention Thursday on what's known as the Simplon Alliance. Named after an Alpine pass between Italy and Switzerland, it aims to make transportation in the mountains eco-friendly, such as by favoring rail over roads, electric vehicles and public transportation over private cars.

But with global warming causing a worrying shrinkage in Alpine glaciers this year, the issue of water frozen up in the mountains, or showered and snowed on them, is growing in importance. Environmental advocates say jockeying for water isn't being addressed with enough urgency; they want the Alpine countries to do more to secure the future of the resource that's been bountiful for centuries.

While many parts of the world have grappled with water woes, well-irrigated and relatively rich Europe has been largely spared so far. Droughts and wildfires raise seasonal worries, but there typically is enough water for agriculture, hydropower, ski resorts, and human consumption. Swiss children were once taught their country was home to the continent's ""water tower,"" according to Maria Lezzi, head of Switzerland's territorial development office.

However, factors like global warming, the fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine on energy supplies and economic demands have made the issue more pressing.

Last month, Swiss authorities authorized a seven-month increase in the amount of water available for electricity generation from 45 of Switzerland's 1,500 hydraulic plants — hoping to churn out up to 150 gigawatts more power. Alluding to the possible knock-on effect, the Swiss said the move could temporarily affect fish migration, ""which could make replenishing fish populations more difficult in 2023.""

Meanwhile, sparse summer rainfall and a punishing heat wave in northern Italy — which melted snowfields and glaciers in the area — dried up the Po River, jeopardized drinking water and threatened irrigation in what's known as the Italian food valley.

The ""9th report on the State of the Alps"" — drafted by the Swiss hosts — notes that water supply is a ""particularly pressing issue"" because the Alps are a huge reservoir of water, which ultimately flows to the benefit of 170 million people along some of Europe's most famous rivers, including the Danube, Po, Rhine and Rhone.

A draft of the report, obtained by The Associated Press, noted the need for ""consistent availability of Alpine water"" for industry, agriculture, hydropower and other uses, adding: ""Climate change puts these functions under pressure, as glaciers are receding, and precipitation regimes are constantly changing.""

""Reduced quantities of water and limited reliability of water supply will be a major issue in the coming decades,"" it added.

Kaspar Schuler, director of CIPRA International, a commission devoted to protecting the Alps based in tiny Liechtenstein, said governments have done well to put water on the agenda but stopped short of steps to tackle the issue — by setting up working groups, expanding research, or coming up with ways that water can be better shared in the future.

""The description of the difficulties is well done by the Swiss, but they have still no courage to really address the elephant in the room,"" said Schuler.

While Alpine resorts and villages rely on water, the major upstream users are Switzerland's hydropower plants, which want to hold on to the water until it's most needed to power turbines that provide some 60% of the country's electricity.

But the biggest consumers of the water are downstream — industrial areas like Grenoble and Annecy in France, Austria's capital Vienna, and areas around Bolzano in Italy's South Tyrol are likely to feel an impact.

The southern Alpine towns, especially in France and Italy with their drier climates, are more likely to undergo water shortages than the northern towns, the report said. ""This is particularly true of inner-Alpine dry valleys such as the Aosta Valley in northwestern Italy, already affected by significant water stress.""

CIPRA's Schuler suggested that many have become too complacent about the Alps' bountiful waters — and those days may be over soon.

""Until now, all the non-Alpine countries — the lowlands — were happy that the Alps have been providing so much: landscape for leisure and sports, ski resorts, and the water as much as everybody needs,"" he said. ""So far, everybody was happy, and the Alps delivered.""

""In future it will be a battle ... about these resources because especially the lack of water can really harm a lot of people,"" he said.

Environment Minister Uros Brezan of Slovenia, which is set to take over the Alpine Convention's presidency, said regional authorities were not taking the issue lightly.

""I think the member states of the European Union and also members of the Alpine Convention are well aware that [the] water scarcity problem cannot be solved only within the national borders, but has to be addressed internationally,"" he said.",electric vehicles,voa news

China's largest online retailer has a massive catalog of bizarre items, including out-of-this-world electric vehicles.

We have already covered the strangest electric vehicles, such as the life-sized Hot Wheels car and the backward car, which may sound like absurd merchandise but can be a great buy if you consider the specifications.

Weird electric vehicles from Alibaba are frequently miniature versions of various types of vehicles. We have already reviewed a mini-tank but also looked into the specifications of an electric ice cream truck.

This time, we will take a look at what appears to be an improved version of an electric mobility scooter for the elderly as our ""Weird Item Spotted on Alibaba of The Day."" Do not be fooled by the appearance; this is not a golf buggy. This amazing electric vehicle is every elderly person's dream ride. To back up that statement, we will thoroughly examine the specifications.

Elderly Scooter Plus?

Growing older need not mean fewer enjoyable car or scooter rides. We keep observing elderly individuals using mobility scooters to navigate the streets of the suburbs; they always travel at speeds comparable to joggers, and maybe with this boring pace, they are considering ways to make their daily short trips feel more enjoyable.

This elderly mobility cart, available on Alibaba, can carry up to four passengers and has a power range of 351 to 500w. This vehicle has a top speed of 30 kilometers per hour. Isn't that cool? Granny and her friends can now share a ride to the nearest park for some oldies' Sunday park escapades.

It is a terrific mobility vehicle, available for much less than the psychological threshold of $1000. According to the official Alibaba listing, this vehicle is available for as low as $899.00. This EV also comes with an Alibaba.com built-in online customization to help you ensure that the vehicle is specifically built for your needs, making it an even better deal.

There is also a front storage basket, mirrors, a windshield wiper, optional rain curtains, a full light package, and plush padded seats. The vehicle appears to be built with a particular emphasis on comfort and safety, which is critical for mobility vehicles.

More About Specs

With 60V of lithium in this oversized mobility scooter and 1,000 watts of power beneath you, Electrek says there could be some serious fun with the weird item spotted on Alibaba. Based on the official listing, the vehicle is also capable of climbing a path with a 30° incline. This may be a stretch, but let's hope no one ever tries to drive a mobility vehicle uphill.

Shop at Alibaba

Alibaba is one of the largest retailers and online marketplaces in the world. Customer-to-customer and business-to-customer sales are also available in the B2B marketplace. This online retail infrastructure is used by many small businesses to sell their products.

Nationalistic policies to protect manufacturers of solar panels and other renewable technologies threaten to undermine global efforts to battle climate change, a new study says.

Prices for solar modules could be as much as 25pc higher than they would otherwise be by 2030 due to tariffs and other protectionist policies, according to the research paper published in Nature on Wednesday.

The global solar supply chain saved the world at least $67bn (€67.3bn) in production costs between 2006 and 2020, the study estimates.

Protectionist measures would limit the free flow of goods, talent and capital, slowing the global energy transition and encouraging more fossil fuel consumption, said John Helveston, author of the study and assistant professor of engineering management and systems engineering at George Washington University.

“It’s more about how quickly can you get the cost down to as low as possible to make these technologies attractive,” Helveston said in an interview.

“And if they’re not getting down fast enough, we’re going to keep using fossil fuels.”

He said that while the study focused on solar, the impact also applies to other renewable energy sectors including wind and electric vehicles.

The solar industry has been embroiled in trade conflicts for more than a decade that have helped shape the global supply chain for clean energy’s killer app.

In 2012, US President Barack Obama slapped duties of as much as 249pc on Chinese solar panels in an effort to prop up American factories.

China retaliated the following year by adopting its own import taxes on US polysilicon – the key material for making the panels.

Aided by a government that subsidised a spending surge on solar, China emerged victorious, accounting for the manufacture of 79pc of the world’s panels, according to BloombergNEF data.

When Donald Trump launched a trade war with China in January 2018, solar power equipment was among the first products targeted.

And when Joe Biden took office in 2021, he once again put China’s solar industry in US crosshairs, accusing a major silicon manufacturer of using forced labour in the Xinjiang region.

As the solar industry seeks to avoid ethical problems by providing documents proving their products are free from forced labour, the study suggests further work needs to be done to improve traceability.

Helveston said low-carbon technologies could be an area for the US and China to collaborate, given that they are not as politically sensitive as the semiconductor industry, which has been the target of sweeping US restrictions because of security risks.

The study also warned against relying on a single or a few countries only for supply chains.

“We need to have local manufacturers for resilience purposes,” Helveston said.

“But we don’t need to be doing that at the expense of also trading with China. We should be doing both.”",electric vehicles,independent.ie

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Clariant Third Quarter 9 Months Figures 2022 Conference Call and Live Webcast. I am Sandra, the Chorus Call operator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Andreas Schwarzwaelder, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Andreas Schwarzwaelder

Thank you, Sandra, and ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. This is Andreas speaking, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to Clariant's third quarter 9 months 2022 results conference call and live webcast. Please note that all information provided today reference the reported Q3 9 months 2022 results and the restated Q3 9 months 2021.

Joining me today, as usual, is Conrad Keijzer, Clariant's CEO; and Bill Collins, Clariant's CFO. Conrad will start today's call by providing a summary of the third quarter development followed by Bill, who will guide you through the group's financials and provide some brief business area comments. Conrad will then conclude with a few comments on Clariant's full year 2022 outlook.

There will be, as usual, a Q&A session following our presentation. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. I would like to remind all participants that the presentation includes forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Listeners and readers are therefore encouraged to refer to the disclaimer on Slide 2 of today's presentation.

As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be made available on the Clariant website shortly after the call. As a final housekeeping comment, please note that all figures discussed today refer to continuing operations unless specifically noted otherwise.

Let me now hand over to Conrad to begin our presentation.

Conrad Keijzer

Thank you, Andreas. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 results conference call. As you can see on Slide #4, Clariant delivered particularly strong sales growth in the third quarter of 2022, with an increase of 27%, in local currency versus the third quarter of 2021.

This increase included two main elements. Firstly, we increased our selling prices by 18% and year-on-year versus the third quarter of 2021. I would like to recognize that we also achieved a further sequential pricing increase of 3% in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2022. The progress we made in the last six quarters reflects our now established capability to effectively offset higher raw material, logistics and energy costs.

Secondly, we grew sales volumes by 9% organically by delivering unique value to our customers, we have been able to consistently outgrow our markets. Clariant increased sales in all businesses and in all geographic regions in the third quarter. We increased our Care Chemicals sales by 24% in local currency in the third quarter via double-digit growth in consumer care and industrial applications.

Our Catalysis sales grew by 28% in local currency, primarily due to volume growth in petrochemicals and specialty catalysts. Natural Resources sales increased by 30% in local currency with growth attributable to all three business units, with particularly strong demand for our halogen-free flame retardants. All regions contributed to the positive sales development in the third quarter of 2022, as reflected on Slide #5.

In Europe, we saw strong local currency sales growth of 22% as we increased prices in the business area Care Chemicals and Natural Resources. Catalysis reported a notable volume decline in Europe, while Care Chemicals and Natural Resources' volumes decreased slightly.

In Asia Pacific, the 19% sales growth was driven by a volume increase in Catalysis with strong growth in China due to the new CATOFIN plant which is running at planned capacity levels. Pricing in Natural Resources, especially in additives and OMS, also boosted our sales in China.

Care Chemicals reported strong pricing in Asia Pacific, compensating for the volume decline caused by customer destocking. We saw strong 30% sales growth in North America, which was attributable to all business areas, especially volumes in Catalysis and both volume and pricing in Natural Resources and Care Chemicals.

The 38% higher sales in Latin America resulted from strong pricing in Care Chemicals and Natural Resources, and a volume pickup in Natural Resources and Catalysis. In Middle East and Africa, the significant sales growth was underpinned by pricing and volume growth in Natural Resources and Catalysis.

As you can see on Slide #6, in the third quarter, we reported -- the reported EBITDA increased by 29% to CHF220 million. The corresponding EBITDA margin rose by 130 basis points to 16.8%, increasing from the 15.5% reported in the third quarter of 2021.

We are pleased with the continued progress of our pricing actions. The 18% price increase implemented in the third quarter, again, fully offset the impact of 24% higher year-on-year raw material cost, 60% year-on-year energy cost and 6% higher year-on-year logistics costs. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities as reflected on Slide #7.

Clariant established a Green Financing Framework and successfully issued its first green bond. The proceeds of CHF175 million will be used for eligible assets, which will drive sustainable innovation to support Clariant's purpose led growth strategy. Clariant announced a CHF40 million investment for a second production line at the Daya Bay production plant in China for our patent-protected halogen-free Exolit OP flame retardants.

The initial Daya Bay flame retardant plant is on track to commence production in mid 2023. This second line is expected to come onstream during 2024. Production from this location will support rapidly growing demand from China and Asian based component manufacturers for innovative and sustainable fire protection in electric vehicles, consumer electronics, 5G communication, infrastructure and appliances.

We have agreed to divest our North American Land Oil business to Dorf Ketal, an India headquartered specialty chemicals manufacturer and services provider. This divestment is a further step to structurally improve Clariant's portfolio and sustainability profile, while focusing our operations on specialty chemicals and value-adding solutions.

Clariant's North American Land Oil business is a provider of chemical technologies and services to the North American oil and gas industry and generated sales of US$113 million in 2021. The sales price, subject to standard closing conditions, is set at US$14.5 million. This transaction will result in a noncash impairment of approximately CHF245 million, which will be recorded in the fourth quarter and does not affect EBITDA as presented for the third quarter of 2022. This transaction is expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2023.

Let me conclude by providing an update on our sustainability transformation commitment as seen on Slide #8. As a global specialty chemicals company with products and solutions we provide have a positive impact on many aspects of everyday life. We see the impact we have as an opportunity to generate the value for people with safe chemistry and the responsible use of resources to enable a sustainable future in every way we can and above all, to add value with sustainable innovation.

This is a prerequisite for being successful, for generating the greatest value for society by addressing its largest challenges. This means that we create safe solutions to address the following 5 key sustainability challenges of our time, which are reflected on this slide: climate change, circularity, sustainable bioeconomy, waste and pollution and social value creation.

On Slide #9, we see an example of Clariant's achievements to fight climate change. The collaboration between Technip Energies' innovative technology solutions and our Catalysis expertise has resulted in an Enhanced Annular Reforming Tube for Hydrogen production called EARTH. EARTH combines a recuperative reforming technology developed by Technip with Clariant's catalyst that enables simultaneously efficient heat recuperation at high conversion rates. This is a breakthrough in sustainable hydrogen production via steam methane reforming, which offers producers a cost efficient way to save energy or to increase capacity with a decreased CO2 footprint.

Clariant and Technip Energies recently got recognized with two industry awards. ICIS, the world's largest petrochemical market information provider, selected this technology as the Best Process Innovation in the ICIS Innovation Awards for 2022. EARTH also won the Best Refining Technology category of the Hydrocarbon Processing Awards 2022, a program that honors the downstream energy segment, leading innovation.

On this positive note, I would like to now hand over to Bill for further details on our financial performance.

Bill Collins

Thank you, Conrad. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, and welcome. Turning to Slide 10. We had a very strong third quarter with an increase in sales of 27% in local currency and an increase in EBITDA of 29% to reach an EBITDA margin of 16.8% versus 15.5% reported in the third quarter of 2021. This profitability improvement was the result of ongoing pricing measures, which enabled us to fully offset the higher raw material, energy and logistics costs. Operating leverage from increased sales also contributed positively to the margin increase.

Moving to the discussion of our third quarter development by business area, I will start with Care Chemicals on Slide 11. Although Care Chemicals sales increased by 24% in local currency, supported by double-digit organic sales growth in both consumer care and industrial applications, the quarter was also characterized by softening demand and selective customer destocking which resulted in a flat volume development for the quarter. However, all geographic regions boosted sales, mostly driven by Europe, North America, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa.

In Consumer Care, sales increased in a double-digit range in all three businesses: Personal Care, Home Care and Crop Solutions, in particular. The sales contribution from the Beraca acquisition contributed sales of approximately CHF2 million in the third quarter. Industrial Applications sales growth progressed at a low-teen rate, despite its seasonal nature, the Aviation business made positive contributions in specific regions.

The Care Chemicals absolute EBITDA grew by 20% and the margin increased by 60 basis points to 22.6% from 22% in the third quarter. This increase was underpinned by active price management, while raw material costs decreased on a sequential basis and positive one-off items contribute in a high single-digit range. There was no impact from inventory revaluation. However, logistics challenges persisted.

Continuing with Catalysis on Slide 12. Catalysis sales rose by a strong 28% in local currency versus the solid comparison base in the third quarter of 2021. The sales growth in petrochemicals and Specialty Catalysts significantly outpaced the weakness at Syngas, as anticipated, despite continued logistical challenges.

Our new CATOFIN production plant in China continued to run at high capacity levels and produce orders for delivery in both the third and fourth quarters of 2022 as well as for 2023. And has significantly improved our ability to serve the growing demand in the region going forward. Although the absolute Catalysis EBITDA increased by 15%, the EBITDA margin decreased to 11.5% from 12% despite the more favorable product mix.

The three main factors influencing this development in order of importance include: first, ongoing project expenses, higher chemical consumption and elevated raw material and energy costs related to the new sunliquid production plant in Romania. Second, a temporary margin squeeze due to continued pressure from high raw material, logistics and energy costs, which have been addressed by adjusting the relevant pricing models, though the long catalyst product lead times resulted in a cost-to-pricing mismatch and the corresponding time lag; and finally, the negative impact of the suspension of all business with Russia. Traditionally, our Russian business had very accretive margin levels.

I will now discuss the business area, Natural Resources on Slide 13. Natural Resources sales increased by 30% in local currency in the third quarter due to growth in all regions and in all three business units particularly strong growth in Additives. Oil and Mining Services sales expanded in double-digit percentage range in the third quarter. Oil Services sales reflected a notable year-on-year improvement due to strong market demand, while Mining Solutions sales increased significantly, supported by successful pricing measures.

Sales in Functional Minerals grew in a double-digit percentage range with positive developments in Purification and Cargo & Device Protection. The Foundry business also increased sales at a low-teen rate again exceeding the absolute levels achieved in the third quarter of 2019 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Additive sales rose most significantly among the three Natural Resources business units with robust growth in all key regions and in Automotive as well as electronic applications despite softening volumes in customer destocking. As a result, the share of Additive sales in Natural Resources has continuously increased while the EBITDA margin at Additives continues to be significantly above the average of the Natural Resources business area.

In the third quarter of 2022, the absolute EBITDA increased by 38% and the margin rose to 20% from 17.6%, reflecting a 240 basis point improvement. The strong top line advance in tandem with pricing measures, mitigated the negative impact from higher raw material costs and rising energy prices. Positive one-off items contributed in a mid-single-digit million range.

Let me conclude my review with our short-term outlook for the fourth quarter on Slide 14. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect Clariant's continuing operations to generate solid local currency sales growth in a year-on-year comparison, primarily driven by pricing in all business areas despite an expected sequential nominal -- normalization in Care Chemicals and Natural Resources and an increasingly tough comparable base.

From a sequential perspective, we expect to see a modest decline in the fourth quarter. Despite a slowdown in volumes, the underlying EBITDA margin is expected to come close to the previous year level by maintaining pricing levels and cost discipline to counter the continued high raw material, logistics and in particular, energy cost levels.

Clariant expects the Catalysis performance to further improve despite a continued burden from the sunliquid ramp-up. Additional restructuring charges will be booked in the fourth quarter due to the cost of implementing our new operating model. The reported EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 is, therefore, expected to be lower than the restated year-on-year margin levels in the previous year.

With this, I close my remarks and hand back to Conrad.

Conrad Keijzer

Thank you, Bill. As we previously communicated, in the fourth quarter, we expect to report continued sales growth based on higher prices, but weaker volumes, in part due to the higher comparison base and in part due to the anticipated economic slowdown. For the full year 2022, we expect to generate strong local currency sales growth in a year-on-year comparison to around CHF5.1 billion based on the strong results in the first 9 months of 2022 and higher pricing compensating for the lower demand in certain end markets.

We expect to improve our year-on-year underlying EBITDA margin despite a continued negative contribution from the ramp-up of our new bioethanol plant. Higher pricing will offset raw material inflation and further cost savings and continued cost discipline will help to sustain our profitability. The reported EBITDA margin level will be impacted by restructuring charges in the fourth quarter for the implementation of our new operating model.

As we previously explained, our new operating model will simplify our organizational structure and enable further progress towards our confirmed 2025 goals for growth and profitability. We continue to make progress with the transformation of the group into a true specialty chemical company. And therefore, we expect to continue to benefit from our innovation driven specialty portfolio and the contributions and synergies generated by our bolt-on acquisitions.

In our view, Clariant is well-positioned to outpace the market and to continue to deliver profitability. Our new team remains committed to taking the next steps to meet our 2025 targets, which we introduced last November. Meanwhile, we continue to prioritize to deliver our full year 2022 operational performance.

With that, I turn the call back over to you, Andreas.

Andreas Schwarzwaelder

Thank you, Conrad, and thank you, Bill. Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin the Q&A session, we would kindly ask that you please limit the number of questions to two, thus providing more participants the opportunity to ask questions. Thanks for your understanding. We will now open the line for questions. Sandra, please go ahead.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Christian Faitz from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Christian Faitz

Yes. Thank you very much. Two questions. No comments, please. First of all, can you give us an indication of where you see free cash flow evolving towards the end of this year so, i.e., for fiscal '22? And then second question, what are the operational difficulties you are referring to pertaining to sunliquid? Are these issues process related? And as such, would they also affect your license business? Thank you.

Conrad Keijzer

Yes, Christian. Good afternoon. Thanks for those two questions. Yes, let me comment on the ramp-up of our sunliquid business and then Bill can provide some color on our free cash flow projections for the full year. Yes, so first, let me remind us that we are talking about a first of its kind technology that we are scaling up here in Podari in Romania. Needless to say that doesn't go -- come without challenges.

What we are seeing right now is that we actually are making solid progress on addressing some of the mechanical challenges that we had earlier on as far as it was related to the pretreatment of the straw, the milling of the straw. But now actually, what we are seeing is that we are not achieving, yet, the yields that we’ve been able to achieve in our pilot plant, and we are also seeing some elevated costs for chemicals as well as for energy.

Meanwhile, Christian, we are continuously getting very positive feedback from the market, there is a pool [ph] for this technology. Also considering recent events, there is an even higher urgency right now for an energy transition in Europe. So, yes, as you can imagine, we continue to be very committed to make this all work. On that note, Bill, if you could provide some color on the cash flow projections?

Bill Collins

Yes. Certainly, Conrad. Thank you, Christian. I think our objective for the end of this year is to show a market improvement in free cash flow and free cash flow conversion relative to what we generated in 2021. And to be fair, we are already starting to see positive momentum in that direction with decreases in inventories in Q3 and further improvements expected in Q4.

Christian Faitz

Thank you very much.

Operator

The next question comes from Markus Mayer from Baader-Helvea. Please go ahead.

Markus Mayer

Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions from my side as well. Firstly, on the divestment of the North America Land Oil business. Could you shed more light on what was the logic of this divestment and also why the multiples have been low? And also what the earnings contribution of this business was in the past? And my second question would be then on the risk of inventory devaluation, if you see any in the fourth quarter or -- then also going into next year? Thank you.

Conrad Keijzer

Yes. Thank you, Markus. I will take the first question on the North America Oil Land business, and Bill can provide some color as far as inventory devaluation risk in the coming quarter. Yes. So to your question on this divestment of the North America Land business, well, first of all, the multiples for this divestment were not low. Let me basically make that clear. So that already tells you at 14.5 million cash payment that the earnings were extremely limited on this, and it was actually a unprofitable business. I mean the headline numbers that we disclosed were a top line last year of US$113 million.

Yes, we didn't disclose an EBITDA number, but clearly, this was highly dilutive to the overall business in OMS. Yes, not a strategic business. This actually was primarily a distribution and resale business with some services to it. It dates back to two acquisitions that the company made back in 2016. Two companies with the name of Kel-Tech and X-Chem. And in reality, we were -- yes, reselling chemicals from other companies and only for a small percentage, it actually concerns our own chemicals.

So actually, we are pleased that we were able to close this transaction and that we basically have found the right owner for a business, which was not strategic within our portfolio. It lifts our profitability profile, it lifts our sustainability profile. Bill, could you comment on the inventory devaluation?

Bill Collins

Absolutely. So with regard to the inventory devaluation, we do expect to see some of that, which is natural as you see raw material prices coming down. I mean just as we saw a positive revaluation as raw materials increase, but the overall shape of the curve on raw material suggests that it will not be a significant amount in terms of the inventory devaluation. We have seen some sequential decline in raw material prices quarter-on-quarter.

But as we discussed last time, it is in a situation that is with a gradual decline as opposed to a precipitous fall. We also will actively manage this through our own destocking, our own reduction in inventory levels as we see our customers basically do the same. So overall, yes, it's something that we are watching closely with regard to the hit on inventory devaluation relative to the decline in raw materials, but it's something we are expecting to be able to manage through.

Markus Mayer

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

The next question comes from Andreas Heine from Stifel. Please go ahead.

Andreas Heine

Yes. I would like to start with Natural Resources. You mentioned restructuring charges in your outlook. What are that for? I know that is impairment you mentioned, but I think that's not what you mean with restructuring charges. And then still coming back on sunliquid, what I'd like to understand is these years you have -- you said that the enzymes do not perform as you expected. Or what is it exactly? What limits the yield?

Conrad Keijzer

Sure. Yes. So as far as the restructuring, your first question, Andreas, this is actually not limited to Natural Resources. What we are doing is actually a company-wide implementation of our new operating model. What we announced halfway in the year was a delayering where we basically took out the layer of the executive committee in the company, where we reduced the number of business units from 5 to 3 and where these business units are now directly reporting to myself.

What we noted at the time when we were looking in more detail at the overall [indiscernible] setup was that we had some instances where we had, literally as an example, 11 layers of management between myself and an operator in one of our plants. Too many layers between myself and a sales representative visiting customers.

So we basically are working on an org redesign that reduces the number of layers to a maximum of 6, between myself and our frontline people. And at the same token, we basically are critically looking at staff levels in our corporate functions and support. So this very much is associated to our G&A costs. As a reminder, Andreas, the company got significantly smaller in the recent years but had not adjusted its top structure yet.

In terms of your question on restructuring charge and sort of as an indication, unfortunately, we first obviously, like to talk to our employees, to our employee representatives and works council. So we cannot give you a granular breakdown. But in terms of a range, we do expect mid double-digit million cost for this actually with the majority of it in the fourth quarter. And also, this whole redesign will be largely done with by the end of this year. Then your second question …

Andreas Heine

Thanks for that. That is really helpful. But I was referring to the outlook slide on 14, where in Natural Resources you specifically in this segment, mentioned restructuring charges. I just wanted to know that there's any specific going on in Natural Resources itself.

Bill Collins

No, that's part of it, Andreas.

Andreas Heine

Okay good.

Bill Collins

So the number Conrad just gave is for the entire group, right? And the one element is related in the Natural Resources business.

Andreas Heine

So it's nothing different. Okay. Thanks.

Conrad Keijzer

Yes. No, it is part of that larger, yes, restructuring that we are doing and implementing in the fourth quarter. Your second question on the enzymes. So basically, yes, this is biotechnology. We have actually had this operation up and running in a pilot plant for almost 10 years. So basically, we know that the enzymes are capable to achieve certain yields. We've just not seen this yet in -- out there in Podari at the plant level.

Operator

The next question comes from Andrew Stott from UBS. Please go ahead.

Andrew Stott

Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for your time. Yes, a couple of questions, please. I'm slightly surprised by your guidance for revenue. So if I take the 9-month number and take off the CHF5.1 billion to get the implied Q4, it sort of suggests there's no growth in revenue in Q4, which I think, Bill, as you said in your slide narrative, 18% you're carrying into Q4 on pricing. So that implies a pretty dramatic volume decline. So first question is why only CHF5.1 billion? Is that a measure of how soft volumes are? And then the second question is more of a technical one around the Catalysis contracts. Conrad, you mentioned that there was a delay. There was a lag in terms of getting those contract pricing actually pushed through to the customer. Can you detail that? Because I'm still surprised at just plus one for the quarter, considering you talked about implementing these changes in the first half. Thanks.

Bill Collins

Sorry, accidently hit mute. If I can maybe start with the sales guidance, we signaled last time and we are still expecting into Q4 that we have softness of demand, we have destocking actually occurring, order delays in certain parts of the business, most notably in Care Chemicals and also in Additives. And that is counterbalanced to a certain extent with the renewed growth that we are seeing in Catalysis. In terms of that run rate through the end of the year, I mean I think if I look at the overall consensus, it's lining up pretty well with what we are seeing internally in terms of the expectation for Q4. So, overall, we still feel pretty good about that CHF5.1 million guidance.

Conrad Keijzer

Okay. Yes, Andrew, so regarding your other question on Catalysis and why are sort of the price increase is not coming through yet to the extent that maybe you had anticipated. Well, let me say there's a few elements to the margins in Catalysis. So they indeed have not picked up yet from last year with the EBITDA margin at 11.5% in the third quarter.

So if you break it down, what we did see is actually some follow through on the price increases that we implemented earlier in the year. Please be aware, there is a 6 to 9-month delay between typically the moment that we take the order and that it finally ships and in between that period, yes, for us, it's not -- it historically was not possible to adjust pricing. Now we have changed that practice, but we still have orders in the system. In fact, we have orders in the system as long as even 18 months in terms of lead times, when it's, for example, a new build business, we have even a longer horizon. But we are seeing it coming through to some extent.

One of the challenges on EBITDA margins that we saw in the third quarter is a bigger dilution from the ramp-up in Romania of our new Podari plant. So we are seeing some higher project costs than previously anticipated, and I think I alluded to that before. And finally, I think Bill mentioned it earlier in the call, there is the impact of the suspension of the business with Russia, which was actually a very profitable business.

Andrew Stott

Conrad, sorry, can I just steal a tiny third question? You don't guide for Q4 underlying margin, you only guide for reported. So I get the message there on the charges. Can you comment on how you see underlying margins year-on-year in Q4, please?

Conrad Keijzer

Yes. Sure, Andrew. Yes, so I think if you basically look at our reported margins, had we not done the restructuring, which we are right now working on. Then, in fact, you would have seen underlying for the full year, an improvement clearly from last year in terms of EBITDA margins. So the 16.2% that we did last year, we are going to end up higher than that. However, we’ve this restructuring charges, which clearly are a one-off. And because actually, this is a mid double-digit million number, we felt it was appropriate to already guide for that right now.

Andrew Stott

Perfect. Very clear. Thank you, Conrad. Thank you, Bill.

Operator

The next question comes from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research. Please go ahead.

Jaideep Pandya

Thanks. First question is really on Care Chemicals. Yourselves and quite a few of your peers have seen a market improvement in margins in the whole EO chain in the last sort of four quarters. Could you just highlight sort of what is driving this? And what is the sustainability of this 22% margin level, especially considering, historically, you used to have a decent de-icing business and the last 2 years, that has sort of dropped off a little bit. So should we think that [technical difficulty] next year, this 22% margin level sort of can be maintained? Or on the other hand, do you expect some normalization in the Care Chemicals margin levels? That's my first question.

And then the second question really is around Catalysis actually. So given the lead time and the order backlog that you have with regards to CATOFIN or polypropylene, could you actually tell us when do you expect to go back to the original sort of corridor of 22% to 26% margin range in this business? I mean, maybe excluding the Romanian sunliquid business, given the fact that maybe that is a drag. So I just want to understand on an underlying basis, when do we go back to the old catalyst days? Thanks a lot.

Andreas Schwarzwaelder

Sorry, Jaideep, we lost the connection for a while. Unfortunately, I have to ask you to repeat your question. I apologize for that.

Jaideep Pandya

No problem. So my first question is on the Care Chemicals side where I'm just asking basically the margin level of 22%, the stage that we see, which has been elevated for not just Clariant, but for other companies as well. What is the sustainability of this considering you might get de-icing business next year, which is higher margin? But on the other hand, is there a risk for normalization in the EO chain? And the second question is really around Catalysis, where I'm basically wondering when do we go back to the old 22%, 25% margin range, considering you have good visibility on CATOFIN and polypropylene and also on the price initiatives that you just mentioned about. So is it going to take 12 months? Or is it going to take longer than 12 months to go back to the 22% to 25% margin range? Thanks a lot.

Conrad Keijzer

Yes. Sure, Jaideep. Thanks for your two questions. First, on Care Chemicals, yes, we are very pleased with our performance in Care Chemicals, the 22% EBITDA margin, which -- yes, which basically is a reflection of our ability to fully pass on raw material cost, freight cost as well as higher energy costs. But I think what is underlying there is also the repositioning of this business. So what you see is that actually two-thirds of the business now is consumer-facing and what you see is that the share of business within Care Chemicals of the consumer applications is actually significantly up in relation to the industrial segments.

Don't forget that we made two accretive acquisitions here, Indian glycols, which are the bio-based surfactants -- surfactants based on bioethanol. The acquisition we made in India. Also, the acquisition we made in Brazil, Beraca, accretive, natural products out of the Amazon. Creams, oils that basically are accretive. So even though, yes, Aviation was lower, but it's actually back to the run rates now -- almost recovered run rates, but even if we were to have a strong Aviation season, you still would see a lift versus the historic levels that we did achieve in the past for Care Chemicals.

Your second question on Catalysis. Yes, we had historically, but you need to go a while back, but we did have indeed margins there north of 22%, 23%. Be aware that it's not entirely like-for-like. There was the scientific design business in there. And now we actually have our biofuels business in there. So we do need to obviously see the ramp-up in biofuels, resulting not just in profitable sales, but also in profitable business with our licensees. And we have that right, plus the share of Petrochemicals business in catalysts that we're targeting then actually, you should see those numbers coming back above 22%, 23%. But there is a few elements here that we are working on, as you can imagine.

Jaideep Pandya

Okay. So it's normal for us to then think this is more a 24% story, not a 23% story because we -- at least for me, I've been thinking it is really because of the price versus energy cost and raw material lag, which is why your margins have taken a hit. But you're pointing out to a couple of structural reasons. So it's more 24% than 23%, we should expect this?

Conrad Keijzer

Yes, it's more 24% than 23%. That's correct.

Jaideep Pandya

Thank you so much, Conrad for the clarity. Thank you.

Operator

The next question comes from Alex Stewart from Barclays. Please go ahead.

Alex Stewart

Hello, good afternoon. Your volume growth in Catalysis was pretty extraordinary. I think the strongest volume performance you've ever done and the comparable period wasn't particularly weak. Clearly, you had the ramp-up of the CATOFIN PDH plants in China, but can you just explain whether there was some unusual order patterns in the third quarter or perhaps how much the new plant contributed to that volume growth, so we can begin to dissect it a bit because it's really unusual in size. Thank you. I think you might be on mute again.

Conrad Keijzer

Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. We were very pleased with the volume pickup in the third quarter, 27% versus the same quarter last year. There's a number of elements here. There is, indeed, as you mentioned, the additional business that we see coming in from China for our CATOFIN business, that is definitely an effect. But there also was the effect of the delayed order book that we basically had from Q2.

So we did see in the second quarter some orders that were actually pushed into the third quarter by some of our customers, which made it indeed an unusually strong quarter. But what is actually going to stay is this element of the business in China. Now, yes, as you can imagine, we cannot break down the single plant business in China for our CATOFIN business that would, for sort of competitive reasons, not be the right thing to do. But it is -- yes, it is quite a significant part of that 27% pickup, which is going to stay also into quarters to come.

Alex Stewart

So if I could [indiscernible] a guess on the fourth quarter volume performance, I mean, it sounded like it could be less than 27%, but probably more like -- more than 10% on accounts of the continued ramp-up of the China plant, is that fair?

Conrad Keijzer

Yes, I'd say the 27% was an unusually high number. Let me put it that way, but we do expect also a good solid fourth quarter on Catalysis.

Alex Stewart

Okay, great. And then finally, the new operating model, which you talked about with the restructuring charges, it sounds like that's going to involve headcount reductions from the sound of your comments they're going to be towards the upper end of the average salary range for the company. So what are the savings that are associated with those efforts? Clearly, there's an internal organization element to it, but is there a Swiss franc amount you can help us understand that might benefit the bottom line next year?

Conrad Keijzer

Yes, sure. Well, Alex, so the reason we actually redesigned the organization, the reason we actually defined our new operating model was very much to set up the company for growth. So we basically wanted to be closer to our customers, less layers of management, more empowerment for the front line, full P&L responsibility for business units. And finally, we wanted to organize the business unit around market segments really to set them up for growth rather than a regional set up.

Now with that, there is indeed the loss of positions. And with that, indeed, there are also savings. Yes, I gave some indication on what to expect in terms of restructuring charge. You correctly mentioned these are the higher salaried positions in the company. Typically, what we would see is a payback of somewhere in between 1 and 1.5 years for this restructuring. So it should indeed definitely set us up for the future, not only from a growth perspective but also from a profitability point of view.

Alex Stewart

So if you do 50 million of restructuring charges, that implies you're getting annualized cost savings of say CHF30 million to CHF50, is that fair? This is quite a substantial amount.

Conrad Keijzer

So I -- we didn't want to guide in a granular way on it. This is still -- we are still working on this as we speak. We are in all kinds of processes with employee consultation, works councils. So yes, and maybe one thing to add, do the mathematics that you just present. So when we say a mid double-digit million range, that is sort of the total parts, not all of it is going to be Q4. But yes, the vast majority will be.

Alex Stewart

Very helpful. Thank you.

Conrad Keijzer

Obviously, Alex, you will get the full details at our full year results. We will be very granular in what exactly we have been doing here as well as the savings.

Alex Stewart

Great. Thank you.

Operator

The next question comes from Chetan Udeshi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Chetan Udeshi

Yes, hi. Thanks. A few questions. Can you -- I know you've given some color on Q4 on a year-on-year basis, but I'm just curious on a quarter-on-quarter basis, so compared to third quarter and on an underlying basis, so excluding the special items. Typically, Q4 is higher than Q3 just from a seasonality perspective, which is a typical sort of seasonal pattern. Can you help us understand what you see from a quarter-on-quarter perspective on the underlying EBITDA in Q4 versus Q3? That would be the first question.

The second question is just going back to the sunliquid discussion. I guess the most cynic argument will be -- your cynical argument is we saw the same pattern with other second generation projects where there was promising development at the pilot stage. But then as you try to scale it up on commercial level, there have always been some of the other issues like how different is the situation today with sunliquid with what we've seen with the other projects on second generation biofuel in the past? And third question is more on restructuring. Is this restructuring going to impact cash flow next year? Because we've been waiting for cash flow improvement. And so I'm just curious whether this restructuring sort of derails the cash flow improvement pattern at Clariant again. Thank you.

Bill Collins

Let me start with those, if I may? So turning to Q4 and our expectations there. We've already mentioned that we do expect some softening of demand in Q4, specifically in Care Chemicals and in Natural Resources. So that will have some impact. But another point to raise too that was actually in the release itself, that we had in Q3 a bit of a margin uplift associated with our ability to keep our selling prices high in the midst of moderate declines in raw material prices. So that actually provided some degree of uplift. It was the best case scenario, I think.

As we go into Q4, we are actually expecting the raw material prices to stabilize. So we will see some catch up for formula based pricing. So we won't necessarily see that same uplift coming into Q4. So as we look at EBITDA margin levels in Q4, we are expecting to be lower than what we saw in Q3 on a sequential basis before any restructuring charges.

And then on your question with regard to restructuring, yes, there will be a cash impact of the restructuring. So we would largely book the expense mostly this year, we think, but it will have an impact on Q4 as individuals start to leave the organization. However, this is not a derailing event in terms of free cash flow. This is something I see as very positive for our organization in terms of addressing the cost base. And with the other momentum that we have in free cash flow conversion, yes, it will have an impact, but I still believe that we're going to continue to show market improvement in this measure. And that's where pretty much everything that comes through, we are looking at in terms of how it impacts our 2025 commitments. And everything that we're talking about here today actually further solidifies our ability to achieve those.

Conrad Keijzer

Okay. Chetan [ph], also, I think I have a question on bioethanol and what is different than what competitors of us have done in the past. I'm not in a position here to talk on what competitors have done wrong in the past, but -- or failed to achieve, but what I will say is what I think is quite unique for the Clariant approach on second generation bioethanol is that not only does Clariant have a state-of-the-art laboratory in Planegg with some real skilled people in the area of biotech, but we also actually have a pilot plant up and running already for a period of almost 10 years. So there is actually quite a long experience with this already before we went to the scale up phase, what is -- which is the phase that we are at right now.

Chetan Udeshi

Thank you.

Conrad Keijzer

You’re welcome.

The last question for today comes from Jean-Baptiste Rolland from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Jean-Baptiste Rolland

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to see if you can provide any details or quantify how much of your -- you've realized in the first 9 months of incremental EBITDA from efficiencies and market growth, please.

Conrad Keijzer

Yes, Bill, if you could take the question from …

Bill Collins

Yes. In terms of efficiency programs through September, we’ve probably delivered about CHF10 million in additional efficiency gains this year with regard to cost efficiencies. All of which part of the CHF110 million that we commented on in the Capital Markets Day last year as part of that overall program of activity.

Jean-Baptiste Rolland

And how much would you have -- you believe you have achieved on the CHF220 million in relation to market growth?

Bill Collins

We got CHF10 million savings in the first 9 months. And then the third quarter, it was CHF2 million of that CHF220 million. Sorry, sorry, Jean-Baptiste, is that what you're asking? How much did we realize?

Jean-Baptiste Rolland

Yes, I was …

Bill Collins

Okay. Yes, I got it. Yes, sorry. So of the CHF220 million EBITDA that we had in Q3 about CHF2 million of that was specific efficiency programs, sorry.

Jean-Baptiste Rolland

Okay. No, no, that’s clear. Thank you very much.

Joerg Hoffmann

Welcome to the Wacker Chemie AG Conference Call on our Third Quarter 2022 Results. Dr. Christian Hartel, our CEO; and Dr. Tobias Ohler, our CFO, will take you through our prepared slides in a minute. The presentation is available on our webpage under the caption Investor Relations. Please note that management’s comments during this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement in today’s press release and in the presentation as well as in our last Annual Report regarding risk factors. All documents mentioned are available on our website. Chris?

Christian Hartel

Hi. Welcome, everyone. Wacker continued to deliver strong results in a challenging business environment. We reported €2.13 billion in Q3 sales, which is up 29% year-over-year. Despite massive raw material and energy inflation and turnaround-related costs, EBITDA was higher than last year at €457 million. This strong performance is clear evidence of our competitiveness. It speaks to the resilience of our business model even under more challenging conditions. And this success highlights the strength of our specialties business and the effectiveness of our pricing management. As expected, our EBITDA margin was lower than last year and below the preceding quarters. We flagged earlier that the first half of this year, performance was exceptional, particularly in SILICONES, where we benefited from very strong global supplier demand and some trailing raw material effects. Net cash flow at nearly €300 million showed another strong cash conversion in the third quarter. In chemicals, our pricing management supported EBITDA solidly over the last year despite strong headwinds from raw materials and energy.

Now looking to the order entry, we’ve been registering a decline in incoming orders in some sectors, particularly in construction since the summer. I believe that this development will most likely continue in the fourth quarter and into the following year. Should this trend continue to manifest itself and Germany and Europe slip it to recession, we will not be completely isolated from these effects. Now despite near-term recessionary risks, we see our long-term prospects intact and strengthened. We remain committed to our modular growth strategy, which we detailed at our Capital Markets Day with ‘23 targets earlier this year.

Our BIOSOLUTIONS expansion project in Halle for mRNA capacity for the German Pandemic Preparedness Plan continues at a fast pace. We continue to pursue our SILICONES specialty expansion plans in the U.S. In POLYSILICON, semiconductor wafer customers are expanding their capacities and they will get higher volumes from us in the future. In POLYMERS, we expect higher fossil fuel prices to drive further demand for our smart construction materials. This is especially the case with POLYMERS used in external insulation systems to drive energy savings.

Reducing energy consumption and improving the efficiency of our own operations has always been a priority. In light of the current energy crisis, it has become imperative. We introduced a new budget this year with new sustainability-specific KPIs. So far, we have approved 17 projects amounting to €60 million, which will reduce the energy intensity of our operations and cut CO2 emissions by more than 100,000 tons per annum. This project continues steps towards reaching net-zero by 2045. Sustainability is a key strategic focus for Wacker, and we see it as a clear differentiating factor among our competitors.

Looking on the next slide on energy pricing in Europe, over the last two quarters, the shifting dynamics of the German natural gas market kept us pretty busy. Gas prices kept soaring with major pipelines out of service and amid a political imperative to fill gas storage before the winter. When we last spoke, a gas surcharge to soften the impact for importers and gas curtailments were options on the menu. Our last guidance reflected all these uncertainties with a provisional €200 million to €250 million charge against our full year expectations. However, these measures did not come to pass, and we actually no longer see gas curtailment as probable in 2022. The new LNG terminals are seeing good progress and storage levels are over 95% here in Germany.

Policy driven and price indiscriminate buying for storage drove up the cost of natural gas in Q3. Although hedged to a high degree, the open portion of our gas and power portfolio increased so much in price that it impacted profitability in our segments. Overall, the third quarter saw more than €300 million higher costs than last year for raw materials, energy, and logistics. Today, the natural gas market as a result the power market, continue to reflect the ongoing uncertainty over future supplies and risks stemming from the ongoing war in Ukraine. Yet, what we see is that the rush to fill the gas storage has now slowed and prices in Q4 are sequentially lower than in Q3.

Due to the lower-than-expected energy and raw material prices in Q4, we now see 2022 full-year raw materials, energy, and logistics costs rising over last year by €1.3 billion to €1.4 billion and you’ll remember in the last call where we mentioned the €1.5 billion flagged earlier. Looking to the next year, forward contracts are still at a record high with some declining during the last weeks. The German government is currently formulating plans for a potential power and gas price cap, but at the moment, it is difficult and it’s only to speculate on this until we have final details available.

Now Page 4, looking onto our guidance. Group guidance for 2022 continues to look for €8 billion to €8.5 billion in sales, and we also confirm our EBITDA outlook for the full year at the upper half of the range previously communicated. We expect our full year EBITDA to come between €2.1 billion and €2.3 billion. Despite weakening order intakes, our guidance reflects our ongoing good operational performance, improved pricing in POLYSILICON, and lower than initially expected energy costs in Q4.

Now before I hand over to Tobias, let me touch on the biannual K fair in Dusseldorf, the world’s largest plastics and rubber fair that came to an end yesterday. We have been there for many, many decades. And this time, we showcased silicone rubber compounds produced with non-fossil methanol, thus significantly conserving resources. And the further spotlight was on self-adhesive liquid silicone rubber grades for polycarbonate parts and also novel silicone resins for manufacturing motor parts that remained stable at high temperature in electrical applications, a lot of fascinating applications and true innovations for our customers. And here again, you can see the huge potential that lies in the field of silicones.

In the appendix, you will find slides detailing numerous applications presented at the fair, showing, for example, the opportunity that electric vehicles present to Wacker. Tobias?

Tobias Ohler

Thank you, Chris. Welcome. I will walk you through the Q3 performance and provide an updated outlook for the full year. Let’s begin with the P&L on Page 5. Q3 sales with the group came in at €2.13 billion, supported mainly by price. Gross profit came in at €488 million. The decrease in the gross profit margin from 29% to 23% year-over-year reflects the effect of the top line inflation, inflation in energy and raw materials, and some volume declines as well as the planned turnaround in POLYMERS. These effects find their way through the entire P&L. EBIT came in at €351 million only €8 million lower than last year. And Q3 EBITDA was €457 million, slightly ahead of last year, despite significant headwinds in raw materials and energy costs. Net income for the period was €259 million. Earnings per share amounted to €5.08.

Moving on to Page 6, the balance sheet. Our balance sheet came in with a higher equity ratio of over 50%. Shareholders’ equity is now nearly €5 billion, up from €3.1 billion at the end of last year. The improvement in equity was primarily due to higher earnings and a significantly lower pension deficit following a higher discount rate. Our pension liabilities are now at €690 million and roughly €1.1 billion lower than at the end of 2021. Although discount rates climbed sequentially, the pension liabilities shown in our balance sheet have slightly increased since the end of Q2. We have reached an asset ceiling in the funded part of our pension liabilities. [indiscernible] now exceeds the pension benefit obligation at current discount rates. However, the remaining unfunded pension liabilities on our balance sheet increased slightly due to the adjusted pension increase assumptions from inflation.

Working capital increased by some €560 million to €1.8 billion over the year due to high sales figures and raw materials. SILICONES delivered a strong performance. Q3 sales were €890 million, 31% higher than last year. Over the year, sales benefited from higher prices and an improved product mix, reflecting a higher share of specialties. Sales growth was strongest in health and care, industrial, and adhesives. Segment SILICONES also benefited from a stronger dollar. SILICONES EBITDA in Q3 was €198 million. Earnings were up 23% year-over-year. The result was supported by positive price effects.

As Chris mentioned, SILICONES benefited in the first half of the year from a very strong global supply and demand and some trailing raw material effects. In Q3, though, global supply and demand for silicones tilted towards oversupply. As a result, prices for standard products fell considerably. At the same time, inventory effects and rising costs for energy and raw materials weighed on profitability. With a 22% margin, our SILICONES business performed well despite the headwinds. We continue to pursue our growth options, focus on specialties, drive specialty content, and meet customer demand in new markets. Looking into Q4, we see stable pricing in specialties with slightly lower volumes and seasonality. For the full year, we see sales at €3.5 billion and EBITDA reaching €900 million, confirming the lower end of our previous guidance range.

POLYMERS achieved Q3 sales of €504 million, up 8% over last year, primarily due to higher prices and positive currency effects. Sales declined due to lower volumes in construction-related applications and the impact of our turnaround in Q3. Q3 EBITDA came in at €60 million, about 29% lower than last year. Lower volumes, significantly higher raw material and energy costs, and the planned turnaround contributed to the decline. Taking all this into account, we updated our POLYMERS outlook for 2022. Towards year-end, we expect to see seasonality and slower destocking. We now see about €2 billion in sales, about €100 million lower than our previous outlook. Our EBITDA margin outlook is unchanged. We expect it to be at last year’s level.

BIOSOLUTIONS reported nearly €90 million in sales with growth in bio-ingredients. Our business with cysteine performed exceptionally well. One of our BIOSOLUTIONS research teams won the Alexander Wacker Innovation Award in July. They found a way to boost the productivity of our fermentation process. This development will support our BIOSOLUTIONS growth part.

We are also progressing at our CDMO business in microbial and advanced pharma like mRNA and pDNA. The construction of our biotechnology center in Munich and our mRNA competence center in Halle are on schedule. The Halle site is part of the German Pandemic Preparedness Plan, and we will be Good for Order here already in 2024. Our growth initiatives require continued investments and higher upfront costs related to new business development and integration costs. These effects weighed on profitability in the third quarter with EBITDA coming in at €4 million. For the full year, our BIOSOLUTIONS forecasts are unchanged. We see a low double-digit percentage sales growth and EBITDA significantly below the prior year.

POLYSILICON continued to see high demand. Q3 sales came in at €619 million, 51% higher than last year. Improved pricing for solar materials was a key driver with some ongoing positive mix effect due to growing semi volumes. Inventories remained at very low levels. Q3 EBITDA at POLYSILICON came in at €191 million. Results declined versus the previous quarter following substantially higher energy and silicone metal costs. Solar pricing is firmer for longer than we initially expected. With continued strong demand for solar and semiconductor products, we updated our forecast for POLYSILICON. We now expect sales to be about €100 million more than before at about €2.2 billion for the full year. We now see EBITDA at the top end of our previous range, plus around €850 million.

Looking at the net financial position on Page 11, we recorded net financial asset of nearly €400 million at the end of September, up from €120 million at the end of June. Gross cash flow was sequentially much higher due to a release in working capital, reaching €912 million at the end of September. Cash flow from long-term investing activities reduced our cash balance by about €500 million, reflecting our strategy of investing in growth and mix improvements. The year-to-date position also includes the acquisition of the majority of Sico Performance Materials. And as a reminder, M&A always comes on top of our full year CapEx guidance.

On Page 12, our updated group guidance for 2022. Let me repeat what Chris said about our guidance. We see full year sales between €8.0 billion and €8.5 billion. Following a strong operational performance, we expect our full year EBITDA to be between €2.1 billion and €2.3 billion. We no longer include the €200 million to €250 million provisional charge against our full year expectation introduced last quarter. For the full year CapEx, we now expect to be at the lower end of our previously communicated range.

We understand your desire for 2023 guidance. From today’s perspective, the next year will have its own challenges. Uncertainty and inflation surrounding energy costs as well as emerging signs of recessions in some regions limits our visibility. Discussions with our customers show concern about volumes in the next year, but also confidence about resurgent growth beyond 2023. As you are aware, the German government is formulating new regulations to cap the price of gas and also potentially of electricity. Until we know the details, it’s not possible to forecast what benefits that might have.

Looking at our forecast and plans for 2023, I believe that given the many moving factors we should stick to our usual approach to guidance. We will wait for the first month to play out before we communicate our guidance as we publish our full year 2022 results in March next year.

With this, I give back to Chris.

Christian Hartel

Thank you, Tobias. And ladies and gentlemen, before we get into the Q&A, let me just say a few words following Tobias’s presentation. You will certainly remember the core messages from our Capital Market Day this year earlier in March, focusing on growth, pivoting more towards specialties while improving our resilience. And looking back into the last years, we have delivered on that promise. We have actively implemented measures to improve our resilience. And I would like to remind you on our Shape the Future restructuring program that we already started in 2019, and that covered about a thousand different initiatives delivering this year €200 million gross savings versus our 2019 cost base.

So we stand on a very strong financial footing with a very strong balance sheet. We now show a cash pile of close to €2 billion and has a negative net debt. Our balance sheet also benefited from a massive reduction in pension liabilities. Today over €1 billion less than at the end of last year, resulting not only from interest rate changes, but also from repeated contributions above and beyond IFRS requirements. Our portfolio now focuses on higher value-add specialty products, supplying services beyond materials in all our major businesses. We now have less exposure to volatile commodity markets than in previous economic downturns. We optimized our hedging program, and we prepared for fuel alternatives. Our ongoing initiatives, efficiency programs, and many other smaller day-to-day initiatives make us stronger. And as I keep telling our employees, we want to be the architect of our success with our entrepreneurial spirit. All of this positions us well as we face a period of higher uncertainty and potential economic turbulence. Joerg?

Joerg Hoffmann

Thank you. Operator, we’re now ready to begin with the Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Charlie Webb from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Charlie Webb

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much for taking the question. Maybe just first on SILICONES. As you think about, obviously, standards seeing some price weakness given maybe some oversupply in China and some weaker demand, how do you think about that relative to, obviously, still very favorable specialty pricing? Is it normal that those should converge over time? And are you seeing any kind of, I guess, certain customer groups pushing for some lower prices on the specialty side? That’s the first question. And then second, I know you said obviously not to guide for next year. But just trying to think about BIOSOLUTIONS, you obviously set out a €250 million number over the medium and longer-term. If we think about the ongoing restructuring charges, ramp-up costs, etcetera, that business has based pretty much ever since 2016-‘17. The earnings haven’t really gone anywhere. And we’ve obviously talked about scale and other factors that have played into that. But just any sense you can give us in terms of some of the moving parts as we look ahead as to why we – and how we’re going to see that €250 million start to emerge? I know it’s not linear. I know it can be a bit lumpy. But just trying to understand what’s going on in that business that’s held it back so much over the last 5 years that we find ourselves with EBITDA lower than it was in ‘17.

Christian Hartel

Okay, Charlie. This is Chris. I would start with the first question – your question on SILICONES and the decrease in pricing, which we see there, especially in China. And I think we had that question also in the last sessions. You referred to the relation between standard and specialty pricing. And well, there is definitely not a one-to-one relation between standard and specialty pricing. And the main reason for that is that these specialties are typically tailor-made products for our customers. They are typically less replaceable, and they typically also have a much higher value contribution to our customers. So from that perspective, there is no direct correlation of standard pricing. Of course, some customers use it as an argument in the negotiations on the pricing. And typically, that might have an impact. But again, the key message here, we don’t see a one-to-one relationship between standard pricing and specialty pricing, and that’s also the reason why we focus our strategy on the silicone specialties.

Second question on the BIOSOLUTIONS, well, BIOSOLUTIONS is at a much earlier stage in the development compared to our chemical business, POLYMERS or SILICONES, which means we have to invest more, both in capacities also in capabilities. And that means, at the moment, we are in a phase where we invest more, we have higher costs, and we mentioned that, for example, on the aspect of digitalization for our processes, we do some significant investments. We just acquired the business in the U.S. for the pDNA. We are working. We are investing on the Halle site for mRNA for the German Preparedness Plan. So all these projects, they pay in that growth strategy. And well, it just takes a little bit more time, but we are definitely absolutely on track, and there is nothing which is holding us back.

Charlie Webb

Just following up on the latter point. I mean, you’ve been investing in this business quite a lot; I would argue since 2016. And we haven’t really seen, at least in terms of earnings, we haven’t seen that real ramp-up. I understand, obviously, we have seen some sales growth. But how can we bridge to that €250 million number? At what point will we really start to see these investments come through? Are we talking in 5 years’ time? Is that – is it a 10-year investment cycle before you see it? Or again, it’s quite hard to see the road ahead for this one after what’s been another tough year.

Christian Hartel

No, I think, Charlie, we made a clear statement also on the CMD that the growth will come gradually. It will definitely not be backloaded, so to speak. And most of these businesses are in the pharma world. And the pharma world is not a business which you have from one day to another. You have to build up. You have to work on these projects. And I can tell you, we have a pretty filled pipeline of very interesting and promising projects, and they will come to fruition in the next quarters. It’s a gradual growth.

Tobias Ohler

Charlie, Tobias here. So to add to what Chris said. With our acquisitions, we typically have the experience that as we buy rather at moderate prices where we can add with our technology, with our customer access, we expect it normally to be after 2 years that we really see a trajectory of additional sales that we create. That’s number one. And to illustrate that a bit also, take our Pandemic Preparedness Project in Halle. This is a fast-track project, and we will see a Good for Order, as I said in my speech part, already in 2024. So as Chris said, it’s gradual. It won’t be backloaded. But yes, it takes some time.

Charlie Webb

Okay, thank you very much.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research. Please go ahead.

Jaideep Pandya

Thanks. The first question is really around the burning topic. Chris, you obviously are very important for the European renewable industry. And Europe is talking about a 30-gigawatt market right now, which at least on paper will be difficult to do without Wacker. So how are your discussions going with regards to getting an industrial power price? And how far are we or have we come to a point where you are willing to go back to the drawing board and say, we want to invest in polysilicon because we are getting good prepayments. There is customer interest, and the authorities and the governments are willing to give us support on the power price. Are we closer to that, or is this still a farfetched dream from your point of view? That’s my first question.

The second question is really around the energy bill that you guys have. Now I know you’re two-thirds hedged as of today. Could you give us some color if spot prices were to prevail, what delta are you looking at with regards to the energy bill for ‘23 versus ‘22? And then just a final question. I know you’re not going to like this one, but if I just take your guidance for Q4 and multiply it times 4 like a dumb analyst, I’m significantly above consensus for 2023 [indiscernible] those cautionary things that are not even in the Q4 of ‘22, which we should be thinking of for ‘23. Thanks a lot.

Christian Hartel

Okay. Jaideep, this is Chris. I would start with the first topic on what you call the burning topic. And well, rest assured, we do a lot on that matter. And we just recently joined forces with other players in the European solar space and addressed very openly and very frankly to the EU Commission that they should speed up the whole process. And I think they got a pretty good understanding on that, especially as the U.S. is moving so fast with their IRA program. And Europe faces the risk of falling behind. And in that argumentation, we are very clear that in order to make the REPower Europe a success, first, I agree with your statement, we would need Wacker for that. I don’t think there will be REPower Europe on solar side without Wacker. And the second point, which we make very clear is, whereas you need on the – let’s say, on the module and the wafer side, the addition of investment money might be attractive, on the earlier stages of the value chain, like the POLYSILICON, what we do, the OpEx, so the attractive or competitive power pricing is imperative. And I think these messages we convey very clearly to the politicians. And I think they are also taken up very clearly. How far are we away from getting that power pricing? Very difficult to judge. But I can tell you that we do everything which is in our power, joining forces with other people that it will get implemented soon.

Tobias Ohler

Jaideep, Tobias here on your question around energy, I’ll take it broader around 2023 house energy and raw materials demand, as a cost of developing, I think as we communicated, we are already hedged for about two-thirds, but ‘23 hedging rate is – or hedging ratio is lower than today. So we would expect a further increase in energy cost, obviously. But when I look at today’s futures, that increase would be slower in absolute terms than in 2022. And on the raw material side, normally, what you see in a recessionary environment, you would see a decline. But I would say we are all living in a very dynamic environment. So let’s discuss in March when we give our full year guidance. And I would also stick to that when you asked question three on the consensus, I think let’s look at that when we have the visibility.

Jaideep Pandya

Alright. Thanks a lot, guys. Thank you.

Operator

Next question is from the line of Samuel Perry from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Samuel Perry

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, on POLYSILICON, can you give us some color on what you’re seeing on the ground in terms of capacity additions? There is obviously a lot of announcements, but in terms of them being delayed or ability to secure energy. Any color you could give on that would be great. And then also on POLYMERS, in terms of the contracts, I believe that during this inflationary period, you reduced the contract terms across a lot of products. If we start to see raw materials come off, is there a chance that the margins, and I guess sales in that division could fall quicker than in previous cycles? Thanks.

Christian Hartel

Okay, Sam. So I would start with the first question on the POLYSILICON and the competitive landscape. Well, first of all, let me start by saying that we are seeing a very strong demand for solar panels globally. And you will know that we will be at the top end installation expectations for 2022 with about 250 gigawatts. So very exciting and a very strong growth momentum. And when we talk about the poly capacities, you also need to talk about the wafer capacities and installations. And for 2023, wafer capacities are actually expected to reach 700 gigawatts. So that means there is a lot of momentum.

And in the last call, we also said that the EIA, the International Energy Agency, is also talking about, we need at least 500 gigawatts per year. So from that perspective, we would need some more polysilicon investments. Commenting on these Chinese capacities that are announced, I can only repeat myself saying, a lot of announcements, typically these announcements are much too aggressive, both on timing and both on capacities. So they are building new capacities, and we will need more capacities. But if you ask for how actually these companies will succeed, you have to ask them. I cannot give you a clear answer on this. But what we will see is a further very strong demand for the solar industry, and that makes me positive.

Tobias Ohler

Sam, Tobias here. So your question on polymers, we’ve stated that our prices have moved up with the VAM cost moving up and that we had some formulas for that also in place. So we committed also to our customers when VAM prices and costs come down, that it would benefit. But obviously, we have other cost items also going up, when we discussed largely energy, we discussed logistics. So we try to really, yes, bring this also into the discussions to our customers as we want to keep our profitability also to be ready for investing in more capacities as this is a growth market. So I would not see any margin impact if VAM comes down because we have, yes, our pricing strategy in place. But I’m not guiding for next year, but obviously, there is a good approach to our customers really that we offer the value and we must also cover the additional cost, but we let them also benefit if some of the costs go away over time.

Samuel Perry

Great. Thank you very much, guys.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Mubasher Chaudhry from Citi. Please go ahead.

Mubasher Chaudhry

Hi, thank you for taking the questions. To start, the updated guidance of €1.3 billion to €1.4 billion in terms of energy and raw material headwind in 2022, how much of that has been achieved in the first 9 months, please? And then secondly, how much of the energy purchases for the fourth quarter are still open? You say you’re substantially hedged. I just wanted to see if you go to a number around how much is open. And finally, around the German gas cap. Any comments around whether you’re eligible for it? And if you would be, would you want to take that help given that there is a chatter around being – or inability to pay dividends if someone was to go for the state aid. Just some comments around that would be helpful. Thank you.

Tobias Ohler

Mubasher, Tobias here. Starting with the first two questions on our raw material, energy, logistics headwind. As we stated before, headwind in the first half of the year was more than €600 million and more than €300 million now for the third quarter and just take those numbers not literally, but if you add a similar number to Q4 – for Q4 to the full year numbers, you get into the range of €1.3 billion to €1.4 billion in total headwind for raw materials, for energy, and logistics. To your question on the hedging for Q4, we normally don’t give that detail on such a short time period. But we always said that we are largely hedged, but we are not fully hedged. That means that we have some open also demand that we are currently buying at lower prices in the spot market. But I can’t give you the detailed numbers for this.

Christian Hartel

Okay. And Mubasher, this is Chris. On the topics of gas cap or potential electricity cap, well, twofold answer. First of all, I think at the moment, it is too early really to judge or to calculate anything specifically also for us because it’s not yet clear. There are different ideas and concepts in place. I would like to give a general statement to these concepts. I think these concepts, both in Germany and in Europe, helped to soothe a little bit the markets. The nervousness in the markets got a little bit away from that. I think that is definitely positive. And I also think it is pretty helpful not only to support individuals, but also companies. But let me say, as I’m also Head of the Bavarian Chemical Association, and we have 60,000 people in Bavaria working for the chemicals, 450 companies, and many of these companies are really small or midcap companies with less than 100 people, which obviously don’t have an energy procurement group like we have. So they are much more exposed to these energy markets and have a huge burden and risk. And I think it’s a good idea to help these companies.

Talking about us and how does it affect us, well, as I said, it’s not yet clear what will actually come into place. But my statement from the beginning, we want to be the architect of our success. So we don’t want to rely on others, and that’s the reason why we work very diligently on all these countermeasures for saving energy, but also for introducing fuel switch measures, which are now ready to go, and we have a very inspiring and great team with a lot of entrepreneurial spirit that is working on that. And as we also said, we are two-third hedged for next year. So from that perspective, again, it is too early to judge what it would mean for us. You mentioned the topic of these government tariffs, if you want to call them, might be linked with some sort of influence on your dividend policy. Again, here, we want to be the architect of our own success, and I’m a little bit concerned if somebody else than the company itself and the shareholders talk about dividends. So I’m reluctant on that topic.

Mubasher Chaudhry

Very helpful. Thank you.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Chetan Udeshi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Chetan Udeshi

Yes. Hi. Thanks. I am a bit puzzled by your guidance on energy costs because, on one hand, you kept saying that the 2022 is largely hedged, and yet we have seen the number for energy and raw material cost guidance being cut by I think €150 million. So, can you explain like what is driving that? Is it the raw material prices which are coming off, or is it energy, which is driving that reduction in the energy costs? And what have you actually assumed in Q4? So, let’s say, if the energy prices were to go from €100 per megawatt hour to €150 or €200 again, what does that mean for numbers in Q4? That was the first question. The second question was more around the silicones. Can you talk about what you see now in terms of the order momentum? You talked about weaker book-to-bill in Q3. Is that still sort of continuing as we speak? Because if I back out what is implied in the guidance for Q4, it seems you are assuming more or less a seasonal decline from Q3, nothing worse than seasonal when, frankly, some of the other companies are talking about really worse than seasonal trends. Thank you.

Tobias Ohler

Chetan, Tobias, I will start with the first question on the energy and raw materials. As we said before, the un-hedged portion saw significant inflation in Q3 as the markets were really going crazy in some weeks. And we – with that view, also looking at those numbers daily, we were very cautious about the Q4. And now we see that markets are still at a high level, if you look into next year, into first quarter, but they have, yes, moderated for the spot portion that we could still buy with our hedging not being at 100%. And that is the effect that we have now also considered. In addition, you are right, raw materials have – in some areas we talked about VAM before have declined. And if you put that all together, I mean we have reduced our assumption for raw materials, energy, and logistics from the order of magnitude of €1.5 billion to something between €1.3 billion and €1.4 billion.

Christian Hartel

Yes. Chetan, on the silicones, since you asked for the order momentum, where we do saw some decline in the order pattern, especially in the Q3 or the beginning of Q4. But it looks like these destocking effects, which were prominent in Q3, are less pronounced now in the Q4. And well, I cannot talk obviously for other companies, but as we have said also in the beginning, we do have a high share of specialty business. And here, we see a firm order pattern going forward. And that makes us confident that our guidance for Q4 is pretty intact.

Chetan Udeshi

Understood. Thank you.

The next question is from the line of Geoff Haire from UBS. Please go ahead.

Geoff Haire

Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. I just had one. Clearly, you are sitting with net cash on the balance sheet. The pension deficit is obviously coming – well, has come down over the last year. Just wondering what your thoughts are around capital allocation and use of that capacity you have on the balance sheet to either return money to shareholders or what are the plans for it?

Christian Hartel

Yes. Geoff, on the – if I understand your question correctly, that is on the dividend policy. Well, I mean we do have a dividend policy in place. We always look, of course, at the overall economic situation. And typically, that’s what we do – we are doing in the first quarter of every year. So, it’s too early to actually talk about dividends. And yes, on the share buybacks, I think that’s something we have been also very clear on that. It’s not something which we can do.

Geoff Haire

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Rikin Patel from BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead.

Rikin Patel

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one on volumes, on the group level, I think you reported a 3% decline. I just wondered if you could maybe quantify the headwinds in polymers and commodity silicones. And then secondly, on CapEx, you are guiding to the lower end of the range now. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of why you have now lowered that amount and whether we should be shifting that €50 million or so into 2023? Thanks.

Tobias Ohler

Rikin, it’s Tobias. On the volumes, we don’t split that exactly by segment. But I can tell you that volumes in silicones and polymers were below prior year. I think we talked about that destocking journey over the third quarter. And in polysilicon, we are running at full capacity. And if there is any I mean deviation in sales volume between 2023 and – 2022 and ‘21, sorry, it’s only about inventory effect. But right now, we are, yes, close to empty in inventory in polysilicon. So, everything that is produced is sold. And for the CapEx guidance, yes, I mean look at the number that we had last year. I mean so we, yes, increased our CapEx program along the lines of our strategy of accelerating growth. But in some projects, there were smaller delays. It’s not that we are not willing to go forward. It’s just by the massiveness of the increase that we are not – year-to-date, we are not at a CapEx number that we believe that we can still reach the upper end of the CapEx guidance, so we lowered it to the €550 million number for ‘22.

Christian Hartel

And Rikin, if I may add this, also, we see the – especially in the beginning of the year, there were some shortages of equipment deliveries actually and also of qualified personnel that we faced with these increased budgets, so that’s also the reason why it’s lower. And yes, as we didn’t stop any projects, it is fair to say that these amounts will be seen in the next year.

Rikin Patel

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

Next question is from the line of Sebastian Bray from Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Sebastian Bray

Hello. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions, please. I have two. The first is on CapEx for 2023. It follows a little on from Rikin’s question. But if Wacker is spending €700 million to €800 million a year or maybe a little bit less than that, but around that, that’s quite a lot. And I would just like to understand which growth projects in particular this is going to. I read a press release two months or three months ago about the expansion of Halle, which I don’t know is yet approved, but I think is due online in 2025. I am referring to the silicone metal furnace. How big is this investment and what are the big investments for the next 2 years or 3 years? The question related to that is, is the Dow JV for siloxane at Zhangjiagang and China going to be expanded at some stage? Are you in discussions on that, or is it off the table? And third question finally on dividends. You referred to the dividend policy of 50% of EPS. I am wondering, are you going to adhere rigidly to this, or are you thinking about being more or less daring potentially, even implied by the 50%? Thank you.

Christian Hartel

Okay. Maybe Sebastian, it’s Chris. I will start with the first question, same answer as I gave before. There is a definite policy in place. And we look at the overall economic situation, and that’s something which we do together with the shareholders in the first quarter, and that’s the time to talk about it. Second question was on the Dow Siloxane expansion. Yes, we have the joint venture in China. The majority is with Dow, so probably the best information you would get from Dow, if they want to expand. We are always interested in business cases that make sense, and it’s a world-class client. So, from that perspective, we are always looking for good opportunities.

Tobias Ohler

And with respect to the CapEx question for 2023, the biggest project that we pursue right now is silicone specialties, the semiconductor capacity for polysilicon, and then the biopharma activity in Halle, the pandemic-preparedness plan that we talked about where we want to achieve a Good for Order in 2024. You asked a question about the Halle project. This is not approved yet. And for that reason, I can also not give you any number on the investment.

Christian Hartel

And in the – this is Chris. As we published this project, we are in a pretty early stage, and we have to look at it, and that’s the reason why it’s not yet approved because it’s not yet in the stages of being approved. But it’s definitely one of our high-priority projects going forward.

Sebastian Bray

That’s helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.

The next question is from the line of Markus Mayer from Baader Bank. Please go ahead.

Markus Mayer

Hi. Good afternoon gentlemen. Two questions from my side. Firstly, kind of modeling question, this plant turnaround you had in polymers, could you quantify the effect that you see? What the underlying earnings have been? And the second question is again on the polysilicon division. It looks like that’s becoming more positive on the sustainability of the current polysilicon price level. Besides the pretty strong demand, was there any other change which has driven this kind of changed view? That’s the two questions I have.

Tobias Ohler

Markus, Tobias here. On the polymers turnaround question, I can explain that the two effects that weighed on our P&L were both technical spending and the additional external spend for procuring the VAM that we would have produced on our own. And if you take that together and if you compare EBITDA of Q2 to Q3, it’s about similar magnitude that is just created from that plant turnaround in that quarter. And on polysilicon, our change in guidance comes from two elements. We see that strong prices hold very firm for longer. So, we had baked in some moderation before. And the second is we see now, yes, a lower energy burden than initially feared, I would say. That’s the point that we had discussed before. But apart from that, we are running full, so we have no stock. So, there can’t be – there is no other moving factor I can use.

Markus Mayer

Okay. But just what you said on polysilicon price book for Q4, that’s nothing – not kind of effect we would also then repeat for 2023 or beginning of 2023?

Christian Hartel

But, again, as we said, Markus, we see a very strong demand on the solar side. I mentioned this 700 gigawatts for the wafer capacity is being installed, which would equate to 2 million tons of polysilicon. So, we see a very strong demand in Q4 and going also into the next year.

Markus Mayer

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Thomas Swoboda from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.

Thomas Swoboda

Yes. Good afternoon everyone. I have two questions left. Firstly, on polysilicon, I must admit I remain puzzled by the phasing of the earnings in this segment. So, maybe you can help me with was there any non-recurring events in this segment in the quarter? I am specifically thinking, did you reduce the production rates in Europe or even stop production during the quarter because of the very high energy costs? That’s my first question. And the second question is on your guidance regarding raw material, energy and the logistics headwinds. Could you give us at least a rough split what do you expect for each of those drivers? I am especially interested in energy. Thank you.

Tobias Ohler

Thomas, Tobias here. I will start with the second one. I mean as we mentioned before, our energy cost is doubling from ‘21 to ‘22 or a bit more, so that portion is – I mean €450 million was a number in ‘21. So, you can make an estimate what comes from energy. So, majority of the headwind is still from raw materials. To your first question, the phasing of the polysilicon result, I can definitely confirm there is no change in production rates due to high energy costs, no way. And you – I mean you look at it sequentially, from Q2 to Q3, we see higher energy and raw material costs. I mean energy market really spiked in that quarter. These were more or less compensated by higher sequential selling prices. And there was a tiny special effect that was helping us a bit in Q2, but it is not of the magnitude that we would report it, but that explains the last difference to that.

Thomas Swoboda

Thank you. That’s really helpful. Maybe if I can sneak in a follow-up. Again, on polysilicon, I am still trying to get my head around it. Your energy hedging, is there a possibility that your hedges or the degree of the hedging you have differs from quarter-to-quarter. So, in other words, you were less hedged on Q3 than you were, for example, in the first half of the year. And again, your hedging rate is higher for Q4. Is this something to think of, or is it completely off limits, something like that?

Tobias Ohler

I think it goes too much into details. I think it’s – typically, the winter quarters are slightly higher in hedging ratios, but that is mainly applying for gas. But also our demand is different, and so we consume more in winter than in summer. I would leave it there. I think it’s not something that’s really driving any quarterly movement between – quarterly movement in the polysilicon division.

Thomas Swoboda

I understand. Thank you very much.

Operator

We have a follow-up question from Jaideep Pandya. Please go ahead.

Jaideep Pandya

Yes. Thanks. The first question really is around your guidance, sorry to ask you this, between €2.1 billion and €2.3 billion. So, what sort of gets you to €2.3 million, because when I add up all your bottom-up guidances, I come to €2.1 million. So, just wondering what gets the €2.3 million number going. Thanks.

Tobias Ohler

Okay, Jaideep, Tobias here. On the guidance, I think I wouldn’t agree entirely that you end up at the bottom end of the range. So, if you would take our segment guide, and we don’t take them literally, it all adds up, that you end up within the range. Here, I would agree rather in the lower half of the range. But as I have said before, don’t take it literally. So, I think I would also confirm that the midpoint of the guidance is, from today’s perspective, more likely than any extreme. So, more likely than the low end and more likely than the high end. And yes, we have two months to go, and we see how we come out in 2022. I mean the year will be financially very successful. We will have the records updates, we will have a record EBITDA, and we will have another strong cash flow after 2 years of strong cash flow. I mean if you add up all the cash flow over 2020, ‘21 and ‘23, I think you come to a number of around €2 billion. So, yes, we will end with a strong balance sheet, as we discussed, and we will discuss guidance for next year when we are in the period of talking about full year results in March.

Jaideep Pandya

Thanks. And just one more follow-up really around your balance sheet and around the original question Charlie actually asked on BIOSOLUTIONS. Chris, are you sort of saying that even on a 12 months to 18 months view, you don’t want to spend big ticket money on BIOSOLUTIONS to sort of beef up this division to at least jumpstart towards the €100 million range, given the fact that your balance sheet is so strong, and you already have fairly large investments earmarked and still you are generating so much cash? So, what is sort of stopping you from signing a big check?

Tobias Ohler

Well, Jaideep, I think we pointed out that we have a very, very clear strategy here in place. We look for the right opportunities. And regardless of how stable or strong our balance sheet is, we will not overpay for opportunities. And that has always been our strategy, and we will continue with this. And we do have projects in the pipeline, rest assured. And if the time is right, we will communicate on them. We do see BIOSOLUTIONS definitely as a big growth opportunity for this company. We are looking at the opportunities, and you will see more coming up. And let me finish. It’s a great company. Wacker is a great company with a great future, and we want to be the architect of our success.

Jaideep Pandya

Great. So, quickly get that industrial power price.

Tobias Ohler

Yes. Sure. Thanks.

Jaideep Pandya

339,Elon Musk Casts Doubt on Paul Pelosi Attack,https://www.thestreet.com/.image/t_share/MTg4NzYwNTI4NjE5ODQxMDU2/elon-musk_4.jpg,30/10/2022,"The billionaire, now in charge of Twitter, shared unverified information about the suspect's motive.",https://www.thestreet.com/technology/elon-musk-casts-doubt-on-paul-pelosi-attack,"The billionaire, now in charge of Twitter, shares unverified report on an attack on House Speaker Pelosi's husband.

Elon Musk is unconventional to his DNA.

The CEO of Tesla (TSLA) has shown many times that he's determined to be different. And he often seems most comfortable when he takes a position that contrasts with widely held opinions.

Take the obvious example of Tesla. For many years, the co-founder of the world's No. 1 producer of premium electric vehicles was alone in betting on EVs, seeing them as the future of the auto industry.

But the more people mocked Musk, the more ambitious he became. In 2015, he said Tesla would be valued at $700 billion by 2025. At the time, the group had not produced a single consumer vehicle.

That car, the Model 3 sedan, arrived in 2018-2019. And Tesla's valuation reached Musk's prediction by December 2020. The company reached a market value of $1 trillion in October 2021, before falling back. The Austin group is currently valued at nearly $722 billion.

His predictions drew ridicule from the business community and other automakers -- and now they are chasing his success in the industry. Tesla's rise has made him the richest man in the world.

Musk Pushes Fake News

He has just confirmed this tendency once again, by distancing himself somewhat from the condemnations of the Oct. 27 violent attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

The attack came a few days before the midterm elections.

""The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories,"" former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted on Oct. 29. ""It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.""

Musk seems somewhat at odds with this theory, which attributes the attack to America's deepening political divisions and to hate speech by some politicians. He indicates that might be another version of the story.

""There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye,"" the billionaire responded to Clinton.

He provided a link to an article in the Santa Monica Observer, which attributes the attack on Pelosi to an argument gone wrong.

Musk later deleted the post.

'Notorious for Publishing False News'

TheStreet can't verify the Observer's reporting and won't repeat it here. The Santa Monica Observer has been known for publishing false information on a number of occasions., including a story about Hillary Clinton passing away and her body double being sent to debate Donald Trump in one of the 2016 presidential candidate debates.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the Santa Monica Observer is ""notorious for publishing false news.""

Musk's tweet unsurprisingly sparked strong reactions on Twitter, of which he became the owner on Oct. 27. For many users, the billionaire is spreading disinformation because the Santa Monica Observer provides no evidence to support its report.

""I don't know Elon, are you sure it's really Hillary you're replying to?"" asked Jon Favreau, Barack Obama's ex-speechwriting director.

""Elon is already using his Chief Twit role to spread disinformation. That sucks. I thought you wanted to promote peace and love?"" added another Twitter user.

""Check you sources @elonmusk, 'the “Santa Monica Observer,' owned by onetime City Council candidate David Ganezer, is notorious for publishing false news. In 2016, for example, it claimed that Hillary Clinton had died and that a body double had been sent to debate Donald Trump,"" posted one user.

Musk's tweet comes at a time when the new owner of Twitter promised advertisers that ""Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!"" He told advertisers this Oct. 27.

The entrepreneur announced the establishment of a council to review banned accounts and promised that no decisions would be made before that panel convenes.

""Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints. No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes,"" he said on Oct. 28.

Police Account of the Attack on Paul Pelosi

According to the police, a man broke into the San Francisco home of the Pelosis early on Friday, demanding to see her. He then violently assaulted her husband with a hammer. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington at the time, according to the Capitol Police.

Paul Pelosi, 82, was taken to a San Francisco hospital, where he underwent surgery to treat a fractured skull and injuries to his right arm and hands, a spokesperson said in a statement.

Nancy Pelosi's husband should make a full recovery, according to the doctors.

The suspect, David Depape, 42, was also taken to the hospital. He is suspected of attempted murder, assault with a weapon, elder abuse and burglary.

The incident comes less than two weeks before the midterm congressional elections and raises fears that more violence could erupt before Nov. 8.

DePape's motivations are still under investigation by the FBI and the San Francisco police, but according to initial information, he is a follower of far-right conspiracy theories. In particular, he believes that the 2020 election was stolen, a theory backed by former President Donald Trump.

According to CNN, he is the author of two blogs that contain hate speech against minorities, women and Jews. Reports say DePape may also be a follower of QAnon theories.",electric vehicles,thestreet

Hanoi (VNA) – A legal framework, support policies and a concerted infrastructure system are needed to encourage people to switch to using electric vehicles, according to Director of VinFast’s charging station development centre Vu Thang.



He held that policies to encourage the development of e-vehicles in Vietnam have remained limited in the absence of a common set of standards and sufficient charging stations.



The official stressed that the Ministry of Science and Technology has yet to set standards for the construction of charging stations and equipment.



Meanwhile, power supplies for charging stations are also another difficulty as they are based far from power sources, he said, adding that there are also a number of barriers in ground clearance for the construction of the stations.



The number of e-vehicles in the country remains low and has yet to affect the power network, but when it rises, VinFast will encourage customers to charge their vehicles during off-peak hours.



Thang said VinFast has introduced six electric automobiles and more than 10 models of e-motorbikes.



At the same time, the firm is building a network of charging stations with a wide coverage and safety to ensure convenience for users, contributing to promoting the use of green vehicles, he said.



He noted that VinFast has opened about 3,000 charging stations in the 63 localities nationwide, while developing a team of support technicians to provide on-the-spot charging services./.
