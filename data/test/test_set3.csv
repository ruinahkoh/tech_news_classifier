Not so with the images in The Bestiary Chronicles, a free, three-part comics series from Campfire Entertainment, a New York-based production house focused on creative storytelling.

The visuals in the trilogy -- believed to be the first comics series made with AI-assisted art -- are stunning. They're also stunningly precise, as if they've come straight from the hand of a seasoned digital artist with a very specific story and style in mind.

""Deep underground, the last remnants of humanity gather to learn about the monsters that have destroyed their planet,"" reads a description of The Lesson, the visually rich retro-futuristic third comic in the trilogy. All three are available for download now on Campfire's site, and also come in softcover and hardcover printed anthologies.

Though AI-generated visual art can tend toward the wildly absurd, the photorealistic humans in The Bestiary Chronicles don't have rearranged facial features, or limbs protruding at odd angles. The monsters -- with their glowing eyes and astonishingly bad teeth -- look like love children of Godzilla and Vhagar and could hardly be mistaken for anything other than rage-filled beasts.

This algorithm-assisted art looks tailor-made for the dark dystopian tale, which leans on tropes from 1960 sci-fi horror film Village of the Damned and from THX 1138, George Lucas' 1971 debut feature film.

""We're seeing the rise of a completely new visualization tool that will radically change the storytelling process across both the comics industry and entertainment in general,"" said Steve Coulson, writer of the trilogy and creative director of the award-winning Campfire, which has created immersive fan experiences for shows including Ted Lasso, Westworld and Watchmen. Its founders thought up The Blair Witch Project.

For The Bestiary Chronicles, Coulson turned to Midjourney, a service that quickly turns short text phrases, or ""prompts,"" into images by scanning a giant database trained on visual art by humans. Artificial intelligence tools like it, Dall-E and Stable Diffusion are capturing the internet's imagination as they let anyone manifest images from text in intriguing and sometimes disturbing ways.

The Bestiary Chronicles is a 114-page science fiction odyssey about monsters born from man's technological hubris. But it also showcases the remarkable progress of products like Midjourney, which are producing increasingly more sophisticated and refined images.

""By the new year, even the trained eye probably won't be able to perceive an AI generation from any other,"" Coulson said. ""It's exciting and terrifying at the same time. But you can't put the genie back in the bottle, so we're embracing the future as fast as we can.""

AI image generation is advancing so rapidly, he adds, that The Lesson, out Nov. 1, marks a clear visual step up from the first comic in the trilogy, Summer Island, a folk-horror story in the spirit of Midsommar that came out in August. During those three months, Midjourney went through two upgrades.

AI, partner in art

""Technology is changing our world, with artificial intelligence both a new frontier of possibility but also a development fraught with anxiety,"" Thomas P. Campbell, director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, said when the exhibit Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI opened in 2020 to explore the ever-expanding space where humans and artificial intelligence meet.

AI generating visual art, composing songs and even writing poetry and movie scripts is driving some of that anxiety, raising ethical and copyright concerns among artists and even lawyers. AI art isn't created in a vacuum. It works by absorbing and reconstructing existing art created by humans. As machine-made art improves, will those humans -- actual graphic designers, illustrators, composers and photographers -- find themselves edged out of work?

When an AI-generated picture won an art prize in September, some artists weren't happy about it. ""We're watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes,"" one Twitter user wrote.

Coulson, an avid comics reader since age 5, is among those pondering the complex questions raised by AI art, but he doesn't think tools like Midjourney will replace the comics artists he's long loved. ""Those geniuses have an eye for dramatic composition and dynamic narrative that I strongly doubt machine learning will be able to match,"" he writes in the afterword to Summer Island. ""But as a visualization tool for nonartists like myself, it's a hell of a lot of fun.""

Campfire, Midjourney

He does, however, see Midjourney as his true collaborator in The Bestiary Chronicles, even giving it an author credit. Where a comics artist might conceive of a narrative and then create art to illustrate it, AI-assisted images have the potential to more actively steer the story, or even change its direction, thus dramatically redefining the whole creative workflow. Coulson likens this human-machine duet to improv jazz.

""I would never ask a human artist to just 'draw 100 splash pages and maybe I'll pick the one I like the best,' but Midjourney will happily spit them out 24/7,"" Coulson says. ""Then after we review the imagery, we start to assemble the story, almost as an act of collage, filling in gaps along the way.""

AI art is the star here, but humans had the decisive hand in which images made it into the final version of each story. They experimented with text prompts and carefully selected their final images from multiple Midjourney offerings, making a Photoshop tweak here and there, but mostly letting the machine-made work stand.

The Campfire team, for example, liked the rich effect produced by the style prompt ""olive-green and sepia and teal-blue tritone print on watercolor paper,"" so they used that one often to give images a painterly effect. For The Lesson, the phrase ""futuristic underground bunker in the style of J.C. Leyendecker"" yielded the perfect retro-futuristic postapocalyptic hideaway.

""We also used the phrase 'Hitchcock Blonde' to describe our heroine, and more often than not she came out looking like Grace Kelly,"" Coulson said. That's a fully recognizable Grace Kelly, without misplaced ears or a dog snout.

Nov 14 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley artificial intelligence (AI) computing startup SambaNova Systems said on Monday it delivered eight units of its latest AI system to the U.S. Argonne National Laboratory, which is expanding its AI offering to researchers.

Each of the systems has eight DataScale SN30 chips, launched in September, and triples the speed of the previous generation.

With AI work taking center stage in research, Argonne National Laboratory has been testing out various AI chips and systems, Rick Stevens, associate lab director for computing, environment and life sciences at Argonne lab told Reuters.

In addition to SambaNova, AI systems from startups including Cerebras Systems, Groq Inc, Graphcore, and Intel Corp (INTC.O) owned Habana Labs have been tested.

""We're working with new emerging AI hardware architectures, and we get early hardware and then we play with it, we use it on our science applications,"" said Stevens.

""When we get to that point, we make internal decisions - 'Is this useful enough and performant enough and interesting enough that we should take the next step?' And so SambaNova has gotten to that milestone.""

Steven said the lab was evaluating AI hardware for its next supercomputer to see if SambaNova and others can be included. The lab, which is a Department of Energy national lab run by the University of Chicago, is currently building a supercomputer dubbed Aurora that will be a two exascale speed machine - able to do two billion calculations in a second.

Stevens said the lab was in discussions with Cerebras and Habana about scaling up those systems as well. ""What we try to do is understand the sweet spots of these different systems,"" he said.

SambaNova's first-generation AI system has been used to predict how tumors respond to various drug combinations, improve weather forecasting accuracy, and speed up fluid dynamics simulations, he said.

3,"Today, TigerGraph rolled out several new features so cloud users can deliver more analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) power without leaving the confines of its database.",artificial intelligence,15/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/saas-trust.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

The cloud’s place in the data environment is growing, and TigerGraph wants to bolster its role. Today, the company rolled out several new features so cloud users can deliver more analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) power without leaving the confines of TigerGraph’s database. The updates expand the role for its tools, as TigerGraph’s product is becoming more of a data analytics and AI platform than just a mechanism for storing graph data.

“Our biggest enterprises are still on-prem,” said Jay Yu, a vice president of product and innovation at TigerGraph. “However, we know a lot of smaller and medium-sized customers or more advanced customers, they actually prefer cloud.”

Analytics for the cloud

The announcements include three features that bring a collection of analytics and analysis to the cloud customers. These options were often available to users who directly installed the database, but often they required a substantial amount of additional configuration, often including big data pipelines like Apache Spark. The cloud versions are already integrated and available to anyone, including those using the free tier.

TigerGraph Insights is one major tool that offers a low-code and no-code option, so users can create reports and graphics with a simplified interface. The goal is to let users, including more non-technical users, create “graph stories” that boil down the details from the database into reports and dashboards that will automatically update themselves.

The database already offers customers the option to download data from the API to other data analysis platforms like Tableau, but the new feature offers options that can use some of the networking data that’s often embedded in the graph. It can deliver answers to graph questions like which node is the most connected to other nodes with no more than two hops.

“We’re not trying to replace those tools that we know people already have.“ said Yu. “But the challenge is that they cannot do the graph work. You cannot [analyze the network]. You can only do the tabular view.”

Graph databases like TigerGraph were designed specifically to both store and analyze networks of nodes or data elements. Some standalone graph database companies like Neo4J or ArangoDB are attracting attention. At the same time, major database companies like Oracle are adding the features for storing and analyzing graph data. Cloud versions of these databases and others like AWS Neptune are active competitors for TigerGraph in the marketplace for storing graphs in the cloud.

ML and AI for cloud data

Another major step forward in today’s announcement is ML Workbench, an option that lets cloud users integrate popular open-source Jupyter notebooks directly with the graph data. Users can start to train the AI model using not just the raw tabular data, but also the interconnections that make up the network in the database.

Performing machine learning (ML) directly inside the database is becoming an essential feature for databases. In the best scenarios, it can save the time for exporting the data to a separate function, a delay that can be substantial with large datasets.

“When you look at a set of data to figure out what’s the pattern behind it and you train it with graph data too, suddenly the model is much smarter.” said Yu who also pointed that it’s naturally good for tasks like fraud detection where the relationships between people or other data elements can be revealing.

This kind of analysis is often a perfect match for the cloud. The training procedures can demand heavy computation using specialized processors that may only be used occasionally. Cloud users can run analysis when it makes sense and avoid investing in extra hardware.

Companies like Oracle offer their customers the option to work directly with machine learning algorithms using their databases. Some cloud vendors like Microsoft, Amazon or Google have engineered their artificial intelligence toolkits to interface directly with many of their cloud data storage options. It’s common for data storage solutions to be sold not just on their ability to retrieve information, but also to feed it directly into a machine learning algorithm.

The same reality is also roiling the world of data analytics. The gap between the analytics tools and the data warehouse or database is growing more blurred. The data scientists who once turned to companies like Databricks or Snowflake are now finding that they can do much of the work using tools that are integrated with the database. IBM, for instance, bundles their Watson AI software with their data storage in a product that mixes analytics with machine learning and data storage.

This is the same path that TigerGraph is following with these announcements. It wants to continue to integrate more features like this directly into their product, effectively turning it more into a data analysis platform than just a simple data storage solution.

The cloud versions are also becoming an essential part of marketing, in part because the company offers a free tier that allows developers or data scientists to experiment without purchasing servers or spending time installing software on local machines.

“We see a big pickup on the cloud,” said Yu. “We keep introducing new things quickly on the cloud because we can highlight those new features. We believe that will make it even easier to push graph to everybody, Our goal is graph for all.”",TigerGraph brings machine learning and analyticsfeatures to the cloud,https://venturebeat.com/enterprise-analytics/tigergraph-brings-machine-learning-and-analyticsfeatures-to-the-cloud/

DeviantArt is now getting into the space with a generator of its own called DreamUp, promising ""safe and fair"" generation for creators. The website says one of artists' main concerns about AI art is that their work may be used to train artificial intelligence models, which means the generator could spit out pieces in their style without their consent. In an attempt to give artists control over their work, DeviantArt is giving them the ability to choose whether or not the tool can use their style for direct inspiration.

Further, the website is giving them the power to declare whether or not to allow their work to be used in datasets used to train third-party AI models. If they choose not to be included in those datasets, their content pages' HTML files will contain a ""noimageai"" directive. Also a ""noai"" directive protects their artwork when media files are directly downloaded from DeviantArt's servers.

""DeviantArt encourages other creator platforms to adopt this approach in order to ensure artists remain able to share their work with online audiences while retaining control over non-human usage,"" the website wrote in its announcement.

Those directives, of course, won't be added to their pages' HTML files if they're cool with their work being used to train AI models. And if they choose to allow DreamUp to use their style as a direct inspiration, they will be ""clearly credited"" on the output when it's published on DeviantArt. The website has anticipated that some users wouldn't be happy seeing even more AI art, though, especially since Midjourney-generated pieces are already a very common sight on the platform. That's why all DreamUp submissions will be automatically tagged as #AIArt, and users will be able to choose to see or to hide posts under the topic.

November 14, 2022 - Technology and science have the potential to fundamentally transform the health care industry. As artificial intelligence and machine learning advance, medical devices will detect disease earlier, diagnose more accurately, target better therapies and improve personalized medicine. However, the current regulatory framework implemented by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not well suited to the adoption of digital health products.

In July 2017, the FDA launched the Software Precertification Pilot Program (Pre-Cert Program) to replace the current FDA product-by-product premarket review process and ""fast-track"" the process for medical device developers that the FDA trusts to produce consistently high-quality, safe and secure products, thereby removing the necessity to undergo the full review process.

After five years of collecting data from nine volunteer companies considered to be the leading developers of digital health products, the FDA issued a final report — ""The Software Precertification (Pre-Cert) Pilot Program: Tailored Total Product Lifecycle Approaches and Key Findings,"" Sept. 26, 2022 — discussing the results of its revolutionary Pre-Cert Program, which concluded that rapidly evolving medical device software technologies could benefit from an updated regulatory framework. Most importantly, however, the recent report notes that the FDA lacks the legal authority to fully implement the program.

FDA oversight and digital health

For decades, the FDA has been charged with the responsibility of regulating medical devices, and its incorporated software, to ensure safety for its consumers. There are two different ways that such software is categorized: (1) a 'software in a medical device' (SIMD); or (2) a 'software as a medical device' (SaMD).

SIMD incorporates software into a traditional medical device to aid functionality, such as a robotic surgical device that implements software for a surgeon to control navigation features while conducting surgery. On the other hand, when the software itself is the medical device, it is classified as a SaMD. For example, a software program that analyzes X-rays and engages in computer-assisted diagnosis is considered an SaMD.

Over the last decade, SaMDs have exploded in both demand and popularity resulting in a new category of health care products coined as ""digital health"" encompassing the development of wearables such as Apple Watches and Fitbits to mobile health care applications aimed at assisting physicians and patients. However, a widely recognized challenge to the growth and advancement of digital health is the FDA's premarket review requirements as it is a lengthy and expensive process. The current FDA premarket review process requires developers of SaMDs to understand the FDA requirements, gather necessary data, prepare voluminous submissions and answer the FDA's stringent criteria.

As such, the FDA's outdated premarket review process severely hampers the speed at which the medical device industry can innovate — a necessary trade-off to ensure that medical devices are marketed to the consumer with a great degree of assured safety and effectiveness. The digital health medical device industry simply cannot thrive within the traditional regulatory structure, a challenge that has previously been addressed by Congress in 2016.

The 21st Century Cures Act

In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act) was enacted by Congress clarifying, among other various purposes, the FDA's regulatory oversight over digital health and medical devices. Pursuant to the Act, digital health — under the purview of the FDA and subject to regulatory authority — includes machines or devices that use artificial intelligence such as machine learning to provide diagnostic information to patients.

Most importantly, the Cures Act provides that devices classified as low-risk medical software that serve as electronic patient records or data storage are to be excluded from the lengthy premarket review process. To put it simply, if the AI algorithm does not provide a diagnosis or predict a course of treatment, the FDA does not need to regulate it.

Before Apple Watches, Fitbits and other mobile medical devices were utilized to track steps or monitor hearts, a medical device was traditionally only thought of and used to provide measurements or give treatments. Considering the increasing popularity and demand of SaMD, and the imperfect fit between technology development and federal regulation, the FDA pitched a pilot program to pre-certify eligible health developers who could market their devices to consumers without additional FDA review.

An overview of the pre-cert pilot program

The FDA launched the Pilot Program as an initial step forward in developing a new regulatory framework that accommodates the distinctive nature of Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) and replaces the FDA's current product-by-product premarket review process with a ""pre-certify"" process for SaMD developers who demonstrate sufficient quality performance. In other words, SaMD developers would be able to forgo the current FDA premarket review process.

Pilot program results and future legislation

Under the Pre-Cert program, the FDA provided nine companies, including Apple, Samsung, Verily, Johnson & Johnson, Roche and Fitbit, with the voluntary opportunity to partake in a ""pre-certification"" process and forgo the FDA's stringent premarket review by demonstrating in-house adherence to objective criteria related to software design, development, testing and validation.

During the Pilot Program, the FDA conducted ongoing ""Excellence Appraisals"" of the nine participants and evaluated each company's ability to develop safe and effective devices, instead of monitoring the medical device itself as currently required under the FDA's 510(k) process. The FDA also collected data throughout the Pilot Program concerning the volunteer companies' capacity to monitor and improve a SaMD during its life cycle.

The FDA report states that the current medical device regulatory approach is far too rigid and impractical to efficiently evaluate the safety and effectiveness of modern medical technology and digital health devices.

The Pilot Program resulted in various findings related to excellence principles and key performance indicators (KPI) that may be useful to SaMD manufactures.

Some of the KPI objectives identified by the Pilot Program and considered as the best practices for implementation of a quality management system in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (21 C.F.R. Part 820) are:

(1) development of well-characterized software, i.e., ""the software behaves as expected"";

(2) deployment and monitoring of such software, i.e., ""the software behaves as expected in the real-world"";

(3) a patching process that ensures timely resolution of issues, i.e., ""software can be fixed when it does not behave as expected;"" and

(4) a process to ensure modifications meet user needs through real-world use.

Ultimately, innovation aside, the FDA concluded that under current statutory authorities there are significant challenges to implement the Pilot Program. However, the report offers no guidance or detail about what type of regulatory framework would be useful to achieve the goals of the Pilot Program. Instead, the FDA provides that the rate at which digital health develops requires that a flexible and risk-based approach to regulation of medical devices be considered.

While the FDA's regulatory process regarding these innovative technologies still requires a great deal of fine-tuning, it is encouraging to see the hurdles have been recognized. Hopefully in time, the legislative action necessary to allow for the FDA to move at — or close to — the speed of these developing technologies will be executed.

These “liquid” neural networks (in the Bruce Lee sense) literally play 4D chess — their models requiring time-series data to operate — which makes them ideal for use in time-sensitive tasks like pacemaker monitoring, weather forecasting, investment forecasting, or autonomous vehicle navigation. But, the problem is that data throughput has become a bottleneck, and scaling these systems has become prohibitively expensive, computationally speaking.

On Tuesday, MIT researchers announced that they have devised a solution to that restriction, not by widening the data pipeline but by solving a differential equation that has stumped mathematicians since 1907. Specifically, the team solved, “the differential equation behind the interaction of two neurons through synapses… to unlock a new type of fast and efficient artificial intelligence algorithms.”

“The new machine learning models we call ‘CfC’s’ [closed-form Continuous-time] replace the differential equation defining the computation of the neuron with a closed form approximation, preserving the beautiful properties of liquid networks without the need for numerical integration,” MIT professor and CSAIL Director Daniela Rus said in a Tuesday press statement. “CfC models are causal, compact, explainable, and efficient to train and predict. They open the way to trustworthy machine learning for safety-critical applications.”

So, for those of us without a doctorate in Really Hard Math, differential equations are formulas that can describe the state of a system at various discrete points or steps throughout the process. For example, if you have a robot arm moving from point A to B, you can use a differential equation to know where it is in between the two points in space at any given step within the process. However, solving these equations for every step quickly gets computationally expensive as well. MIT’s “closed form” solution end-arounds that issue by functionally modeling the entire description of a system in a single computational step. AS the MIT team explains:

Imagine if you have an end-to-end neural network that receives driving input from a camera mounted on a car. The network is trained to generate outputs, like the car's steering angle. In 2020, the team solved this by using liquid neural networks with 19 nodes, so 19 neurons plus a small perception module could drive a car. A differential equation describes each node of that system. With the closed-form solution, if you replace it inside this network, it would give you the exact behavior, as it’s a good approximation of the actual dynamics of the system. They can thus solve the problem with an even lower number of neurons, which means it would be faster and less computationally expensive.

By solving this equation at the neuron-level, the team is hopeful that they’ll be able to construct models of the human brain that measure in the millions of neural connections, something not possible today. The team also notes that this CfC model might be able to take the visual training it learned in one environment and apply it to a wholly new situation without additional work, what’s known as out-of-distribution generalization. That’s not something current-gen models can really do and would prove to be a significant step towards the generalized AI systems of tomorrow.",MIT solved a century-old differential equation to break 'liquid' AI's computational bottleneck,https://www.engadget.com/mit-century-old-differential-equation-liquid-ai-computational-bottleneck-160035555.html

Customers can grab sandwiches as they wish from the fridge, which is also listening to what you’re saying as you’re using it.



This past September, the Subway smart fridge was placed on the campus of the University of California San Diego and was stocked with grab-and-go options like pre-made sandwiches and prepackaged chips and soda. The company stated in a press release yesterday that reception to the fridge has been “extremely positive” from college students who can pick up a sandwich whenever they want. In addition to the weight-sensitive shelves that tell the fridge what to charge you and the UV-C light that sanitizes the machine after each use, the fridge is also equipped with artificial intelligence and language recognition software.

“Subway Grab & Go has quickly gained traction as consumers are drawn to sandwiches made fresh daily from a brand they know and love, versus competitor items that rely on a 14-day plus shelf life,” said Karla Martinez, director of innovation for non-traditional development. “As Subway continues to expand off-premises concepts, guests can expect to find Subway Grab & Go and smart fridges in more convenient everyday places like airports, college campuses, and hospitals.”

Cool concept, bizarre execution. The AI and speech recognition feature on the fridge is supposed to allow customers to ask the machine about the offerings that lie within. But as you may know, that’s almost never the entire story, and we don’t exactly know when/if the microphone switches off or on, what else the AI is capable of, or what Subway is doing with any recordings they may be collecting. Subway didn’t immediately return our request for comment on those questions.

Subway began piloting a grab-and-go platform in 2020.

JERUSALEM, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Israeli digital health firm AEYE Health said on Tuesday it received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market its screening system to detect damage to the retina of the eyes in diabetics.

Screening diabetics for retinopathy, or damaged retinas, has recently become reimbursable in the United States.

The FDA approval follows positive Phase III clinical trial results from last February.

Using a special desktop camera, AEYE takes images from each eye and through artificial intelligence it captures and analyses data of the retina that helps diagnose diseases, including diabetes, that could lead to blindness.

It noted that diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness in the working age and that 90% of such vision loss could be avoided with early detection and treatment.

AEYE added it was advancing a follow-on program for the screening of glaucomatous optic neuropathy and expects to initiate FDA pivotal trials soon.

The chip, known as the A800, is an alternative to the A100 chip that went into production in the third quarter, Nvidia said Monday. ""The A800 meets the US government's clear test for reduced export control and cannot be programmed to exceed it,"" a spokesperson for the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said in a statement.

Tech companies have been caught in the middle of rising tensions between China and the US over Chinese companies gaining access to technologies that enable high-performance computing, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors.

Nvidia revealed in August that the US government had ordered it to restrict sales of two AI acceleration chips to China -- the A100 and the forthcoming H100, which let AI developers speed up their research and build more-advanced AI models. The order aimed to ""address the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a 'military end use' or 'military end user' in China and Russia,"" Nvidia said at the time.

The company warned at the time that it had expected approximately $400 million in sales to China during the third quarter but indicated that figure may be impacted by customers being unwilling to purchase alternative products.

Nov 11 (Reuters) - Swiss private investment company Partners Group Holding AG (PGHN.S) is investing up to $1.2 billion in U.S. data center operator EdgeCore Digital Infrastructure, the private equity firm told Reuters.

Partners Group will use the fund to acquire a majority stake in EdgeCore and help it build out new data center sites across the United States, the latest of Partners' investment in data center assets.

""We believe that the company is really well positioned to benefit from the growth in data traffic globally. Some of the themes include cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, 5G and mobile,"" said Ed Diffendal, managing director at Partners Group.

In 2021, Partners Group made four digital infrastructure investments, including acquiring atNorth, the largest data center operator in Iceland.

Data centers have become popular assets for infrastructure funds, as investors bet on companies shifting IT infrastructure to outsourced cloud service providers with data solutions.

Led by former CoreSite chief executive Tom Ray, Denver-based EdgeCore had developed six data centers in the United States, including campuses in Phoenix, Arizona and the Silicon Valley.

Backed by over $800 million of equity from Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, Canada's OPTrust pension fund and Mount Elbert Capital Partners, Edgecore says it has been serving large tech companies since its launch in 2018.

Founded in 1996, Partners Group manages $131 billion across private equity, real estate, infrastructure, credit and secondaries globally. The infrastructure arm that invests in EdgeCore has $21 billion in assets under management.

It’s a tricky tightrope that Ferrell’s new festive comedy Spirited precariously wobbles along before almost immediately falling off, a desperate and crudely assembled attempt to recapture that very difficult to capture magic.

It comes from Apple, as one of the tech behemoth’s biggest bets to date (at least $75m was spent just on talent), and suitably has the feeling of something created less by real human people and more calculated by artificial intelligence, heavy emphasis on artificial. It’s a plasticky piece of product with the puppyish insistence that it has the power to please us all, frantically trying to tick every box but failing to hit just one. A meta spin on A Christmas Carol that’s also a bromance comedy but mostly an earnest, full-throated musical was never going to be an easy elevator pitch to untangle but it was enough to spark a bidding war with Apple beating out Netflix, Paramount and Warner Bros.

In the annual flurry of cheaply stuffed Christmas streaming movies, there is a thrill to watching one that wouldn’t pixelate if transferred to a bigger screen and Spirited easily and expensively earns its one-week theatrical release before it heads to your smartphone. It’s all very slickly packaged, even if at points such slickness becomes a little too synthetic, and will probably find a record audience for Apple, a company that’s struggled to find a homegrown blockbuster movie. But while it might be a hit this season, I doubt for many it will have that annual rewatchability factor, a film not for life but just this one Christmas.

In the high-concept world of Spirited, haunting is a business. Every year when Christmas approaches, three ghosts descend upon a figure in need of de-Scrooging, redemption being the ultimate goal. The Ghost of Christmas Present (Ferrell) is edging toward retirement but eager to make an impact before that day comes and so picks Clint Briggs (Ryan Reynolds), a heartless media consultant who spends his life causing conflict for a living. He’s what’s known as an “unredeemable”, someone incapable of real change, but along with Past (Glow’s Sunita Mani) and Future (the voice of Tracy Morgan), he’s determined to finish the job.

New adaptations of the Dickens morality tale are a seasonal staple (this year also sees a Netflix animation with the voices of Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley, the return of Jefferson Mays’ one-man Broadway show and an Adrian Edmondson-led version at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon) and so there is at least some initial inventiveness to be praised in the Daddy’s Home co-writers Sean Anders and John Morris’s distinctive revision. There’s some intricate world-building and the odd deft idea but some less developed joke-writing, a string of misses crashing from the very first scene. While Elf managed to be genuinely funny while also being genuinely sweet, the tone here is far less even. The wink, wink jokes for the adults reek of eye-rolling smugness (it’s the kind of film where a character watches a song-and-dance number and asks “Why are they singing?” to the answer of “Because they’re in a musical”) and this clashes with the film’s often embarrassingly straight-faced earnestness, most visible in the film’s many, many, many musical set pieces.

The decision to make the film a musical is a genuine head-scratcher, one that’s never justified or even mildly explained given that the two leads are not natural singers and so throughout the lunges into song feel awkward at best. With music from the La La Land and The Greatest Showman duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, it’s certainly committed to the genre but extravagant staging and enthused backing dancers can’t disguise forgettable, cloying songs and lacklustre singing. It’s closer to watching high-budget karaoke at an office Christmas party. Even when they’re not bursting into song, the two can’t really conjure the necessary star powered chemistry to glide us through. Reynolds’s regurgitated quippy shtick is growing more exhausted by the movie (his character name-checking Scrooged only serves to remind us just how much more well-suited Bill Murray was to the role of grinch) while an unsure Ferrell struggles to flip between serious and silly leaving it up to an underused Octavia Spencer, as assistant-cum-love interest, to walk away with the film, an admittedly easy task given the leaden leads.

Anders, also serving as director, never seems confident enough in what his film should be and so we’re never confident enough in what we’re actually watching, an atonal grab bag of inharmonious notes (an uneasy third act suicide proves to be the flattest). When stretched to a two-hour-plus runtime (with more musical bits during the credits), we leave feeling bloated, a 10-course Christmas meal we wish we’d never started.",Spirited review – Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds hit all the wrong notes in Christmas musical,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/09/spirited-review-will-ferrell-ryan-reynolds

CAIRO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Blnk, a fintech platform that enables instant consumer credit in Egypt, has closed one of the country's biggest funding rounds for a startup this year, raising $32 million, its chief executive said.

The company, launched in October 2021, raised $23.7 million in equity and debt funding and $8.3 million in securitised bond issuance, co-founder and CEO Amr Sultan told Reuters.

The funds will be used to accelerate financial inclusion within underserved communities across the country, to support further development of Blnk’s Artificial Intelligence-powered lending infrastructure, and to finance the company’s fast-growing portfolio of customers, he added.

The combined pre-seed and seed funding rounds of $12.5 million were led by Abu Dhabi’s Emirates International Investment Company (EIIC) and Egypt-based venture capital firm Sawari Ventures, with participation from several prominent local and international angel investors.

The $11.2 million debt funding was secured from a number of leading local banks. The $8.3 million securitised bond issuance was underwritten by National Bank of Egypt and Banque du Caire.

Blnk has developed a digital lending platform that empowers merchants of all sizes to instantly underwrite and finance their customers' purchases at the point of sale and enables consumers access to financing to purchase a range of products and services, including electronics, furniture and automotive services, paying over instalments ranging from six to 36 months.

The company says it has disbursed more than $20 million in loans to date.

Not so with the images in The Bestiary Chronicles, a free, three-part comics series from Campfire Entertainment, a New York-based production house focused on creative storytelling.

Campfire, Midjourney

The visuals in the trilogy -- believed to be the first comics series made with AI-assisted art -- are stunning. They're also stunningly precise, as if they've come straight from the hand of a seasoned digital artist with a very specific story and style in mind.

""Deep underground, the last remnants of humanity gather to learn about the monsters that have destroyed their planet,"" reads a description of The Lesson, the visually rich retro-futuristic third comic in the trilogy. All three are available for download now on Campfire's site, and also come in softcover and hardcover printed anthologies.

Though AI-generated visual art can tend toward the wildly absurd, the photorealistic humans in The Bestiary Chronicles don't have rearranged facial features, or limbs protruding at odd angles. The monsters -- with their glowing eyes and astonishingly bad teeth -- look like love children of Godzilla and Vhagar and could hardly be mistaken for anything other than rage-filled beasts.

This algorithm-assisted art looks tailor-made for the dark dystopian tale, which leans on tropes from 1960 sci-fi horror film Village of the Damned and from THX 1138, George Lucas' 1971 debut feature film.

""We're seeing the rise of a completely new visualization tool that will radically change the storytelling process across both the comics industry and entertainment in general,"" said Steve Coulson, writer of the trilogy and creative director of the award-winning Campfire, which has created immersive fan experiences for shows including Ted Lasso, Westworld and Watchmen. Its founders thought up The Blair Witch Project.

For The Bestiary Chronicles, Coulson turned to Midjourney, a service that quickly turns short text phrases, or ""prompts,"" into images by scanning a giant database trained on visual art by humans. Artificial intelligence tools like it, Dall-E and Stable Diffusion are capturing the internet's imagination as they let anyone manifest images from text in intriguing and sometimes disturbing ways.

The Bestiary Chronicles is a 114-page science fiction odyssey about monsters born from man's technological hubris. But it also showcases the remarkable progress of products like Midjourney, which are producing increasingly more sophisticated and refined images.

The advances in AI image generation over the last few months have been exponential and mind blowing. Steve Coulson, Campfire Entertainment

""By the new year, even the trained eye probably won't be able to perceive an AI generation from any other,"" Coulson said. ""It's exciting and terrifying at the same time. But you can't put the genie back in the bottle, so we're embracing the future as fast as we can.""

AI image generation is advancing so rapidly, he adds, that The Lesson, out Nov. 1, marks a clear visual step up from the first comic in the trilogy, Summer Island, a folk-horror story in the spirit of Midsommar that came out in August. During those three months, Midjourney went through two upgrades.

Campfire, Midjourney

AI, partner in art

""Technology is changing our world, with artificial intelligence both a new frontier of possibility but also a development fraught with anxiety,"" Thomas P. Campbell, director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, said when the exhibit Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI opened in 2020 to explore the ever-expanding space where humans and artificial intelligence meet.

AI generating visual art, composing songs and even writing poetry and movie scripts is driving some of that anxiety, raising ethical and copyright concerns among artists and even lawyers. AI art isn't created in a vacuum. It works by absorbing and reconstructing existing art created by humans. As machine-made art improves, will those humans -- actual graphic designers, illustrators, composers and photographers -- find themselves edged out of work?

When an AI-generated picture won an art prize in September, some artists weren't happy about it. ""We're watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes,"" one Twitter user wrote.

Coulson, an avid comics reader since age 5, is among those pondering the complex questions raised by AI art, but he doesn't think tools like Midjourney will replace the comics artists he's long loved. ""Those geniuses have an eye for dramatic composition and dynamic narrative that I strongly doubt machine learning will be able to match,"" he writes in the afterword to Summer Island. ""But as a visualization tool for nonartists like myself, it's a hell of a lot of fun.""

Campfire, Midjourney

He does, however, see Midjourney as his true collaborator in The Bestiary Chronicles, even giving it an author credit. Where a comics artist might conceive of a narrative and then create art to illustrate it, AI-assisted images have the potential to more actively steer the story, or even change its direction, thus dramatically redefining the whole creative workflow. Coulson likens this human-machine duet to improv jazz.

""I would never ask a human artist to just 'draw 100 splash pages and maybe I'll pick the one I like the best,' but Midjourney will happily spit them out 24/7,"" Coulson says. ""Then after we review the imagery, we start to assemble the story, almost as an act of collage, filling in gaps along the way.""

AI art is the star here, but humans had the decisive hand in which images made it into the final version of each story. They experimented with text prompts and carefully selected their final images from multiple Midjourney offerings, making a Photoshop tweak here and there, but mostly letting the machine-made work stand.

The Campfire team, for example, liked the rich effect produced by the style prompt ""olive-green and sepia and teal-blue tritone print on watercolor paper,"" so they used that one often to give images a painterly effect. For The Lesson, the phrase ""futuristic underground bunker in the style of J.C. Leyendecker"" yielded the perfect retro-futuristic postapocalyptic hideaway.

""We also used the phrase 'Hitchcock Blonde' to describe our heroine, and more often than not she came out looking like Grace Kelly,"" Coulson said. That's a fully recognizable Grace Kelly, without misplaced ears or a dog snout.

""The advances in AI image generation over the last few months have been exponential and mind blowing,"" Coulson said, ""and this technology is only going to get better -- faster than we can imagine.""",You'd Never Know AI Drew This Beautiful Comic Series - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/culture/youd-never-know-ai-drew-this-beautiful-comic-series/

Given their contribution to the world’s carbon emissions, minimising the environmental effects of industrial plants is vital. But plans to decarbonise heavy industry efficiently have been unsuccessful, often relying on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies that would take decades to scale. Carbon Re’s technology, by contrast, can be implemented quickly, requires no new equipment, and is already being used to cut emissions today.

In a world-first, the company is developing an artificial intelligence powered software (Delta Zero) to create ‘Digital Twins’ of industrial plants – which can then be monitored to analyse a specific plant’s output and efficiency. Procedures can then be optimised to reduce fuel usage, operational costs, and carbon emissions. Because Delta Zero continuously tracks the plant’s function, operators may alter and improve manufacturing processes virtually in real-time.

Today, the technology is being used in pilot projects at cement plants in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, allowing them all to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 10 per cent. But, with £4.2 million of seed money now raised with the help of Planet A Ventures, Carbon Re aims to scale-up Delta Zero Cement onto the global market and expand into the steel and glass industries.

Springwise has spotted other innovations seeking to reduce industrial carbon emissions, including a carbon-capture solvent and new biogas plants.

It’s everywhere and has been for a while, but AI-powered writing software is a relatively new concept.

AI Writing Software uses artificial intelligence to write articles, blog posts, and other content in your voice. The goal is to provide a tool that will save you time and energy so you can focus on different aspects of your business or life.

To help you get started, we’ve compiled a list of 20 AI writing software you can use to create content for your website, blog, or social media accounts.

Copy.ai uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to produce high-quality content for your business, ebooks, blog posts, articles, product descriptions, social media content, and more. It can also be used to rewrite existing content so that you can use it on your website, blog, or social media pages.

Since it uses artificial intelligence to mimic human writing patterns and styles, the copy will be more natural and easier to read than the typical machine-generated text we’re used to seeing.

Copy.ai differs from traditional content creation tools because it doesn’t just offer suggestions on improving your current content; it generates new text based on what it thinks would be most relevant for the topic or audience.

Key Features:

Pre-built Templates – Copy.ai has a ton of pre-built templates for different kinds of content. For example, you can see below that it has options for blogs, social media content, video, case studies, and more:

Different tones and variations – Get access to tones like friendly, persuasive, professional, luxury, witty, bold, and more to align the content with your writing style. It also creates multiple variations based on your input – you can pick the one you like or make more. To illustrate this, here’s a screenshot of the results we got while trying to write the introduction for this article using Copy AI.

Writing and Brainstorming tools – You also get tons of writing tools, brainstorming tools, and personal tools. Writing tools include essay intro, cliffhanger generator, adjective accelerator, passive to active voice, verb booster, and the like. Brainstorming tools have a name generator, startup ideas, viral ideas, and more – while Personal tools include birthday cards, clubhouse bios, cover letters, love letters, and shower thoughts. You can save your content and then return to it later if you wish. Plus, the software’s user interface is easy to navigate, and the program is simple.

Luciano Viterale , Co-founder of Ticker Nerd, also shares his experience with Copy.ai,

“I’ve been experimenting with AI copywriting tools since GPT-3 was released. I have explored many of the popular tools. However, my favorite tool by far is Copy AI. They have an outstanding blogging outline feature; the UX is clean and easy to navigate, and the pricing is reasonable.

Copy AI also generated the name of my startup, “Ticker Nerd,” which is an investing newsletter that was recently acquired.”

That said, Viterale suggests that the blog outlines can be repetitive. He says, “one thing I don’t particularly like is that blog outlines include the same point repeatedly but articulated slightly differently, essentially adding no value.”

Pros:

Copy.ai produces content at least 80% as good as a human writer (and often better). The system continually learns, which means the more you use it, the better it gets.

It has an extensive library of templates available for different requirements.

Frequently asked questions about AI writing software.

1. What is AI Writing Software?

AI writing software is an artificial intelligence program used to write text. It can generate content for websites, blogs, and other fields. The content created by AI writers is often indistinguishable from human-created content. Still, sometimes it has a slightly robotic feel or may include words or phrases that seem out of place in the context of the writing.

2. How does AI Writing Software work?

The software uses an algorithm to mimic the creative process of human writers. It first creates a base text that modifies by adding words and phrases specific to your content. This ensures that you get high-quality original content every time you use it.

3. Who can use AI Writing Software?

Anyone who needs to create texts for their business or website can benefit from using this software. It’s also an excellent option for freelance writers and content marketers facing writer’s block. As it’s easy and fast, even beginners can start using it immediately and see great results within minutes!

4. Can I use AI writers for everything I write?

No — AI writers are best suited for shorter pieces like headlines or product descriptions because they don’t have much time to learn about your company’s brand voice or personality.

While there are tools to churn out long-form content, you still need the human touch for longer and more research-intensive pieces like blog posts or sales copy. AI algorithms still can’t pick up on nuances like a human can.

5. What are some of the benefits of using AI Writing Software?

There are many benefits to using AI writing software. The most obvious benefit is that you no longer need to spend time creating content yourself. The software will do it for you!

Another benefit is that AI writing software allows you to create content in any niche or topic you desire. You can even target multiple niches at once! This makes it possible to scale your business quickly and easily by leveraging the power of automation while still keeping your hands on the work itself.

6. How much does it cost?

The pricing depends on the type of service you want to use. Some companies offer free trials or even freemium versions with limited credits so that you can test their services before making a purchase decision. Some companies offer lifetime discounts for repeat customers, so keep an eye out for those offers when making your choice!

7. What’s the difference between AI-powered and human-written content?

While humans are still required for high-quality content creation, AI makes scaling up your content marketing efforts easier. By automating much of the writing process – from keyword research to formatting – AI can help you create more content at a lower cost per article. In addition, this frees your team members to focus on other tasks that require their expertise (like outreach) or simply spend more time enjoying their lives!

8. What is the best AI Writer?

The best AI writer depends on what you want it to do and how much you want to spend. If you’re going to write books or articles, many different programs can help you with this task. Our top pick for long-form would be Jasper .

On the other hand, if you only need help with short-form content such as blog posts or press releases, there may not be any need for an AI writer because these documents don’t require as much work or effort from the user. In that case, you might want to use tools like Copy.ai , Rytr , and more.

9. Can I use AI Writing Software to replace my human writers?

No, AI writing software isn’t meant to replace human writers. It’s designed to work alongside them, helping them create more engaging and relevant content for their audiences. You’ll still need human writers who can add style and personality to your content.

Over to You!

Do you find writing to be an exhausting activity? If yes, you would want to try one of the AI Writing Software tools we suggested above. These are some of the best AI writing tools specially developed to boost creativity, motivation, and productivity.

There’s room for experimentation with AI-generated content as long as you can recognize where specific tools are lacking and how to incorporate that into your work. Ultimately, the future of AI writing assistant software will mean ever-more versatile tools for writers, so don’t be shy about testing the waters.

Watch now.

Natalie Monbiot, head of strategy at synthetic media company Hour One, dislikes the word “deepfakes.”

“Deepfake implies unauthorized use of synthetic media and generative artificial intelligence — we are authorized from the get-go,” she told VentureBeat.

She described the Tel Aviv- and New York-based Hour One as an AI company that has also “built a legal and ethical framework for how to engage with real people to generate their likeness in digital form.”

Authorized versus unauthorized. It’s an important delineation in an era when deepfakes, or synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else’s likeness, has gotten a boatload of bad press — not surprisingly, given deepfakes’ longstanding connection to revenge porn and fake news. The term “deepfake” can be traced to a Reddit user in 2017 named “deepfakes” who, along with others in the community, shared videos, many involving celebrity faces swapped onto the bodies of actresses in pornographic videos.

And deepfake threats are looming, according to a recent research paper from Eric Horvitz, Microsoft’s chief science officer. These include interactive deepfakes, that offer the illusion of talking to a real person, and compositional deepfakes, with bad actors creating many deepfakes to compile a “synthetic history.”

Most recently, news about celebrity deepfakes has proliferated. There’s the Wall Street Journal coverage of Tom Cruise, Elon Musk and Leonardo DiCaprio deepfakes appearing unauthorized in ads, as well as rumors about Bruce Willis signing away the rights to his deepfake likeness (not true).

The business side of the deepfake debate

But there is another side to the deepfake debate, say several vendors that specialize in synthetic media technology. What about authorized deepfakes used for business video production?

Most use cases for deepfake videos, they claim, are fully authorized. They may be in enterprise business settings — for employee training, education and ecommerce, for example. Or they may be created by users such as celebrities and company leaders who want to take advantage of synthetic media to “outsource” to a virtual twin.

The idea, in these cases, is to use synthetic media — in the form of virtual humans — to tackle the expensive, complex and unscalable challenges of traditional video production, especially at a time when the hunger for video content seems insatiable. Hour One, for example, claims to have made 100,000 videos over the past three and a half years, with customers including language-learning leader Berlitz and media companies such as NBC Universal and DreamWorks.

At a moment when generative AI has become part of the mainstream cultural zeitgeist, the future looks bright for enterprise use cases of deepfakes. Forrester recently released its top 2023 AI predictions, one of which is that 10% of Fortune 500 enterprises will generate content with AI tools. The report mentioned startups such as Hour One and Synthesia which “are using AI to accelerate video content generation.”

Another report predicts that in the next five to seven years, as much as 90% of digital media could be synthetically generated.

“That sounded very bullish … probably even to me,” said Monbiot. “But as the technology matures and massive players are getting into this space, we’re seeing disruption.”

The business side is a “hugely under-appreciated” part of the deepfakes debate, insists Victor Riparbelli, CEO of London-based Synthesia, which describes itself as an “AI video creation company.” Founded in 2017, it has more than 15,000 customers, a team of 135 and is “growing in double-digits every month.” Among its clients are fast-food giants including McDonald’s, research company Teleperformance and global advertising holding company WPP.

“It’s very interesting how the lens has been very narrow on all the bad things you could do with this technology,” Riparbelli said. “I think what we’ve seen is just more and more interest in this and more and more use cases.”

A living video that you can always edit

It’s difficult to access quality content and most businesses don’t have the skills to enable high-grade content creation, said Monbiot.

“Most businesses don’t have people that have any skills that enable content creation, especially high-grade content creation featuring actual talent, and they also don’t have the ability to edit videos or have these kinds of resources in-house,” she explained. Hour One is a no-code platform, so even users with no prior skills in creating content can select from a range of virtual humans or become one themselves.

Berlitz, one of Hour One’s first enterprise clients, needed to digitally transform after 150 years offering classroom learning. “To keep the instructor in the content, they do live videoconferencing, but that doesn’t really scale,” Monbiot said. “Even if they had all the production resources in the world, the cost and the investment and the management of all of those files is just insane.” She added that with AI, the content can be continually updated and refreshed. Now, Berlitz has over 20,000 videos in different languages created with Hour One.

Meanwhile, Synthesia said its AI is trained on real actors. It offers the actors’ images and voices as virtual characters clients can choose from to create training, learning, compliance and marketing videos. The actors are paid per video that’s generated with them.

For enterprise clients, this becomes a “living video” that they can always go back to and edit, Riparbelli explained.

Video by Synthesia

“I think we actually work for almost all the biggest fast-food chains in the world by now,” he said. “They need to train hundreds of thousands of people every single year, on everything … how to stay safe at work, how to deal with a customer complaint, how to operate the deep fryer.”

Before, he said, a company might record a few videos, but they would be very high-level and evergreen. All other training would likely be via PowerPoint slides or PDFs. “That isn’t a great way of training, especially not the younger generation,” he said. Instead, they now create video content — to replace not the original video shoots, but the text options.

Authorization agreements are key

Hour One guides users through the process to get the highest-quality video capture in front of a green screen. The base footage becomes the training data for the AI.

“We basically create a digital twin of that person — for example, a CEO,” said Monbiot. “The CEO would sign an agreement allowing us to take the footage and create a virtual twin.” Another portion of the agreement would specify who is authorized to create content with the virtual twin.

“We want people to have a very positive, comfortable, pleasant experience with our virtual human content,” she said. “If people feel a little confused or uneasy, that creates distrust, and that’s very antithetical to why we do what we do.”

According to Synthesia, this kind of authorization is common in all kinds of licensing agreements that already exist.

“Kim Kardashian has literally licensed her likeness to app developers to build a game that grossed billions of dollars,” said Riparbelli. “Every actor or celebrity licenses their likeness.”

Offering influencers their images at scale

One synthetic media company, Deepcake, is leaning less into the enterprise space and more into the business of authorized deepfakes used by celebrities and influencers for brand endorsements. For example, the company created a “digital twin” of Bruce Willis to be used in an advertisement for Russian telecom company MegaFon. This led to the rumor that Deepcake owns the rights to Willis’ digital twin (which they do not).

“We work directly with stars with talent management agencies, to develop digital twins ready to be put into any type of content, like commercials for TikTok,” said CEO Maria Chmir. “This is a new way to produce the content without classic assets like constantly searching the locations and a very long and expensive post-production process.”

There are also fully-synthesized people who can become brand ambassadors for a few dozen dollars, she added. Users simply enter the text that these characters have to say.

“Of course you can’t clone charisma and make a person improvise, but we’re working on that,” she said.

The future of authorized deepfakes

Synthesia says it is adding emotions and gestures into its videos over the coming months. Hour One recently released 3D environments to create a “truly immersive” experience.

“If you think of the maturity of the AI technology, every time we move up that scale, we unlock more use cases,” said Riparbelli. “So next year, I think we’ll see a lot of marketing content, like Facebook ads. We’re just generally going to see a lot less text and a lot more video and audio into communication we consume every day.”

The enterprise use cases around synthetic media “deepfakes” are just beginning, said Monbiot, who added: “But this economy has already begun.”",Why authorized deepfakes are big business,https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-authorized-deepfakes-are-big-business/
20,Appen’s latest State of AI Report reveals advances in helping enterprises overcome barriers to sourcing and preparing their data.,artificial intelligence,08/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_350476919-e1513916353327.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"To further strengthen our commitment to providing industry-leading coverage of data technology, VentureBeat is excited to welcome Andrew Brust and Tony Baer as regular contributors. Watch for their articles in the Data Pipeline.

Quality data is at the heart of the success of enterprise artificial intelligence (AI). And accordingly, it remains the main source of challenges for companies that want to apply machine learning (ML) in their applications and operations.

The industry has made impressive advances in helping enterprises overcome the barriers to sourcing and preparing their data, according to Appen’s latest State of AI Report. But there is still a lot more to be done at different levels, including organization structure and company policies.

The costs of data

The enterprise AI life cycle can be divided into four stages: Data sourcing, data preparation, model testing and deployment, and model evaluation.

Advances in computing and ML tools have helped automate and accelerate tasks such as training and testing different ML models. Cloud computing platforms make it possible to train and test dozens of different models of different sizes and structures simultaneously. But as machine learning models grow in number and size, they will require more training data.

Event Intelligent Security Summit Learn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies on December 8. Register for your free pass today. Register Now

Unfortunately, obtaining training data and annotating still requires considerable manual effort and is largely application specific. According to Appen’s report, “lack of sufficient data for a specific use case, new machine learning techniques that require greater volumes of data, or teams don’t have the right processes in place to easily and efficiently get the data they need.”

“High-quality training data is required for accurate model performance; and large, inclusive datasets are expensive,” Appen’s chief product officer Sujatha Sagiraju told VentureBeat. “However, it’s important to note that valuable AI data can increase the chances of your project going from pilot to production; so, the expense is needed.”

ML teams can start with prelabeled datasets, but they will eventually need to collect and label their own custom data to scale their efforts. Depending on the application, labeling can become extremely expensive and labor-intensive.

In many cases, companies have enough data, but they can’t deal with quality issues. Biased, mislabeled, inconsistent or incomplete data reduces the quality of ML models, which in turn harms the ROI of AI initiatives.

“If you train ML models with bad data, model predictions will be inaccurate,” Sagiraju said. “To ensure their AI works well in real-world scenarios, teams must have a mix of high-quality datasets, synthetic data and human-in-the-loop evaluation in their training kit.”

The gap between data scientists and business leaders

According to Appen, business leaders are much less likely than technical staff to consider data sourcing and preparation as the main challenges of their AI initiatives. “There are still gaps between technologists and business leaders when understanding the greatest bottlenecks in implementing data for the AI lifecycle. This results in misalignment in priorities and budget within the organization,” according to the Appen report.

“What we know is that some of the biggest bottlenecks for AI initiatives lie in lack of technical resources and executive buy-in,” Sagiraju said. “If you take a look at these categories, you see that the data scientists, machine learning engineers, software developers and executives are dispersed across different areas, so it’s not hard to imagine a lack of aligned strategy due to conflicting priorities between the various teams within the organization.”

The variety of people and roles involved in AI initiatives makes it hard to achieve this alignment. From the developers managing the data, to the data scientists dealing with on-the-ground issues, and the executives making strategic business decisions, all have different goals in mind and therefore different priorities and budgets.

However, Sagiraju sees that the gap is slowly narrowing year over year when it comes to understanding the challenges of AI. And this is because organizations are better understanding the importance of high-quality data to the success of AI initiatives.

“The emphasis on how important data — especially high-quality data that match with application scenarios — is to the success of an AI model has brought teams together to solve these challenges,” Sagiraju said.

Promising trends in machine learning

Data challenges are not new to the field of applied ML. But as ML models grow bigger and data becomes more abundantly available, there is a need to find scalable solutions to assemble quality training data.

Fortunately, a few trends are helping companies overcome some of these challenges, and Appen’s AI Report shows that the average time spent in managing and preparing data is trending down.

One example is automated labeling. For example, object detection models require the bounding boxes of each object in the training examples to be specified, which takes considerable manual effort. Automated and semi-automated labeling tools use a deep learning model to process the training examples and predict the bounding boxes. The automated labels are not perfect, and a human labeler must review and adjust them, but they speed up the process significantly. In addition, the automated labeling system can be further trained and improved as it receives feedback from human labelers.

“While many teams start off with manually labeling their datasets, more are turning to time-saving methods to partially automate the process,” Sagiraju said.

At the same time, there is a growing market for synthetic data. Companies use artificially generated data to complement the data they collect from the real world. Synthetic data is especially useful in applications where obtaining real-world data is costly or dangerous. An example is self-driving car companies, which face regulatory, safety and legal challenges in obtaining data from real roads.

“Self-driving cars require incredible amounts of data to be safe and prepared for anything once they hit the road, but some of the more complex data is not readily available,” Sagiraju said. “Synthetic data allows practitioners to account for edge cases or dangerous scenarios like accidents, crossing pedestrians and emergency vehicles to effectively train their AI models. Synthetic data can create instances to train data when there isn’t enough human-sourced data. It’s critical in filling in the gaps.”

At the same time, the evolution of the MLops market is helping companies tackle many challenges of the machine learning pipeline, including labeling and versioning datasets; training, testing, and comparing different ML models; deploying models at scale and keeping track of their performance; and gathering fresh data and updating the models over time.

But as ML plays a greater role in enterprises, one thing that will become more important is human control.

“Human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluations are imperative to delivering accurate, relevant information and avoiding bias,” Sagiraju said. “Despite what many believe about humans actually taking a backseat in AI training, I think we’ll see a trend towards more HITL evaluations in an effort to empower responsible AI, and have more transparency about what organizations are putting into their models to ensure models perform well in the real world.”",Why data remains the greatest challenge for machine learning projects,https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-data-remains-the-greatest-challenge-for-machine-learning-projects/

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo















NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Roger Ng, the former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) banker convicted for helping loot Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, on Friday sued the government's star witness Tim Leissner for more than $130 million, alleging fraud.

In a complaint filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, Ng accused his former boss of repeatedly lying in order to steal his investments in energy drink maker Celsius Holdings (CELH.O) and artificial intelligence company Sentient Technologies.

The complaint said Leissner, a former Goldman partner, stole Ng's money to cover his own defense costs in a related criminal case where he pleaded guilty in 2018, while depriving Ng of funds to defend himself and appeal his conviction.

""Ng is in the unimaginable position of having to defend himself against allegations made by the person who defrauded him and who stole the money that plaintiff Ng needs to defend against those same allegations,"" the complaint said.

Leissner's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Ng, the former head of investment banking for Goldman Sachs Malaysia, said Leissner's thefts included a $1.25 million Celsius stake now worth more than $130 million, plus $1 million intended to buy half of Leissner's interest in Sentient.

He said it wasn't until May 2021 when Leissner and his wife, the model and entrepreneur Kimora Lee Simmons, were sued by Simmons' former husband, record executive Russell Simmons, that he learned Leissner had diverted the Celsius investment.

In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay $2.9 billion and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge, to settle probes into the looting of billions of dollars from 1MDB and payment of bribes to win business for the Wall Street bank.

A federal jury in Brooklyn convicted Ng in April of conspiring to violate an anti-bribery law and commit money laundering.

Ng faces up to 30 years in prison. He and Leissner are scheduled to be sentenced in mid-February.

Jho Low, a Malaysian financier and suspected mastermind of the looting, was also indicted in Brooklyn and remains at large.

22,Both Nvidia and Intel’s Habana Labs reported performance gains with the MLPerf 2.1 benchmark in training machine learning models.,artificial intelligence,09/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/machine-learning-challenges.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

MLCommons is out today with its latest set of machine learning (ML) MLPerf benchmarks, once again showing how hardware and software for artificial intelligence (AI) are getting faster.

MLCommons is a vendor-neutral organization that aims to provide standardized testing and benchmarks to help evaluate the state of ML software and hardware. Under the MLPerf testing name, MLCommons collects different ML benchmarks multiple times throughout the year. In September, the MLPerf Inference results were released, showing gains in how different technologies have improved inference performance.

Today, the new MLPerf benchmarks being reported include the Training 2.1 benchmark, which is for ML training; HPC 2.0 for large systems including supercomputers; and Tiny 1.0 for small and embedded deployments.

“The key reason why we’re doing benchmarking is to drive transparency and measure performance,” David Kanter, executive director of MLCommons, said during a press briefing. “This is all predicated on the key notion that once you can actually measure something, you can start thinking about how you would improve it.”

How the MLPerf training benchmark works

Looking at the training benchmark in particular, Kanter said that MLPerf isn’t just about hardware, it’s about software too.

In ML systems, models need to first be trained on data in order to operate. The training process benefits from accelerator hardware, as well as optimized software.

Kanter explained that the MLPerf Training benchmark starts with a predetermined dataset and a model. Organizations then train the model to hit a target quality threshold. Among the primary metrics that MLPerf Training benchmark captures is time to train.

“When you look at the results, and this goes for any submission — whether it’s training, tiny, HPC or inference — all of the results are submitted to say something,” Kanter said. “Part of this exercise is figuring out what that something they say is.”

The metrics can identify relative levels of performance and also serve to highlight improvement over time for both hardware and software.

John Tran, senior director of deep learning libraries and hardware architecture at Nvidia and chair of MLPerf Training at MLCommons, highlighted the fact that there were a number of software-only submissions for the latest benchmark.

“I find it continually interesting how we have so many software-only submissions and they don’t necessarily need help from the hardware vendors,” Tran said. “I think that’s great and is showing the maturity of the benchmark and usefulness to people.”

Intel and Habana Labs push training forward with Gaudi2

The importance of software was also highlighted by Jordan Plawner, sr. director of AI products at Intel. During the MLCommons press call, Plawner explained what he sees as the difference between ML inference and training workloads in terms of hardware and software.

“Training is a distributed-workload problem,” Plawner said. “Training is more than just hardware, more than just the silicon; it’s the software, it’s also the network and running distributed-class workloads.”

In contrast, Plawner said that ML inference can be a single-node issue that doesn’t have the same distributed aspects, which provides a lower barrier to entry for vendor technologies than ML training.

In terms of results, Intel is well represented on the latest MLPerf Training benchmarks with its Gaudi2 technology. Intel acquired Habana Labs and its Gaudi technology for $2 billion in 2019 and have helped to advance the company’s capabilities in recent years.

The most advanced silicon from Habana Labs is now the Gaudi2 system, which was announced in May. The latest Gaudi2 results show gains over the first set of benchmarks that Habana Labs reported with the MLPerf Training update in June. According to Intel, Gaudi2 improved by 10% for time-to-train in TensorFlow for both BERT and ResNet-50 models.

Nvidia H100 hops past predecessor

Nvidia is also reporting strong gains for its technologies in the latest MLPerf Training benchmarks.

Testing results for Nvidia’s Hopper-based H100 with MLPerf Training show significant gains over the prior generation A100-based hardware. In an Nvidia briefing call discussing the MLCommons results, Dave Salvator, director of AI, benchmarking and cloud at Nvidia, said that the H100 provides 6.7 times more performance than the first A100 submission had for the same benchmarks several years ago. Salvator said that a key part of what makes the H100 perform so well is the integrated transformer engine that is part of the Nvidia Hopper chip architecture.

While H100 is now Nvidia’s leading hardware for ML training, that’s not to say the A100 hasn’t improved its MLPerf Training results as well.

“The A100 continues to be a really compelling product for training, and over the last couple of years we’ve been able to scale its performance by more than two times from software optimizations alone,” Salvator said.

Overall, whether it’s with new hardware or continued software optimizations, Salvator expects there will be a steady stream of performance improvements for ML training in the months and years to come.

“AI’s appetite for performance is unbounded, and we continue to need more and more performance to be able to work with growing datasets in a reasonable amount of time,” Salvator said.

The need to be able to train a model faster is critical for a number of reasons, including the fact that training is an iterative process. Data scientists often need to train and then retrain models in order to get the desired results.

“That ability to train faster makes all the difference in not only being able to work with larger networks, but being able to employ them faster and get them doing work for you in generating value,” Salvator said.",Nvidia and Intel show machine learning performance gains on latest MLPerf Training 2.1 results,https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-and-intel-show-machine-learning-performance-gains-on-latest-mlperf-training-2-1-results/
23,Iterable just released a suite of tools to enhance SMS marketing using AI.,artificial intelligence,10/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/send-sms.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

Face it: We live on our phones. By one estimate, we check our screens on average once every four minutes (that we admit, anyway).

In fact, more than half of Americans have never gone longer than 24 hours without their cell phones, nearly half say their phone is their most valuable possession — and more than a third would even choose their phone over their pets.

It’s no doubt that we’re in a mobile-first world. So, it’s critical that brands be proactive and tactical in reaching them via the channel they most use — and prefer, said Andrew Boni, CEO and founder of cross-channel marketing platform, Iterable.

To help marketers reach and engage with customers through their phones, Iterable today released a suite of new features, including Iterable SMS, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered channel optimization and custom send control.

Event Intelligent Security Summit Learn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies on December 8. Register for your free pass today. Register Now

“SMS is incredibly effective as a channel for certain use cases,” said Boni. “The future is definitely going to involve SMS.”

Automation: The future of marketing

AI-powered customer engagement platforms like Iterable are greatly growing in popularity. The global market for retail omnichannel commerce platforms will reach $16.9 billion by 2027, as forecasted by ReportLinker. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4% from 2020. The growth has been largely propelled by the COVID-19 crisis, according to the firm.

All told, according to Markets and Markets, the global customer engagement solutions market will grow to $32.2 billion by 2027, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 11%. The primary driver for this is reducing churn rates, the firm reports.

Companies competing for that market share include Adobe Marketo Engage, HubSpot Marketing Hub, Pega, Blueshift, Braze and MoEngage.

As Boni put it, automation is where customer communication platforms are headed.

“Brands want to be able to engage customers wherever customers are, on whatever channel customers prefer and respond to,” he said. When leveraging SMS in particular, “from a consumer standpoint, it’s just a better experience.”

The power of SMS

SMS has been shown to have a surprising 98% open rate. On top of that, this year, 70% of consumers subscribe to SMS marketing, indicating a 12% year-over-year growth in opt-in rates.

The majority of consumers (55%) are subscribed to receive texts from between one and five businesses, largely for shipping notifications, appointment/reservation reminders, special offers and promo codes.

All this makes it seem a no-brainer for marketers to connect with customers, said Boni. Still, due to the cost, complexity and limited data capabilities of the mobile channel, many have been slow to add SMS to their strategies.

He pointed out that email programs are “the easiest to get going with, the oldest channel” and have high ROI.

But SMS are highly interactive, simply for the fact that consumers are on their phones for multiple hours a day (if not all day).

“The direct nature of SMS is really exciting for brands, very straightforward for them to leverage,” said Boni. “It’s really just seeing this tremendous rise in popularity over the last couple of years.”

Automating away tedious tasks

The new capabilities announced today will be part of Iterable’s existing AI optimization suite. Using predictive analytics based on historical data and patterns will help brands determine in real time what communication channel is best to reach customers, when they should reach out, and how they can tailor channels, said Boni.

For instance, they can alert them to when an item they follow or favorited is back in stock.

“It can automate away a lot of the tedious work, a lot of the lower level minutiae that our practitioners have to do,” he said. For instance, “brands no longer need to think about picking a specific time or specific day to send an SMS.”

It is also important to be thoughtful about just how much to send, and not be “bombarding customers with various messaging,” he said. For example, if a user is a huge takeout and delivery fan, they probably won’t mind a lot of messages about promos and deals; but if it’s a mom that only used Doordash (an Iterable customer) one or two times, it makes more sense to sporadically message her.

Iterable is currently working on a future AI/ML-powered feature to help solve that particularly vexing problem, said Boni.

Ultimately, he noted, automation frees brands and marketers up to focus on higher-level goals, initiatives, strategies and campaigns, and instead focus on questions such as: “What high-level APIs do we need to be setting for Q4?”

Fishing for success

In the case of the Georgia Aquarium, using SMS helped to work out kinks in ticketing, thus greatly increasing customer satisfaction.

Previously, ticket delivery relied on an old email service provider (ESP). However, the aquarium ran into issues with delays or tickets not arriving in inboxes at all. Also, content was sometimes flat and disjointed from in-person brand experiences, said Boni.

“If you buy tickets and don’t receive them for a couple of hours, that really hampers your experience,” he said.

Now, tickets are sent via Iterable SMS, delivering tickets via a QR code. Since implementation, customer satisfaction has significantly improved: There’s been a 96% decrease in issues tracked during call center interactions and social media monitoring. Also, the venue has seen close to a 4% increase in customer transactions and a 2.5% increase in average order value.

“The power of providing an SMS channel for our guests is immense,” said Josh Cherfoli, senior director of marketing and digital engagement at Georgia Aquarium. “It allows us to engage the guests when and how they would like to receive information, while providing a seamless experience for them to enjoy the aquarium without having to navigate through multiple channels.”

This feature also allows users to revert to previous published versions.

The journey to a new customer journey

Boni founded Iterable in 2013 after working for Google. He came up with the idea while working at its Mountain View, CA., headquarters and seeing the tech giant grapple with sending out marketing, messaging, product notifications, emails — and particularly SMS.

“They really struggled with sending notifications and executing on that well,” said Boni, calling it a “clunky process” with “a lot of friction, a lot of red tape.”

And, he explained, he figured that if a company like Google was experiencing issues, many other organizations must be as well.

Now, the 9-year-old series E “centaur” company has more than 1,000 customers. These include retailers, streaming services, sports leagues, ticketing services, financial services, online banks, cryptocurrency, software companies such as Zillow, Doordash, Fender, Bombas, Seat Geek, Curology and Calm.

“This release is really important and critical in a number of different ways,” said Boni. Notably, “it furthers our AI capabilities and our AI story.”",Not ‘phoning it in’: Iterable’s new tools help marketers harness the power of SMS,https://venturebeat.com/automation/not-phoning-it-in-iterables-new-tools-help-marketers-harness-the-power-of-sms/
24,Nvidia and Rescale partner to make it easier to spin up new scientific workloads and operate them more efficiently. This will also apply equally to public cloud service and private cloud infrastructure.,artificial intelligence,09/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/data_streaming2-e1634064555341.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

Nvidia and Rescale today announced several enhancements designed to simplify artificial intelligence (AI) development and optimize high-performance computing (HPC) workflows. Nvidia is powering a new AI compute recommendation engine (CRE) to replace a more manually tuned approach. It’s also integrating the Nvidia AI platform into Rescale’s HPC-as-a-service offering.

Both developments promise to make it easier to spin up new scientific workloads and operate them more efficiently. This will also apply equally to public cloud service and private cloud infrastructure.

Rescale specializes in tools for automating scientific computing workloads — a field that is ripe for disruption, since engineers may sometimes spend more time configuring experiments than running them. Earlier this year, Rescale announced tools to help refactor legacy apps to run on containers to dramatically simplify configuration and deployment.

It also announced a partnership with Nvidia in July to containerize many Nvidia workloads. The latest news builds on this partnership to automate support for Nvidia’s AI platform. This will automates the use of AI for physics, recommendation engines, simulations, medical research and more. It also applies Nvidia’s recommendation capabilities back on the HPC infrastructure itself.

AI-powered infrastructure recommendations

Spinning up scientific computing workloads requires a delicate balance involving hardware, networking, memory, software and specific configurations. Rescale and Nvidia have collaborated on what the two are billing as the world’s first AI-powered recommendation system for HPC and AI workloads. The companies claim it will assist teams with balancing decisions about architectures, geographic regions, price, compliance and sustainability objectives. Nvidia and Rescale trained the system using data from more than 100 million production HPC workloads.

“Prior to compute recommendation engines, the primary way we provided compute optimization was through our solution architects working with the customers guided by our internal benchmarks library,” Edward Hsu, Rescale’s chief product officer told VentureBeat. “With the compute recommendation engine, we are bringing unprecedented levels of automation and insights by applying machine learning [ML] to infrastructure telemetry and job performance data.”

With the new engine, users choose a workload and Rescale will suggest a computing architecture to provide the best performance. Hsu claims that these recommendations are 90% accurate. Further optimization will also need to account for the models, which can impact both performance and the applications they run on.

Rescale is also integrating the Nvidia Base Command Platform software to orchestrate workloads across clouds and on-premises Nvidia DGX systems.

Expanding the reach and utility of AI

The two companies are also partnering to support the Nvidia AI Enterprise Software Suite on top of the Rescale platform. Soon, this will help automate workflows using tools like Isaac for programming robots, Nemo for languages, Merlin for recommendations, Morpheus for Security and Holoscan for medical AI. Nvidia Modulus, a physics-ML framework, is also now available on Rescale — which will play a key role in helping companies create faster digital twins for simulating the physical properties of products and equipment.

Existing AI frameworks on Rescale, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, are more general purpose. Modulus is a programmable physics-informed neural network that can create models that the company claims run hundreds or thousands of times faster than traditional simulation techniques. The Modulus support allows teams to more easily apply AI to emulate physics-based simulations at much higher performance and lower cost

“As we see the engineers move from intuition-based engineering towards AI-assisted engineering, bringing together the tools for computational engineering and artificial intelligence will be critical to help companies accelerate new product innovation,” Hsu said.","Nvidia, Rescale team to enhance AI cloud automation and HPC-as-a-service",https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-rescale-team-to-enhance-ai-cloud-automation-and-hpc-as-a-service/

28,Cresta's conversational AI tools will be integrated with Zoom's portal to improve customer service.,artificial intelligence,09/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1370249712-1-e1658347263596.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

Zoom calls are no longer just for work meetings and family reunions. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) leader, Cresta, wants to make them a channel for customer service too. The company is integrating its AI tools with Zoom to improve the service when customers contact companies through a video call.

The integration effectively allows businesses using Zoom to activate Cresta directly through Zoom’s interface. In essence, Zoom is leveraging its customer portfolio to sell other services and Cresta is making it simpler for companies to adopt its technology.

The move is unsurprising as Zoom was one of the investors in Cresta’s $80 million series C round led by Tiger Global back in March. The deal catapulted Cresta to unicorn status with a valuation of $1.6 billion. This also comes in the heels of Zoom’s plans to continue expanding its platform toward new solutions for marketing and sale teams.

Customer services powered by AI

Cresta uses AI to improve the work of customer service in several ways that will all be integrated into the Zoom portal. Its tool, the Cresta Agent Assist, offers suggestions to live humans using customer records and knowledge of what’s worked in the past. The suggested responses handle both strategic challenges like steering the customer to the best product, while also managing tactical details like checking grammar and deploying stock answers that are already edited.

“[Cresta’s tool] enables companies who purchase the Zoom Contact Center, along with Cresta, to use real-time transcription to guide the agent in their engagement process with the customer to do things such as sell more though better adherence to the company’s sales playbook, or to more quickly resolve customer issues.” explained Scott Kolman, the CMO at Cresta. “All of this is invisible to the end customer.”

Cresta claims that its platforms can boost several metrics. Customer satisfaction ratings (CSAT) increased by 15% in the company’s tests. Startup and training time for new agents was cut by a factor of three. The agents are said to save three to five hours in an average week by letting Cresta’s tools do repetitive tasks.

“Cresta’s AI-solutions make agents faster and enable self-service automation, so businesses can finally improve [customer experiences] on every interaction while also improving operational efficiency.” continued Kolman.

Conversational AI competition is heating up

A number of companies are actively trying to automate this space because customer service inquiries are expensive and sometimes fraught with political minefields with many dangers for missteps. These are one of the first places where AI scientists looked to apply their work in natural language processing (NLP).

The tools for creating the bots are now fairly common in the front lines of businesses, and now much of the effort is devoted to finding the best channel for delivering the technology — which is reflected in Cresta’s announcement today. The creators of tools sold in market sectors like customer data platforms, customer relations managers and data management platforms all want to help companies curate their interactions with customers and they’ve been integrating AI in different ways at different layers.

At the same time, some developers are shipping more basic tools that other developers can integrate into their own applications. AWS markets its tool, Lex, for creating virtual agents and voice assistants. It also offers other tools like Polly that can turn text into speech and Transcribe to create vocal interfaces. For companies that want a more complete and turnkey solution, there’s AWS Connect, a tool that integrates AI and machine learning (ML) with their bots to provide interactive chat sessions for customers. Competitors like Microsoft and Google offer similar options.

Cresta’s decision to market its tools directly through Zoom is a good indicator of how these tools are becoming more of a commodity. Instead of being a product on its own, the company is blending into the feature set of other platforms.

“The Cresta platform complements the Zoom Contact Center offering,” explained Kentis Gopalla, head of ecosystem for Zoom Phone and Contact Center. “The combination of Cresta’s real-time capabilities with Zoom Contact Center helps our customers improve agent productivity by providing additional insights, and deliver better customer experiences. This integration makes it easy to offer our solutions in a secure way without complex IT work, so customers can focus on business value.”",Zoom adds Cresta’s conversational AI to help customer service agents,https://venturebeat.com/ai/zoom-adds-crestas-conversational-ai-to-help-customer-service-agents/

The broker to Hollywood's elite is leaving the embattled brokerage Compass for Christie's.

He said he doesn't think Compass' tech is essential to his work and he wants international reach.

Aaron Kirman, the Los Angeles real-estate agent known for having star-studded clients like Rihanna and Orlando Bloom, said on Tuesday that he's leaving Compass for a new partnership with Christie's.

Kirman leads 160 agents in what RealTrends, a company that ranks real-estate brokers, has called a ""mega team."" RealTrends identified the Aaron Kirman Group as the top-grossing mega team from Compass last year, with an annual sales volume of $1.1 billion. Kirman said sales so far this year have exceeded 2021's sales despite the down market, totaling $1.6 billion.

Kirman is one of several high-profile brokers who've left Compass , which has had a tumultuous year.

It's common for real-estate brokerages to struggle during a cooling housing market, when fewer people are buying and selling homes. But the company posted a $494 million loss in 2021 during a historically hot real-estate market .

This year, Compass has laid off 1,000 people in two rounds as its stock price has fallen by 60%. The layoffs did not impact agents; in fact, the company said when reporting third-quarter earnings that the average number of agents increased 15% from this time last year. Compass reported a $154 million loss in the third quarter.

""It's no secret that Compass is in a difficult situation,"" Kirman said, though he added that he believes the company will eventually succeed again.

""We wish Aaron all the best in starting his own company and look forward to continuing to work with him,"" a Compass spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Insider.

Some of the cuts Compass made were to its much-touted proprietary technology that agents use to market properties and generate leads. Compass used that platform —along with incentives to agents like cash bonuses, equity in the company, and generous commission splits — to lure brokers from other established firms.

But Kirman said he felt Compass was always a traditional brokerage, not a tech giant.

""At the end of the day, it is a real-estate company,"" he told Insider. ""They have many stores and many offices with a layer of technology.""

Kirman said his team uses in-house technology that harnesses artificial intelligence to track housing-market moves. ""We have the ability to see what's happening in any given city in real time to be able to predict future marketplaces,"" he said.

Kirman said he's partnering with Christie's International Real Estate which has offices in 48 countries, to expand the team's reach outside Southern California.

""What we noticed is people who are buying luxury houses often buy many — from London to Hong Kong to Los Angeles to New York,"" he said.",A Los Angeles superagent with a team of 160 that's sold $1.6 billion in real estate this year is leaving Compass: 'It's no secret that Compass is in a difficult situation',https://www.businessinsider.com/broker-aaron-kirman-leaving-compass-for-christies-2022-11

We’ve all heard how A.I. is creating new opportunities for small business owners.

James Clift, CEO and Founder of Durable sits down with Shawn Hessinger, the Executive Editor of Small Business Trends, to show us how you can use an AI website builder to generate a website for your new service business in just 30 seconds.

AI Website Builders for Small Business

Don’t believe us? Read the edited transcript from this latest episode of Small Biz in :15 and see for yourself.

You can see this full conversation in the player above or listen to it on SoundCloud below.

Shawn Hessinger: What exactly does Durable do for small business owners, especially solopreneurs?

James Clift: Our goal at Durable is to allow anybody to turn their skills into a business in the shortest possible time. So essentially, we’re like a business in a box for a solo business owner.

So, if you have a skill you want to sell as a business, we give you a website, invoicing CRM, financial tools…essentially everything you need to run your whole business under one login is our goal.

Shawn Hessinger: When we talk about AI, what does that mean in non-technical terms?

James Clift: What we’re using A.I. for is to build the first version of your website for you in 30 seconds, so you don’t have to think about it. All you have to do is give three inputs: your location, your name and your business category. Then, we’ll build a website for you.

And then from there, you can regenerate it so you can try as many times as you want to get something you really like, or you can just create an account and then edit it from there.

We found that speed is really important and just giving someone something to look at. And what we’re giving you is a way faster to launch your business.

Shawn Hessinger: Let me back up on something. You said you need three things.

James Clift: Location, the name of your business, and we give you some names as well that you can choose from.

And then just your business category … the kind of business that you’re in.

Shawn Hessinger: Well, we’ve got to see this. Can you give us a little demonstration of how building a website in 30 seconds works?

James Clift: Essentially, we’re building a Web site right now. We’re picking images, we’re adding services, adding a lead capture form and writing a paragraph about the business. Then you’re done. So, you’ve got a website here with images, text, a list of different services, a Contact Form and then an About Us page.

You can rebuild, you can restyle, change your colors, change your font pairing and more. You can try a bunch of different businesses here. You can also say, “Hey, I don’t like the subtext.” We will generate it again for you. It’s just giving people something to work with, right? Instead of trying to figure it out from scratch. That’s the basics of the AI generator and platform.

Shawn Hessinger: Can you give us a little tour around everything?

James Clift: Yes. You see, once you’ve built your site, you’ve essentially got a full platform. You’ve got a CRM to keep track of all your customers in one place. So, you’ve got your money accounts, your account balance. You can set a monthly revenue goal and get a list of all your invoices here. And then you can link to your website’s analytics, basically everything you need to run your business under one login. It’s quite a robust CRM.

We fully sync with your emails and all your communication with customers is in one place. You’ve got your customer profile here, you’ve got your customer ratings, you get notes about your customers…invoicing, there are financial tools, and we issue credit cards for your business expenses.

See Also: Best Tools to Create Great Images for Your Small Business Website or Blog

In addition, you can automatically track your expenses and tie that to your invoicing. For marketing automation tools, we’re building some cool stuff around our generation as well, so you can create the copy for your business ads and your profiles on Google my business and stuff like that. But it’s supposed to be the one place to run your whole business for a solo business owner.

Shawn Hessinger: Can you give us an idea of the variety of work that can be produced?

James Clift: Sure! You can have your own images, and we’ve got different options for banner headers. For example, we’ve got one customer here an executive recruiter. So, it looks really different than the other sites, right? But yeah, you can really customize kind of how you want the site to look.

As another example, here’s a backcountry skiing guide. I think the variety is one thing that’s super interesting to us, and I think the way to narrow it down is by asking are you delivering a service and are you a solo entrepreneur? And that’s really who we’re focused on.

Because if you have a big team, you’ll obviously hire someone and pay thousands of dollars for a website. Otherwise, it just takes too long, and it’s a tedious process. So yeah, we’re trying to make it really easy and really flexible for anybody to start and grow their business using us.

Shawn Hessinger: You mentioned a CRM and other things; you’ll have to pay additional for that, correct?

James Clift: The entire AI website suite will be free. We’re working on pricing, but the rest of the tools to run your entire business will probably be less than $50 a month.

We want to prove that you can actually go get a customer, make some money, and then after that, you can start investing in a lot of the tooling that you will need eventually.

Shawn Hessinger: What about SEO and usability?

James Clift: We’ve baked all that in, as well. My last business primarily grew through SEO. So that’s important to me to ensure that our websites do the same. We’ve also used AI for a lot of that.

So, generating the things that are important with SEO and the narrowing of the focus is captured. So, are you what type of business? And in what city? Most of our services are local, so that’s the best way to start.

Shawn Hessinger: How is the financial information represented there? You just get it in as you make sales?

James Clift: All the financial stuff is automated. Therefore, if you’re using our invoicing tool and you’re recording your revenue, that will go into your financial dashboard and then your expenses if you’re using your durable credit card. Basically, all your revenue goes into your financial account. You can either pay that out to a personal bank account or keep that in there and use that credit card or that business debit card for your expenses.

As far as our invoicing goes, you can accept credit cards, Apple Pay and then a wire-to-wire transfer, along with ACH…and then the financial account which is basically a checking account that holds your money. And then you have a debit card that lets you spend it. It replaces your business banking account essentially and is a lot less expensive and easier to use.

Shawn Hessinger: Would the Durable process work with an eCommerce business? Because you’re not really invoicing somebody for that.

James Clift: Correct, but we don’t work with eCommerce businesses. Our goal is service businesses only, and we want to stay focused on that.

Shopify is pretty good at eCommerce, and we’re trying to do that but for services.

Shawn Hessinger: As somebody sitting and watching this video, how do I get started? I mean, how simple is it? What do I do first?

James Clift: Go to Durable.co, press the build your free website button, generate your site with AI in 30 seconds, regenerate it if you want and then sign up, edit it, tweak it, share it with a few friends.

Hopefully have a customer in your CRM the next day and you’ve got yourself a business.

[Read More]",artificial intelligence,09/11/2022,https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2022/11/AIBias.jpg,petapixel,"A new tool is allowing people to see how certain word combinations produce biased results in artificial intelligence (AI) text-to-image generators.

Hosted on Hugging Face, the “Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer” was launched in late October.

According to Motherboard, the simple tool lets users combine descriptive terms and see firsthand how the AI model maps them to racial and gender stereotypes.

What's the difference between these two groups of people? Well, according to Stable Diffusion, the first group represents an 'ambitious CEO' and the second a 'supportive CEO'.

I made a simple tool to explore biases ingrained in this model: https://t.co/l4lqt7rTQj pic.twitter.com/xYKA8w3N8N — Dr. Sasha Luccioni 💻🌎✨ (@SashaMTL) October 31, 2022

For example, the Stable Diffusion Explorer shows using the word “CEO” on an AI image generator almost always exclusively generates images of men.

However, there is a difference in terms of what the AI image generator thinks an “ambitious CEO” looks like compared to a “supportive CEO.” The first description will get the generator to show a diverse host of men in various black and blue suits. The latter descriptor displays an equal number of both women and men.

Pretty cool tool. Well thought out.

The bias is shocking.

Profession: Cook (1st group I picked ""self-confident"" as the adjective, for the 2nd group I picked compassionate)

In case it is not evident 1st group is all male, 2nd group is all female. https://t.co/RhBjp2V2VP pic.twitter.com/Np67q0YN7R — deepamuralidhar (@deepamuralidhar) November 1, 2022

Meanwhile, Twitter user @deepamuralidhar showed how the Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer reveals how a “self-confident cook” is depicted as male on AI image generators. Meanwhile a “compassionate cook” is represented as female.

AI ethics researcher for Hugging Face, Sasha Luccioni, developed the tool to show biases in the machine learning models that create images.

“When Stable Diffusion got put up on HuggingFace about a month ago, we were like oh, crap,” Luccioni tells Motherboard.

“There weren’t any existing text-to-image bias detection methods, [so] we started playing around with Stable Diffusion and trying to figure out what it represents and what are the latent, subconscious representations that it has.”

To do this, Luccioni came up with a list of 20 descriptive word pairings. Half of them were typically feminine-coded words, like “gentle” and “supportive,” while the other half were masculine-coded, like “assertive” and “decisive.” The tool then lets users combine these descriptors with a list of 150 professions—everything from “pilot” to “CEO” and “cashier.”

Human Bias

While it is impossible to fully remove human bias from human-made tools, Luccioni believes that tools like the Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer could give users an understanding of the bias in AI systems and could help researchers reverse-engineer these biases.

“The way that machine learning has been shaped in the past decade has been so computer-science focused, and there’s so much more to it than that,” Luccioni says. “Making tools like this where people can just click around, I think it will help people understand how this works.”

The subject of bias in AI image generation systems is becoming increasingly important. In April, OpenAI published a Risks and Limitations document acknowledging that their model can reinforce stereotypes. The document showed how their AI model would generate images for males for prompts like “builder” while the descriptor “flight attendant” would produce female-centric images.

HONG KONG/SYDNEY, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The fintech arm of Chinese e-commerce firm JD.Com (9618.HK) aims to win Beijing regulators' approval to list in Hong Kong as soon as the end of the year, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said, after a first attempt failed earlier this year.

JD Technology's initial public offering (IPO) would be one of the largest listings of Chinese companies in Hong Kong since a sweeping regulatory crackdown started in China two years ago, as part of which scrutiny of capital raising outside mainland China was tightened.

The revived IPO plan comes as Chinese authorities have in recent months softened their tone on cracking down on tech companies as they seek to boost an economy that has been hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The size of JD Tech's IPO has yet to be decided and could be smaller from its previous $2 billion target as demand for new share sales remains weak globally, one of the people with knowledge of the matter said. If the listing is approved, its timing remains unclear and dependent on market conditions.

There has been about $10.3 billion worth of IPOs and second listings in Hong Kong so far in 2022, just over a quarter of the $37.7 billion of deals done during the same time last year, according to Refinitiv data.

Banks have restarted to work on the float since mid-October, one of the sources said. The people with knowledge of the IPO plans declined to be identified as the information was private.

Reuters reported in May that JD Tech's original plan for a Hong Kong IPO was put on ice because it could not get regulatory approval for the deal to proceed.

JD.Com did not respond to a request for comment.

As a domestically incorporated company, JD Tech - JD.Com's fintech, cloud and artificial intelligence unit - needs approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to list offshore, including in the Chinese-controlled territory of Hong Kong.

It first applied to the CSRC in late January seeking an offshore listing, according to the regulator's website.

The CSRC's international department, the main regulator for such offshore listings, has recently been reviewing JD Tech's application again and reached out to other relevant regulators to seek their views on its business, said one of the sources.

The CSRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

JD Tech, which was hived off as a separate unit in mid-2017, had appointed several banks to work on the IPO, but progress had slowed as it failed to win regulatory approval first time around, sources have previously told Reuters.

As JD Tech seeks to advance its IPO plan, shareholders of Ant Group's consumer finance unit on Monday said the unit will more than double its registered capital to $2.62 billion - a move which could help the fintech giant move closer to the end of its regulatory-driven revamp. read more

As F1 reels under an onslaught of often poisonous online abuse between fans of different drivers, Ben Sulayem revealed that the FIA steward Silvia Bellot had recently received death threats. He also noted that other FIA staff had been “targeted” with harassment and hate posts, which he insisted was unacceptable.

“It is utterly deplorable that a volunteer such as Silvia or any of our marshals and officials, who volunteer their time to allow us to go racing, is the subject of such hatred,” he said.

Bellot is well-respected in the sport and made her debut as an F1 steward in 2011. She is also an ambassador of the FIA’s Women in Motorsport Commission. Bellot was one of the stewards at the US Grand Prix that was involved in Fernando Alonso’s controversial post-race penalty, later overturned, and was subsequently targeted with angry, threatening abuse online.

“It is totally unacceptable that our volunteers, officials and employees are subjected to this extreme abuse,” said Ben Sulayem. “Without these people there would be no racing. We have to ask ourselves, who would want to pursue becoming a top official in this environment? The reality is obvious, if this continues it will destroy our sport.” Alonso and his Alpine team condemned the way fans had behaved toward Bellot.

The FIA is to pursue a process of attempting to prevent the abuse, working with social media companies and to use artificial intelligence to remove unacceptable content from their channels in what Ben Sulayem described as a “concerted campaign”, with further details to be announced at the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

Their forthright position has been adopted after both Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen condemned the toxicity of F1 social media that has become noticeably and progressively worse this season. Hamilton was sufficiently disillusioned with the situation to state last week “we should all come off social media.”

With a long history as one of the world’s top financial capitals, this is a costly place to live.The city tied for 17th place with Helsinki, a notoriously expensive location, in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) Worldwide Cost of Living index in 2021.

The index is compiled by comparing prices in US dollars for goods and services in 173 global cities. While this is just one indication that London is a pricey place to live and work, there are plenty of others.

A 2019 survey from SpareRoom found that 33% of people aged 20 to 30 living in the city didn’t have access to a living room. Rental costs are rocketing, says property website Rightmove: in July this year, average monthly rent in London reached an all-time high of £2,257, or 11.8% higher than last year.

Then there’s inflation and the cost of goods and services to contend with. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) suggests that web-scraped supermarket data for 30 everyday grocery items indicates that the lowest-priced items have gone up by 17% in the 12 months to September 2022.

While London has long been hailed as a mecca for talent, thanks to the sheer scale of opportunities on offer plus its unrivalled access to culture and nightlife, other factors beyond the price of milk, bread, and rent are now clamouring for attention. Brexit, in particular, has reduced the size of the opportunity here with about 44% of UK-based financial services firms moving or planning to move some of their operations or staff to the EU, according to EY.

Rising layoffs among tech companies, political uncertainty — the UK is on its fifth prime minister in just six years — and a looming recession are not helping either. The ONS reported that Britain’s economy shrank in the three months to September, ushering in what is expected to be the beginning of a recession.

But despite all that, there are still plenty of opportunities. The key for workers is to focus on areas of stable growth, and careers within those sectors. Here are three sectors with high growth potential for 2023.

Cybersecurity

Following on from the UK’s initial National Cyber Security Strategy 2016 to 2021, the government launched the National Cyber Strategy 2022, which sets out a five-pillar approach to protecting and promoting the U.K.’s interests in cyberspace. The plan aims to shape its cyber sector so that it can stay ahead of adversaries, strengthen its abilities, and influence and shape tomorrow’s technologies so they are safe, secure, and open.

As a result, the U.K. is developing domain excellence in cybersecurity with companies such as BAE Systems, Clearswift, Sophos, and PwC leading the field. As we move towards an increasing level of digitization, digital security becomes increasingly important to secure our data in the first instance, and also protect it from attack.

Cybersecurity jobs are particularly prevalent in the financial and fintech sectors, but are becoming more and more common across the workforce to secure sensitive data in healthcare and education.

This essential sector doesn’t look like it is going anywhere. If you’re looking to build your career further in this sector, Citi is seeking a Head of Network Security Services in London. You’ll have end-to-end responsibilities for engineering and operations of network security services and will ensure a service-oriented organization that meets the business needs of a digital bank.

Cloud

Gartner reports that worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services is forecast to grow 20.4% this year, with spending expected to reach nearly £489 billion by 2023.

The big boom in cloud adoption was driven by the pandemic: In April 2020, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella said, “We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months.” That rapid pace has only continued as businesses first introduced remote working and now hybrid and flexible options.

As a result, this is a great area for career growth. A recent report from Public First and AWS found that digital technology could grow the UK economy by over £413 billion by 2030, which is more than twice the annual output of the UK’s manufacturing sector (£183 billion). The research also revealed that cloud computing will play an integral role in underpinning the technology stack that will enable the UK’s digital future.

Interesting jobs at companies large and small are available. Google has a Cloud Security Consultant role in its Google Cloud Professional Services division on offer in London, for example. You’ll provide advice and guidance to customers adopting Google Cloud Platform services, and work with them to design and develop cloud security architectures and solutions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

A recent study from software analytics company, SAS, assessed the AI-readiness of London’s boroughs, discovering that Camden, Westminster, and Hackney came in the top three places. The study looked at the number of AI-related jobs, R&D spend, GDP, business growth, and the number of relevant academic courses available within each area. In 2021, the city was home to 1,300 AI companies, or 65% of the entire UK AI industry ecosystem, with companies including Brainpool.ai, iTransition and Signal AI.

The government wants to make the UK a “global AI superpower” and aims to do that with its 10-year National AI Strategy, which will place a wider focus on AI and data science skills, recognizing how these can be used to increase resilience, productivity, growth, and innovation across both the private and public sectors.

If you’re looking for an AI or machine learning role in London right now, you’re in luck as any number of companies are hiring. For example, check out Amazon EU SARL which is seeking a Machine Learning Scientist. You’ll be building state-of-the-art machine learning systems for the most complex, and fastest growing transportation network in the world and focus on the development and research of machine learning solutions and algorithms for core planning systems.

[Read More]",artificial intelligence,14/11/2022,https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2022/11/AIhistorical-figures.jpg,petapixel,"A photographer has used artificial intelligence (AI) to imagine what historical figures like Al Capone, Benjamin Franklin, and Sharon Tate would look like if they were born today.

Photographer Alper Yesiltas, who is based in Istanbul, Turkey, created the hyper-realistic portraits for a project titled Thisness.

For the project, Yesiltas used AI photo enhancer software and photo editing programs to imagine what historical icons would look like if they lived in the 21st century instead of their own time.

Yesiltas used the original photos of these individuals to create modern-day portraits. With the help of AI, he reconstructs their outfits and the composition of the photo before editing the image to transform these historical legends into modernized icons.

Fifteenth-century Italian explorer, Christopher Columbus is reimagined as a contemporary male in a white t-shirt.

Meanwhile, the Founding Father of the U.S. Benjamin Franklin is depicted as a modern-day politician in a smart black suit with an American flag brooch.

New York Yankees Legend Babe Ruth is pictured in a casual sweatshirt rather than 1930s baseball attire.

Meanwhile, American Gangster Al Capone no longer wears his famous pinstriped suit. Instead, the mobster, who gained notoriety during the Prohibition era, is portrayed in chinos and a jumper.

Some of the stars depicted in Yesiltas’ portraits are instantly recognizable as modern-day sirens, while others are less obvious at first glance.

1960s actresses Audrey Hepburn and Sharon Tate are unmistakable as modern-day sirens. However, it may take a moment to identify classic Hollywood star Ginger Rogers as a casually-dressed actress in the modern age.

Yesiltas says he plans to continue adding to his Thisness project and transform other historical icons into modern-day icons.

“In general, the people I work with using artificial intelligence are the people I personally want to see the photorealistic version of or adapted to the present day,” he says.

“I think these people are indeed some of the greatest icons that ever lived, and I am very curious about them.”

This is not the first time the photographer has used AI to “resurrect” stars from the dead. Yesiltas previously used AI to show what celebrities like Princess Diana, Kurt Cobain, and John Lennon would look like if they were still alive today.

Canva, which is a free online visual communications and collaboration platform designed to make it easier for the average person to access and use design software tools, has fully launched the text-to-image option as an app inside its software which had previously been in beta for two months.

The popular creative software company joins Picsart — another major Adobe competitor — which also added a free and unlimited text-to-image generator to its app last week.

The company says that in the short time the app was in beta, Canva users created more than six million images using it, which it says shows overwhelming support for the technology.

“We’re always thinking about ways to bring the best of technology to our community to empower them to design. We envisage a world where design and visual communication is collaborative, simple and enjoyable — where bringing your imagination to life can be done with just a few clicks and where anyone, anywhere, can communicate visually,” the company says.

“Text to Image is just the beginning and we look forward to launching a suite of magic features over the coming months that will supercharge the Canva Visual Worksuite while making it easier than ever to bring your ideas to life.”

While Canva is itself an app — it can be downloaded on the Apple App Store, for example — the experience is also app-based. Canva offers a large number of add-on apps that enhance the experience, and the new Text to Image is one such app.

Just like many other text-to-image generators, Canva’s app allows users who are giving the AI a text prompt to also define a style — such as photo, drawing, 3D render, painting, pattern, or concept art — as well as add an effect to the equation.

Once an image has been created, users can “enhance the photo” with Canva’s built-in photo editor, where they can adjust image settings like depth of field, Autofocus, or apply filters.

Canva says that it has invested heavily into assuring that the system is safe to use and is especially focused on making sure it can’t be abused.

“We’ve invested heavily in safety measures that help the millions of people using our platform ‘be a good human’ and minimize the risk of our platform being used to produce unsafe content. For Text to Image this includes automated reviews of input prompts for terms that might generate unsafe imagery, and of output images for a range of categories including adult content, hate, and abuse,” the company says.

At launch, Canva does not make any copyright claim over images that are created with its Text to Image app and says that users own the images they create (subject to following the company’s terms of use). The only stipulation is that users give Canva the right to host them on its platform and to use them for marketing its products.

All intelligent life, they argue, has likely destroyed itself before reaching a sophisticated enough point in evolution to support such an encounter. And the same fate likely awaits humans unless we take action, they believe.

The “Great Filter” theory — as in “filtering out” various forms of life — argues that other civilizations, possibly several, have existed during the life of the universe. But they all destroyed themselves before they could make contact with Earth, noted the paper, “Avoiding the ‘Great Filter’: Extraterrestrial Life and Humanity’s Future in the Universe.”

The scientists fear that all intelligent life, such as humans, have deeply ingrained dysfunctions that may “snowball quickly into the Great Filter,” they wrote.

But there’s still a bit of hope for humans — provided we can learn and take steps to avoid our own extinction, noted the paper by a team of researchers based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in southern California.

“The key to humanity successfully traversing such a universal filter is… identifying [destructive] attributes in ourselves and neutralizing them in advance,” astrophysicist Jonathan Jiang and his coauthors wrote in the paper that appeared online on Oct. 23.

The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed.

Whatever seems likely to wipe out humans would conceivably also threaten intelligent life on other planets, the authors argue. The likely culprits — which could be impacted by humans or other intelligent life forms — include nuclear war, pandemic, climate change, and uncontrolled artificial intelligence, the authors note.

The trick, the biggest challenge of all, will be to work together to survive, the researchers said.

40,Bosch group is building sustainable growth through carbon neutrality efforts.,artificial intelligence,10/11/2022,https://i.insider.com/6365282dc816990018947b2c?width=1200&format=jpeg,business insider,"Bosch Group, a leading global engineering, technology, and services company based in Germany, set an ambitious target: to become the world's first fully carbon-neutral industrial enterprise.

From consumer goods, mobility solutions, industrial technology, and energy and building services, Bosch is building next-generation Internet-of-Things (IoT) products, recognizing that a very different kind of transformative process is underway: climate change. By going carbon neutral, Bosch is making a significant contribution to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The Bosch IT function is central to the group strategy around IoT, artificial intelligence, resilience, and environmental protection. After achieving its goal of becoming fully carbon neutral in 2020, the organization wanted to increase efficiency from every aspect of its operations, including the vital SAP business systems that help thousands of Bosch associates work productively every day.

To help realize this objective while simultaneously enhancing its ability to innovate, the organization looked to high-performance IBM Power servers to help deliver SAP systems to thousands of global Bosch employees.

Sustainability without sacrificing performance

Bosch is committed to energy-efficient operations by enabling even greater sustainability across its business. By moving its SAP solutions to IBM Power10 servers, Bosch is developing IoT solutions while slashing data center energy usage by 20% — taking its green strategy to the next level.

Bosch looks at every opportunity to reduce its carbon footprint, including product design, supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, and data center operations. With IBM Power servers, the organization delivered vital SAP services effectively while keeping data center power and cooling requirements to a minimum, making an important contribution to achieving full carbon neutrality.

To help equip the business with digital capabilities without exceeding its tight carbon budgets, Bosch again turned to its trusted partner, IBM. Bosch engaged a small team from its Stuttgart, Germany location to transition over 1,200 SAP systems in all 440 locations in more than 60 countries to the latest-generation IBM Power10 platform, providing even higher levels of energy efficiency while boosting performance for essential SAP workloads.

Setting the bar for secure, green data center technology that delivers energy savings

""Bosch depends on a wide range of SAP solutions running on IBM Power servers,"" said Christian Dümmler, a senior manager responsible for global SAP infrastructure at Bosch. ""Transitioning to IBM Power10 delivered performance gains of up to 75% while cutting energy consumption by 20% compared to the previous generation of servers. IBM is a true partner in our journey to run business-critical systems cost efficiently and sustainably, while still delivering outstanding performance and security.""

As its sustainability initiatives grow, Bosch is blazing a trail for other global industrial enterprises to follow. The company's global SAP solutions are crucial to underpinning these efforts — and transitioning the SAP solution infrastructure to Power10 is an essential part of its long-term IT strategy.

""Even against demanding requirements by our business users, the IBM Power10 platform is raising the bar by offering significant energy savings, enabling Bosch to perform more work with less carbon in less time,"" Dümmler said. ""From the moment we onboarded our first customer to the IBM Power E1080, we saw processing performance gains and improvements of roughly 50% in response times.""

He added that some customers remarked on how quickly their tasks were completed, and that they were surprised and satisfied with the results.

""Even if in future we average only half that improvement, this will still be a huge performance gain for every customer using SAP HANA and SAP R/3 workloads on Power10, enabling significantly greater business productivity,"" Dümmler said.

Given how complex AI is, it is hard to separate the pretenders from the real innovators.

The industry is expected to grow at 20% annually through 2029 and hit over $1 trillion in annual spending worldwide. Companies that are the leaders in AI and machine learning can capture a lot of this spending, helping their businesses grow and leading their stocks to put up great returns for shareholders.

Here are two AI stocks that look ready to make a bull run over the next decade.

1. Alphabet: Multiple AI machines working in tandem

Alphabet (GOOG 1.53%) (GOOGL 1.45%) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, and the Google Cloud platform. The technology giant is one of the premier AI companies worldwide, using it to help its search, mapping, and other functions.

CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted Google's research multiple times on Alphabet's recent earnings call, saying that the company is using AI to bring ""significant improvements to search,"" and that he thinks AI is the next big revolution after mobile phones.

Here are a few examples of how this can work in practice. With trillions upon trillions of pieces of information across Google Search, YouTube, and Google Maps, Alphabet is able to harness AI to greatly improve search results, no matter where customers start their inquiries.

This means that if, for example, you search Google for how to fix a particular device, it will bring up a YouTube tutorial that you can play to learn exactly what you need to do. As these AI models ingest more data, they will continue to improve search results, which will improve Google's customer experience.

Through Google Cloud, Alphabet's cloud infrastructure segment, the company is selling its AI capabilities to other businesses. Companies of all sizes that want to use AI but don't have the internal research capabilities (and there are very few that do) can buy Google's machine-learning products through the cloud. That's a big reason Google Cloud revenue grew 38% year over year last quarter.

With the stock down 34% this year, Alphabet has a market cap of $1.2 trillion. Over the last 12 months, it has generated $67 billion in net earnings, giving the stock a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.9, which is below the market average. For a company with such an advantage in AI and a huge opportunity to grow its business this decade, now looks like a great time to pick up shares of Alphabet.

2. Ansys: spurring innovation through simulation

Alphabet is a leader in AI for the internet, but there are multiple companies working on AI for more-physical applications like semiconductors, the space economy, and the automotive sector. Enter Ansys (ANSS 1.20%), the global leader in simulation software for research & development departments.

Ansys has dozens of software products that cover a variety of end markets, but all with a common goal: to simulate the real world in a multiphysics environment. ""Multiphysics"" is a broad term that means replicating real-world physical properties like electricity, heat, or stress loads on a product, but in a simulation.

Along with other engineering software companies, Ansys helps companies like Tesla and Rocket Lab perform simulations for their manufactured products all within a realistic software environment, saving time and money with their research budgets.

Engineering simulations require vast computing power, which Ansys is trying to improve through its AI and machine-learning research. The company claims AI can help with the speed and accuracy of these simulations, which makes sense since machine learning is generally just one big data problem.

These developments should not only help Ansys improve its products for customers but also distinguish it from any software challengers, insulating it from competition.

Today, Ansys has a market cap of $22 billion. Over the last 12 months, it has generated a net income of $469 million, giving the stock a P/E of 47. This is much more expensive than Alphabet, but with the huge growth opportunity Ansys has within fields like semiconductors, the space economy, and electric vehicles, I think the stock is still a great buy even at today's premium price.

Fueled by greater connectivity and faster transactions, the digital transformation of the payables and receivables landscape continues to reshape the outlook for treasury management. In what seems like a short period of time, we have come face to face with the realities of an automated, real-time post-paper world. The tools are within reach and businesses, especially in light of the COVID-19 crisis, are moving quickly to adjust their tactics and approach to technology.

For many, the status quo has been about keeping up with the rapid pace of change and the increasingly complex mix of products and services. However, as we move forward, for those ready to invest in configuring the right technology and understanding what will drive strategic value, there is considerable opportunity for growth and productivity.

Meeting customers where they are

One insight that has materialized, particularly as part of the pandemic response, is that customer needs are more important than ever. This has been invaluable when trying to evaluate new technologies and determine how to integrate them with existing systems and infrastructures.

We've seen many companies embrace faster and easier payments systems. Traditional options such as checks, automated clearing house (ACH), and wire are regularly being uprooted by high-speed digital alternatives including real-time payments, virtual cards, and even Same Day ACH. The modern options are simply more efficient, more transparent, and incredibly precise — and the growth has been impressive. Same Day ACH, for example, has jumped in volume from $17 million in 2016 to $461 million in 2020, according to Mercator Advisory Group.

Mercator Advisory Group

The corporate shift has in part been motivated by the consumerization of the payment experience that has popularized on-demand and real-time innovations, such as contactless payments, digital wallets, and on-demand payment tools.

The COVID-19 pandemic worked to further accelerate this move toward digitization and expose the expendability of paper transactions. Businesses realized that they no longer needed to handle physical items in physical locations and quickly pivoted as they discovered accessible and easy-to-use digital options.

Those who have made the shift to digital transactions, especially the early adopters, now expect the companies they do business with to be up to speed with on-demand and real-time services. It has become very important to meet trading partners or customers on the right platform with the right tools.

Newer, faster, and even more precise payments and processes

Looking forward, faster and more accurate transactions and payment schemes will continue to gain traction and see widespread adoption. With change happening quickly and plenty of product fragmentation, it will be difficult to know what's important and where it's best to invest attention and resources. Corporate treasurers will need to focus on prioritizing operational and strategic value, as well as on determining what will best align with their internal competencies and IT capacity.

Connectivity and automation will drive the digital transformation

Advanced connectivity is increasing the speed, availability, and transparency of payments, making it easier and more cost-effective to manage everything from accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR) to cash flow and reporting.

One territory that has already taken off and made an impact is API technology, which enables companies to integrate banking and payment services directly into their own enterprise resource planning and treasury management systems. There's a lot of potential for innovation and just a few of the benefits for treasurers include cutting-edge insights and analytics, more efficient payments, and better working capital management.

Despite slow initial uptake, more corporates are also set to embrace the powerful connectivity and 24/7/365 flexibility of real-time payment networks like RTP®. There is work to be done, but it will be a game-changer in streamlining billing and payment procedures, improving transaction communication, decreasing reconciliation times, and further reducing reliance on paper. While the RTP® now reaches more than half of transaction accounts in the US, the Federal Reserve Banks are developing a similar end-to-end instant payments platform, the FedNow Service. This is set to launch by 2023 and will extend access to real-time payments to more financial institutions and customers nationwide.

By 2024, Deloitte expects real-time payments to make up a 20.9% share of volume in the payments market with a projected transaction volume of $4.2 billion.

Another key trend in connectivity will likely be point-to-point encryption solutions (P2PE), a new standard for encrypting account and transaction information. It's an important layer of added security that will make it faster and simpler to conduct transactions and further open doors toward tokenization, a process where card or account numbers can be encrypted and passed through the internet without revealing actual bank details.

Finally, there's also a push towards the corporate application of the Internet of Things (IoT), which promises to disrupt and better connect business-to-business trade, especially in areas like manufacturing.

Automation

In terms of automation, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) will have a critical role in realigning treasury operations and streamlining AP and AR processes. Intelligence-driven automation is being deployed to reduce manual processes, improve payment accuracy, optimize data exchange and consolidate invoicing and receivables reconciliation. It's helping create significant operational efficiencies and organizational value. The dominant force in this area will be cloud-based, intelligent payables and receivables platforms like Citizens' integrated payables solution powered by Paymode-X.

Alongside automation, data and analytics will continue to be a big part of how treasury departments will define their AP and AR functions in the coming years. With greater connectivity and more information being shared about customers and transactions, there will be more potential to generate valuable business intelligence. Organizations will gain access to powerful insights to advise with, improve services, reduce costs, and pursue new opportunities.

Relatedly, payment messaging will be an essential area to keep track of as new digital payment options are becoming increasingly sophisticated and data-intensive. Standardized messaging between financial institutions, specifically ISO 20022, is a growing global initiative and corporates need to be ready to migrate their systems to be compliant.

The bottom line is that amidst this rapid pace of innovation, treasurers will be at a disadvantage if they aren't staying abreast with the latest developments and readying their systems for what's next.

The Hollywood giants were the ones that could afford to pay celebrities millions of dollars and license sophisticated software to produce elaborate, special effects-laden films. That’s all about to change, and the public is getting a preview thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E and Midjourney.

Both tools use images scraped from the internet and select datasets like LAION to train their AI models to reconstruct similar yet wholly original imagery using text prompts. The AI images, which vary from photographic realism to mimicking the styles of famous artists, can be generated in as little as 20 to 30 seconds, often producing results that would take a human hours to produce. For example, the “detailed glowing synthwave diagram of Japanese mech robot” illustration below .

These paid tools generally prevent the direct appearance of celebrities in their outputs. But users are finding workarounds with the arrival of free, open-source AI image generation software. The most popular is Stable Diffusion produced by UK-based startup Stability.AI. The open-source tool allows users to generate original imagery of any celebrity found on the internet. One particularly convincing example (below) shows Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) donning the costume of a Game of Thrones character, putting the iconic actor in a setting many fans could only dream of.

What began as AI image generation has quickly evolved into experimental animations that combine Stable Diffusion with free complementary tools like Deforum, Google Colab, and Ebsynth. In some cases, the add-ons require some code manipulation, YouTube, Discord, and Reddit are filled with easy-to-interpret tutorials that make them accessible to nearly anyone. These cobbled-together animations are just the start. Full-fledged original AI videos derived from text prompts are already on the way.

Earlier this year, Google’s Imagen and Meta’s Make-a-Video previewed AI tools that can generate photorealistic video from text prompts. Open-source versions of these kinds of AI tools are already being developed—a dynamic that will likely lead to the same kind of uncensored content produced by Stable Diffusion.

If the evolution of AI video tools mirrors the rapid improvement of 2D AI image generators, the public may see its first full-length, completely AI-generated film in the next one to two years.

Stable Diffusion was hoping it could trust its users

The potential abuse of AI video generation tools to violate the intellectual property rights of Hollywood studios, and the rights of the actors, are among the many potential problems that will arise in the coming months. Soon, almost anyone using AI tools may be able to cast celebrities in unauthorized films featuring everything from violent sequences to sexually-explicit scenes.

For example, the general install version of Stable Diffusion includes safety filters to prevent explicit imagery from being generated, but the open-source community rapidly came up with code to defeat those guardrails. While sexual content is not the most popular target for the roughly 10 million users of Stable Diffusion, there’s at least one Reddit community with more than 6,400 members dedicated to exploring how to use Stable Diffusion to produce sexually suggestive and nude imagery.

In September, when publicly questioned about the possibility of people using Stable Diffusion in potentially problematic ways, such as in the creation of porn, the company’s CEO Emad Mostaque shrugged off responsibility.

“If people use technology to do illegal stuff then it is their fault,” Mostaque tweeted. “This is the basis for liberal society.” In the same thread, Mostaque wrote that“if people use this to copy artists styles or break copyright they are behaving unethical and it is literally traceable as outputs are deterministic.”

AI-generated content is coming for Hollywood

On Oct. 17, Stability.AI received an investment of $101 million to continue to develop its AI models, as well as its in-development Dream Studio product, a proprietary, paid version of its AI model that doesn’t require the same technical skills needed to install and operate Stable Diffusion.

But along with Stable Diffusion’s new billion-dollar valuation has come an apparent shift in Stability.AI’s approach to its business. The company’s public messaging has shifted with the latest release of Stable Diffusion 1.5 which, according to the startup, attracted government interest in its free AI tool being used by millions.



“We’ve taken a step back at Stability AI and chose not to release version 1.5 as quickly as we released earlier checkpoints,” wrote Stability.AI’s chief information officer, Daniel Jeffries, on Oct. 20. “We’ve heard from regulators and the general public that we need to focus more strongly on security to ensure that we’re taking all the steps possible to make sure people don’t use Stable Diffusion for illegal purposes or hurting people.”

This extra caution from the Stable Diffusion team may be welcomed by the movie and music studios (there’s an AI music generation tool in the works as well) that could be impacted by AI generation tools in the coming months and years.

Nevertheless, the next independent film starring one’s favorite actor may soon be produced in the bedroom of someone using an AI video generator to create unlikely Hollywood mashups and put them on the internet, legal consequences be damned.

He’s been merging illusion with reality in his work for a while now, and now he’s added an interesting twist to it: artificial intelligence.

Thanks to tools like DALL-E and Midjourney, you can create an image from pretty much anything you can spell. Antti was curious whether it will be possible with his work. Since it’s dreamy and surreal, Midjourney seemed like a logical choice – and it did a remarkably good job!

Antti tells DIYP that Midjourney doesn’t have similar features when creating new content as Stable Diffusion. However, you can feed it images as input reference and then use the prompt to guide it to generate something similar. Here’s the basics of how you do it:

To recreate his work, Antti placed one image at a time as an input and typed its content into AI. Midjourney returned a grid of four images, and Antti would select the best one and upscale it. For example, he used his image and a prompt “Dolores from Westworld holding a gun, sunset canyons” for this one:

“I’ve been playing with AI for almost a year now and I’m starting to get the hang of it even though the technology is moving at the speed of light,” Antti writes. “Learn a new way of doing something and the next day there is something new popping up that draws my attention.”

“It takes something like 30 seconds to one minute for Midjourney to create those images,” Antti tells DIYP. And it’s both amazing and a bit concerning how quickly the technology changes. “From images to animations generated by text prompts, this industry is changing many things, and also disrupting industries,” Antti concludes. “How we create images is not the same anymore.”

I recently wrote about whether we should be worried about AI in photography. My conclusion is that we shouldn’t. Today I’m demonstrating the power of AI in the form of a battle, putting the leading noise removal software head-to-head. I’ve searched through my raw images to find a particularly noisy shot to work with. Here’s what we’re working with:

I’ll quickly explain what’s going on here. This is a shot from the shores of Jökulsárlón in Iceland. It’s better known as the Glacier Lagoon. I took this shot last winter on a moonless night. When I’m looking for the northern lights, I take quick shots to help me compose, which is what this is. I’ve selected this image because it was taken in the dark, and that’s where we often encounter noise in our photos.

Aperture: f/2.8

Shutter speed: 0.6 seconds

You can see just how much noise there is right here when I zoom in:

The Contenders for noise removal

In this battle, I’ll be using the following software and features:

I’m opening the raw photo directly into each piece of software without any prior edits. Where there’s an automatic function available, that’s what I’ll be using.

I’ll go through each piece of software now and have a complete side-by-side at the end at 100%.

Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Sensei drives some awesome Neural Filters, but their Noise Reduction Neural Filter isn’t available yet. We’ll have it covered as soon as this drops, but I’m using the Reduce Noise Filter for now. When we see the full image, the difference is barely noticeable. I’m a big fan of Adobe, but they’re falling behind when it comes to noise reduction.

The noise reduction features currently fall within the Filters section of Adobe Photoshop. They are all manual, giving us options to change by way of slider adjustments. All the other software I used in this comparison was far simpler and more effective. We’ll see what happens when the Neural Filter lands.

Skylum Luminar Neo

The Noiseless RAW feature within Luminar Neo recommended that I use the ‘High’ preset. The noise reduction took about 45 seconds, and the result was pretty good. The expectation in most noise removal is that the details will be softened and the pixels will appear to have been ‘spread out.’ This isn’t the case at all with Luminar Neo.

The before and after images here show some difference at the 100% scale. The difference is far more obvious when we’re zoomed in tight (at the bottom of the page). The Noiseless AI feature of Luminar is part of their Extensions Pack. Their subscription model makes the Extensions available to users as soon as they’re ready to go in their $119 annual plan.

Topaz DeNoise AI

Topaz Labs are probably the most talked about in this line-up. Their ads appear all over social feeds, and with good reason. Their AI software is powerful and productive. This DeNoise process was easy and intuitive. The software took care of everything for me and churned out a great result, taking a minute and one second to complete the task. This software does what it says on the tin, with no frills.

I prefer this workspace. The side-by-side view reveals a before-and-after, and the sliders and buttons are easy to see and read. The preview took a while to hit 100%.

ON1 NoNoise AI

ON1 NoNoise AI was almost instant, taking three seconds to export the JPEG after hitting the ‘Done’ button. It had no problems in processing the RAW file, and I didn’t need to make any adjustments to the sliders. The preview was instant, whereas the Topaz preview took about twenty seconds to appear. This means a faster and more efficient workflow. Great job, ON1.

Another feature present in the ON1 NoNoise AI is a Tack Sharp AI option alongside NoNoise AI. This sharpening tidies up a lot of the fuzziness that usually results in images processed by noise reduction software.

Results (click for high res)

If I had to pick a winner, I would be torn between Luminar Noiseless AI and ON1 NoNoise AI 2023. Topaz isn’t bad, though, so it’s really tough. The truth of the matter here is that each piece of software is evolving. That’s the nature of Machine Learning – the Artificial Intelligence develops over time.

What is currently the best option may not be in a few months’ time. The same can be said for the images we put through the software. High ISO images and low light images can produce different results, and the camera and sensor also make a difference. Each piece of software is essentially an ecosystem. Just as when you buy into a camera brand, you are basically “stuck” with it. The same applies here. The good news is that Topaz, Skylum, and ON1 all offer a free trial, so you can test each piece of software on our own images to see which works best.

46,"Conversational AI technology is commonly associated with human interactions with bots, but that's not the approach that Interactions has largely taken.",artificial intelligence,10/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ss-cloud-call-center.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Every day, individuals call into customer contact centers and provide sensitive information, like credit card numbers, to agents by voice. Now, a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) solution using natural language understanding capabilities offers a way to remove that information from calls, while still passing data through for transactions.

This is important because dealing with any sort of personally identifiable information (PII) inevitably involves an array of compliance with security and privacy regulations that can vary based on jurisdiction. There is also a non-trivial risk that sensitive information could potentially be leaked or stolen. In fact, there are known incidents where credit card information provided by voice have been written down by malicious agents, leading to undesirable outcomes.

“There was an incident where an enterprise customer came to us with a real-life story saying, hey, look, this happened, somebody noted down the credit card numbers and those things were leaked in the open market,” Srini Bangalore, head of AI research at conversational AI vendor Interactions, told VentureBeat. “That led us to start thinking about the technology itself, and how to go about redacting personally identifiable information in real-time with low latency, without impacting user experience.”

To that end, Interactions developed a new technology, Trustera, which is generally available as of today. The goal is to use AI and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify PII in real time, redact it from the live voice call and still pass off the information to the underlying digital systems for transactions in an encrypted approach.

Taking a hybrid AI approach to conversational AI

Interactions is a company that designs conversational AI technology platforms for organizations.

Conversational AI technology is commonly associated with human interactions with bots, but that’s not the approach that Interactions has largely taken. Bangalore said that his company has taken what he called a hybrid AI approach.

With the hybrid AI model, humans are part of the process alongside conversational AI to help support user experience in a frictionless approach. The Trustera system, for example, is not bot-driven, but is intended to operate in environments where an individual calls into a customer support center and then speaks with a human.

Bangalore said that the process of redacting PII in human led conversations is more complicated than it is for purely bot and digital-driven interactions in an interactive voice response (IVR) type system. He noted that in IVR or bot conversations, the system knows when PII is being transmitted because it is part of the process and initiated by the system.

With human-led conversations, it’s not always at the same point in a conversation when PII is requested or transferred. There is also a need to understand what PII is being sent, as well as understanding the actual human speaker.

How Trustera conversational AI works to secure PII

The AI technology that Interactions has developed for its conversational AI platforms has its roots in capabilities that come from AT&T Bell Labs.

In 2014, Interactions acquired speech analysis technologies from AT&T, which is where Bangalore had formerly worked for 18 years. The speech recognition capabilities have steadily improved in the years since, with the integration of natural language understanding (NLU) functionality, which helps to enable the Trustera service.

Interactions has trained its model on-call information to understand when different human speakers transfer PII. The model isn’t static and is constantly being updated.

“We have a self supervised auto ML approach, where we take the previous day’s calls and we have a notional confidence metric to say these are data elements that we can add back to the model,” Bangalore said. “So we update the model periodically that way as well.”",How conversational AI can remove sensitive information from contact center calls ￼,https://venturebeat.com/business/how-conversational-ai-can-remove-sensitive-information-from-contact-center-calls/

AI is a powerful tool that can be used to create new and interesting images. It can be used to create new images from scratch or to edit existing ones from a simple text prompt. I was curious and decided to try to use Ai to replicate my own pictures.

I used Ai called Midjourney and used my own art as input, typed the rough outline of the image, and let the AI do its thing. And the results were quite astounding.

So what do you think, which ones are better, the real ones or the ones with some AI touch?”

Today’s report, however, says Laserlike’s founders have returned to Google…

Laserlike cofounder Srinivasan Venkatachary had taken the role of senior director for Apple’s search team, helping manage at least 200 employees. This team is responsible for developing features for things like Spotlight and Siri Suggestions, as well as answers from the Siri voice assistant itself.

During his time at Apple, Venkatachary reported to Apple’s vice president of machine learning and artificial intelligence John Giannandrea, who is also a former Google executive. Venkatachary also expanded the headcount of the search team at Apple, focusing on hiring a number of Google Search employees.

Venkatachary has now returned to Google, along with other Laserlike cofounders:

Venkatachary is now vice president of engineering at Google under James Manyika, senior vice president of technology and society, whose portfolio includes a group tasked with tracking how technologies such as artificial intelligence are affecting social issues, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Venkatachary’s fellow Laserlike co-founders, Steven Baker and Anand Shukla, are also part of his team, this person said. It couldn’t be learned what the former Apple employees are working on specifically.

As today’s report points out, however, Apple and Google are both competitors and partners in the search industry. Most notably, Google pays Apple an estimated $18 billion to $20 billion per year to remain the default search engine on all Apple devices. This deal, however, is facing a growing amount of antitrust scrutiny.

Whether or not Apple plans to launch a dedicated Google search replacement remains unclear, but today’s report indicates the company is still “at least four years away” from being able to do so:

Apple is still at least four years away from launching a potential Google search replacement, estimated the person who has been involved with the team. Doing so would undoubtedly require a significant increase in the team’s budget. Apple might also be able to strike a deal with Microsoft’s Bing that’s similar to the one Apple has with Google, as Bing has a relatively small share of the search market.

In the interim, Apple is reportedly focused on expanding the technology developer by Venkachatary’s former team to “power search for Apple Music and the App Store.” It could also use the technology to “generate data for Apple teams developing applications using natural language processing, such as those involving translation.”

A diversity score for artificial intelligence inspired by how ecologists measure biodiversity could help identify bias in data sets and AI systems.

AIs can learn and mimic certain biases if their training data sets are not diverse enough. This has already been seen in AI systems perpetuating racist and sexist prejudice and in governments using racially biased AI for checking passport photos. Such AI-powered bias has also shown up in law enforcement efforts to predict crime.

Historically this has left untapped value on the table for both buyers and suppliers. To address this challenge, Walmart deployed AI-powered negotiations software with a text-based interface (i.e., a chatbot) to connect with suppliers. So far, the chatbot is negotiating and closing agreements with 68% of suppliers approached, with each side gaining something it values. This article offers four lessons to deliver results from automated procurement negotiations: move quickly to a production pilot, start with indirect spend categories with pre-approved suppliers, decide on acceptable negotiation trade-offs, and scale by extending geographies, categories, and use cases.

Walmart, like most organizations with large procurement operations, can’t possibly conduct focused negotiations with all of its 100,000-plus suppliers. As a result, around 20% of its suppliers have signed agreements with cookie-cutter terms that are often not negotiated. It’s not the optimal way to engage with these “tail-end suppliers.” But the cost of hiring more human buyers to negotiate with them would exceed any additional value.

Walmart solved the problem with artificial intelligence–powered software that includes a text-based interface (or chatbot) that negotiates with human suppliers on behalf of Walmart. Walmart Canada piloted the solution in January 2021 and used supplier feedback to hone the system. Walmart has since deployed the solution in three other countries, and Walmart operations in more countries plan to implement the technology soon.

This article shares four lessons on how to use automated procurement negotiations in ways that benefit both buyers and suppliers. Such systems can generate savings, improve the terms for both parties, and increase the flexibility and resiliency of a supply chain.

The Pilot

With advances in artificial intelligence (AI), Walmart began exploring the possibility of automating procurement negotiations for tail-end suppliers and licensed a software product called Pactum AI in 2019. The deployment was postponed because of Covid-19, but one of us (Michael DeWitt) resurrected the initiative a year later, in January 2021, for his organization, Walmart International.

Since Walmart already had experimented with the software in a sandbox environment, Walmart International moved directly to a small pilot in the company’s Canadian business. The pilot, which lasted three months, included a variety of stakeholders — 89 suppliers, five buyers, and representatives from Walmart Canada’s finance, treasury, and legal departments — and Pactum, the company that had created the underlying AI technology.

At the outset, Walmart International estimated that the system would yield a positive return on investment if the chatbot could close deals with 20% of the suppliers involved in the pilot. The retailer selected “goods not for resale” — categories such as fleet services, carts, and other equipment used in retail stores — and not products sold to Walmart customers. It decided to focus on suppliers for whom there was accurate data on payment terms and where there was clear opportunity to improve payment terms and secure additional discounts.

Walmart International targeted payment schedules, hoping to negotiate early payment discounts or extended payment terms without discounts. In exchange, Walmart would offer suppliers the option to change Walmart’s right to terminate contracts immediately without cause (known as “termination for convenience”) to providing a 30-, 60-, or 90-day written termination notice. Walmart would also selectively offer suppliers opportunities for growth in assortment and sales volume in exchange for price discounts.

Internal buyers selected the suppliers to target and created training scenarios for Pactum AI’s machine learning algorithm. The scenarios were used to create structured scripts to guide suppliers through negotiations. Suppliers could respond to scenarios at their own pace.

Walmart International invited around 100 tail-end suppliers to try the solution. Eighty-nine agreed to participate. The chatbot was successful in reaching an agreement with 64% of them — well above the 20% target — and with an average negotiation turnaround of 11 days. Walmart gained, on average, 1.5% in savings on the spend negotiated and an extension of payment terms to an average of 35 days.

In post-pilot interviews with suppliers that engaged in successful negotiations, 83% of them described the system as easy to use and liked the ability to make a counteroffer and the time the system gave them to think about the negotiation at their own pace. For example, Ben Garisto, president of MIWE, a bakery-equipment manufacturer, said, “During in-person negotiations, you do not always have the questions in advance, and you are responding in real time. Other types of automated requests for proposals sometimes feel a bit like a template with little room to tell your story.”

Several suppliers, however, still would have liked to negotiate face to face. Other suppliers wanted a less verbose, more fluid script instead of prohibiting suppliers from backtracking to early steps in the negotiation.

After the production pilot, Walmart improved the scenarios and scripts and extended the solution to suppliers in the United States, Chile, and South Africa. So far, the chatbot has closed deals with 68% of the suppliers approached and generated an average savings of 3%.

Other companies interested in automating procurement can apply these lessons on how to develop and introduce such a system:

1. Move to a production pilot quickly.

The AI journey for many companies languishes in the proof-of-concept phase — fewer than half make it into production, according to Gartner. That’s because proof-of-concept phases focus on technical capabilities instead of business goals. Walmart decided to skip a proof-of-concept phase and to go straight to a production pilot focused on business goals.

Walmart’s “business owners” — people in charge of budgets and responsible for the spend with suppliers (for example, operations for store supplies and IT for hardware and software) — helped to create negotiation use cases and scenarios. Walmart’s buyers provided crucial subject-matter expertise on the negotiation scenarios needed to train the chatbot and nominated suppliers to participate in the pilot (based on which suppliers conduct enough business with Walmart to warrant a negotiation and which would welcome a chance to negotiate). The legal team made sure the chatbot’s script and resulting contract conformed to Walmart contracting standards and policy.

2. Start with indirect-spend categories and pre-approved suppliers.

Walmart began with goods not for resale (i.e., not sold to its retail customers) to minimize the risks to the business posed by the testing of a new procurement practice. Walmart also focused on pre-approved suppliers so the need to validate new suppliers wouldn’t delay the start of the pilot.

3. Decide on acceptable trade-offs.

Automated procurement requires precisely defining the boundaries of what the buyer is willing to concede in exchange for what it wants. For example, the AI chatbot needs to know the specific trade-offs the buyer is willing to give for, say, moving from full payments in 10 days after receipt of the invoice to receiving payment 15, 20, 30, 45, or 60 days after receipt of invoice in exchange for improved termination terms and the opportunities for suppliers to expand their business with Walmart.

4. Scale by extending geographies, categories, and use cases.

Walmart’s motto for this project was to “nail it and scale it.” Successful production pilots helped Walmart sell the solution to other parts of the business. After the pilot in Canada, the United States, Chile, and South Africa, deployments in Mexico, Central America, and China are imminent. The categories have also expanded to include route rate negotiations for transportation and some goods for resale. Some mid-tier suppliers now use the system, and the chatbot is multilingual.

Scaling has increased productivity because the software learns from every negotiation, reducing the setup time for new categories. Additionally, the chatbot can run 2,000 negotiations simultaneously — something no human buyer can do.

One can see the trajectory: As terms and conditions become more algorithmic, fewer suppliers and parts of spend pools will go unmanaged. Procurement professionals will focus less on negotiating agreements and more on strategic relationships, exceptions, and continuous improvement.",How Walmart Automated Supplier Negotiations,https://hbr.org/2022/11/how-walmart-automated-supplier-negotiations

Climate Trace, a project to measure at source the true levels of carbon dioxide and other global heating gases, published a new report on Wednesday showing that half of the 50 largest sources of greenhouse gases in the world were oil and gas fields and production facilities.

Many are underreporting their emissions, and there are few means of calling them to account.

Oil and gas production can leak methane, and the gas is also frequently flared intentionally, ostensibly for safety reasons but sometimes for convenience. Atmospheric levels of methane, a greenhouse gas about 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, have been rising strongly in recent years, but countries’ reported emissions of the gas have been found to be much lower than the reality.

The “shocking” under-reporting of emissions is a big problem in trying to tackle the climate crisis, according to Al Gore, former vice-president of the US, a founding member of the Climate Trace coalition.

“We can only manage what we can measure,” Gore told the Guardian at Cop27 in Egypt. “Climate Trace is the neighbourhood watch for the globe.”

Under the UN system, countries are responsible for reporting their own greenhouse gas emissions. Gore said: “There are some inherent vulnerabilities in a self-reporting framework. If there is a bad actor, who doesn’t want to report, or if there is a brand name company that wants to sell its high emitting asset through a dark private equity group, it disappears from the self-reporting framework. But we still see it because we have empirical data. So we can help them protect against cheating.”

He gave the example of Saudi Arabia. “Saudi Arabia has reported its oil and gas production emissions. We have measured them empirically and we find a huge gap, that the emissions are larger than those that have been reported,” he said. “When we look more carefully at the emissions we find from their refining centre, it turns out that the volume of emissions from their refining centre, that have not been reported, exactly match the [amount] by which their reported admissions are undercounted. Now, was that an oversight on their part? Was it a mistake? Maybe. Not for me to say.”

Climate Trace uses evidence from satellites, remote sensors and other sources to monitor emissions globally, using artificial intelligence to build a clear picture of emissions sources around the world. The group’s database provides emissions information from 2015 to 2021 for all countries that are party to the Paris agreement, which encompasses all world nations apart from a handful of failed states.

None of those nations have yet submitted to the UN a full account of their greenhouse gases for 2021, and 52 countries have not submitted any emissions inventories covering the last 10 years.

Oil and gas companies were the worst of all sectors for under-reporting emissions, said Gore. “For the oil and gas sector it is consistent with their public relations strategy and their lobbying strategy. All of their efforts are designed to buy themselves more time before they stop destroying the future of humanity.”

He pointed to ExxonMobil, which was discovered to have disguised what it knew about global heating. “They engaged in industrial scale lying to publics around the world, even though they had information of their own notifying them that they were being dishonest. I do think that they have committed the moral equivalent of war crimes,” he said.",Oil and gas greenhouse emissions ‘three times higher’ than producers claim,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/09/oil-and-gas-greenhouse-emissions-three-times-higher-than-producers-claim

Soon it will be joined by others in a development that could mean the end of thousands of jobs and, Amazon argues, the creation of thousands of others.

As the robot worked, a screen displayed its progress. It carefully packed a tub of protein powder, next came a box of napkin rings then … a tube of hemorrhoid cream. As 100 journalists from around the world snapped pictures, someone switched the screen to hide the cream.

One day soon the robot, called Sparrow, could do the work of the hundreds of thousands of people that Amazon now employs to sort the 13m packages it delivers each year. Using computer vision and artificial intelligence Amazon says Sparrow can already identify about 65% of its product inventory, tell if an item is damaged and discard it, and adjust its suction cup “hand” to handle different objects – all jobs currently done by human hands. As it learns, it gets better by the day.

Sparrow, which will probably start rolling out next year, was just one of the new army of robots on display for the first time at Amazon’s “Delivering the Future” conference last Thursday. Other innovations included an autonomous green robot called Proteus – a giant Roomba lookalike capable of shifting heavy loads around cavernous warehouses. The company also showed off its latest drone which it hopes will allow the company to deliver 500m packages by air by the end of the decade. Another corner of Amazon’s BOS27 warehouse had been kitted out with fake grass, fake house fronts complete with welcome mats, and a giant electric-powered delivery van fitted with tech to inform drivers about the best routes and give “coaching” for better driving. Behind a white picket fence, a drone sat on the lawn, an image of how Amazon believes millions of its customers will one day receive their orders.

The 2020s will be the “age of applied robotics”, said Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics. “Robots will be doing meaningful tasks and extending human capability. I feel like it’s taken 50 years to get here. It’s exciting!”

In recent years Amazon has become one of the world’s largest private employers, with a payroll of more than 1.6 million as of 2021. That growth has not come without pain. Amazon is fighting tooth and nail to stop US warehouse workers angered by low wages and relentless pressure from forming unions and Wall Street has been critical of its perceived over-hiring. Robot packers, robot movers and robot deliveries could be an answer to those issues.

Brady disagrees. People have predicted that robots will destroy the labour market for decades. As far back as 1933 the economist John Maynard Keynes prophesied widespread technological unemployment was coming “due to our discovery of means of economizing the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour”.

“I just don’t see that at all,” said Brady. “We made our first serious investment in robotics over 10 years ago and in those 10 years we created more than a million jobs.” More robots will boost the efficiency of warehouses meaning they can store more goods, Amazon will sell more stuff and more people will be needed to make sure everything runs smoothly, he said.

“The need for people to solve problems and use common sense will always be there,” he said. “We are nowhere near that with robotics. It’s not even close. We have millions of years of evolution for the human brain that’s powered off 20 watts and a banana, that’s incredible.”

Brady may be right on job numbers. A recent report from the US government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics said there was “little support” for the idea that the new era of smart machines would lead to job destruction. Economists even have a term for it – the “lump of labor” fallacy. Innovation may destroy occupations but there is no fixed number of jobs and new ones take their place. Warehouse jobs, for example, replaced retail jobs as online shopping decimated shopping malls.

But all this change isn’t necessarily good for workers. In a paper for the University of Berkley’s Labor Center, Beth Gutelius and Nik Theodore also concluded that tech innovations at warehouses were unlikely to cost significant job losses. But, they argued, employers “may use technology in ways that decrease the skill requirements of jobs in order to reduce training times and turnover costs. This could create adverse effects on workers, such as wage stagnation and job insecurity.”

Such arguments are unlikely to slow Amazon’s robot revolution. The company is the largest manufacturer of industrial robots in the world. Its Boston facilities already produce 330,000 robots a year. And all to ensure ever faster delivery of toothpaste – or hemorrhoid cream. And that is what people want, said Brady: “We will react and we will obsess about what the customer wants and if they want their toothpaste faster, we will help them get their toothpaste faster,” he said.",Amazon enters the age of robots.

The Dorries Diktat – that Arts Council England money should be moved out of London – led to various anomalies, not least the disastrous decision to cut funding from one of the best of the capital’s theatres, the Donmar Warehouse, in the name of levelling up. Of course it matters where organisations are based. But buildings and geography are not the end of the story. In supporting the work of new writers and directors, the Donmar has always pumped fresh blood around the country. The theatre’s plans to support local organisations in Kent, the West Midlands and Nottinghamshire have now been crushed.

Meanwhile, the stage has been subjecting itself to inquisitions. For three days at the Royal Court, Martin Crimp wrote and performed his new play, a coruscation, driven by questions perpetual and immediate. When does pretending become fakery? Is fiction a lie? And, particularly current, can a dramatist “give voice” to any character?

That last question, of cultural appropriation, which Crimp feels is pressing on younger dramatists, is dodgy: no playwright actually gives someone else their voice. The stage is part mimicry, part makeup; it is response and creation. This complexity was brought to life in Not One of These People. In Christian Lapointe’s staging (he designed and directed), a stream of faces – brown, black, white, wrinkled, young, all genders – flashed up on a screen, accompanied by a battery of short lines. At first these were read by Crimp, then the photos began to move and slew, as if bubbling from beneath, and to speak in a mixture of the banal and the momentous: about pretending to be Russian, wishing you had different children, failing to kill yourself.

She is a diligent, capable person, unravelling in an impossible job. She is a hospital doctor

Sometimes lines and image seemed congruent, sometimes they were wildly unexpected, but, then, what sentence wouldn’t be unexpected from the mouth of a tiny baby? The contrasts were often high comedy, often saddening. They were always teasing, for the 299 faces on show had been generated by artificial intelligence. Does this make them more or less “real” than characters generated by a human mind?

The question of who speaks in whose voice is also animated in David Ireland’s brilliant new 50-minute sprint Not Now. On the day after his father’s funeral, in Ballybeen, east Belfast, a young man is rehearsing the opening speech from Richard III; he’s off to London to audition for a drama school that his uncle calls “Radar”. The boy overacts badly, all lolloping limbs and tortured Olivier vowels. The uncle – not at all thespy – thinks he should perform in his own accent, that he should play up the “Irish” thing, so loved by the English. His nephew protests: he is a loyalist; he is British; he doesn’t want to pretend to be something he is not. Then, asks his uncle, why do you want to be an actor?

‘Nonstop sparkle’: Stephen Kennedy and Matthew Blaney in Not Now. Photograph: Lidia Crisafulli

Ireland’s dialogue is nonstop sparkle; the development of the play beautifully judged in Max Elton’s production, as the boy (Matthew Blaney) moves from gangle and sullenness to candour and the uncle (Stephen Kennedy) from joviality to reluctant disclosure. There is, as always with Ireland, an unflinching look at Protestant politics, but Not Now adds different notes. His greatest play so far, Cyprus Avenue, was a satire fuelled by an imaginative flight of which Jonathan Swift would have been proud. This drama has a new warmth. It also clinches on a beautiful reanimation of Shakespeare’s words about changing “dreadful marches to delightful measures”. After having heard about loyalist marches and watching reconciliation, the phrase has a startling, particular ring.

Jasmine Blackborow comes shooting out of the traps as a glowing talent in Super High Resolution. At first calm and humorous, increasingly wound round in a skein of desperation; becoming numb, yet never entirely ceasing to function. She is a diligent, capable person unravelling in an impossible job. She is a hospital doctor.

Nathan Ellis’s new play steadily emits the white heat of working in the NHS, spinning on its title, with Blackborow’s young clinician Anna pitting personal commitment and resolution against the impossibility of actually resolving problems exacerbated by scarce resources, strained nerves and crazily protracted hours. Catherine Cusack as Meredith, who has been longer in the job, is a terribly convincing warning of what may be to come: tautness, deafness to others.

Ellis is nimble on his comic toes, tweaking surprise throughout: in the topsy-turvy opening scene, the question “Are you OK?” is addressed by the person in civvies to the person in scrubs. Action straggles towards the end, when an overbusy plot is packed into what is really a case study; director Blanche McIntyre, so marvellously steady in her deep, close focus, could have done with getting her scissors out. Yet what a series of sharp moments are acted in front of Andrew D Edwards’s neat design: pleated blue hospital curtains are swished between scenes, both clinical and theatrical. And what performances. Lewis Shepherd makes a nonchalantly assured debut. Hayley Carmichael, seemingly frozen as she describes her mysterious injuries, is distress incarnate: it is as if her expressions are slightly out of her reach, at arm’s length from her words.

In parallel, regulations for data center sustainability requirements are getting tougher.

The data center industry is booming and eager for land, which can push up property prices in residential areas. Meanwhile, with power constraints on energy grids, governments are increasingly aware of the industry's carbon footprint. Data centers and data transmission networks account for about 1% of global electricity, the International Energy Agency has estimated, although some experts say that number could be even higher.

In short, data center sustainability is in the spotlight.

But how can data centers scale with confidence and support computing-intensive technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and 5G — all while reducing their carbon footprint and complying with tougher environmental regulations?

The industry has taken several steps to make progress, including advancing eco-friendly refrigerants used in data centers. Voluntary industry initiatives are also helping drive these efforts forward. For example, the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact in Europe between cloud infrastructure providers and data center operators, is a commitment to make European data centers climate neutral by 2030. However, more needs to be done.

The fuel cell opportunity

Part of the answer to this dilemma may be fuel cells that use hydrogen or other fuels to produce electricity. Fuel cells – which have been around since the 1960s and were used in the first NASA space missions − have long been tipped as a clean and efficient source of power for consumers and industry, including data centers.

Progress has been slow, but the EcoEdge PrimePower (E2P2 for short), a European hydrogen and fuel cell project with support from Vertiv, may help accelerate these efforts.

The 2.5-million-euro Clean Hydrogen Partnership, funded by the European Commission, was announced in December 2021.

The partnership aims to develop a proof-of-concept for how low-carbon fuel cells can provide green power for data centers.

The consortium of seven companies – Equinix, InfraPrime, RISE, Snam, SolidPower, TEC4FUELS, and Vertiv – will attempt to integrate solid-oxide fuel cells with uninterruptible power supply technology and lithium-ion batteries to provide resilient and clean primary power for data centers and other critical infrastructure.

Fuel cells are recognized as a cleaner and quieter power solution that can reduce the strain on urban power grids. They can be deployed on-site at a data center campus, and operate using natural gas, biogas, liquified petroleum gas (LPG), or green hydrogen, which can be transported and distributed over existing gas networks.

Investing in a low-carbon future

In the longer term, the hope is that fuel cells will help pave the way for the use of green hydrogen for both backup and prime power systems.

This project and other matters were recently discussed by panelists at Data Center Dynamics' ""Towards Net-Zero"" event, which included Arturo Di Filippi, global offering manager for smart power at Vertiv; Dan Loosemore, chief operating officer at Data Center Dynamics; Jon Summers, scientific lead in data centers at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, a state-owned organization that collaborates with universities, industry, and the public sector; and David Hall, former senior director of technology innovation at Equinix.

As Loosemore said during the event, the data center industry's environmental performance is under growing scrutiny as governments try to meet targets – part of the European Green Deal − for becoming carbon neutral by 2050 or earlier.

""How do data centers become a force for good in a low-carbon environment?"" Loosemore said. Fuel cells can help reduce the data center industry's reliance on natural gas and diesel-powered generators, he added.

Vertiv will use its experience in AC-power systems as well as prefabricated modular solutions for data centers to design and develop an integrated fuel cell power module, including the Vertiv™ Liebert® EXL S1 UPS and Vertiv™ HPL lithium-ion batteries.

Di Filippi said that the target of the E2P2 project is to generate an 80 kW net power proof-of-concept consisting of a Vertiv power module with 16 fuel cell modules and UPS, lithium-ion batteries, and switchgear.

For green fuel cell technology to become commercially viable, it must be transportable, easy to use and maintain, and reasonably priced. Di Filippi said that Vertiv is working with several fuel cell manufacturers and suppliers to understand how to drive down costs.

Understanding green power standards

Regardless of how successful the E2P2 project is, its impact will be limited unless others in the data center industry build on its work.

In the webinar, Summers emphasized how important it is that any solution for low-carbon fuel cells turns into an ""open standard."" He added that the E2P2 consortium will publish results about its fuel cells research, including operational data.

""With hardware, making open standards for fuel cells work is critical,"" Hall added.

Equinix aims to produce more local, low-carbon and no-carbon power for data centers. Medium-term aims for using more sustainable technologies in data centers could include using natural gas fuel cells, diesel generators not powered by fossil fuels, and renewables with battery storage, David said. Longer term aims could include primary fuel cells that use hydrogen, large-scale battery storage, and on-site hydrogen production.

It is early days for the project, but the E2P2 initiative has the potential to slash data centers' environmental impact and pave the way for a greener and more efficient digital infrastructure.

One of those drawbacks is racial and gender bias, and increasingly popular text-to-mage generators aren’t free from it.

Enter Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer, a tool that lets you explore AI-generated images and the biases they contain. It’s free, accessible to anyone, and quick to show that both humans and artificial intelligence still have a long way to go before they get rid of deeply rooted stereotypes.

“Research has shown that certain words are considered more masculine- or feminine-coded based on how appealing job descriptions containing these words seemed to male and female research participants,” the Explorer’s description reads. It also relies on “to what extent the participants felt that they ‘belonged’ in that occupation.”

Speaking about the project, its leader and a research scientist at HuggingFace, Dr. Sasha Luccioni told The Motherboard:

“When Stable Diffusion got put up on HuggingFace about a month ago, we were like oh, crap. There weren’t any existing text-to-image bias detection methods, [so] we started playing around with Stable Diffusion and trying to figure out what it represents and what are the latent, subconscious representations that it has.”

The tool is simple to use: you have two groups to compare to each other. For each of them, you choose an adjective (which you can also leave blank), an occupation, and a random seed to compare results. Dr. Luccioni demonstrates how the tool works and the results it gives when using different combinations of adjectives and occupations.

What's the difference between these two groups of people? Well, according to Stable Diffusion, the first group represents an 'ambitious CEO' and the second a 'supportive CEO'.

I played with Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer myself to see what I’d get. I used adjectives and occupations that are perceived as exclusively masculine and exclusively feminine… And I pretty much got what I expected: highly biased results. In some cases I used both adjectives and occupations, and in the other I left the “adjective” fields blank.

Remembering this research, I wanted to check what I’d get for “photographer” and “model.” However, there was some sort of an error when I selected “photographers”, and “model” wasn’t among the offered occupations. But here are some screenshots of the results I got.

To be fair, artificial intelligence was built, developed, and trained by humans. It uses human knowledge and input – and hence inherits human biases. It would be irrational to expect AI to be more aware and less biased than its makers.

Here’s more from our top 5 tech stories of the week:

Meta layoffs hit an entire ML research team focused on infrastructure



After Wednesday’s Meta layoffs, which cut 11,000 employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly shared a message to Meta employees that signaled, to some, that those working in AI and ML might be spared the brunt of the cuts.



However, a Meta research scientist who was laid off tweeted that he and the entire research organization called “Probability,” which focused on applying machine learning across the infrastructure stack, was cut.

Why data remains the greatest challenge for machine learning projects



Quality data is at the heart of the success of enterprise AI. And accordingly, it remains the main source of challenges for companies that want to apply ML in their applications and operations.



The industry has made impressive advances in helping enterprises overcome the barriers to sourcing and preparing their data, according to Appen’s latest State of AI Report. But there is still a lot more to be done at different levels, including organization structure and company policies.

Snowflake announces plans to improve query performance, collaboration



This week Snowflake, at its annual Snowday event, announced improvements to its platform’s key elements such as the elastic performance engine and Snowgrid technology. The move, it said, will provide enterprises with a faster querying experience for improving overall data cloud economics as well as streamlined collaboration capabilities.

Why the metaverse will rely on blockchain frameworks to connect to physical devices



This week, MachineFi Lab — the core developer of IoTeX, a decentralized blockchain platform that enables interactions between humans and machines — announced the release of W3bstream.



The new tool, it says, is “a blockchain-agnostic infra with the power to disrupt the machine economy where innovation until now has remained stagnant,” according to the company’s press release.

Sanofi signs latest billion-dollar AI drug discovery deal



In an era when biopharma research in drug R&D continues to be costly and slow, and AI-based drug discovery platforms are rapidly growing, Paris-based pharmaceutical leader Sanofi announced a $1.2 billion AI drug discovery deal with startup Insilico Medicine.



The research collaboration comes on the heels of several other high-value AI drug discovery partnership announcements from Sanofi, including with Atomwise in August; a partnership expansion with Exscientia last January; and an equity investment in Owkin a year ago.","Top 5 stories of the week: Meta layoffs, Sanofi’s billion-dollar deal and Snowflake updates",https://venturebeat.com/ai/top-5-stories-of-the-week-meta-layoffs-sanofis-billion-dollar-deal-and-snowflake-updates/

Watch now.

One of the hottest trends in artificial intelligence (AI) this year has been the emergence of popular generative AI models. With technologies including DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, there are a growing number of startups and use cases that are emerging.

Generative AI builds on a number of foundational technologies including the use of transformer models. The use of transformers for generative AI and other use cases can be resource intensive on the inference side, where systems predict and build out the results of a model.

Among the vendors that is building technology to help accelerate AI inference for transformer models is startup d-Matrix, which raised $44 million in a series A round of funding in April to help build out its AI accelerator hardware technology. The company has developed a digital in-memory compute (DIMC) technology that isn’t publicly available yet, but it’s already gotten the attention of Microsoft.

Microsoft and d-Matrix today announced that the Microsoft Project Bonsai reinforcement learning will be supported on the d-Matrix DIMC technology, which the two vendors hope will provide a significant acceleration for AI inference.

“Project Bonsai is a platform which enables our version of deep reinforcement learning and we call it machine teaching,” Kingsuk Maitra, principal applied AI engineer at Microsoft, told VentureBeat. “We have trained a compiler for d-Matrix’s one-of-a-kind digital in-memory compute technology and the early results are very encouraging.”

What Microsoft’s Project Bonsai is all about

Project Bonsai has been in development at Microsoft for the last several years and is currently available as a preview.

Maitra said that the goal of the effort is to abstract away the complexities that are associated with deep reinforcement learning networks. An initial target for Project Bonsai is industrial controls, including chip design and manufacturing. Part of the technology is a capability to train models using a high-level language developed at Microsoft Project Bonsai called Inkling to train deep reinforcement agents to do control tasks.

Deep reinforcement learning doesn’t require labeled data, Maitra explained. Rather, it essentially learns with feedback from the environment, which can be emulated with a simulator. At the end of a training loop, the result is a trained reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which Microsoft refers to as “brains.” The brains, when deployed, can take meaningful actions to complete the task at hand.

“We are running active real-life workloads and training the compiler, relative to those real-life workloads, most of them with well-known large language models with different Bonsai brains,” Maitra said.

The d-Matrix Corsair is coming in 2023

Currently d-Matrix doesn’t have any chips that are publicly available, but the first one, code-named Corsair, is set to debut in 2023.

“We’re building an accelerated computing platform for transformers and specifically focused around generative AI,” Sudeep Bhoja, cofounder, CTO at d-Matrix told VentureBeat.

Bhoja explained that the chips that d-Matrix is developing can be built in a very modular way and could be packaged together with a CPU or could be integrated on a PCI card that plugs into a server in the cloud. The d-Matrix technology is designed to help accelerate AI inference, with its DIMC technology that provides high performance and low latency.

With Microsoft’s Project Bonsai, d-Matrix now has a compiler that can build deep reinforcement learning tools for its silicon. A key end goal for d-Matrix is to help support the continued growth and deployment of generative AI models.

“We want to enable [generative AI models] because it takes a lot of processing power, there are latency constraints and it is user facing,” Bhoja said. “You have to be able to do it in a very energy-efficient way so that the data centers don’t have to bring in more power….”",New Microsoft partnership accelerates generative AI development,https://venturebeat.com/ai/new-microsoft-partnership-accelerates-generative-ai-development/

Watch now.

Nvidia has announced several significant advances and partnerships to extend the Omniverse into scientific applications on top of high-performance computer (HPC) systems. This will support scientific digital twins that join together data silos currently existing across different apps, models, instruments and user experiences. This work will expand upon Nvidia’s progress in building out the Omniverse for entertainment, industry, infrastructure, robotics, self-driving cars and medicine.

The Omniverse platform uses special-purpose connectors to dynamically translate and align 3D data from dozens of formats and applications on the fly. Changes in one tool, application or sensor are dynamically reflected in other tools and views that look at the same building, factory, road or human body from different perspectives.

Scientists are using it to model fusion reactors, cellular interactions and planetary systems. Today, scientists spend a lot of time translating data between tools and then manually tweaking the data representation, model configuration and 3D rendering engines to see the results. Nvidia wants to use the USD (universal scene description) format as an intermediate data tier to automate this process.

Nvidia lead product manager of accelerated computing, Dion Harris, explained, “The USD format allows us to have a single standard by which you can represent all those different data types in a single complex model. You could go in and somehow build an API specifically for a certain type of data, but that process would not be scalable and extendable to other use cases or other sorts of data regimes.”

Here are the major updates:

Nvidia Omniverse now connects to scientific computing visualization tools on systems powered by Nvidia A100 and H100 Tensor Core GPUs.

Supports larger scientific and industrial digital twins using Nvidia OVX and Omniverse Cloud.

Enhances Holoscan to support scientific use cases in addition to medical. New APIs for C++ and Python will make it easier for researchers to build sensor data processing workflows for Holoscan.

Added connections to Kitware’s ParaView for visualization, Nvidia IndeX for volumetric rendering, Nvidia Modulus for Physics-ML, and Neural VDB for large-scale sparse volumetric representation.

MetroX-3 extends the range of the Nvidia Quantum-2 InfiniBand Platform up to 25 miles. This will make connecting scientific instruments spread across a large facility or campus easier.

Nvidia BlueField-3 DPUs will help orchestrate data management at the edge.

Building bigger twins

Processing latency is one of the biggest challenges with building Omniverse workflows that span many tools and applications. While it is one thing to translate between a few file formats or tools, creating live connections between many requires serious computing horsepower. The larger Nvidia A100 and H100 could help reduce the latency in running the larger models, and support for Nvidia OVX and Omniverse Cloud will help enterprises scale composable digital twins across more building blocks.

Nvidia created a demo showing how these new capabilities can simulate more aspects of data centers. Earlier this year, they reported on work to simulate data center network hardware and software. Now they can bring together engineering designs from tools like Autodesk Revit, PTC Creo and Trimble SketchUp to share designs across different engineering teams. These can be combined with port maps in Patch Manager for planning cabling and physical connectivity within the data center. Then Cadence 6SigmaDCX can help analyze heat flows, and Nvidia Modulus can create faster surrogate models to do what-if analysis in real time.

Nvidia is also working on a partnership with Lockheed Martin on a project for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They plan to use the Omniverse as part of an Earth observation digital twin to monitor the environment and gather data from ground stations, satellites and sensors into one model. This could help improve our understanding of glacial melting, model climate impacts, assess drought risks and prevent wildfires.

This digital twin will work with Lockheed’s OpenRosetta3D to store data, apply artificial intelligence (AI) and build connectors with various tools and apps that are standardized using the USD format to represent and share data across the system. Nvidia Nucleus will translate between native data formats and the USD format, and then deliver those to Lockheed’s Agatha 3D viewer, based on Unity, to visualize data from multiple sensors and models.

Harris believes these enhancements will usher in a new era of digital twins that evolves from passively reflecting a model of the world to actively shaping the world. A two-way connection will leverage IoT, AI and the cloud to issue commands to equipment in the field. For example, Nvidia is working with Lockheed Martin on using digital twins to help direct satellites to focus on areas at increased risk of forest fires.

64,Meta and Twitter's AI and ML layoffs matter because they signal a shift in the world of ML talent and a responsible AI reckoning.,artificial intelligence,14/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pink-slips-layoffs-shutterstock-eric-von-seggern.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

Ten days ago, as part of mass Twitter layoffs, the company’s entire ethical artificial intelligence (AI) team — which worked to make Twitter’s algorithms more transparent and fair — was let go. The team, called ML Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability, was led by Rumman Chowdhury, who is well known for her leadership in the field of applied algorithmic ethics.

Meanwhile, Meta’s layoffs last week of 11,000 employees, or 13% of the company’s workforce, included an entire 50-person research team focused on machine learning (ML) infrastructure, called Probability. The Probability team was made up of 19 people doing Bayesian modeling, 9 people doing ranking and recommendations, 5 people doing ML efficiency, 17 people doing AI for chip design and compilers, as well as managers, according to one researcher on the team.

Both sets of layoffs matter, say experts, because they signal a shift in the landscape of even the most sought-after AI and ML talent, as well as a reckoning for Big Tech and enterprise business in terms of how they respond regarding their own responsible AI efforts.

Meta AI and ML leaders get pink slips

Georgios Gousios, head of research at software company Endor Labs and associate professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, told VentureBeat by email that Meta’s Probability team was the “equivalent of an elite army tactical squad.”

Event Intelligent Security Summit Learn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies on December 8. Register for your free pass today. Register Now

Gousios, who worked on the Probability team from October 2020 to February 2022, said while Facebook had a lot of developers working on various parts of the tech stack and business, Probability was doing work “that is orthogonal to everyday software production, aiming to invent and apply new tools/methods that would make the other teams more efficient in their everyday job.”

This included, he explained, probabilistic programming (writing programs where variables are represented by distributions, rather than single values), differentiable programming (making neural networks more efficient), and applications for software engineering, such as tools that use ML to help engineers both write code faster with fewer bugs, as well as debug inevitable problems more quickly.

“The quality of the team was extremely high,” he said. “Many of us (including me) were coming from years of academic research; many had decades of industrial research experiences in places like Microsoft Research or Bell Labs. I think more than 60% had Ph.D.s.”

Many in the AI and ML field expressed surprise at the layoffs, given how highly-prized the Probability team was.

According to Nantas Nardelli, senior research scientist at climate tech AI company Carbon Re, these were some of the best in the field, but not as well-known as other researchers.

“They tend to produce work that is perhaps less flashy, but that might end up becoming the backbone of ML products in 5-10 years,” he told VentureBeat in a LinkedIn message.

Their ML work, he explained, is “well-applicable” to problems with a low or medium amount of data, high-domain knowledge, and where it is important to estimate uncertainty. “This expertise is generally challenging to acquire, and fewer and fewer people are specializing in it nowadays,” he said.

Twitter ethical AI layoffs offer lessons to enterprises

Triveni Gandhi, responsible AI lead at data science and ML platform Dataiku, said she was not surprised by the ethical AI layoffs at Twitter.

“My gut reaction was, of course they are the first to be laid off, because of the way the current leadership at Twitter has indicated what they think about questions around ethics and trust and security,” she told VentureBeat.

But as a responsible AI lead, she added, she also began to think about what the news meant for her enterprise clients: “Are they also going to start thinking, well, we don’t need this stuff?”

However, she said she realized that the public reaction to the layoffs was indicative of how important and well-respected ethical AI has become.

“I think that other companies see this very public reduction of that specific team, and they think, I don’t want to go down the same path,” she said. “I don’t want to create a sense of mistrust among the consumers of my AI products.”

Among her clients, she added, she is seeing a “sense of resolve” coming out of the news of Twitter’s ethical AI layoffs. “They’re saying, ‘we can be better than that, we’re going to enable [responsible AI teams] and start getting them to put stuff into practice,’” she said. “Like, let’s move away from the thought leadership stuff about this and get rubber on the road.”",Why Meta and Twitter’s AI and ML layoffs matter | The AI Beat,https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-meta-and-twitters-ai-and-ml-layoffs-matter-the-ai-beat/

At its core lies the idea of “social innovation,” a modality involving the creation of new social services and models that are applicable in a multinational paradigm.

Examples of “social innovation” include public libraries, open universities, and worker’s rights movements. But there’s more to it than just bringing people together to solve problems or attempting to create an atmosphere of equality.

A social service that’s successful in affluent urban areas could be completely useless in a rural setting, and vice versa. Taking into account the human factor, how climate crisis and other environmental factors affect different communities, and the difficulties faced by minorities and refugees, the challenge of serving the EU’s agenda across national lines becomes exponentially more difficult.

Greetings, humanoids Subscribe to our newsletter now for a weekly recap of our favorite AI stories in your inbox.

However, that hasn’t stopped the global community from rising to the challenge. In the time since the agenda was instituted, the social innovation sector has grown from a handful of organizations attempting to provide multinational citizen services and solutions, to a comprehensive ecosystem containing thousands of actors working across more than 150 countries. This has brought about a glut of riches, so to speak.

Up until recently, numerous attempts over the past couple of decades to codify the number of ongoing social innovation projects, resources, and services have brought little success. According to a team of researchers in Europe, “there has been a lack of a comprehensive data to study social innovation.”

The team, comprised of researchers from the Universities of Strathclyde and Manchester in the UK and the University of Leon in Spain, recently published the results of a comprehensive study wherein they used machine learning and artificial intelligence to create the European Social Innovation Database (ESID).

So just how many social innovation projects did it find? As stated in the headline of this article, it was a whopping 11,456. Prior attempts at building a similar database averaged between 500 and 1,000 entries.

The research team was able to expand those numbers significantly by employing text crawlers to find data online and AI to separate, label, and score that data. Essentially, the team built their own search and ranking systems for social innovation projects. That might sound only slightly more interesting than building an AI that sorts through Google Search outputs, but it’s actually quite innovative in its own right.

The problem with social innovation is that it’s a bit of a nebulous term. We can, for example, measure how many people in a given geography died in a specific year and how old they were. From that data we can glean the average lifespan and mortality rate. But what we can’t do, with that particular database, is figure out whether local library campaigns inviting seniors in the EU to get free blood pressure checks at regular intervals are having any effect on either of those data points.

The ESID database bridges the gap between reported knowledge and available knowledge by a significant amount. Traditional datasets rely on accurate reporting. With the automated system, the team’s able to make the data come to them. Or to be more accurate, they’re able to speed up the data-gathering process exponentially through the use of machines.

More importantly however, the database is also quite robust. Its primary audience is researchers who want to know how well social innovation initiatives are working. And, to that end, it breaks the data down by categories including a summary of the project, its geography, topic, and four different kinds of scores meant to further break down the projects by how the term “social innovation” is being defined.

The more granular the data becomes, the more difficult it is for humans to parse without the help of AI.

In the future, the researchers hope to expand the scope of projects the system is able to find and to give it the ability to keep entries in the database up to date as their sources change over time. For now, however, those interested in checking out what’s almost certainly the world’s largest searchable social innovation database can click here to get to the official ESID website.","UK researchers used AI to uncover a whopping 11,456 social innovation projects online",https://thenextweb.com/news/uk-researchers-used-ai-uncover-a-whopping-11456-social-innovation-projects-online

NUSA DUA, Indonesia — A highly anticipated meeting between China's leader Xi Jinping and President Biden finished Monday with both leaders expressing an openness to restoring channels of communication and repairing a relationship that has been compared to a second Cold War.

The leaders of two superpowers met face-to-face and unmasked on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, on Monday evening. In a substantial meeting, they touched on the war in Ukraine, military tension in the Taiwan Strait and North Korean missile tests.

Biden said he and Xi were ""very blunt with one another."" Xi, according to his spokesperson, viewed the meeting as ""in-depth, candid and constructive.""

Here's what you need to know about their three-hour discussion.

A ""baby step"" — but a step in the right direction

Biden and Xi both said in their opening remarks that they were looking for ways to coexist despite their disagreements. The two spent lots of time together when they were both vice presidents more than a decade ago — and both men referenced their lengthy relationship in warm greetings before the talks began.

""Do I believe he's willing to compromise on certain issues? Yes,"" Biden told reporters afterward about his meeting with Xi. ""We were very blunt with one another about places where we disagreed.""

Today's meeting was the first face-to-face exchange between the two since Biden became president. It took place after both leaders had just strengthened their respective political positions at home, analysts say.

Yu Jie, a senior research fellow on China at the London-based think tank Chatham House, says that given Biden's ""reasonable success"" in the midterms, he is in a stronger position to steer Washington's relationship with Beijing.

And for Xi, Yu says his further consolidation of power in the Chinese system may leave him more space for conducting diplomacy. ""Xi is keen to resume a routinized mechanism and dialogue to steady the bilateral ties with Biden,"" she says.

U.S. officials share this relative optimism. ""The fact of a leaders' meeting coming together has created space in the Chinese system, for reopening what we believe to just be simply ongoing work between our side to get things done,"" a senior administration official told reporters before the meeting.

In what analysts called a ""breakthrough,"" Beijing and Washington said they would resume climate talks that had been frozen following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's controversial visit to Taiwan in August, which Beijing claims as its own. The White House said the leaders ""agreed to empower key senior officials to maintain communication and deepen constructive efforts.""

However, Yu warns that Monday's meeting is just ""a baby step"" towards improving relations: ""It will not resolve any substantial grievances both sides have had against each other, but only slowing down the deterioration of their relations.""

The State Department said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will also visit China in person sometime early next year to follow up on the Xi-Biden meeting.

Taiwan, technology and human rights remain areas of intense disagreement

During their meeting, Biden and Xi did not resolve the key issues that have driven competition and disagreement between the U.S. and China.

Last month, the U.S. imposed dramatic export bans on certain advanced semiconductor technology — trade sanctions explicitly designed to hobble critical technology sectors like military modernization and artificial intelligence that are important to China.

Meanwhile, according to the U.S. readout, Biden ""raised concerns about PRC practices in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, and human rights more broadly."" China has long insisted these issues are of ""internal affairs"" and has warned against ""external interference.""

""The world is big enough for the two countries to develop themselves and prosper together,"" tweeted Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokesperson who accompanied Xi in his meeting with Biden.

On Taiwan, despite intense media speculation over Beijing's intention, Biden said he did ""not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images

But the president objected to Beijing's ""coercive and increasingly aggressive"" Chinese actions in the waters around Taiwan, according to the White House readout, adding such behaviors ""undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the broader region, and jeopardize global prosperity.""

China regards the ""Taiwan question"" an internal matter. It is ""at the very core of China's core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations,"" wrote Hua, the spokesperson, on Twitter after the meeting ended.

After decades focused on the Middle East, the U.S. military shifts to the Pacific After decades focused on the Middle East, the U.S. military shifts to the Pacific Listen · 5:05 5:05

Both Chinese and American militaries have recently been beefing up their capabilities in case of a conflict over Taiwan. For Washington, this is also a part of the broader paradigm shift in its strategy in the Indo-Pacific region. After decades of concentrating its fighting power in the Middle East, the U.S. is now shifting its focus to Asia.

China is watching closely, too. Xi recently appointed a new slate of top military leaders from China's Eastern Theater Command, which encompasses Taiwan, indicating that going forward, the island is a priority for China's fighting forces. Last week, he urged his military to ""focus all its energy on fighting.""

Ukraine and North Korea were elephants in the room

The U.S. has pushed China to take a clearer stand against Russia's war in Ukraine, which China has tried to remain neutral on despite signing a partnership with Moscow in February.

Some analysts say China appeared to be blindsided when Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Beijing has called repeatedly for a peaceful, negotiated end to the war.

During their meeting, Xi and Biden agreed ""that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won and underscored their opposition to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine,"" according to the White House statement. The Chinese readout included no mention of nuclear weapons.

The two leaders also spoke about North Korea — a longstanding regional security issue. Biden warned if Beijing is unable to rein in Pyongyang's weapons ambitions, the U.S. would beef up its presence in the region — a move that will be read by Beijing as a threat to its own security.

U.S. domestic politics also plays a role

Last year, China's foreign minister Wang Yi put out three core demands — ""bottom lines"" — that China wanted the U.S. to agree to in order for relations to improve: to not get in the way in the country's development, to respect China's claims over places like Taiwan and to respect Beijing's Communist Party rule.

From Beijing's perspective, the U.S. has since done the opposite on all counts. It has imposed the semiconductor export bans and sanctioned some of China's leading technology firms — moves Beijing decried.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has upped ties with Taiwan, with lawmakers including Pelosi visiting the island since August. Congress is considering drawing on the U.S. weapons stockpile to arm the island at American expense. Biden stressed in the press conference after meeting Xi that U.S. policy on Taiwan remains unchanged.

And while Biden came in to the G20 with a stronger position due to the narrow Democratic victory in the battle to control the Senate, he is up for reelection in two years himself.

Many in China now worry that should Republicans win the presidency in 2024, the U.S. will take an even more starkly hostile position against it.

Meta laid off 11,000 employees, or 13% of its workforce, amid falling revenues from advertising and e-commerce. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is also considering other cost-cutting measures, and suggested it would close offices. In a separate filing it said it expects losses to grow significantly next year at its Reality Labs division, at a time when investors are already frustrated with Meta’s focus on creating a metaverse at the expense of the rest of the business. Mark Zuckerberg said he took full responsibility. The company’s market value is now around $270bn, down from $1trn in September 2021.

The great tech shake-out

Meta was not the only big tech company to announce job cuts. Stripe, an online payments firm, is letting go of 14% of its workforce, and Lyft, a ride-hailing company, of 13%. Amazon has introduced a freeze on hiring for its corporate jobs. Twitter laid off half its staff following Elon Musk’s takeover, though it has reportedly asked some of them to come back.

More than 12m people signed up to Disney+ in the three months to October 1st, taking the total number of subscribers to 164m. That is a faster rate of growth in users than at Netflix, though Netflix has 223m subscribers. Operating losses at Disney+ have soared, however, causing Disney’s share price to drop by 13%. Following Netflix, it is introducing an ad-supported subscription plan next month to entice consumers and generate new revenue streams.

Apple issued a rare warning about delays to supplies of the iPhone. It now expects fewer shipments of iPhone 14 models, and longer waiting times for customers, because of covid-19 restrictions at the factory that assembles the device in Zhengzhou, China. The plant is operated by Foxconn, which has shifted some of the iPhone’s production to India, and may transfer more if China becomes an unreliable centre for production.

Advancing its ambitions in the electric-car market, Foxconn said it would invest $170m in Lordstown Motors, a startup that is developing an electric-powered pick-up truck at a factory in Ohio.

Renault is rearranging its business around five divisions, including one based on “new mobility, energy and data-based services”. The overhaul accelerates the flotation of its electric-vehicle unit, Ampere, next year. Renault also launched a joint venture with Geely, a Chinese carmaker, to make internal-combustion, hybrid and plug-in hybrid engines. The arrival of electric cars has meant that the industry must shift gears “from soccer to pentathlon”, said Renault’s boss.

In Britain speculation mounted that the government will impose a road tax on electric vehicles for the first time when it unveils a budget on November 17th. EV s are currently exempt from the tax, but the government is looking at ways to offset a fall in revenues from fuel duties because of the switch away from petrol to electric.

The global cryptocurrency market was shaken by the looming collapse of FTX , one of the biggest exchanges, after a run of customer withdrawals left it facing a liquidity crunch. FTX turned to Binance, an arch-rival, for help. Binance at first said it would take over FTX , but then pulled out of the deal, citing reports that FTX had “ mishandled customer funds” and was being investigated by the authorities. Cryptocurrency prices plunged. Bitcoin fell to around $16,000, its lowest level in two years.

Nvidia has developed a new chip that can be exported to China without violating the American government’s ban on selling technology in semiconductors to the Chinese. The ban has hit sales of Nvidia’s high-end microchips for use in artificial intelligence, data centres and supercomputers.

Covid lockdowns affecting manufacturers and their suppliers lay behind a surprise fall in China’s exports, which dropped by 0.3% in October, year on year. Imports also declined, marking the first simultaneous contraction in both categories of trade since May 2020, in the heat of the pandemic. China, meanwhile, has become Russia’s top trading partner, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, after EU sanctions targeted the Russian economy.

Undersea drones have come a long way from the days when they were basically motorized television eyes operated by remote control at the end of a tether. Today, these machines are becoming increasingly sophisticated with a growing range of capabilities that may one day not only see submarines deploying and recovering drones routinely, but could find conventional warships relegated to command centers overseeing robotic submarine fleets.

Based on HII's REMUS 300 UUV, the medium-class sized REMUS 620 is designed to support both current and predicted US Navy and special forces operations thanks to an improved battery system with a life of 110 hours. This not only provides the REMUS 620 with longer mission times, but enough range to ferry itself to and from its operational sites. Potential missions include mine countermeasures, hydrographic surveys, intelligence operations, surveillance, and electronic warfare.

The REMUS 620 boasts a modular open architecture and incorporates HII's Odyssey autonomy suite that provides the drone with artificial intelligence, autonomous health monitoring, and sensor fusion and perception, as well as the ability to collaborate with other robotic vehicles.

In addition, the modular design allows the batteries to be quickly swapped for fast turnaround times or to incorporate alternative energy sources. The standard synthetic aperture sonar unit can also be replaced or augmented to suit mission requirements.

According to HII, the REMUS 620 can be launched from submarines, small crewed or uncrewed boats, amphibious ships, surface warships, and helicopters. It can also deploy robotic craft and payloads of its own while underwater.

""Retaining a forward strategic advantage requires the ability to deliver a multitude of effects from under the sea,"" said Duane Fotheringham, president of HII's Mission Technologies’ Unmanned Systems business group. ""The REMUS 620 is the first medium UUV designed to accurately deliver this range of advanced above-and-below water effects at long range.""

Founded in 2019, Luxonis has so far focused on developing high-res OAK camera systems with built-in depth sensing and AI processing. Now that stereo vision tech has been packed into an open-source rolling robot called rae – which stands for robotics access for everyone – and launched on Kickstarter.

""rae is representative of our foremost goal at Luxonis: to make robotics accessible and simple for anyone, not just the tenured engineer with years of programming experience,"" said company CEO, Brandon Gilles. ""A longstanding truth about robotics is that the barrier to entry sometimes feels impossibly high, but it doesn’t have to be that way. By creating rae, we want to help demonstrate the kinds of positive impacts robotics can bring to all people's lives, whether it's as simple as helping you find your keys, talking with your friend who uses American Sign Language, or playing with your kids.""

Two motorized wheels to the rear with encoders for positioning precision and the ability to roll over multiple surfaces, plus 40 RGB LEDs for a custom lightshow Luxonis

Robot rae measures 4.75 x 4.75 x 1.3 in (120 x 120 x 32 mm) and weighs in at 14 oz (400 g), and comes with two motor-driven wheels (with encoders) under its durable metal housing balanced out by two free-rolling wheels to the front. And despite its diminutive proportions, it's reported capable of rolling over multiple surface types, including carpet, wood floor, tiles, grass and gravel.

RGB LED lighting runs around rae's bottom edge for some funky programmable visuals, it sports a Sony IMX214 4K camera module in front for streaming hi-res video plus a LCD display that can be user-programmed via a companion app. Luxonis has also included its OAK stereo camera system in the shape of two forward-facing OV9782 sensors and two more around back.

The system combines machine learning and computer vision technology in one unit, and boasts Robotic Vision Core 3 processing supported by 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are onboard as well, there's an array of six microphones for voice interaction plus an integrated 1-W speaker, and rae is powered by a 5,000-mAh Li-Po battery for around an hour's use between charging.

It's ready to use as soon as it's charged up and paired with a smartphone running the mobile app, which gives access to control functions, settings and a database, as well as cooked-in applications for playing games, problem solving tasks and a host of functions like locating objects, room mapping, emotion recognition, time-lapse recording and even sign language interpretation.

Within rae's durable metal enclosure are four depth-sensing camera modules, a 4K video camera, onboard Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, an hour-per-charge battery, and a powerful vision processing unit Luxonis

The ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) platform comes pre-installed and preconfigured for access to its libraries and tools. Users can also create their own apps and models to get rae to perform custom tasks, or equip the robot with additional hardware and accessories, and they get access to the company's cloud platform for online learning, community collaborations, download/install of user-created apps and more.

With four successful Kickstarters under its belt, Luxonis has returned to the crowdfunding portal to fund production of rae, where pledges currently start at US$399. If all goes to plan with the already funded campaign, shipping is estimated to start in June 2023. The video below has more.

The AI is also capable of picking out someone who is smoking. All eight stadiums are smoke free. They are all currently locked down to all but accredited Fifa and local organising personnel.



Abdulrahiman did concede that some AI programmes struggled to distinguish between the expressions of supporters simply angry at their team’s performance and those who might be on the brink of violence. Face paint can also affect that calculation.



Nevertheless, the Qatari organisers do not anticipate violence on any major scale. The most serious prohibited behaviour they most often have to deal with is excited fans standing on seats. “We inform ground forces and they can request them to sit in their seats,” Abdulrahiman said. “The purpose is that we have a safe game, that the fans enjoy it and they go home with sweet memories of the Qatar World Cup.”



The centre has already taken charge of 75 events including the Fifa Arab Cup earlier this year and, after the World Cup, the AFC Asian Football Cup comes next year. Asked directly to guarantee there would be no repetition of the chaos that engulfed the Euro 2020 final at Wembley and then the Stade de France in May, Abdulrahiman said “we have the tools and technology to protect people”. He added: “We are well prepared for this scenario and to a great extent we will be able to avoid it [before it happens].”

The strategy behind the technology is to anticipate problems. Even a single fan trying to swipe a ticket at the wrong gate will set off an alarm in the command centre and ground forces will be told immediately to guide the person away to prevent congestion forming.



The command centre’s AI can count fans in a certain area of a stadium and calculate if there are too many for the planned capacity. It can also use facial recognition technology to review the thousands of hours of footage in its archive. Abdulrahiman, and the centre’s director Hamad Ahmed al-Mohannadi, said that the intense surveillance was not undertaken with a view to prosecutions or data gathering but with the emphasis on security.



Nevertheless, supporters can expect their movements to be monitored in detail at World Cup venues in Qatar and all over the peninsula. Abdulrahiman acknowledged that the tournament could well be a target for a cyber attack. “We are all under that risk and the World Cup is no different. What we can do is be prepared for it. You have to build your defence, get the right tools and the right skillset in people.

A podcaster steps up to a mic to do a review of a new chicken nugget brand. As he begins talking and recording himself on his laptop, real-time speech-to-text transcribes his comments: “So these nuggets are, um, made from chicken, but they’re made to um, um, um, um, emulate the taste of, like, like, non chicken nuggets.”

That doesn’t sound very professional; on his screen, he strikes through those filler words — and while he’s at it, boosts the podcast’s sound quality before publishing it for his audience.

This is one use case for audio-video editing tool Descript, which today announced a significant product update and a $50 million series C round led by the OpenAI Startup Fund.

The growing field of generative AI

Generative AI is a hotly-discussed topic of late: Next-gen tools are seeing significant gains in just a short period of time.

Just this week, IMARC Group released a study forecasting the global generative AI market size to exhibit a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 20% between 2022 and 2027.

As noted by Gartner distinguished VP analyst, Arun Chandrasekaran, much of the technology progress in generative AI owes its origins to technical advancements in its underpinning foundation models.

Large labs, including OpenAI, Google Brain and Microsoft Research, are deploying vast resources to build these large-scale models, he said, and cloud computing provides a “tremendous avenue” for them to reach developers who want to try them without spending too much money or undergoing complex training.

Thus, use cases are expanding, Chandrasekaran pointed out. For instance, due to advances in prompt engineering, foundation models are capable of generating “original and coherent text in a highly contextualized way,” he said, which lends itself to use cases including writing headlines and paragraphs, creating product descriptions, generating conversational responses and completing text.

Foundation models are also increasingly being used in broader natural language capacities, such as summarization, rewriting, language translation and classification. And, fine-tuned diffusion models such as Dall-E 2 and Stable Diffusion are creating images from text, which can be extremely useful for synthetic data generation for scenarios where real data is scarce or unavailable.

“The image generation capabilities could positively affect design and marketing functions within the enterprise,” Chandrasekaran said, “enabling them to create faster and better visuals for websites, blogs, ads and other content.”

Chandrasekaran forecasted that generative AI use cases where humans act as filters — aiding in content creation — will be adopted far more quickly than automatic content creation. As an augmentation technology to human tasks, he noted, there will be rapid adoption of foundation models in the next few years.

“In the future, we will see more use case-specific models as well as more innovation in the open-source community,” said Chandrasekaran, “which will hopefully enhance the access and transparency of these models.”

A new kind of video editor

When it comes to video and generative AI, Descript calls itself a “new kind of video editor that’s as easy as using a word processor.”

The company’s platform enables users to record themselves and their screen, write, storyboard, collaborate and edit in real time. For instance, they can remove silence and filler words (like the above-mentioned podcaster), overdub and add crossfades, titles, shapes and images.

As LeBoeuf explained, the company uses AI to create a text-to-speech voice that sounds like a user, so they can make corrections to recordings by deleting or typing in new words (as one would with a doc). The Studio Sound feature addresses issues around technical problems that creators struggle with, such as poor sound quality caused by an echoey room or bad mic.

“These are very practical use cases that enable a new class of people to edit video for whom it would have been prohibitively time-consuming otherwise,” said LeBoeuf.

Akin to making a slideshow, any creator in any type of workflow can create anything from simple screen recordings, all the way up to sophisticated narratives, with multiple layers of video, b-roll and audio, with video and audio effects and transitions, said LeBoeuf.

The company has quickly made progress improving its AI features, he said, and has reduced the length of time users need to set up their voice in Overdub, its text-to-speech voice-cloning service.

LeBoeuf pointed out that Descript powers many YouTube and TikTok channels, “9 out of the 10 top podcast publishers.” As well as businesses, including Shopify and HubSpot, that use video for marketing, sales and internal training and collaboration.

“The stage is set for video to take its place alongside text as something everyone uses to create and communicate — the only things holding it back are the tools,” said Andrew Mason, Descript CEO. “With the new Descript, we’ve replaced the drudgery of timeline editing with a tool that’s as familiar as the word processor — so you can make, edit and share video without breaking your creative flow.”

Similarly, one of Descript’s competitors, Runway, recently rolled out a tool that can edit video from written prompts; others in the emerging space include Type Studio and Reduct.

Empowering creation with generative AI

Descript’s enhanced platform now includes more than 30 new visual and AI-powered editing tools, including:

Premium stock media: Free access to millions of premium stock videos, images, sound effects and music tracks.

Templates: A gallery of layouts, title sequences and social clips (or creators can make their own).

Multitrack screen recording: Descript’s recorder is now integrated into the editor, with separate tracks for screen and camera.

Green screen: Creators can put their videos in any setting with AI background-removal capabilities.

Write mode: Creators can use Overdub to write their script in Descript while laying out visuals as they go. Then, they can choose one of its realistic text-to-speech voices, or swap it out with their own recording.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s COO and manager of the OpenAI Startup Fund, lauded Descript for bridging the divide between idea and creation.

“We started the OpenAI Startup Fund to accelerate the impact that companies building on powerful AI will have on the world,” he said, “and we’re particularly excited about tools that empower people creatively.”

Andreessen Horowitz, Redpoint Ventures, Spark Capital and Daniel Gross also participated in the round, which brings the company’s total funding to $100 million.",How Descript’s generative AI makes video editing as easy as updating text,https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-descripts-generative-ai-makes-video-editing-as-easy-as-updating-text/

Picture the moment you arrive at a theater to attend a concert, talk, or play. Anticipation builds as you walk through the warmly lit entryway, ticket in hand. Ascending the stairs, the doors swing open to reveal the grand scale of the space, the murmuring audience, and the spot-lit stage. As you find your seat, the lights dim, the curtains part, and the opening music swells. The show is about to begin.

Events are defined by their rituals, their sense of mounting thrill and narrative progression. From the moment you approach the entrance all the way until the final applause dies down, a well-designed theater will impart a sense of shared occasion and purpose. Historically, people are great at building these venues — spaces that enhance the quality of our communal experiences — in the physical world. And it is just as possible to build them in a virtual one.

With virtual reality (VR) steadily entering the mainstream — just this month, news broke on two new headsets from Meta and Sony, both set to broaden VR adoption — it’s vital that designers create virtual spaces that acknowledge our humanity. As someone who designs virtual venues used by thousands, I want to share the learnings my team and I have gathered so that other designers can create experiences that will remain in memory long after the headsets come off.

Take inspiration from the real world, but note the differences

The fundamentals of virtual event spaces are similar to those of real-life venues, and so is the process of designing them. Often, our design team brings in architects to ensure we learn from real-world principles.

“There are considerations specific to the audience, the program, and the context — it’s just that this audience is made up of avatars and the context is virtual,” says architect Christopher Daniel, who designs both real and virtual performance venues. “We have the opportunity to work with features from a concert hall in Berlin or a theater in Buenos Aires, sidestep physical limitations, and create virtual places that feel both fantastical and authentic.”

Bear in mind that virtual spaces do have different demands, however. We’ve found that virtual audience members require more space between seats to feel comfortable. And sight lines from seats to stage must allow for the fact that audience members are simultaneously in the room together, as well as around the world in separate physical environments. This means that avatars often move more often, and more erratically, than they would in a physical venue. To ensure that other audience members aren’t distracted, we typically make each seating tier higher than it would be in a physical space, with the seats more spread out.

Be specific with your material choices

Creating convincing virtual experiences is an exercise in world-building. Whether an environment is wholly fantastical or based in reality, that it feels “true” is an essential factor in its immersive potential.

We experience virtual worlds up close, which means that every environment requires attention to fine detail. From the kind of stone chosen to the cut and grain of wood — think mahogany or red cedar, not just “brown wood” — a high level of craftsmanship will make your space feel like a destination to which people will want to return.

Design virtual spaces with audio in mind

The most convincing virtual reality spaces are multisensory, so a thoughtful use of audio elements is key to placing the audience inside a new world. There are many techniques to consider, including environmental sound, spatially anchored sound, audio feedback to reward specific interactions, or a mix of each.

Regardless of your approach, effective spatial audio adds tangibility to a space while deepening the impact of compelling visuals. The sound of distant lapping waves, or a seagull passing overhead, can bring a space to life, so consider how your landscape contributes to your soundscape.

Empathize with your audience

Virtual reality poses a new challenge to creatives: When you can make anything, how do you choose where to begin?

An initial discovery phase is key to deepening understanding of a space’s purpose and intended audience. How do you want your guests to feel? How will the space serve them? Or surprise them? The aim is for artists, user experience (UX) designers, and technologists to be open to inspiration at this stage while keeping the audience and the event’s purpose top of mind.

At this point, it’s also critical to establish constraints and define what the environment is not. We often use Miro and Pinterest boards to highlight elements to avoid — low ceilings, strip lighting, flashy chrome — so that we don’t build something generic or characterless. This process helps the creative team eliminate ambiguity, build a shared visual vocabulary, and air out any assumptions.

Think of your virtual event as a story

With each virtual reality event, we are telling a story with a beginning and an end, much like a real-life performance. To ensure attendees feel that narrative progression, it’s helpful to provide cues inspired by screenwriting fundamentals, like the classic three-act structure.

The start of each event, for example, should serve as your first act, one that’s characterized by scene-setting and exposition. Welcome your guests in, show them around, and provide initial information that inspires them to explore more. It’s important to guide attendees — many of whom might be new to virtual reality — gently from the start before escalating complexity.

That rising action should culminate in the event’s keynote presentation or performance, generating a different audience response. It’s also vital that guests understand what to do when the main event ends by providing clear next steps for exiting the space and moving on.

Humanity will remain vital even as technology evolves

Like most technology, virtual reality is evolving exceptionally quickly. Today’s designers face the task of optimizing experiences around the constraints of current headsets while also preparing for the next evolution. The future will present even greater challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI), for example, will soon generate not just concept art but entire virtual worlds.

Designing spaces with storytelling at their heart will continue to be a human differentiator. As we venture out into the metaverse, let’s not forget our humanity.

GPT-3, a text-generating language model. PaLM-540B, a stunningly powerful question-answering language model. Great Palm- A hypothetical language model that combines the powers of GPT-3 and PaLM-540B. Probably buildable with current technology. Great Palm with continuous learning (GPWCL)- A hypothetical language model that combines the capacities of GPT-3 and PaLM-540B, and has additional power. Most language models work over a “window” of text, functioning as short-term memory. Their long-term memory is set by their training. Continuous learning is the capacity to keep adding to long-term memory as you go, and this would allow a language model to tackle much longer texts.

N.B., I sometimes use the phrase “an artificial intelligence” which is considered low rent in the field, but ahh well.

The argument

What I’ll be doing in this short essay is a bit cheeky, but I think we’ll make a few important points, viz:

Goals that seem very concrete can turn out to be vulnerable to bar-shifting- shifting which we may scarcely even notice. AGI is such a goal. We have gotten very good, much too good, at denying the progress we have made in AGI. A focus on able-bodied humanity, and the tendency to forget disabled people exist when thinking about these topics, deceives us in these matters.

If I’m being a bit of a gadfly here, it’s not without a purpose.

Everything I say in this article in a sense maybe applies to GPT-3 alone, but for the avoidance of doubt, let me specify that I’m talking about a hypothetical language model that has the fluency of GPT-3 and the question-answering capabilities of PaLM-540B which we will call The Great Palm to make it clear that we’re not taking ourselves too seriously. In my view, The Great Palm is very close to being an AGI.

I think the Great Palm lacks only one thing, the capacity for continuous learning- the capacity to remember the important bits of everything it reads, and not just in its training period. If Great Palm (GPT-3+PaLM540B) had that ability, it would be an AGI.

“But hang on”, you say “Great Palm can’t draw, it can’t play computer games, it can’t listen to music, it can’t so much as discriminate an apple from a banana, and adding on a capacity for continuous learning doesn’t change that”.

I have two responses.

Response 1: Sure, but neither could noted author, activist, and communist intellectual Helen Keller and other completely deaf and blind people, who are all general intellects.

Response 2: Actually, it may be able to do some of these things so long as you can convert them into the modality of text. It’s quite conceivable that Great Palm could analyze music, for example, if the notation were converted into text. We should focus more on content than modality.

Why do I say that Great Palm with a capacity for continuous learning would be an artificial general intelligence? Because it can attempt basically all tasks a human with access to a text input, text output console and nothing more could and make a reasonable go at them. In the case of Great Palm with continuous learning, looking at what PaLM-540B and GPT-3 can do, it’s actually hard to find tasks that the average human can beat it. Look at the MMLU dataset if you don’t believe me- they’re tough questions). That kind of broad scope is comparable to the scope of many humans.

To be clear I am absolutely not saying that, for example, Helen Keller could only answer text input text output problems. There are numerous other sensory modalities-touch taste etc. Helen Keller could navigate a maze, whereas Great-Palm-With-Continuous learning could only do that if the maze were described to it. I suppose this gives a possible line of counterargument. We could disqualify Great-Palm-With-Continuous-Learning by adding a disjunction like “AGIs must be proficient in at least one of touch, taste, smell, sight or hearing”, but that seems arbitrary to me.

I’m not exactly going to proffer a definition of AGI here, but it seems to me that entities that can make a reasonable go at almost all text input text output tasks count as AGIs. At the very least, imposing the need to be able to use particular sensory modalities is not only wrongly human-centric, but it also doesn’t even account for all human experience (e.g. the deaf and blind).

Objections:

What about Commonsense reasoning: Maybe you’re worried about commonsense reasoning. Looking at PaLM’s capabilities, Its performance on commonsense reasoning tasks is human, or very close to it. For example, PaLM 540B scored ~96% on the Winograd Schema test. My recollection is that most humans don’t get this much, but the authors set the bar 100 because they reasoned a human properly paying attention would get full marks. Requiring 100% of human performance on commonsense reasoning tasks to be an AGI seems to me like special pleading. Near enough is good enough to count.

What about the Turing test: Would the Great Palm continuous learning edition be able to pass the Turing test reliably? I don’t know. I’m confident it could pass it sometimes and I’m confident it could pass it more reliably than some humans- humans who are undoubtedly general intelligences. Language models have gotten very good at Turing tests after all.

Surely there are some tasks it cannot do: Is it not possible that there might be some tasks that humans can do that Great Palm with continuous learning (GPWCL) can’t do? I’d say it’s probable! Nonetheless, the great bulk of tasks an average literate human could do, GPWCL can do- and it’s quite difficult to find counterexamples. I think that insisting that AGI requires a computer to be able to perform literally every task a literate human can do is special pleading. If we encountered aliens, for example, it’s quite likely that there would be some tasks the average human can do that the average alien couldn’t do (and vice versa) this wouldn’t exclude either of us from counting as AGI.

Haven’t you just arbitrarily drawn a line around text input, text output problems and said “being able to do the majority of these is enough for AGI”? Sure, definitions of AGI that exclude the deaf and the blind may be wrong, but that doesn’t prove text alone is sufficient. Maybe some third definition that includes Helen Keller, but excludes Great-Palm-With-Continuous-Learning is right: Ultimately, this will come down to definition debate. However when we focus on the content of problems rather than the modality, it becomes clear the range of text input, text output is vast, one might even say general.

What if there are other huge categories of text input text output tasks that Great Palm with continuous learning could not attempt that you are unaware of: Am I certain that continuous learning is the only thing holding something like Great Palm back from the vast bulk of literate-human accessible tasks? No, I’m not certain. I’m very open to counterexamples if you have any, put them in the comments. Nonetheless, PaLM can do a lot of things, GPT-3 can do a lot of things, and when you put them together, the only things that stand out to me as obviously missing in the domain of text input, and text output involve continuous learning.

Am I saying that text input text output is the only way to prove intelligence? Absolutely not! The vast majority of humans who ever lived were illiterate. However, it seems general enough to me to qualify. It is sufficient, not necessary.

Aren’t you treating continuous learning as if it were a very easy problem, a negligble barrier, when it fact it’s very hard?: That’s not my intention. I recognize that it is very hard. That said, at a guess, it is probably possible to make Great-Palm sans continuous learning now. Adding on the continuous learning component will take time, but I would be very surprised if it took anywhere near as much time as it took us to reach GPT-3 and PaLM-540B.

Implications

Turing proposed the Turing test as a test for something like AGI, but since then it seems the concept of AGI has somewhat metastasized. For example, Metaculus gives this as the requirements to qualify as a “weakly general” AGI:

Able to reliably pass a Turing test of the type that would win the Loebner Silver Prize.

Able to score 90% or more on a robust version of the Winograd Schema Challenge, e.g. the ""Winogrande"" challenge or comparable data set for which human performance is at 90+%

Be able to score 75th percentile (as compared to the corresponding year's human students; this was a score of 600 in 2016) on all the full mathematics section of a circa-2015-2020 standard SAT exam, using just images of the exam pages and having less than ten SAT exams as part of the training data. (Training on other corpuses of math problems is fair game as long as they are arguably distinct from SAT exams.)

Be able to learn the classic Atari game ""Montezuma's revenge"" (based on just visual inputs and standard controls) and explore all 24 rooms based on the equivalent of less than 100 hours of real-time play (see closely-related question.)

And this as the definition of a strong AGI:

Able to reliably pass a 2-hour, adversarial Turing test during which the participants can send text, images, and audio files (as is done in ordinary text messaging applications) during the course of their conversation. An 'adversarial' Turing test is one in which the human judges are instructed to ask interesting and difficult questions, designed to advantage human participants, and to successfully unmask the computer as an impostor. A single demonstration of an AI passing such a Turing test, or one that is sufficiently similar, will be sufficient for this condition, so long as the test is well-designed to the estimation of Metaculus Admins.

Has general robotic capabilities, of the type able to autonomously, when equipped with appropriate actuators and when given human-readable instructions, satisfactorily assemble a (or the equivalent of a) circa-2021 Ferrari 312 T4 1:8 scale automobile model. A single demonstration of this ability, or a sufficiently similar demonstration, will be considered sufficient.

High competency at a diverse fields of expertise, as measured by achieving at least 75% accuracy in every task and 90% mean accuracy across all tasks in the Q&A dataset developed by Dan Hendrycks et al..

Able to get top-1 strict accuracy of at least 90.0% on interview-level problems found in the APPS benchmark introduced by Dan Hendrycks, Steven Basart et al. Top-1 accuracy is distinguished, as in the paper, from top-k accuracy in which k outputs from the model are generated, and the best output is selected.

But to me, these aren’t really definitions of AGI. They’re definitions of visual, auditory and kinaesthetic sensory modality utilizing AGI. Putting this as the bar for AGI effectively excludes some disabled people from being general intelligences, which is not desirable! That alone makes it worth correcting. But it also has another undesirable effect. Adding this onto the concept of intelligence is a form of bar-shifting that prevents us from recognizing our progress. This sort of bar shifting is part of a general pattern of thought that means we keep being taken by surprise by our own achievements in machine learning.

Also, the second set of problems particularly, but to a certain degree the first as well, are much too hard. Almost no human being would pass all of the second set of problems. This also contributes to the bar-shifting problem. But that’s a matter for a different essay.

There’s an old joke in the field that intelligence is whatever it is that we can’t get computers to do at the moment. Let’s try to avoid that!",Language models are nearly AGIs but we don't notice,https://philosophybear.substack.com/p/language-models-are-nearly-agis-but

In addition to revolutionising genetic engineering, synthetic biology is also helping to reduce carbon emissions. Startup Solugen Bio is one of the companies utilising synthetic biology, in this case to manufacture chemical-based products using bio-based feedstock instead of fossil fuels.

Solugen Bio uses artificial intelligence (AI) to engineer enzymes and metal catalysts that, in turn, allow the production of molecules at room temperature using bio-based feedstocks, with no toxins and no waste. The company’s ‘Bioforge’ uses feedstocks composed of corn syrup and deionized water. This is pumped into the enzyme reactor, where specially engineered enzymes convert the feedstock to the desired molecules. This produces an ‘intermediate product’ which is then mixed with compressed air and flowed over the company’s engineered metal catalysts. This transforms the compound again into the final product. Once the excess water has been removed, this becomes either a liquid concentrate or a solid ready for shipping. The entire process is also powered using 100 per cent wind-powered electricity, which the company claims is 10 times more efficient than creating steam by burning natural gas.

The company claims that its process can achieve greater than a 90 per cent overall conversion of feedstock to product. Solugen also states that “the entire process generates zero wastewater or air emissions. An interconnected closed drain system allows all of the material we produce to be continuously collected and reworked without generating byproducts or slowing down operations.”

Green chemicals are not the only exciting use for synthetic biology. Springwise has also spotted innovative uses for this technology that include lab-grown, bio-based drugs for use in mental health care and a customised biofertiliser that can be manufactured on-site.

When you think of artificial intelligence (or AI), do you think of sci-fi spaceships trying to kill Dave, weird photos generated by Dall-E that make your uncanny valley itch, or do you think about magic?

Well, Blackmagic Design announced a new update to DaVinci Resolve 18, which has several new features, including, most notably, new artificial intelligence-based tools that can isolate and level out recorded dialogue.

There are also new vertical video formats for social media content that will end up on TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram. So, is this going to put sound mixers out of a job?

New Audio and Dialogue Tools

The DaVinci Resolve 18.1 update includes new tools to the Fairlight Audio Tab, which enabled voice isolation track FX to the DaVinci Neural Engine. This new feature will allow editors to separate voice and dialogue while eliminating ambient noise, such as loud background elements or aircraft sounds. The tools promise to reduce the need to either re-record dialogue in voiceover or reshoot a scene while on location and will likely be a godsend for documentarians and news organizations shooting interviews out in the wild.

Moreover, Fairlight will also gain grid support so that editors can create a grid of edits positioned to be more easily cut by timecode or musical temp. This will make the process of cutting on the beat for music videos and montages to be easier for faster turnaround.

Social Media Aspect Ratios

Meanwhile, Resolve gets several new social media-centric video formats.

The update adds support for vertical resolutions such as 1080x1920, as well as square aspect ratios to make it faster to set up a timeline and produce social media-style videos. Additionally, users will be able to create their own custom thumbnails and channels for uploading videos to YouTube.

Content collaborations will now be able to lock a timeline to prevent two separate users from selecting the same timeline. Multiple editors can now work on different timelines within the same bin simultaneously.

More Magic Masking

Over on the Fusion tab, users can get an expansion of the Magic Mask tool, enabling it to detect animals, vehicles, people, and objects and then track their movement in a shot. This will allow editors to create clean traveling mattes and add effects or backgrounds.

There is also a keyword and category search of Fusion’s 200-plus effects tools and filtering the list to find the proper effect without knowing the exact name.

Users will also be able to use the Resolve FX DustBuster in the editing timeline.

Housekeeping

As for housekeeping fixes, Blackmagic has improved importing of video files when using the ATEM Mini ISO, by attaching audio to video clips. The speed editor has been improved, and there’s now the ability to override the subtitle capture properties individually.

Finally, when editing Dolby Vision 5.1 projects, editors can adjust the brightness levels of HDR video, optimizing clips for either cinema or television broadcasts. The resolution can also be optimized for Windows or Linux to see fonts for titles more easily.

Things Not to Miss

As always, updates to Resolve are free. The DaVinci Resolve 18.1 update is now available from the Blackmagic Design Support Website.

However, that's not what piqued our interest. While the update is a nice addition to an already sprawling editing suite, the inclusion of AI is a really interesting change of pace.

With AI-generated imagery causing quite a stir in the arts community, we're seeing the technology have a huge impact, both big and small. If this audio feature in Resolve works well enough, this will open a ton of doors for creatives on a time crunch or on a budget.

I know more than a few student filmmakers who would give an arm and a leg for this kind of audio support. But will it work better than a dedicated sound mixer? That remains to be seen.

WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration's move to block exports of advanced computer chips to China is signaling a new phase in relations between the globe's two largest economies — one in which trade matters less than an increasingly heated competition to be the world’s leading technological and military power.

The aggressive move, announced last month, will help set the tone for President Joe Biden’s upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Asia. It's evidence of Biden's determination to “manage” the U.S. competition with China, whose officials were quick to condemn the export ban.

After more than two decades in which the focus was on expansion of trade and global growth, both countries are openly prioritizing their national interests as the world economy struggles with high inflation and the risk of recessions. The U.S. and China have each identified the development and production of computer chips as vital for economic growth and their own security interests.

“We’re going to do whatever it takes to protect Americans from the threat of China,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in an interview. “China is crystal clear. They will use this technology for surveillance. They will use this technology for cyber attacks. They will use this technology to, in any number of ways, harm us and our allies, or our ability to protect ourselves.”

Xi responded to the export ban in his statement at last month's congress of the Chinese Communist Party, where he secured a third term as the country's leader. He pledged that China would move more aggressively to become self-reliant in producing semiconductors and other technologies.

“In order to enhance China’s innovation capacity, we will move faster to launch a number of major national projects that are of strategic, big-picture and long-term importance,” Xi said.

The Chinese government has named the development of advanced computer chips that could handle everything from artificial intelligence to hypersonic missiles as one of its top priorities. To bridge the gap until it can get there, China has been relying on imports of advanced chips and manufacturing equipment from the U.S., which imposed a series of export controls last month that block sending to China the world's most advanced chips, factory equipment and industry experts tied to America.

The U.S. and its allies famously deployed export controls against Russia after the February invasion of Ukraine, making it harder for Russian forces to be resupplied with weapons, ammunition, tanks and aircraft. As a result of those constraints, Russia has relied on drones from Iran and the U.S. has accused North Korea of supplying them with artillery.

The U.S. had until recently operated from the premise that strong trade relationships would bring countries closer together in ways that made the world safer and wealthier, a post-Cold War order. Global supply chains were supposed to lower costs, boost profits and enable democratic values to seep into the terrain of oligarchies, dictatorships and autocracies.

But after a global pandemic, the war in Ukraine and China's own ambitions, the Biden administration and many European and Asian allies have chosen to prioritize national security and industrial strategies. Both the U.S. and European Union have provided tens of billions of dollars in incentives to spur more domestic production of computer chips.

In a speech last month at IBM, Biden said China specifically lobbied against a law that provides $52 billion to produce and develop advanced semiconductors in the U.S., an incentive package that has been followed by a string of announcements by Intel, Micron, Wolfspeed and others about the construction of computer chip plants in the U.S..

He said that some of the GOP lawmakers who opposed the measure had bought into the arguments made by China.

“The Communist Party of China was lobbying in the United States Congress against passing this legislation,” Biden said. “And unfortunately, some of our friends on the other team bought it.”

Donald Trump had fiery rhetoric on China during his presidency, imposing tariffs that the Biden administration has yet to lift. But by any qualitative measure, the export bans on computer chips are much tougher than anything imposed by Trump, said Gregory Allen, a senior fellow in the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Allen said the Trump-era tariffs were large in terms of dollars, but they had almost no affect on the balance of trade. Nor were the import taxes strategic. The export controls imposed by the Biden administration would be a setback for Chinese technology that is already decades behind the U.S.

“We have essentially committed ourselves to saying: China you will not achieve your number one goal,” Allen said.

The era of China, Russia and other competitors having relatively unfettered access to U.S. and European markets appears to be ending, said Christopher Miller, a Tufts University professor and author of the book, “Chip Wars.”

“The risks posed by these countries has grown, so Western leaders have reconsidered the wisdom of giving adversaries open access to their markets,” Miller said.

Instead of trying to work together as a single global economy, new alliances are being formed such as the Quad (Australia, India, Japan and the U.S.) and existing partnerships such as NATO are being expanded. Economic integration among these partners has become essential, as the U.S. export controls on advanced chips need support from other producers in Japan and the Netherlands.

“All the great powers are restructuring international economic relations in ways they hope will improve their geopolitical position,” Miller said. “Semiconductors are just one of many arenas in which trade, tech, and capital flows are being re-politicized due to great power rivalry.”",Computer chip ban signals new era as Biden and Xi meet,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/computer-chip-ban-signals-era-biden-xi-meet-93157128

The post A news photo editor’s nightmare is an art director’s dream appeared…",artificial intelligence,11/11/2022,https://www.poynter.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/nightmare-dream.png,poynter,"Now that our Agora report which assesses Oregon’s local news & information ecosystem is out, I finally had a few hours to kick the tires on the generative Artificial Intelligence art technology we’ve heard about to produce any digital image imaginable from the words you type into a prompt. The results are spectacular. If you want to see what the growing community is creating, OpenArt has a collection of artwork generated by the top three AI systems: DALL·E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion.

We’ve heard about generative AI for some time, but I’ve always felt it would impact us in the distant future. But with web-based tools that generate high-quality output now readily available, that future is here. There’s no doubt that generative AI innovations will change how we create and consume media, disrupting the creative marketplace and communication industries. And while text-to-text tools are already assisting writers in producing stories, I’ll focus on text-to-image generative AI.

In the last few months, many of these AI systems have published online tools, accelerating its availability to the public. For example, Midjourney’s beta requires a Discord account to log in, while Stability.ai‘s DreamStudio Lite has a convenient web interface. Each offers an addicting amount of credits to create a several dozen images for free. If you have a powerful machine sitting around, you can also download and install Stability.ai’s open-source, public release to generate art on your local device without paying for the online service. And if you’re tech-savvy, you can train your local model with custom data. This means you can feed your computer hundreds of specific images not in the default AI model, which is helpful if you want want to stay “on brand” on iterations of a visual campaign. Or you can create a series of portraits of non-famous but REAL people. As you can imagine, this raises serious ethical questions.

Controversies abound. I completely understand and appreciate the debate over the ethics of mimicking artists’ styles and copyrighted likenesses. People contributing to this ecosystem should be compensated and credited for their talent and work. For many artists, generative AI art is a threat. But for those who embrace this new digital brush, it can be a powerful tool in their design process.

But what worries me more is the lack of foresight in establishing regulations for deep fakes, AI-powered photos and realistic art that could lead to harm and disinformation. But back to the foundational technology of generative AI, I’m anxious to see how Stable Diffusion’s Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license and de-centralized mitigation strategies will keep users ethically, legally and morally responsible for harming others and distributing disinformation. As usual, we’re incapable of establishing policy ahead of innovation and must constantly catch up.

Now imagine when the technology is a Photoshop plug-in away. Well, imagine no more. Watch this video (also see below) that plug-in developer Christian Cantrell, former Director of Experience Development and head of Adobe Design Prototyping, tweeted last month.

Cantrell’s Twitter bio states he’s VP of Product at StabilityAI. The Inpainting feature in the Stable Diffusion plug-in for Photoshop is a News Photo Editor’s nightmare. And it can also be an Art Director’s dream. As Cantrell also tweeted: “This is how all advertising and marketing collateral will be made sooner than most of the world realizes.” And yes, there’s a Stable Diffusion plug-in for After Effect to apply the generative AI models on video. Sure, a skilled touch-up expert could do the same. But now you’ve compressed the touch-up time from hours to seconds.

As impressive as the technology is, producing that exact image you imagine still requires knowing how to talk to the algorithms behind the tool. What you type into these prompts tells the AI model what to render. The more you understand the “language,” the closer it can produce the image in your mind. It’s called Prompt Engineering and OpenArt published a Prompt Book to help you understand effective techniques. Of course, there’s already a marketplace for prompts. And apparently it’s a future career. This leads to my next concern.

On top of the ethical and legal questions generative AI tech raises, I fear we’re not ready for this massive change in the media and communication industry. And as educators, how are we preparing our students for such a world? These additional questions come to mind:

How do we label and define generative AI content in our publications?

When is it appropriate to publish generative AI images, and when is it not?

What are the most inspiring and most concerning examples of others using generative AI to render images?

What’s the balance between using generative AI to “assist” vs. “make” in the creative process?

What ethical and legal boundaries do we need to consider when using and publishing generative AI content?

What safe guards, if any, should be in place to prevent the abuse of news photography?

What questions come up for you?

A mentor early in my career asked this question that sticks with me today: “Would you rather surf the web or make the waves?” Generative AI technology is awe-inspiring and is here to stay. But I hope we can collectively answer these questions together before we drown in the inevitable tidal wave of generative AI images.

We found that for a significant fraction of the benchmarks in our dataset, only few results were reported at different time points in different studies (Table 1). For example, 1318 NLP benchmarks have at least one result reported, but only 661 (50%) of these have results reported at three or more different time points.

SOTA curve diversity and dynamics

In order to explore the diversity of real-world within-benchmark SOTA dynamics in a data-driven way, we used Self Organizing Maps (SOM)—a type of Artificial Neural Network able to convert complex, nonlinear statistical relationships between high-dimensional data items into simple geometric relationships on a low-dimensional display—to cluster individual metrics curves based on their shapes. Only SOTA trajectories with at least five entries over at least one year were considered.

Figure 3 displays the three clusters discovered for benchmarks in computer vision and NLP for all metrics. In total, 1079 metric trajectories of 654 benchmarks were assigned to one of three clusters. Cluster 1 (460 trajectories) most closely resembles the phenomenology of continuous growth. Cluster 2 (378 benchmarks), corresponds to the saturation/stagnation scenario. In this cluster, values close to the ceiling of all results are observed very soon in the time series and limited remaining growth in performance is recorded afterwards. Finally, cluster 3 (241 benchmarks) most closely resembles the stagnation followed by breakthrough scenario.

As similarity metric we use the euclidean distance between trajectory and gold function. Full size image

We analyzed the number of benchmarks reporting new SOTA results vs. active benchmarks reporting any results over time for NLP (Fig. 4) and computer vision (Suppl. Fig. 3). For both NLP and computer vision, the number of benchmarks in the dataset started to rise in 2013, with a notable acceleration of growth in benchmarks reporting SOTA results in 2017-2018 and a slowdown of growth after 2018. There is a strong stagnation of the number of active and of SOTA-reporting benchmarks in 2020, which is more marked for NLP. The peak numbers of active benchmarks in the dataset were highest in 2020 (432 for NLP, 1100 for computer vision), demonstrating that the availability of benchmarks for computer vision remained significantly higher compared to NLP.

Fig. 4: Development of benchmark activity in NLP over time. Shown are the number of active benchmarks (i.e., benchmarks for which any novel results were reported) vs. number of benchmarks reporting novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) results over time for NLP tasks. A similar plot for computer vision is available in the associated online material and supplementary material. Full size image

To understand in greater detail how benchmark creation and saturation unfold across the great variety of tasks that are addressed by global AI research, we devised methodologies for normalizing and visualizing benchmark dynamics, as described below.

Creating global maps of AI benchmark dynamics

Comparing SOTA trajectories across a wide variety of tasks, benchmarks and performance metrics is not trivial: How significant is a certain increment in performance? What constitutes a markedly unimpressive result (i.e., the ‘floor’ of our expectations)? What would constitute the best result realistically possible (i.e., the ‘ceiling’ of our expectations)?

Different performance metrics can inherently cover widely different value ranges. For example, for the performance metric accuracy, the inherent lowest value would be 0%, while the inherent highest value would be 100%. However, this is often less helpful for judging benchmark results than one might hope: For a balanced dataset with two classes, the floor should rather be set to 50%, as this would be the accuracy achieved by a random classifier. For an unbalanced dataset, the inherent floor might be another value—i.e., it would be highly dataset specific. Similar concerns can also be raised about the potential ceiling value: for example, a perfect accuracy score of 100% might never be achievable even by the best hypothetical model because of limitations inherent in the dataset (e.g., mislabeled examples in the test set).

Arguably, the best solution for judging and comparing trajectories would be an in-depth manual analysis and curation of all benchmarks, where floor values are determined by trivially simple prediction algorithms and ceiling values are determined through gold standards (e.g., expert human curators). Unfortunately, such curated data are not available for the vast majority of benchmarks. Moreover, even purported gold standard test sets can have severe limitations. For example, many recent NLP benchmarks were quickly saturated with some systems reaching above-human performance on test sets1—but further analyses reveal that models achieving very high performance often did so through recognizing benchmark-inherent artifacts that did not transfer to other data distributions1,3.

To easily scale our analysis to all benchmarks without requiring cost-prohibitive per-benchmark curation of performance metrics value ranges, we normalized and calibrated SOTA benchmark results in a data-driven way. As the basis of further analyses, we calculated the relative improvement (i.e., increase in performance) for individual metrics (e.g., accuracy). We achieved this by comparing the stepwise increment from the first (A, anchor) to the last reported result (M, maximum) in each step of a SOTA trajectory.

We define relative improvement (r) as:

$${{{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}}=\frac{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}}-{{{{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}-{{{{{\bf{1}}}}}}}}{{{{{{\boldsymbol{M}}}}}}-{{{{{\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}},\,{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}} > {{{{{\bf{1}}}}}}$$ (1)

where relative improvement (r i ) is the ratio of the difference between the current result (R i ) minus the previous result (R i-1 ) over the difference between the last result (M, maximum) minus the first result (A, anchor). Because we need the anchor value (i = 1) as reference for the r i calculation of the subsequent values, we only consider the calculation of r from the second value (i = 2) in the trajectory onwards. Figure 5 exemplifies this calculation and visualizes the resulting values for SOTA accuracy results of five AI models reported from October 2015 until April 2017 for the visual question answering benchmark ‘VQA v1 test-dev’.

Fig. 5: Example of calculating the relative improvement in SOTA for the ‘VQA v1 test-dev’ benchmark. Top: The SOTA curve displays accuracy results achieved by different models over time. Bottom: The values of the SOTA curve rendered as relative improvement r, calculated as the ratio of the obtained result (R) minus the previous result over the difference between the final (M, maximum) and first (A, anchor) accuracy values. The first result (A) is displayed as a vertical dash in the trajectory, whereas the remaining SOTA jumps are depicted as icons with color corresponding to relative improvement. Full size image

The methodology exemplified in Fig. 5 was applied to all AI tasks in NLP and computer vision to create global SOTA trajectory maps (generated data are available in Supplementary Data 3 and 4). To condense the visual representation, data items for the same task and month were aggregated by selecting the maximum value.

Figure 6 displays the global SOTA trajectory map for NLP. Here, every dash represents an anchor, i.e., the first result of a newly established benchmark. The subsequent icons depict the relative improvements for different benchmarks belonging to each task. We grouped tasks based on their superclasses extracted from the ontology structure we created during data curation (see Methods section), placing related tasks adjacent to each other. For example, “Semantic analysis” is the superclass of “Semantic textual similarity” and “Word sense disambiguation”. A similar global SOTA trajectory map for computer vision is available in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Fig. 6: Global SOTA improvement map for NLP. Vertical dashes represent ‘anchors’, i.e., first results establishing a new benchmark. Diamond-shaped icons represent gains in a SOTA trajectory. Icon colors represent the relative improvements in SOTA for a specific benchmark as described in Fig. 5. Each task may contain data on multiple benchmarks, which are superimposed. Benchmarks containing fewer than three results at different time points and AI tasks that would contain only a single icon are not displayed. Detailed information for each data point (such as benchmark names) can be viewed in the interactive online versions of these figures at https://openbiolink.github.io/ITOExplorer/. A similar plot for computer vision, as well as plots aggregated by high-level task classes, are available in the supplementary figures and interactive online material. Full size image

Interactive versions of these plots that allow for displaying details for each data item can be accessed online through a webpage (https://openbiolink.github.io/ITOExplorer/) and Jupyter notebooks (Code 2, Code availability).

In NLP the tasks of information extraction, sentiment analysis, language modeling and question answering had significant density of novel SOTA results the earliest (2014–2016). It is noteworthy that none of the tasks completely ceased to produce SOTA activity once they became established. Relative SOTA improvements were modest until 2018. There was a slight clustering of large relative SOTA improvements around 2018–2019—a possible interpretation being that this was when AI language capabilities experienced a boost while benchmarks were not yet saturated.

In computer vision, high research intensity and continuous progress on image classification benchmarking (Supplementary Fig. 1) started in 2013. This is earlier than most other AI tasks, as those were the first application areas in which deep learning started to excel. Notable later advances happened in 3D vision processing (since 2016), image generation (since 2017) and few-shot learning (2018–2019). In terms of relative SOTA improvements, the map for CV shows a wide array of patterns in benchmark dynamics across different AI tasks that elude simple narratives about benchmark intensity and progress.

To further visualize the dynamics of benchmark creation, progression, saturation/stagnation and eventual abandonment, we devised a global AI benchmark lifecycle map, exemplified in Fig. 7 for the NLP domain. The lifecycle map classifies each benchmark into one of four classes every year: (a) New benchmark: benchmark reporting its first result this years, (b) Benchmark reporting SOTA: established benchmark that reports at least one SOTA result, (c) Benchmark reporting no SOTA/no results: established benchmarks that does not report any results, or does report results but none of them establish a new SOTA, and (d) Disbanded benchmark: a benchmark that does not report further results from a given year onwards. In the lifecycle map, every class is represented as an icon, while the size of the icon represents the number of benchmarks falling into this category. Each benchmark can only fall into a single category for each year.

Fig. 7: AI benchmark lifecycle map for NLP. Benchmarks with fewer than three reported results in at least one metric and tasks containing only a single benchmark are omitted. A similar plot for computer vision is available in the supplementary figures and interactive online material. SOTA: State-of-the-art. Full size image

The figure and a related figure for computer vision are also available as interactive graphs on the web (https://openbiolink.github.io/ITOExplorer/).

The benchmark lifecycle map for NLP (Fig. 7) shows that a few benchmarks across most tasks were established early (before 2015), but only a small number of novel SOTA results were reported for these benchmarks during this period. Establishment of novel benchmarks strongly accelerated in 2015–2018, and was most marked in question answering, information extraction, text classification and text summarization. The years 2018 and 2019 saw the establishment of many novel benchmarks for a wide variety of further tasks, as well as the reporting of SOTA results for large numbers of benchmarks. Establishment of novel benchmarks was reduced in 2020, and concentrated on high-level tasks associated with inference and reasoning, likely because of increasing model capabilities in these areas. From 2019, no novel SOTA results (or no results at all) were reported for a large number of benchmarks, and this phenomenon was not particularly biased towards any specific types of tasks.

The lifecycle map for computer vision (Supplementary Fig. 2) shows a first wave of benchmark establishment for the tasks of image clustering and image classification around 2013, followed by several other tasks in 2014. It is noteworthy that even tasks established early—such as image classification and semantic segmentation—demonstrated high benchmark activity and novel SOTA results well into 2021, and especially for image classification this was accompanied by an ongoing establishment of novel few-shot benchmarks. Tasks for most other benchmarks were established in 2015–2019.

For both NLP and computer vision, the number of distinct benchmarks strongly differs between tasks. Only a very fraction of benchmarks was disbanded in the years up to 2020. A larger number of benchmarks was reported as disbanded from 2020 (i.e., have no reported results in 2020 or after). The number of benchmarks classified as disbanded is highest in 2021, but this is likely partially influenced by the cutoff date of the dataset used in the analysis (mid 2022).

Dataset popularity is distributed very unevenly

We selected all datasets used to benchmark NLP or computer vision tasks and which had first reported results in the Papers With Code dataset in 2018. We analyzed the distribution of dataset popularity, measured by the number of scientific papers utilizing each dataset for NLP. We found distributions to be heavy-tailed, i.e., a small set of benchmark datasets was used to generate a large number of benchmark results, as demonstrated in Fig. 8 for NLP datasets. The top 22% of NLP datasets and top 21% of computer vision datasets were utilized by the same number of papers as the remaining datasets for each domain. The disparity becomes even greater when analyzing all datasets in Papers With Code, regardless of their first recorded entry: Here, the top 10% of NLP and top 5% of computer vision datasets were utilized by the same number of papers as the remaining datasets.

Quantifying Papers With Code dataset completeness

While Papers With Code is the largest dataset of AI benchmark results by a wide margin, it cannot provide a full coverage of all existing AI benchmarks. We conducted a small-scale study to estimate the completeness of the Papers With Code dataset regarding SOTA result trajectories.

We randomly sampled 10 benchmark datasets from NLP and 10 benchmark datasets from computer vision in the dataset, resulting in a total of 20 randomly sampled datasets (listed in Supplementary Data 7). Querying Google Scholar, we found that the total size of the combined corpus of papers introducing the datasets and all their citing papers was 7595. Out of the citing papers, we randomly sampled 365 papers (sample size chosen to yield a margin of error of 5% in the analysis).

We inspected and annotated these 365 papers to determine whether each paper contained results on the benchmark of the cited dataset paper. If this was the case, we compared the reported result with the Papers With Code dataset to determine if the paper reported a result that was SOTA at the time and was not currently covered by Papers With Code (annotation data is available in Supplementary Data 8).

We found that even though dataset papers were highly cited, only a small fraction of citing papers reported results on the associated benchmarks, and an even smaller fraction (14 of 365, i.e., 3.84%) reported novel SOTA results. This implies that an estimated 0.0384 * 7595 = 291.32 papers in the combined corpus are expected to contain SOTA results. (Note: values here are shown rounded to two decimal places for ease of reading, but calculations were done with more precise numbers. Precise calculations are included in Supplementary Data 7.)

Meanwhile, Papers With Code contained SOTA results from 95 papers, i.e., 95/7595 = 1.23% of the combined corpus.

Taken together, 95/291.31 = 32.61% of papers containing SOTA results in the combined corpus were captured by Papers With Code, i.e., a coverage of approximately 1/3 of all SOTA results. While this indicates significant remaining potential for further increasing the coverage of Papers With Code, we deem this coverage sufficient to allow for meaningful aggregated analyses.

Dataset attributes associated with popularity

The finding that a large fraction of research activity was focussed on a comparatively small number of benchmark datasets and that many datasets failed to find adoption raises the question: which attributes differentiate highly popular from unpopular benchmark datasets? Gaining an understanding of these differences may guide creators of future benchmark datasets in prioritizing their efforts.

We conducted an exploratory analysis of some such potentially differentiating attributes. We selected all benchmark datasets used to benchmark NLP or computer vision tasks and which had first reported results in the Papers With Code dataset in 2018. We ranked selected datasets in two separate lists for NLP and computer vision by the number of unique papers that reported benchmark results on each dataset, i.e., a list ranked by the follow-up utilization of datasets for benchmarking.

We created two samples of top 10 and bottom 10 datasets (i.e., datasets with highest/least follow-up utilization for benchmarking) for NLP and computer vision, respectively (see “Methods” section for details on the sampling methodology). We combined the top and bottom lists of computer vision and NLP, resulting in a top list and a bottom list with 20 datasets each, yielding a total of N = 40 annotated datasets.

The majority of included datasets (n = 36; 90%) were associated with peer-reviewed publications. 33 datasets (82.5%) were associated with a paper with a first or last author with a public/academic affiliation, and 11 (27.5%) of datasets were associated with a paper with a first or last author with a private/industrial affiliation.

We investigated seven attributes for their correlation with top or bottom popularity status, based on the following driving hypotheses:

1. Number of task types, i.e., the number of different AI tasks that were evaluated by building on a specific dataset. This can include tasks that were not originally envisioned during benchmark creation (dataset repurposing). Hypothesis: Top datasets have a higher number of task types. Rationale: Datasets that are flexible enough to be employed for a larger number of tasks types will see greater utilization. 2. Number of sub-benchmarks. Some benchmark datasets are made up of a predefined set of independent benchmark datasets. For example, the SuperGLUE NLP benchmark is made up of eight sub-benchmarks covering five different task types. Hypothesis: Top datasets have a higher number of sub-benchmarks. Rationale: Datasets that provide multiple benchmarks are more attractive because they cover a wider range of capabilities and are less prone to quick saturation. 3. Dedicated leaderboard, i.e., the dataset publishers advertised a dedicated, publicly available leaderboard. Hypothesis: Top datasets are more likely to have a dedicated leaderboard. Rationale: Providing a public leaderboard incentivizes benchmark use; leaderboard provision is also a proxy for more elaborate and user-friendly setup of a benchmarking datasets. 4. Proposed as part of a competition, e.g., Kaggle, a workshop competition etc. Hypothesis: Top datasets are more likely to have been proposed as part of a competition. Rationale: Competitions lead to an initial burst of interest in the research community; this might also lead to larger follow-up interest of the community after the competition has ended. 5. Top conference or journal, i.e., the dataset paper was published in a top conference or journal (top status is defined through lists in Supplementary Data 6). Hypothesis: Top datasets are more likely to have been published in top conferences or journals. Rationale: Publication in top conferences or journals is a marker for higher quality datasets; datasets published in these venues are reaching a broader and more active audience. 6. Number of institutions, i.e., number of different institutions represented by co-authors of a dataset paper). Hypothesis: Top datasets have a higher number of institutions. Rationale: The creation of good datasets requires broad collaboration; having a broader set of participants increases visibility in the community. 7. Top company or university, i.e., first or last authors are affiliated with a top-tier university or a company that is a key player in the AI domain. Hypothesis: Top datasets are more likely to have the first or last author affiliated with a top company or university. Rationale: Researchers at such institutions design datasets that are more broadly relevant and of higher utility; association with top institutions might increase interest of other researchers, positively impacting adoption.

A comparison of datasets in the top vs. bottom popularity lists is shown in Table 2. We found that datasets in the top popularity list were versatile (had greater number of task types), were published alongside a dedicated leaderboard, and had a larger number of sub-benchmarks (which was particularly the case for NLP datasets). Involvement of first/last authors from top institutions was associated with greater popularity. Proposing benchmark datasets as part of a competition was not associated with greater popularity, as was the involvement of a greater number of institutions.",Mapping global dynamics of benchmark creation and saturation in artificial intelligence,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34591-0

Note: this article includes spoilers from ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.""

To my admittedly un-cameo-trained eye, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" seems pretty light on traditional Marvel guest appearances. Bruce Campbell doesn't show up and get squirted with mustard, Harry Styles doesn't saunter into the end credits, and Brett Goldstien doesn't appear as a demigod. The movie focuses first and foremost on the feelings it instills in viewers, leaving the perfunctory character intros and one-off cameos to other Marvel movies.

The film does, however, include one familiar name in the credits that you may have totally missed. That's because the movie's biggest cameo isn't a face, but a voice: that of Shuri's (Letitia Wright) robotic assistant, Griot. Her helper is able to calculate stats quickly and advise her about the best possible course of action, but he's also a bit sassy, and sounds so human that I kept expecting him to be revealed as a remote working assistant rather than an actual piece of artificial intelligence. That's probably because Griot sounded so familiar: he was played by none other than comedian and host of ""The Daily Show"" Trevor Noah, Collider confirms.

Noah actually voiced Griot in the first ""Black Panther"" film as well, but his role in that movie was much more brief. This time around, he plays a part in several of the movie's most pivotal scenes, as when Shuri tries desperately to save T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) in the film's opening scene, or when Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) tries to find her daughter after she's captured by the sea god Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejía). The robotic assistant played by the South African writer, comedian, and TV host is pretty much always around in a pinch, and he seems to make it out of the attack on Wakanda unscathed.","The Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Cameo You Never Saw, But Definitely Heard",https://www.slashfilm.com/1099014/the-black-panther-wakanda-forever-cameo-you-never-saw-but-definitely-heard/

Larson, author of The Myth of Artificial Intelligence: Why Computers Can’t Think the Way We Do (2021), asks us to look at life in the aftermath of the big new world that computers are supposed to create:

But the “bureau of statistics” mindset is now a problem. It dominates thinking everywhere, not just in technology businesses aiming for sticky ads and more captive users. Nearly every institution one can point to today, from government to science, media, medicine, insurance, and many others, embraces a centralized, data-capture model requiring massive computing resources and actively downplaying human ingenuity in favor of number crunching and prediction. More troubling perhaps, is the way this has shaped the zeitgeist. Confidence in human smarts and imagination seems at an all-time low. Entire books are written now on how people are, in effect, cognitively biased, limited, and indeed stupid. Given this cultural climate, Dyson’s time of “creative chaos and freedom” seems not only distant but beyond recovery.

Dyson called the Cold War science of the 1950s and 1960s Napoleonic because research occurred mostly in huge companies like RAND and involved teasing out the implications of earlier scientific results from brilliant Tolstoyan tinkerers like Max Plank or Albert Einstein. As in our present time, results were achieved through the investment of huge sums of money, and were typically conservative in scope, reflecting already formed interests and agendas. Much of the money during that time was spent on making larger fission, then fusion bombs. The math was already done. That time and ours both correspond to Perez’s depiction of a fully matured technology revolution showing signs of slowdown and decay. We seem to have wandered into the 1950s again, this time with Web companies instead of IBM and General Motors. Erik J. Larson, “Twenty Five Years After Imagined Worlds, What World Are We Living In?” at Hedgehog Review (October 26, 2022)

91,A company run by Elon Musk is on the verge of implanting computer chips in human brains. Is this a good idea?,artificial intelligence,14/11/2022,https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/styles/manual_crop_1_91_1_1528x800/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2022-11/neuralink.jpg?itok=oTasHUsX,psychology today,"Recently, Elon Musk has been in the news for having purchased Twitter. However, he also owns another company. I am not referring to Tesla or SpaceX. It is potentially more revolutionary than either of these.

This other company, called Neuralink, is much less known than the latter ventures. The goal of the latter company is to merge artificial intelligence with the human brain. According to Musk, unless human beings merge themselves with artificial intelligence, the latter will eventually overtake and control them.

So, for the past six years, Musk’s new company has been engaged in research to link human brains to computers by implanting a “neural lace” in them. This is to be performed by surgically implanting a chip (a tiny transceiver) into the human brain, which contains an expansive network of nano threads containing electrodes at their tips, which are, in turn, robotically guided onto specific parts of the human brain. As a result, the human being with such a brain-computer interface will be able to communicate wirelessly with the internet through thought alone.

The first phase of this project is to aid those who have neurological damage, such as loss of motor function in limbs, to operate computer technology just by thinking. For example, this could potentially permit an amputee to operate an artificial limb. The company has apparently already implanted a chip in the brain of a monkey, thereby enabling this primate to play a computer game just by thinking.

The plot thickens, however, because Musk seeks to create “symbiosis with artificial intelligence,” per Business Insider. This means that there would be a two-way street between computers and human beings. In the case of artificial limbs, the technology would also provide sensory feedback.

For example, not only would the amputee be able to operate an artificial limb by thought alone; the technology would also provide sensory and kinesthetic feedback so that it would feel like one is moving one’s own limb. In the case of scanning the internet with one’s brain, this would involve not only uploading commands from one’s brain by converting analog brain circuits into digital ones (output), but also the reverse (input); that is, downloading information from the internet into one’s brain.

Now, for most of us, the most fundamental form of privacy that exists is that which goes on in our minds. However, if Musk’s technology were to be deployed to create a two-way “symbiosis” between the internet and human brains, it stands to reason that there would no longer be any such privacy. The companies that controlled the internet pipes could have access to your most private thoughts; and so too could any government agencies such as National Security Agency (NSA) that, under current Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) laws, have access to the contents flowing down these pipes.

Drawing out the logical implications of the latter, your brain, like your computer, may become vulnerable to infection with viruses and malicious content. Imagine having downloaded to your brain false content—say a radical conspiracy theory—and having it stored in long-term memory so that it became part of your permanent working memory. Of course, when your computer becomes infected you can refresh your hard drive or get a new computer; but your brain may not be so easily refreshed (without losing your memory and hence personal identity) or replaced.

In the past, protecting your privacy on the internet has been left to the federal government—Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations and FISA laws, specifically. Hence, much may depend on how proactive the federal government would be in protecting your privacy and this most fundamental area of freedom of thought and expression—what goes on in your own mind.

With the trend toward strongarm governments throughout the world taking control, this solution may become part of the problem. Totalitarian governments don’t care about freedom of thought or expression and would prefer to control these things. So, relinquishing control of these new technologies to a totalitarian government, or one with tendencies in this direction, could be a recipe for a new world order that makes the likes of that envisioned by George Orwell in 1984 seem archaic and benign.

Is it true that artificial intelligence will take us over, as Musk believes? This is the stuff of science fiction movies that have been produced ad nauseam with this theme. It is true that too much reliance on artificial intelligence can make us over-dependent on them. How good is your sense of direction now that you have become increasingly dependent on global positioning system (GPS) devices? Computers are now building themselves so it is not impossible that we may eventually be replaced by computers.

But do we need to become one of them in order to stop them from overtaking us? Aren’t there better ways such as laws requiring human planning and development of new technologies that serve human beings rather than usurp them?

There is indeed a technological imperative that says, if you can create it, then do so. Unfortunately, this absolutistic injunction is blind to the social problems that the introduction of such new technologies can bring.

Musk predicted that he would be installing chips in humans by 2022, and it does not appear that he is there yet. Also, there is likely to be resistance, at least at first, by the average consumer to have chips implanted in their brains—even though he has claimed that the surgery would be as safe as having Lasik eye surgery. Still, many of us now walk about with our Bluetooth sets fastened to our ears. Just how long it might take to get tired of wearing them on the outside of one’s brain is not clear, especially when it becomes “nerdy” to so wear them.

So, is merging human brains with artificial intelligence truly a good idea? Better to answer this question now than after such technology becomes the new reality.",Elon Musk's New Brain Interface Technology,https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/what-would-aristotle-do/202211/elon-musks-new-brain-interface-technology

I have a new book coming out in February. It’s about hacking.

A Hacker’s Mind: How the Powerful Bend Society’s Rules, and How to Bend them Back isn’t about hacking computer systems; it’s about hacking more general economic, political, and social systems. It generalizes the term hack as a means of subverting a system’s rules in unintended ways.

What sorts of system? Any system of rules, really. Take the tax code, for example. It’s not computer code, but it’s a series of algorithms—supposedly deterministic—that take a bunch of inputs about your income and produce an output that’s the amount of money you owe. This code has vulnerabilities; we call them loopholes. It has exploits; those are tax avoidance strategies. And there is an entire industry of black-hat hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in the tax code: we call them accountants and tax attorneys.

In my conception, a “hack” is something a system permits, but is unanticipated and unwanted by its designers. It’s unplanned: a mistake in the system’s design or coding. It’s subversion, or an exploitation. It’s a cheat—but only sort of. Just as a computer vulnerability can be exploited over the Internet because the code permits it, a tax loophole is “allowed” by the system because it follows the rules, even though it might subvert the intent of those rules.

Once you start thinking of hacking in this way, you’ll start seeing hacks everywhere. You can find hacks in professional sports, in customer reward programs, in financial systems, in politics; in lots of economic, political, and social systems; against our cognitive functions. A curved hockey stick is a hack, and we know the name of the hacker who invented it. Airline frequent-flier mileage runs are a hack. The filibuster was originally a hack, invented by Cato the Younger, A Roman senator in 60 BCE. Hedge funds are full of hacks.

A system is just a set of rules. Or norms, since the “rules” aren’t always formal. And even the best-thought-out sets of rules will be incomplete or inconsistent. It’ll have ambiguities, and things the designers haven’t thought of. As long as there are people who want to subvert the goals of a system, there will be hacks.

I use this framework in A Hacker’s Mind to tease out a lot of why today’s economic, political, and social systems are failing us so badly, and apply what we have learned about hacking defenses in the computer world to those more general hacks. And I end by looking at artificial intelligence, and what will happen when AIs start hacking. Not the problems of hacking AI, which are both ubiquitous and super weird, but what happens when an AI is able to discover new hacks against these more general systems. What happens when AIs find tax loopholes, or loopholes in financial regulations. We have systems in place to deal with these sorts of hacks, but they were invented when hackers were human and reflect the human pace of hack discovery. They won’t be able to withstand an AI finding dozens, or hundreds, of loopholes in financial regulations. We’re simply not ready for the speed, scale, scope, and sophistication of AI hackers.

A Hacker’s Mind is my pandemic book, written in 2020 and 2021. It represents another step in my continuing journey of increasing generalizations. And I really like the cover. It will be published on February 7. It makes an excellent belated holiday gift. Order yours today and avoid the rush.

Some people with lower body paralysis can walk further after receiving prolonged electrical stimulation to the injured area of their spine NeuroRestore - Jimmy Ravier

Nine people with different degrees of lower body paralysis gained the ability to walk after receiving prolonged electrical stimulation to the injured area of their spine. This led to researchers identifying neurons that may help to improve walking ability post-paralysis.

Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord is often used to relieve pain in people with spinal cord injuries. In the latest discovery, electrical stimulation also accelerated walking recovery among people with spinal cord injuries who had enough functioning neurons in the affected area.

“We mimic the way the spinal cord is normally activated by electrical signals from the brain when you walk, by electrically stimulating the right spot of the spinal cord at the right time to move leg muscles,” says Jocelyne Bloch at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

The team implanted electrical devices into the spinal cords of nine people who had injuries in a similar area of their spinal cord. Six of the participants had some feeling in their legs but little to no ability to move them, while the remaining three couldn’t feel or move their legs at all.

Electrical stimulation was applied to the participants’ spinal cords, with the pattern and location of these pulses being personalised via an artificial intelligence. The participants were then asked to walk as far as possible in 6 minutes.

With the support of a frame, the electrical stimulation enabled them to walk nearly 25 metres, on average.

Over the next five months, they continued to receive this electrical stimulation, alongside guided physiotherapy sessions, up to five times a week. At the end of the study period, they could walk about 50 metres in 6 minutes, on average.

Four of the participants could even walk without any electrical stimulation, suggesting that the therapy induced sustained rewiring of spinal cord neurons.

To better understand how this occurred, the researchers induced spinal cord injuries in mice, paralysing their hind legs. They then implanted a device that delivered electrical pulses to the animals’ spines. Their walking ability subsequently improved.

Next, the researchers mapped the gene activity of the neurons at the mice’s spinal injury site, which revealed that a certain type of neuron became more active after electrical stimulation.

They then used a genetic tool, which could be controlled via light, to silence and reactivate the neurons linked to walking recovery. The rehabilitated mice could only walk when the neurons were switched on.

“After spinal cord injury, you have a lot of chaotic activity where a lot of neurons are trying to function,” says Bloch. “The electrical rehabilitation organises the network of cells and you actually increase the activity of a specific type of cell, while all the other cells are not activated.”

The researchers also found that silencing these neurons in mice that hadn’t been paralysed had very little effect on their walking ability.

“These cells are important for recovery of walking in injured mice, but when we switch them off in healthy mice without injury, it hardly affected their ability to walk,” says Bloch.

“The identification of a recovery-organizing cell type is a big step forward in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie [electrical stimulation] rehabilitation,” wrote Kee Wui Huang and Eiman Azim, at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California, in an accompanying opinion article.

In the future, manipulation of these neurons could reveal new ways to improve walking ability after paralysis, Huang and Azim wrote.

Here are the edited excerpts from our exclusive interview with Olivier Thierry, chief revenue officer, HungerRush:



Olivier Thierry, CRO, HungerRush

SWNI: It has been a busy year for the restaurant industry especially after the pause during the pandemic. But as the pandemic clouds begin to move away, how are technologies such as artificial intelligence changing the future of restaurants?

Olivier: The pandemic turned the restaurant industry upside down, and many of its setbacks are still being felt today. During the pandemic, restaurants were struggling with unforeseen lockdowns as well as new regulations and restrictions from guest capacity to food preparation. In fact, the National Restaurant Association reported that the restaurant industry suffered the most significant sales and job losses since the COVID-19 outbreak began compared to any other industry. More than 8 million restaurant employees were laid off or furloughed, and the industry lost $280 billion in sales during the first 13 months of the pandemic.

“As we continue moving toward a post-pandemic way of life, many of these pain points have evolved into longer-term issues. Labor shortages, rising food prices, changing consumer expectations, and even leftover debt all still plague restaurants today. As a result, the industry, which has been historically slow to adopt new technology, has begun experimenting with AI and relying on the technology to combat these issues.”

Restaurants have realized taking on new technology will help them not only survive these challenges but achieve results that they haven’t been able to before. For example, several large fast casual chains have turned to utilizing AI in drive-through, phone ordering systems and even integrating it into the kitchen to help restock items. When technology finds a way to step in and alleviate the stressors that workers have, we find a world where employees and technology can coexist. When workers aren’t as absorbed in restocking, taking orders and assisting in drive-thru lanes they can focus on the customer experience and in-store customers. AI has quickly become essential, and the pandemic accelerated a technological revolution that has propelled restaurants into the future.

SWNI: From talent shortages to customer experience, the restaurant industry is facing unprecedented challenges in the post-pandemic era. In your opinion, how AI can overcome these challenges and allow restaurants to reduce human error?

Olivier: Labor shortages have become one of the biggest strains on every industry since the pandemic, however, the restaurant industry was hit the hardest. According to the National Restaurant Association, 65% of restaurant operators surveyed said they don’t have enough employees to support customer demand. As a result, 60% of US restaurants have reduced hours of operation, while 38% are closed on days they would normally be open. Having to make such drastic adjustments has had direct impact on employee welfare, bandwidth and leaving guests to feel unwelcome.

“AI has emerged as a way for restaurants to mitigate these shortages while improving employee and customer experiences. For example, some restaurants with high volume of phone orders, like pizza restaurants, have begun implementing AI-powered phone bots to handle orders placed over the phone or via text message. For orders placed over the phone, the AI can understand and place customizable orders through payment and completion.”

Orders placed via text, AI can offer the option to re-order previous orders with knowledge of each customer’s personal preferences and customizations. Reduction in human error is a benefit of this technology, as the bots can understand multiple speakers, heavy accents, and slang. And since these bots aren’t limited to human inefficiencies, they never get sick, have a bad day, or reach a call limit.

SWNI: Let’s talk about natural language processing models. Several surveys have found that sarcasm or code-switching don’t work well with today’s NLP engines. How can NLP be used to interpret customer attitudes in phone orders and have a real place in the restaurants’ customer experience?

Olivier: As with other NLP solutions, the trick is exposure to large, diverse sets of data. By exposing the AI to varying speakers and commands, the AI uses deep learning and machine learning to augment its intelligence over time by processing real-time data. In addition, it’s essential to integrate the AI with the full extent of a menu and the restaurant software to guarantee knowledge of all possible orders.

With this understanding, the AI will recognize more and more vocal styles and varying orders. As mentioned previously, today’s AI solutions can also understand heavy accents, SMS shorthand and regional slangs and colloquialisms, and multiple speakers. In addition, AI can sense when the customer is getting frustrated and will offer to switch to a live person who can take over the situation.

“Luckily, interpreting commands from an order placed off a menu is more straightforward than a lot of other industries leveraging AI where interpreting sarcasm and code-switching is more necessary and commonplace. However, it’s always a good idea to give your guests an option to speak to a human employee in case of their personal preference or discomfort with the technology.”

SWNI: Another factor for restaurants to consider is investment in AI is a costly affair. How can the restaurant industry assess the need to invest in AI to improve customer experience and measure the ROI from AI investments?

Olivier: If operators are looking for a way to modernize restaurants, I truly believe AI has the best value when it comes to investing in technology that is futuristic but still delivers ROI across multiple needs. Many restaurants we see today are investing in flashy chip-making robots and other eye-catching tech, but AI can supplement everything from marketing to order-taking to improving customer experience. When done correctly, it can have much more of an effect on the entire restaurant than something such as a kitchen robot.

For example, order-taking AI can handle multiple phone lines and ensure no customer is left on hold, confirming those orders get placed. Beyond that, AI can also be programmed to upsell every order.

“On the texting side, the AI can send scheduled text messages to customers encouraging repeat orders with the click of a button. It can also send out coupons and promotional deals to increase brand awareness and ensure your restaurant stays top of mind.”

Further, by relieving employees from the task of manning phones, AI allows employees to spend more time on reassigned to table service, delivery, or order fulfillment, ensuring customers are satisfied and quality of service optimal.

SWNI: There is an ongoing debate over crucial aspects of AI performance, including bias, ethics, and overall control. How can the AI community make progress toward securing an unbiased regulatory framework?

Olivier: To ensure data is unbiased, data scientists must operate with heavy scrutiny of the data to ensure it’s an unbiased equivalent to real-life.

“Continuous testing of the data is essential to ensure all biases are caught and addressed before the algorithm is unleashed to the public.”

Moreover, there must be a standardized framework to ensure the ethical models to which we hold the data to are unbiased. Careful monitoring, diverse data teams, and increased transparency of training processes can all help combat biased AI.

SWNI: As the technology paradigm continues to shift rapidly, which AI investments will help restaurants to improve their customer experience and orders in 2023 and beyond?

Olivier: There’s a lot of places where restaurant AI can go from here! It’s already happening, but I believe we’ll see AI more widely integrated into holistic operations, from managing inventory to counting orders, tracking customers in real-time, and monitoring the number of people at dining tables.

“With computer vision, AI can also be used to monitoring the hygiene of the dining area, or the condition of kitchen equipment.”

We may also see use of AI at ordering kiosks that leverage voice technology and NLP like the phone ordering solutions. The possibilities are endless, and it’s truly exciting to see where the industry will take its innovation next.

Correct Answer: SRI/DARPA

A grand price fixing scheme that took place between 1998-2002 involved over a dozen makers, of what PC component?

Co-founded by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer, and Tom Gruber, Siri was an offshoot of the DARPA-funded CALO project and spun out of the SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center as Siri Inc., which launched an app for the iPhone in February 2010 and was acquired by Apple in April 2010.

Kittlaus named Siri after a co-worker in Norway, the name is a short form of the name Sigrid.

Siri (the speech interpretation and recognition interface) debuted as a native install on Apple products with the release of iOS 5 and was introduced as a feature of the iPhone 4S on October 14, 2011.

Siri's founders left Apple after a brief stint post-acquisition and in 2016 developers Dag Kittlaus and Adam Cheyer debuted Viv, an ""advanced"" descendent of Siri. Viv was created as an open platform that understands layered commands for more complex interactions and follow-up questions.

A subscription to the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) tracking system helps clients reduce the transport of empties by maximising efficiencies across all routes.

Because of the increased volume of cargo held by each Unit One, use of the containers cuts maritime emissions by reducing the numbers of containers required. The smooth sides, while making the containers easier to stack and store, also contribute to lower truck emissions when the containers are transported on land.

The maritime industry constitutes such a large global footprint that innovations are seeking improvements in a myriad of areas. Springwise has spotted modular onboard carbon capture systems, along with filters on ships that remove microplastics from the water.

The dangers of robots evolving beyond our control are well-documented in sci-fi movies and TV — Her, Black Mirror, Surrogates, I, Robot, need we go on?

While this may seem like a far-off fantasy, FICO’s 2021 State of Responsible AI report found that 65% of companies actually can’t explain how specific AI model decisions or predictions are made.

Greetings, humanoids Subscribe to our newsletter now for a weekly recap of our favorite AI stories in your inbox.

While AI is undeniably helping to propel our businesses and society forward at lightning speed, we’ve also seen the negative impacts a lack of oversight can bring.

Study after study has shown that AI-driven decision-making can potentially lead to biased outcomes, from racial profiling in predictive policing algorithms to sexist hiring decisions.

As governments and businesses adopt AI tools at a rapid rate, AI ethics will touch many aspects of society. Yet, according to the FICO report, 78% of companies said they were “poorly equipped to ensure the ethical implications of using new AI systems,” and only 38% had data bias detection and mitigation steps.

As is usual with disruptive technologies, the speed of AI development has quickly outpaced the speed of regulation. But, in the race to adopt AI, what many companies are starting to realize is that regulators are now catching up. A number of lawsuits have already been leveled against companies for either developing or simply using biased AI algorithms.

Companies are feeling the heat of AI regulation

This year the EU unveiled the AI Liability Directive, a bill that will make it easier to sue companies for harm caused, part of a wider push to prevent companies from developing and deploying harmful AI. The bill adds an extra layer onto the proposed AI Act, which will require extra checks for “high-risk” uses of AI, such as in the use of policing, recruitment, or healthcare. Unveiled earlier this month, the bill is likely to become law within the next few years.

While some worry the AI Liability Directive will curb innovation, the purpose is to hold AI companies accountable, and require them to explain how their AI systems are built and trained. Tech companies that fail to comply will risk Europe-wide class actions.

While the US has been slower to adopt protective policies, the White House also released the blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights earlier this month which outlines how consumers should be protected from harmful AI:

Artificial intelligence should be safe and effective Algorithms should not discriminate Data privacy must be protected Consumers should be aware when AI is being used Consumers should be able to opt-out of using it, and speak to a human instead

But there’s a catch. “It’s important to realize that the AI Bill of Rights is not binding legislation,” writes Sigal Samuel, a senior reporter at Vox. “It’s a set of recommendations that government agencies and technology companies may voluntarily comply with — or not. That’s because it’s created by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a White House body that advises the president but can’t advance actual laws.”

With or without strict AI regulations, a number of US-based companies and institutions have already faced lawsuits for unethical AI practices.

And it’s not just legal fees companies need to be concerned about. Public trust in AI is waning. A study by Pew Research Center asked 602 tech innovators, developers, business and policy leaders, “By 2030, will most of the AI systems being used by organizations of all sorts employ ethical principles focused primarily on the public good?” 68% didn’t think so.

Whether or not a business loses a legal battle over allegations of biased AI, the impact that incidents like this can have on a company’s reputation can be just as damaging.

While this puts a dreary light on the future of AI, all is not lost. IBM’s Global AI Adoption Index found that 85% of IT professionals agree that consumers are more likely to choose a company that’s transparent about how its AI models are built, managed, and used.

Businesses that take the steps to adopt ethical AI practices could reap the rewards. So why are so many slow to take the plunge?

The problem may be that, while many companies want to adopt ethical AI practices, many don’t know where to start. We spoke with Priya Krishnan, who leads the Data and AI product management team at IBM, to find out how building a strong AI governance model can help.

AI governance

According to IBM, “AI governance is the process of defining policies and establishing accountability to guide the creation and deployment of AI systems in an organization.”

“Before governance, people were moving straight from experiments to production in AI,” says Krishnan. “But then they realized, ‘well, wait a minute, this is not the decision I expect the system to make. Why is this happening?’ They couldn’t explain why the AI was making certain decisions.”

AI governance is really about making sure that companies are aware of what their algorithms are doing — and have the documentation to back it up. This means tracking and recording how an algorithm is trained, the parameters used in the training, and any metrics used during the testing phases.

Having this in place makes it easy for companies to both understand what’s going on beneath the surface of their AI systems and allows them to easily pull documentation in the case of an audit. Krishnan pointed out that this transparency also helps to break down knowledge silos within a company.

“If a data scientist leaves the company and you don’t have the past information plugged into this hook in processes, it’s very hard to manage. Those looking into the system won’t know what happened. So this process of documentation just provides basic sanity around what’s going on and makes it easier to explain it to other departments within the organization (like risk managers).”

While regulations are still being developed, adopting AI governance now is an important step to what Krishnan refers to as “future-proofing”:

“[Regulations are] coming fast and strong. Now people are producing manual documents for auditing purposes after the fact,” she says. Instead, starting to document now can help companies prepare for any upcoming regulations.

The innovation vs governance debate

Companies may face increasing competition to innovate fast and be first to market. So won’t taking the time for AI governance slow down this process and stifle innovation?

Krishnan makes the argument that AI governance no more stops innovation than brakes stop someone from being able to drive: “There is traction control in a car, there are brakes in a car. All of these are designed to make you go faster, safely. That’s how I would think about AI governance. It’s really to get the most value from your AI, while making sure there are guardrails to help you as you innovate.”

And this lines up with the biggest reason of all to adopt AI governance: it just makes business sense. No one wants faulty products and services. Setting clear and transparent documentation standards, checkpoints, and internal review processes to mitigate bias can ultimately help businesses create better products and improve speed to market.

Still not sure where to start?

Just this month the tech giant launched IBM AI Governance, a one-stop solution for companies struggling to get a better understanding of what’s going on below the surface of these systems. The tool uses automated software to work with companies’ data science platform to develop a consistent and transparent algorithmic model management process, while tracking dev time, metadata, post-deployment monitoring, and customized workflows. This helps take the pressure off of data science teams, allowing them to focus on other tasks. The tool also helps business leaders to always have a view of their models, and supports the appropriate documentation in case of audit.

This is a particularly good option for companies that are using AI across the organization and don’t know what to focus on first.

“Before you buy a car, you want to try it out. At IBM, we invested in a team of engineers that help our clients take AI governance for a test drive to help them get started. In just weeks, the IBM Client Engineering team can help teams innovate with the latest AI Governance technology and approaches using their business models and data. It’s an investment in our clients to quickly co-create using IBM technology so they can get started quickly,” Krishnan says.","Why AI governance is critical for building more trustworthy, explainable AI",https://thenextweb.com/news/ai-governance-critical-trustworthy-explainable-ai

With a long history as one of the world’s top financial capitals, this is a costly place to live.The city tied for 17th place with Helsinki, a notoriously expensive location, in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) Worldwide Cost of Living index in 2021.

The index is compiled by comparing prices in US dollars for goods and services in 173 global cities. While this is just one indication that London is a pricey place to live and work, there are plenty of others.

A 2019 survey from SpareRoom found that 33% of people aged 20 to 30 living in the city didn’t have access to a living room. Rental costs are rocketing, says property website Rightmove: in July this year, average monthly rent in London reached an all-time high of £2,257, or 11.8% higher than last year.

Then there’s inflation and the cost of goods and services to contend with. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) suggests that web-scraped supermarket data for 30 everyday grocery items indicates that the lowest-priced items have gone up by 17% in the 12 months to September 2022.

While London has long been hailed as a mecca for talent, thanks to the sheer scale of opportunities on offer plus its unrivalled access to culture and nightlife, other factors beyond the price of milk, bread, and rent are now clamouring for attention. Brexit, in particular, has reduced the size of the opportunity here with about 44% of UK-based financial services firms moving or planning to move some of their operations or staff to the EU, according to EY.

Rising layoffs among tech companies, political uncertainty — the UK is on its fifth prime minister in just six years — and a looming recession are not helping either. The ONS reported that Britain’s economy shrank in the three months to September, ushering in what is expected to be the beginning of a recession.

But despite all that, there are still plenty of opportunities. The key for workers is to focus on areas of stable growth, and careers within those sectors. Here are three sectors with high growth potential for 2023.

Cybersecurity

Following on from the UK’s initial National Cyber Security Strategy 2016 to 2021, the government launched the National Cyber Strategy 2022, which sets out a five-pillar approach to protecting and promoting the U.K.’s interests in cyberspace. The plan aims to shape its cyber sector so that it can stay ahead of adversaries, strengthen its abilities, and influence and shape tomorrow’s technologies so they are safe, secure, and open.

As a result, the U.K. is developing domain excellence in cybersecurity with companies such as BAE Systems, Clearswift, Sophos, and PwC leading the field. As we move towards an increasing level of digitization, digital security becomes increasingly important to secure our data in the first instance, and also protect it from attack.

Cybersecurity jobs are particularly prevalent in the financial and fintech sectors, but are becoming more and more common across the workforce to secure sensitive data in healthcare and education.

This essential sector doesn’t look like it is going anywhere. If you’re looking to build your career further in this sector, Citi is seeking a Head of Network Security Services in London. You’ll have end-to-end responsibilities for engineering and operations of network security services and will ensure a service-oriented organization that meets the business needs of a digital bank.

Cloud

Gartner reports that worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services is forecast to grow 20.4% this year, with spending expected to reach nearly £489 billion by 2023.

The big boom in cloud adoption was driven by the pandemic: In April 2020, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella said, “We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months.” That rapid pace has only continued as businesses first introduced remote working and now hybrid and flexible options.

As a result, this is a great area for career growth. A recent report from Public First and AWS found that digital technology could grow the UK economy by over £413 billion by 2030, which is more than twice the annual output of the UK’s manufacturing sector (£183 billion). The research also revealed that cloud computing will play an integral role in underpinning the technology stack that will enable the UK’s digital future.

Interesting jobs at companies large and small are available. Google has a Cloud Security Consultant role in its Google Cloud Professional Services division on offer in London, for example. You’ll provide advice and guidance to customers adopting Google Cloud Platform services, and work with them to design and develop cloud security architectures and solutions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

A recent study from software analytics company, SAS, assessed the AI-readiness of London’s boroughs, discovering that Camden, Westminster, and Hackney came in the top three places. The study looked at the number of AI-related jobs, R&D spend, GDP, business growth, and the number of relevant academic courses available within each area. In 2021, the city was home to 1,300 AI companies, or 65% of the entire UK AI industry ecosystem, with companies including Brainpool.ai, iTransition and Signal AI.

The government wants to make the UK a “global AI superpower” and aims to do that with its 10-year National AI Strategy, which will place a wider focus on AI and data science skills, recognizing how these can be used to increase resilience, productivity, growth, and innovation across both the private and public sectors.

If you’re looking for an AI or machine learning role in London right now, you’re in luck as any number of companies are hiring. For example, check out Amazon EU SARL which is seeking a Machine Learning Scientist. You’ll be building state-of-the-art machine learning systems for the most complex, and fastest growing transportation network in the world and focus on the development and research of machine learning solutions and algorithms for core planning systems.

Some Twitter users said that problems with the platform's two-factor authentication system mean they were temporarily locked out of their accounts on Monday amid new owner Elon Musk's huge changes to the platform.

Musk tweeted on Monday that he was ""turning off the 'microservices' bloatware."" He said that less than 20% of the company's microservices were needed for Twitter to work.

The Washington Post reporter Joseph Menn tweeted that Twitter's two-factor authentication system seemed to have been affected by this. The system, which users can opt in to, works by requiring people to authenticate their account using a second method alongside their password. This could be a code sent by SMS, a login confirmation via an app, or a physical security key.

One Twitter user posted on Monday morning that they had not received an SMS after trying to log in to their account using two-factor authentication.

""Can't send the confirmation code right now. Please try again later,"" the message from Twitter read.

They tweeted a few hours later that the two-factor authentication service still wasn't working, attaching a screenshot of a message from Twitter saying: ""You have hit the limit for SMS codes. Try again in 24 hours.""

Other Twitter users said they also couldn't use the two-factor authentication service via SMS and email.

Cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont tweeted later on Monday that the service was working again but had been down for around 90 minutes.

Since taking ownership of Twitter on October 27, Musk has pushed ahead with plans to roll out massive changes at the platform, such as charging users for verification and luring content creators over from other sites. He has also touted the possibility of introducing tiers of content moderation, reviving Vine, and offering a high-yield money market account.

Musk has also fired around half of the company's workforce, told staff to return to the office or face dismissal, and brought in more than 50 employees from Tesla.

One social-media expert previously told Insider that while Musk's decisions since taking over Twitter may look chaotic, he clearly has a ""master plan.""",Twitter users with 2-factor authentication said they were locked out of their accounts soon after Elon Musk said he was ridding the site of 'bloatware',https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-users-two-factor-authentication-locked-out-accounts-2022-11

Macs continue to be safe from malware

A new global threat report paints an ugly picture for Microsoft as Windows continues to have the most malware infections, while macOS had the least malware.

Elastic Security Labs published a cybersecurity report on Tuesday that examines popular operating systems and the threats they have received. The company also includes forecasts and recommendations for enterprise customers.

As usual, macOS is at the bottom of the list, even beating Linux, meaning it saw the least amount of security threats. The numbers show that 54% of all malware infections were found on Windows, 39.4% were found on Linux, and macOS only had 6.2% of infections.

Trojans were responsible for most infections, coming in at 80.5%. A Trojan is a piece of software that pretends to be benign but hides malware inside that activates once a user runs the program.

The researchers found that MacKeeper was the biggest threat for Mac users as an attack vector for malware. MacKeeper has a bad history that involved aggressive advertising, and some versions left Macs vulnerable to attack from malware.

The MacKeeper program is often seen as malware, or used to spread malware

The report mentions that attackers can abuse MacKeeper since it has extensive permissions and access to macOS processes and files.

It also warns that macOS cryptominers could become more prevalent in malware for Apple's platform. Cryptomining malware or ""cryptojacking"" is a malicious program that uses a computer to secretly ""mine"" a cryptocurrency without the user's consent.

Mining takes up most or all of the computer's resources, such as GPU or CPU performance, slowing down the system.

Traffic mirroring is typically deployed on a single-core switch to provide a copy of the network traffic to a sensor that uses DPI to thoroughly analyze the payload. While this approach provides detailed analysis, it requires large amounts of processing power and is blind when it comes to encrypted network traffic. Metadata Analysis has been specifically developed to overcome these limitations. By utilizing metadata for analysis, network communications can be observed at any collection point and be enriched by the information providing insights about encrypted communication.

Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions have become crucial to reliably monitor and protect network operations. However, as network traffic becomes encrypted and data volumes continue to increase, most traditional NDR solutions are reaching their limits. This begs the question: What detection technologies should organizations utilize to ensure the maximum security of their systems?

This article will shed light on the concept of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and Metadata Analysis. We will compare both detection technologies and examine how modern Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions can effectively protect IT/OT networks from advanced cyber threats.

What is Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), and how does it work?

DPI is a way of network traffic monitoring used to inspect network packets flowing across a specific connection point or switch. In DPI, the whole traffic is typically mirrored by a core switch to a DPI sensor. The DPI sensor then examines both the header and data section of the packet. If the data section is not encrypted, DPI data are rich in information and allow for robust analysis of the monitored connection points. Traditional NDR solutions rely on DPI-based technologies, which are quite popular to this day. However, in the face of rapidly expanding attack surfaces and evolving IT environments, the limitations of DPI have become increasingly prevalent.

Why Is DPI not enough to detect Advanced Cyberattacks?

Organizations are increasingly using encryption to protect their network traffic and online interactions. Although encryption brings enormous benefits to online privacy and cybersecurity, it also provides a suitable opportunity for cybercriminals to hide in the dark when launching devastating cyberattacks. As DPI was not designed for the analysis of encrypted traffic, it has become blind to the inspection of encrypted packet payloads. This is a significant shortfall for DPI since most modern cyberattacks, such as APT, ransomware, and lateral movement, heavily utilise encryption in their attack routine to receive attack instructions from remote Command and Control Servers (C&C) scattered across cyberspace. In addition to absent encryption capabilities, DPI requires large amounts of processing power and time in order to thoroughly inspect the data section of each packet. Consequently, DPI cannot analyze all network packets in data-heavy networks, making it an unfeasible solution for high-bandwidth networks.

The New Approach: Metadata Analysis

Metadata analysis has been developed to overcome the limitations of DPI. By utilizing metadata for network analysis, security teams can monitor all network communications passing through any physical, virtualized or cloud networks without inspecting the entire data section of each packet. Consequently, Metadata analysis is unaffected by encryption and can deal with ever-increasing network traffic. In order to provide security teams with real-time intelligence of all network traffic, Metadata analysis captures vast arrays of attributes about network communications, applications, and actors (e.g., user logins). For instance, for every session passing through the network, the source/destination IP address, session length, protocol used (TCP, UDP), and the type of services used are recorded. Metadata can capture many other key attributes, which effectively help detect and prevent advanced cyberattacks:

Host and server IP address, port number, geo-location information

DNS and DHCP information mapping devices to IP addresses

Web page accesses, along with the URL and header information

Users to systems mapping using DC log data

Encrypted web pages – encryption type, cypher and hash, client/server FQDN

Different objects hashes – such as JavaScript and images

How can Security Teams benefit from metadata-based NDR?

Implementing a Network Detection and Response (NDR) solution based on Metadata analysis provides security teams with reliable insights on what happens inside their network – no matter whether the traffic is encrypted or not. Metadata analysis supplemented by system and application logs allows security teams to detect vulnerabilities and improve internal visibility into blind spots, such as shadow IT devices, which are considered a common entry point exploited by cybercriminals. This holistic visibility is not possible with DPI-based NDR solutions. In addition, lightweight metadata allows for efficient log data storage of historical records, facilitating forensics investigations. Data-heavy DPI analysis makes long-term storage of historical data practically infeasible or very expensive. Finally, the metadata approach allows security teams to determine the source of all traffic passing through corporate networks and monitor suspicious activity on all devices connected to networks, such as IoT devices. This makes complete visibility into corporate networks possible.

Conclusion: The Future of Cybersecurity is the analysis of Metadata

Traditional DPI-based NDR tools will eventually become obsolete for enterprise cybersecurity as the threat landscape expands and more traffic becomes encrypted. These developments are already felt across the cybersecurity industry, as more companies are adopting MA-based security systems to effectively seal security gaps and protect their digital assets.

ExeonTrace is a leading NDR solution based on Metadata Analysis. Unlike traditional DPI-based NDR systems, ExeonTrace provides clever data handling, is unaffected by encryption and does not require any hardware sensors. Furthermore, ExeonTrace can effortlessly deal with high-bandwidth network traffic as it reduces network volumes and provides more efficient data storage.

109,How can an entrepreneur make journalists interested in publishing their stories? Here are a few helpful tips.,cybersecurity,15/11/2022,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1668114169-GettyImages-1361314094.jpg,entrepreneur,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Companies can solve different tasks through media publications: increasing recognition, attracting new users, finding partners or investors, strengthening their founder's personal brand and so on. But writing a story is only half the job: You should pitch news or columns to journalists so that they want to publish them. According to one study, journalists respond to 3.3% of pitches they receive. So, how can an entrepreneur make an editorial board interested? Here are a few tips:

Put yourself in their shoes

Treat journalists like regular people. I encountered situations where companies or agencies expected editors to respond to emails on the same day or asked correspondents for editorial plans. Some even ended their pitches by saying, ""If you don't answer me within 24 hours, I'll send the topic to another media outlet."" Establishing benevolent relations with editorial staff with such an approach is impossible.

It is important to understand that journalists receive dozens, sometimes hundreds of requests daily. According to Fractl research, 46.5% of journalists receive at least 11 pitches per day, and 28.6% receive more than 26 pitches per day. The Financial Times, for example, gets 300-400 columns a week, so it is physically impossible for their editors to respond to every letter individually. That said, they don't need to write about you while you aim to appear in the newspaper as an expert.

Try to imagine yourself in the shoes of the person you are writing to. If you are an editor of a magazine you are interested in, which of the hundreds of letters are you likely to open? It is also helpful to read articles on topics relevant to you and analyze why they were published. What attracted the editor's attention? What can your company do to enthuse them? Why would they accept the article you are preparing, and why might they reject it? Thinking this way will help you choose both a topic and a way to pitch it.

Usually, newspapers themselves prompt writers about what might interest them. Entrepreneur, The New York Times, Business Insider and many other prominent business websites have guides for writers. So, I advise looking for instructions before researching topics and preparing your column.

Think of your PR as a Rubik's cube

A Rubik's cube has many sides of different colors — just like your business. If your side of the cube looks red to you, it might be green to your investors, blue to your customers, yellow to your employees and so on.

For example: If your product is a marketplace, your partners will be interested in what features you have to promote their goods, how profitable and secure the transactions are and whether you can outsource fulfillment and delivery. On the other side are users: They will pay attention to the breadth of choice, how sellers are checked for counterfeit goods and when the support service is available. And potential investors will be willing to know about product-market fit, market volume, competition, financial performance and your team's experience. So, if you want to publish an article in a media outlet, first think about who should read it and which side of the Rubik's cube you will show them.

You can also apply this principle to communicating with different editorial boards. Some editors will be interested in your product from a technological point of view, and others will be interested in how your business has scaled, how you hired a team or your marketing promotion strategies. Before pitching to an editor, look closely at materials that have already appeared on the media website. The topic you propose should fall within the sphere of interest of the media outlet, but it should not be too hackneyed.

Here is an example from my experience: A client of my agency prepared a study on cybersecurity. We wanted to promote it in the UAE, a market of particular interest to the company, but we focused on the Middle East when preparing the news publication. As a result, local media outlets weren't interested in the news because it covered too much of the region. We had to rewrite the article focusing on the Emirates for it to be picked up.

Follow the format of the media outlet

If you send your article without a headline, a lead or subsections, even visually the text will look informal. Instead, it's worth examining how articles look on the website beforehand and adding the appropriate design to your column or piece of news. In this case, the editor will at least see that you understand the format of a newspaper and will be more likely to read the material.

Sometimes editors ask for articles without formatting, but even then, it is crucial to divide them into paragraphs rather than sending them as a single text. Equally important is how the letter is written and laid out. You should consider differences in mentality, be mindful of weekends and holidays, and of course, be polite. In the headline, I recommend stating the subject at once so that the journalist can catch a glimpse of the letter while looking through their inbox. Sometimes journalists advise writers when and how to pitch their topics. Below are tips from StartupToEnterprise founder, Linda Ashok, as an example:

""I prefer pitches via email. I do not respond if I'm not going to cover the story you pitch me. If emailing, my ideal email length is 2-3 sentences and I would prefer not to receive follow-up emails. I always check newswires for new story ideas. 1. Name (please do not misrepresent yourself) 2. Company 3. 2. Line Pitch 4. Wait for Response.""

Remember that there will be no second chance to leave the first impression

Often clients insist on sending the letter quickly, even if it is not yet perfected. It's better to spend a little more time but finish the material, especially if it's your first time pitching a topic to a media outlet. After all, if you leave a wrong impression of yourself, it will be harder for you to interest an editor next time. Some correspondents block entire domains after receiving irrelevant letters from agencies. Sometimes they can do this after two unsuccessful pitches.

Other times, companies do an automated mailing to dozens of media outlets. As a result, instead of personalized messages, journalists receive emails with ""Hi, Name"" or ""Hi, First Name"" in the title. Occasionally, you can see all recipients' email addresses in such newsletters because the company or agency forgot to hide them. There's a good chance that the sender will be blocked immediately after such an email.

Another common mistake is not considering the relevance of your material. For example, correspondents of business news websites regularly receive pitches tied to the end of the year in September and even in August.

And the surest way to get blocked is to lie to a reporter once. Sometimes entrepreneurs try to embellish their accomplishments and their business's financial performance by calling GMV revenue or expected revenue — actual revenue. As with investors, this will lead to harmful consequences — in all likelihood, media staff will no longer consider your news and columns.

You may think that the media outlet is not that relevant and that one case like this solves nothing. But remember, journalists often change jobs and share stories of lousy pitching with colleagues and in the public space. When a niche journalist becomes a correspondent at The Washington Post, you won't be able to write to them anymore because you let them down once.

Believe in your idea

Finally, always send a letter with a positive vibe and the belief that you have a worthwhile product and useful experience. Clients often tell me that they have nothing to write about. Still, any entrepreneur goes through an exciting journey — finding their niche, creating an MVP, learning how to manage a team and delegate, promoting the product and adapting it according to customer feedback, raising funding rounds and scaling into new regions. Your personal experience and unique ideas will interest journalists if you talk about them in detail and honestly.

You're part of a growing network of systems so poorly secured they could one day be used to destabilize entire electrical grids, and which contain enough security issues to be problematic today.

That's what scientists at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico have concluded after four years of looking at demonstrated exploits and publicly-disclosed vulnerabilities in electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), as well as doing their own tests on 10 types of EV chargers with colleagues from Idaho National Lab.

""Can the grid be affected by electric vehicle charging equipment? Absolutely,"" said Sandia's Brian Wright, a cybersecurity expert who worked on the project. ""It is within the realm of what bad guys could and would do in the next 10 to 15 years. That's why we need to get ahead of the curve in solving these issues,"" Wright said.

Hey, I recognize that vulnerability!

In the meantime, however, there are plenty of attacks that criminals could be using right now, and researchers already are. Sadly it's a grab-bag of the same old problems we've been seeing for years in other tech sectors.

""There have been multiple demonstrations of stealing credentials or influencing charging sessions via the EV-to-EVSE connection,"" the researchers said in their paper. In one case, researchers managed to sniff out and interrupt charging using a software defined radio with less than 1W of power from 47 meters away ""on all seven vehicles and 18 EVSEs that they investigated.""

RFID cloning is currently possible in early generation EVSE infrastructure, which can lead to thieves getting charged up using someone else's debit or credit card. Some iOS and Android apps used to manage charging sessions ""could also easily be reverse-engineered to reveal weaknesses in the EVSE management and vendor cloud interfaces,"" the researchers said.

EVSE internet interfaces have problems that are easy to guess: They often use insecure web services that can be accessed from a local smartphone or computer, while chargers from several manufacturers can be found on the public internet. Vulnerabilities in web services used by chargers could allow an attacker to change configuration data or push malicious firmware updates, the report found.

Communications between chargers and cloud services also contained a host of problems, like lacking appropriate authentication methods, not sanitizing input fields and even being open to supply chain attacks due to manufacturers' maintaining remote backdoor access.

As for hardware vulnerabilities, they included a host of outdated Linux kernels running superfluous services accessible via exposed USB ports that would let an attacker upload malicious firmware. Some chargers were even found to be operating off of Raspberry Pis without secure bootloaders.

Oh, and since we're going for the full run of security fails, of course the team found numerous hard-coded credentials, passwords hashed without a salt, and other cryptographic no-nos.

This is not great

What have we learned? That the EV charging industry seems to have treated cybersecurity the same way as the companies behind the Internet of Things: As an afterthought.

Jay Johnson, the Sandia electrical engineer behind the project, said that he hopes his team's findings will serve as a baseline in understanding the current state of the industry, which is vital to getting it fixed.

""By conducting this survey of electric vehicle charger vulnerabilities, we can prioritize recommendations to policymakers and notify them of what security improvements are needed by the industry,"" he explained.

""The government can say 'produce secure electric vehicle chargers,' but budget-oriented companies don't always choose the most cybersecure implementations. Instead, the government can directly support the industry by providing fixes, advisories, standards and best practices,"" Wright added.

No surprise here, but Sandia is recommending some basic cyber hygiene, like removing unneeded services, keeping software up to date, locking physical ports, and using proper encryption.

The team also suggested implementing better methods of EV owner authentication, like plug-and-charge public key infrastructure, as well as network intrusion detection systems, code-signed firmware updates and other habits it covers in its charging industry best-practices [PDF] suggstions.

Johnson's team isn't done yet, and has received follow-on funding to address some of the gaps it found alongside Idaho and Pacific Northwest National laboratories. Together, the three are working to develop a system for EV chargers that uses new methods to protect public infrastructure from ne'er-do-wells.

But until the government steps in with some regulations, Johnson said things won't improve.

Many EVSE manufacturers, Johnson told The Register, ""are desperately trying to keep up with demand."" While regulations have been discussed, Johnson said it's unlikely they'll appear for at least a year. Note that this applies in the US; the UK has already proposed regulations on EV chargers that will take effect next year.

While some vendors have improved their security, Johnson said those companies have found themselves at a market disadvantage against those in favor of rushing products to market. ""Until there's regulation to level that playing field, market trends favor insecure systems,"" Johnson said. ®",Shocker: EV charging infrastructure is seriously insecure,https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/15/ev_charging_infrastructure_sandia/

Shares of the cybersecurity specialist fell sharply following its quarterly report. However, a closer look indicates that investors may have overreacted.

Fortinet is growing at a red-hot pace

Fortinet's Q3 revenue shot up 33% year over year to $1.15 billion, driven by impressive growth in both the product and the services segments. Fortinet CEO Ken Xie said on the earnings conference call that the company's revenue grew at a faster pace than the cybersecurity industry, which means it ended the quarter with a bigger share of the market.

Fortinet's margin also increased last quarter. The company's non-GAAP (adjusted) operating margin was up to 28.3% in the third quarter from 25.8% in the prior-year period. The impressive revenue jump and stronger margins led to a 65% increase in Fortinet's adjusted earnings to $0.33 per share. Wall Street was expecting $0.27 per share in earnings on revenue of $1.12 billion.

Fortinet eased past those estimates thanks to the secular growth of the cybersecurity market and its improving share. More importantly, Fortinet's Q4 guidance indicates that its terrific growth is here to stay.

The company is estimating adjusted earnings per share of $0.39 in the current quarter, a non-GAAP operating margin of 30.5%, and revenue of $1.3 billion at the midpoint. Fortinet delivered $964 million in revenue and $0.25 per share in adjusted earnings in the prior-year period (after accounting for the five-for-one stock split that was executed in June this year). So, Fortinet is on track to deliver 34% growth in revenue and a 56% spike in earnings per share in the current quarter.

Investors, however, apparently couldn't look beyond the company's billings guidance. The company has guided for $1.69 billion in billings this quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range, which is a bit below Wall Street's expectation of $1.74 billion. Billings provide a measure of Fortinet's future revenue as the metric includes amounts that are yet to be received by the company.

Fortinet's guidance suggests that its billings are on track to increase 30% over the prior-year period, which is healthy even if it is slightly lower than what analysts are anticipating. What's more, a closer look at some of Fortinet's key metrics will make it clear that the company is headed for better times.

The impressive growth is here to stay

Fortinet's billings guidance may have missed expectations, but investors shouldn't forget that the company is witnessing healthy growth in deal activity. Last quarter, Fortinet struck 153 deals that were worth $1 million or more, up significantly from 83 such deals in the year-ago period. The number of transactions worth $500,000 or more increased to 355 from 232 in the prior-year period.

Not surprisingly, Fortinet's deferred revenue increased 35% year over year to $4.19 billion last quarter, outpacing its actual revenue growth. The faster growth in the company's deferred revenue points toward a robust revenue pipeline as this metric represents the money collected in advance by the company for services that will be provided later.

Moreover, Fortinet believes that it could capture a bigger share of fast-growing cybersecurity niches such as software-defined wide area networks (SD-WAN). Management expects that Fortinet could become the largest player in the secure SD-WAN market in the next two years, which could help the company sustain its terrific momentum as this space is anticipated to clock 21% annual growth through the next decade.

All this shows why analysts expect Fortinet's bottom line to clock a compound annual growth rate of 23% for the next five years. With the stock trading at 60 times trailing earnings right now as compared to its five-year average earnings multiple of 90, investors are getting a relatively good deal on this cybersecurity play. Of course, the stock is still richly valued, but it is growing impressively to justify the valuation.

As organizations were forced to adopt hybrid working, they had to reconsider infrastructural configuration. Facilitating remote working meant that businesses needed to consider a plethora of new endpoint devices connecting to the enterprise network. This increasing digital landscape is creating a wide range of complexities for businesses around network management and device visibility.

The ever-evolving IT estate is only a part of the cyber-security team’s challenges. It is almost impossible to 'solve' the complexity it brings with it because the requirements of dealing with and handling the technology keep changing. The security team's preparedness, ability to work under pressure, and people skills will determine how resilient an organization is, and how well it can detect, defend, and respond to a new or emerging attack. It is therefore vital to give teams the capabilities they need adapt to the ever-changing threat landscape. security teams.

Why is developing a resilient cybersecurity team important?

Advertisement

Building resilience in a cyber security team is crucial as it can help mitigate the impacts of a cyber-attack. The effects of these attacks can be economic, societal, financial, and psychological; the impact can harm the people responsible for protecting an organization. Suffering this type of damage increases risk and reduces resilience.

Teams need to understand that resilience is not an inherent personality trait but something that individuals or groups can learn. The effect of building resilience skills within a cyber security team can be the different between a successful security strategy and increased risk.

To strengthen relationships between team members, they need to exercise together regularly and rehearse crises. Defensive and offensive cyber security teams must practice their skills in complicated scenarios resembling their day-to-day work encounters. This will help them put their best foot forward if real-life incidents occur.

Practicing their skills and keeping a note of the team's performance will help cyber security teams in the long run. The data captured from these exercises can help identify and rectify the team's knowledge gaps. Teams can then work on honing their skills and tracking their progress to prepare them for real-life threats.

This data will also ensure that the team is abreast with attackers, which will help strengthen the organization's overall cyber resilience.

Key pillars of resilience

There are four components of resilience that every workplace needs to have:

Confidence -- Teams need to have confidence in their skills, techniques, knowledge, and judgement. They must believe they can make the right decision for their organization's well-being. Adaptability -- Adaptability is a key component for building resilience. To develop the agile thinking skills that are needed for the job, the security teams must consciously carry out regular exercises. This will help them reflect on the decisions they have previously made and understand if they should apply or update their techniques if an actual incident takes place. Purposefulness -- Each security team member must have a certain amount of self-awareness to positively adapt, learn, and grow from their previous experiences. They should have a good understanding of why they are doing the training and the benefits they will achieve. This will help the teams move toward their goals with a sense of purposefulness. Social support -- For a team to develop a greater bond, building trust and having social support is essential. It is paramount that these relations are not tested under pressure and that they are gradually built through rehearsals. The difficult conversations need to be saved for times when the environment is calm. The team must recognize the importance of the individual differences within the group because a diverse pool of skills, knowledge, and judgements brings well-rounded solutions. By carrying out new techniques, the team gains a depth of understanding, which encourages creative solutions.

Understanding how to implement the learnings into the daily lives of security teams is essential. The knowledge of what makes the team better will only be helpful if it is brought into practice.

Resilience in practice

Threat actors constantly use creative ways to carry out their attacks. They hope that their target lacks resilience and will crumble under the stress and panic caused by an attack. Hence, organizations need to improve and continuously work on how they respond to cyber-attacks. The training isn't enough; the teams need to upskill their capabilities through sessions that simulate real-life, high-stress scenarios.

Resilience is not a trait; it is built through continuous development and exercise. A security team can achieve a lot by working together to build resilience. Studies on resilience are not theory-based but evidence-based, proving that building resilience is essential.

Research carried out by the University of Manchester proves that resilience training is beneficial for workers. The benefits of this training include mental well-being, such as reduced stress, anxiety, and depression, and an increase in the team's confidence. This confidence positively impacts their ability to cope with stressful situations.

An organization must also be able to prove its security team's capabilities by measuring and setting a goal for the team against industry peers. This will help identify gaps in knowledge and upskill, which builds confidence. The organization must support the teams to develop the skills needed to defend and mitigate risk. This can be done by equipping the teams with access to scenarios that mirror the latest threats.

Building the resilience of cyber security teams is essential. To build people skills, adaptive expertise, and technical thinking, teams must go through regular exercises in a collaborative environment with real-world scenarios. It helps the teams to respond successfully to unexpected and unknown threats by building cognitive agility. People and groups need to be resilient because the system won't hold up if the people can’t.

Those constant warnings that passwords need to be strong seem to be falling on deaf ears, as the latest reports show most people still going for the same-old, easy-to-guess password combinations that we’ve all already seen.

Cybersecurity researchers from CyberNews (opens in new tab) recently analyzed 56 million passwords that were either breached, leaked, or made their way to the broader internet this year to determine any patterns.

As it turns out, we still love to use the sequence “123456” for the password, as that’s by far the most common one out there with 111,417 instances. “Admin” is also quite a popular one, with almost 17,000 entries, followed by “root” and “guest”.

Celebrity names, swear words

According to the study, people love using different names in their login credentials. Names of popular football teams, personal names, celebrity names, and names of months and days, those have all been observed as frequently used.

Users were also found to deploy swear words, with one particular profanity raking up almost 300,000 instances.

One of the problems with weak passwords is the fact that some products come with pre-set passwords, with the developers expecting the end-users to replace factory settings with their own passwords at their earliest convenience.

In many cases, this never happens, and many apps and endpoints end up with easy-to-guess passwords for extended periods of time.

“It is important for customers not to rely solely on developers to protect their credentials and personal data by adopting new internet safety habits, starting with strong password generation and cybersecurity awareness,” said Mantas Sasnauskas, the Head of Security Research at Cybernews. “Due to many services being interconnected, even one leaked password could lead to many accesses, potential damages, and time-consuming recoveries.”

To eliminate this risk factor, most major tech companies these days are building solutions that aim to replace the password, such as Apple’s passkeys solution.",These are officially the worst passwords we're all still using,https://www.techradar.com/news/these-are-officially-the-worst-passwords-were-all-still-using

PITTSBURGH, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Security risk management has become a staple business concern for modern enterprises of all sizes. Given the present shift to remote work and the prevailing threat of invasive security breaches, Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are in high demand. However, there is already a shortage of qualified CISOs in the market. Moreover, for many companies, the expense of a full-time CISO is prohibitive, and often leaves them particularly vulnerable to destructive cyber threats.

CGT Staffing understands the challenges manifested by the current talent shortage and the pressing need to attract and retain talent on a limited budget. ""Safeguarding the infrastructure needed to keep an organization viable should be more than a question of budgeting for it or not,"" said Bill Welge, President and CEO. For organizations unable to afford an in-house CISO, or even those who struggle to manage their IT systems internally, a vCISO is a viable, economical, and practical solution to a dilemma that all businesses increasingly face. ""Our experts' experience in identifying gaps in existing cybersecurity infrastructure, and subsequently developing revised security protocol, is expansive, and often for clients of notable reputation and scale across many industries,"" explained Welge.

The team at CGT Staffing believes strongly that protecting business-critical information should not simply be constrained by hiring budgets. Through its vCISO services, CGT Staffing empowers clients of all sizes to take ownership of their cybersecurity needs and vulnerabilities, and develop a lasting plan for long-term protection. This is doubly true for businesses without the flexibility to afford a full-time Chief Security Officer. ""As a small business ourselves, we understand the importance of managing budgets,"" said Welge, ""but cybersecurity is too big a variable for any business to ignore. Our goal is to deliver a premium service while allowing our clients to determine how expansive they desire our vCISO's involvement to be. Frequently, most businesses don't know what they need until it's too late. We strive to make the discovery and remediation process less daunting.""

MILWAUKEE, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of the National Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Sprint launched by the White House, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security in July, ManpowerGroup today announced its new national Registered Apprenticeship Program for Cybersecurity Analysts.

The program, approved by DOL's Office of Apprenticeship (OA), will be administered by Experis, a global leader in IT professional staffing and project services and part of ManpowerGroup, and will be open to Experis' IT clients and channel partners. By building competencies for in-demand cyber roles with accelerated learning delivered in tandem with on-the-job mentoring, these partners will be able to move quickly to effectively recruit and train apprentices nationwide for critically needed cybersecurity roles, while also diversifying their cyber workforces.

ManpowerGroup's Cybersecurity Apprenticeship program is competency-based, enabling partners' apprentices to move through their paid on-the-job learning skill-building work at their own pace while working with a mentor. Through the program, apprentices will also complete industry-validated related instruction to gain critical technical knowledge and upon completion earn at least one nationally recognized, portable credential.

""It's a huge honor for ManpowerGroup to be the only U.S.-based workforce solutions company to ever receive the National Apprenticeship Sponsor designation,"" said Martie Telepo, Government Solutions Director for ManpowerGroup. ""We are excited to grow our apprentice programs and provide organizations with the in-demand skills they need while continuing in our mission to be creators of talent at scale.""

ManpowerGroup worked closely with Safal Partners, a DOL national industry intermediary charged launching, promoting, and expanding apprenticeship programs in cybersecurity and related tech occupations nationwide, to develop their new national program.

Story continues

""ManpowerGroup's program is a game-changer for its Experis IT clients and channel partners,"" said Katie Adams, Senior Director at Safal. ""It provides them with a structured, scalable, and industry-validated program they can join quickly and easily to both source and train talent or provide upskilling for current incumbent workers. We are proud to support ManpowerGroup in accelerating the organization's ability to fill critically needed cyber roles through its new national Registered Apprenticeship program.""

The launch of the U.S.-based initiative is an extension of ManpowerGroup's investment in apprenticeship programs around the world, including in the United Kingdom and Germany, through our family of brands including Experis, Manpower, and Talent Solutions. Apprenticeship is a proven method for recruiting, training, and retaining a stronger and more diverse workforce. According to DOL, 98 percent of companies with apprenticeship programs recommend them as a talent solution and report on average $1.47 return on investment for every $1 invested. By acting as a sponsor, Experis will provide clients and partners with an increased ability to recruit and develop a highly skilled workforce – at a time when companies are facing a global tech talent shortage.

To add to that, (ISC)², an industry-leading cybersecurity education organization, reports over 2 million vacant security roles in their latest (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study.



Aquia is meeting that demand with its Accelerator train-to-hire program specifically targeting individuals who may not otherwise have the means to access further education or the qualifications necessary to be hired in a cybersecurity capacity.



Aquia Accelerator is a 6-month-long program that includes a paid apprenticeship, access to training materials and courseware, and a dedicated mentor. Upon completion of the program, participants are transitioned into a role as an Associate Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Specialist at Aquia.



""Drive, curiosity, and a passion to learn and innovate aren't exclusive to the cybersecurity industry,"" said Jonathan (Jono) Sosulska, Principal Application Security Architect at Aquia and program lead for Aquia Accelerator. ""One of our core values at Aquia is hiring, developing, and retaining the best talent and our Accelerator program supports that commitment. Vital roles across the world rely on solutions-oriented critical thinkers — and often times these people fall through the established systems. We're excited to work towards bridging those gaps by enabling talented people to apply themselves in new and challenging environments.""



Aquia Accelerator's first participants are Mackenzie Wartenberger and Ellie Ashton.



Mackenzie brings more than 13 years of experience in NCAA collegiate athletics as an accomplished coach and is ready to marry her proven leadership and training skills with her passion and eagerness to learn in the technology space.



Ellie joins Aquia as an experienced project manager, published author, and intuitive life coach looking to gain experience in the cybersecurity field.



The company will welcome its next round of Aquia Accelerator participants in Q2 2023.

What are today’s top threats, and how is Canada addressing them? Generally, how would you rate Canada’s cybersecurity posture?

Over the past two years, cybersecurity has become a top concern for Canadians. Ransomware incidents hit the headlines on an almost daily basis both in Canada and around the world. Cybercrime is still the number one cyber threat activity affecting Canadians. However, the state-sponsored cyber programs of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea continue to pose the greatest strategic cyber threat to Canada. And critical infrastructure is still a prime target for both cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors alike.

The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) recently published its National Cyber Threat Assessment 2023-24 report. This publication is meant to help inform Canadians about the threats they face, and we’ve also prepared advice and guidance tailored to the five narratives identified in the report.

These companion publications outline practical steps to mitigate the risks associated with each theme. We have partnered with the industry on a variety of cyber projects to share threat information and analyze data, but there are too many positives to mention.

From a government cybersecurity perspective, Canada has a robust framework and clear governance mechanisms to support the defense of government networks against cyber attacks. On any given day, our defensive systems can block anywhere from 3 to 5 billion events targeting the Government of Canada’s networks, and up to 7 billion. These defensive actions are a result of CSE and the Cyber Centre’s existing dynamic cyber defense capabilities which remain ready to defend the Canadian government’s systems and help protect against future attacks.

The cyber threat landscape in Canada continues to evolve. Canadians use the Internet more often and for a greater number of tasks. As more devices are connected to the Internet, the cyber threat surface expands. Cyber threat actors adapt their activities and utilize new technologies to achieve their financial, geopolitical, or ideological goals. Canadian organizations and critical infrastructure operators are becoming more informed of the threats, but there is still work to do.

At the Cyber Centre, we approach security through collaboration, combining expertise from government, industry, and academia. Working together, we can increase Canada’s resilience against cyber threats. We need to continue making Canada a harder target for cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors.

When you reflect on your 30 years in the Communications Security Establishment, what project or initiative makes you the proudest?

Our operational environment is very challenging, whether it be on the intelligence side, or in cybersecurity.

The threats are real. Every time we make a difference, and make Canada safer, as well as work together with our allies to protect our online environments, it’s a win. There isn’t one initiative I am most proud of, but to be clear, there are many (and most of them are too sensitive to mention).

However, I would like to think the release of our third National Cyber Threat Assessment report two weeks ago is a great accomplishment by the Cyber Centre team, and it is a threat report I am most proud of. The fact that our teams came together during a pandemic to put together this great document is impressive, and it encompasses clear and authoritative language that Canadians can understand. The NCTA received widespread positive feedback on its clear language and comprehensive coverage of the threats we face as a nation.

How would you describe your leadership style? What personal goals do you have for yourself during your tenure as Head of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security?

Over the past year, I have come to appreciate the wealth of knowledge on our operational and mission teams. My key goal is to tap into this rich talent pool and enable our employees to excel at whatever they do.

I see myself as an enabler, clearing the path (or plowing it, since we are Canadians) to enable the various teams to advance their work in support of our important mission. I believe in giving them the latitude to innovate, the leadership encouragement to lean forward and take some risks, and most importantly support them when they are under stress and pressure.

Let’s talk about Cybertech NYC 2022. What do you expect from the event? What will your presentation be about?

This is my first time attending Cybertech, but I’ve heard a lot about it, most importantly the level of innovation. I definitely do not think I will be disappointed! As I hear various key speakers or walk around the exhibit floor, I expect I will be impressed by what I hear and bring back some ideas, or identify partnership opportunities with others, since as we know cybersecurity is a team sport.

My presentation will cover three themes: innovation, the cyber threat landscape (specially as it relates to the tech sector), and partnership opportunities.

Given your extensive experience, what is one piece of advice you would like to pass along to the younger members of the cybersecurity industry?

You can make a difference. Be passionate about your work; have a vision; and develop a plan and know your goal. I would add, don’t chase the 100% solution, 80% is good enough and iterate to refine.

Too often young entrepreneurs or engineers miss the opportunity to make a difference, or bring an idea to market by being fixated on the perfect solution to a problem. Being passionate about what you do is important, but you also need to be realistic and set clear and achievable outcomes.","As trust in online spaces degrades, Canada bolsters resilience against cyber attacks",https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/11/15/sami-khoury-canada-resilience-against-cyber-attacks/

The integration supports the MOD’s new Digital Skills for Defence programme to build stronger, digital skills across defence and follows a successful trial by the UK Army.

The partnership supports MOD’s efforts to ensure teams have Suitably Qualified Experienced Person (SQEP) capabilities with access to more than 1,800 labs and simulations aligned with the NIST/NICE Framework. The labs are available to all personnel from novice to expert and across each service (i.e., Army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force), as well as STRATCOM, Ministry of Defence, and all MOD civil servants. The integration will also help MOD identify qualified candidates for cyber management, operations, and maintenance, among other roles.

“Throughout the world, cybersecurity threats are increasing, and national security depends on teams and individuals with the right capabilities to effectively and dynamically respond to cyber attacks of all kinds,” said Christine Maxwell, Director Cyber Defence and Risk, Ministry of Defence. “We have chosen Immersive Labs to help our teams build vital skills to confront emerging threats and demonstrate their cyber resilience. As teams complete labs, we will be able to identify personnel within our organization who demonstrate skills needed to fill cybersecurity gaps.”

Digital skills for defence programme transforms learning culture

MOD established the Digital Skills for Defence programme to deliver critical digital skills for Defence Leaders, Digital Professionals, and the whole Military and Civilian workforce. The programme is fundamental in building and retaining operational and business advantage. MOD’s ambition goes beyond education, seeking to transform to a learning culture where teams work collaboratively across the organization.

“We applaud the Ministry of Defence for its proactive efforts to support national security with a people-centric approach to cybersecurity,” said Matt Knutsen, Chief Revenue Officer, Immersive Labs. “We look forward to helping MOD build and demonstrate their cyber readiness in support of their innovative Digital Skills for Defence Programme.”

Immersive Labs helps organizations assess, build, and provide cyber workforce resilience. The company provides skills-based assessments that help leaders identify individuals who show in-demand cybersecurity expertise. Immersive Labs is trusted by the world’s largest organizations and governments, including Citi, Pfizer, Daimler, Humana, Atos, HSBC, and the UK National Health Service.",Immersive Labs helps UK Ministry of Defence identify qualified candidates to fill vital cybersecurity roles,https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/11/15/immersive-labs-uk-ministry-of-defence/

The SANS fellow, already a seasoned advisor and angel investor to many cybersecurity startups, will work with the firm’s portfolio companies and vetted entrepreneurs to guide their ideation, value propositions and customer relations.

Having served as a CISO for leading organizations over the course of 15 years, Kim offers deep insight into enterprise cybersecurity’s main customer profile and sales processes. He also brings added expertise as a former technologist with startup experience, which will not only serve entrepreneurs with ideation and product guidance, but also benefit the firm in its due diligence processes.

“A celebrated expert on both enterprise security and cybersecurity vendor business development, Frank offers a rare and coveted perspective across the most important facets of ideating and building solutions enterprises actually need,” said John Brennan, senior partner at YL Ventures.

“Frank is helping guide us through the technological realities of the enterprise cyber threat landscape and translating them into actionable business objectives,” he added.

Over the past few years, cybersecurity has developed into a top C-suite priority due to soaring cybersecurity attacks on enterprises. As a result, Kim intends to focus his work with entrepreneurs on the business impact of cybersecurity solutions.

“I want to help shed the perception that cybersecurity kills productivity,” asserts Kim, adding that many of today’s best-designed tools can actually help promote better workflows and teamwork across organizations.

YL Ventures pioneered the CISO-in-Residence position for investment firms three years ago in a strategic move to advance its vetting processes and value-add program. The program has counted a roster of cybersecurity leaders as alumni, including Roger Hale, CSO at Agora; Sounil Yu, CISO and head of research at JupiterOne and Ryan Gurney, former CISO at Looker, acquired by Google.

It is an extension of the firm’s strategy to connect entrepreneurs to their companies’ prospective customer base for feedback and opportunities, which additionally relies on the firm’s Venture Advisory Network of more than 115 enterprise cybersecurity leaders from Fortune 500 enterprises. These advisors conduct regular calls to help guide and support the firm’s founders with ideation, go-to-market strategies, product-market-fit and other customer perspectives.

YL Ventures often connects entrepreneurs to CISOs before even formally investing in them and continues to do so across their entire company-building journey. It has helped distinguish the firm in an age where, despite a volatile economy, investors find themselves competing to attract hi-tech’s most qualified founders.

By focusing on the niche of early stage Israeli B2B cybersecurity, YL Ventures is able to produce faster due diligence processes as well as cater to its portfolio companies’ specific market and business needs.

The firm also keeps a large, multidisciplinary team in both Israel and the U.S. to work closely with its portfolio companies, supporting them from inception through every critical stage of building a company and bolstering their position in the global market.

Kim’s predecessor, Ryan Gurney, has transitioned to the role of operating partner, joining the firm’s growing roster of in-house CISO experts that also includes Andy Ellis, former CISO of Akamai.",Frank Kim joins YL Ventures as CISO-in-Residence,https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/11/16/yl-ventures-frank-kim/

Experts Stress Importance of Investing in Cybersecurity Early in Development Cycle, Communication and AI-Driven Security Tools

SAN ANTONIO, Nov. 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rackspace Technology® (NASDAQ: RXT), a leading end-to-end, multicloud technology solutions company, hosted a Cloud Talk Live Cybersecurity Summit 2022 on October 25th in San Antonio, Texas, in coordination with Cybersecurity Awareness Month. The conversations, broadcast globally, included CISOs and security executives from Rackspace, iHeartRadio, and Cloudflare, with over 500 audience members joining in person and live-streaming around the world.



The panel of expert security leaders included Jeff Deverter, Chief Technology Evangelist at Rackspace Technology; Janet Heins, Chief Information Security Office at iHeartMedia; Karen O’Reilly-Smith, Chief Security Officer at Rackspace Technology; Gary Alterson, Vice President of Security Services at Rackspace Technology; and Kenny Johnson, Product Manager at Cloudflare.

""We will continue to see organizations developing new security capabilities centered on AI and analytics,” said Gary Alterson, Vice President of Security Services at Rackspace Technology. “But even as technology has a critical role to play in advancing security, adversaries are leveraging many of the same technologies as they become increasingly sophisticated. It is up to us across the industry to continue to invest to stay a step ahead.”

As Rackspace continues to drive thought leadership and helps organizations strengthen their cybersecurity postures, key insights from the Cybersecurity Summit include:

Communicating the value of security to the C-Suite/business leaders – For most organizations, security is not seen as a revenue driver but rather as an expense. Panelists agreed that is vital to emphasize the importance of continued investments in security to the C-Suite and other leaders.

Don’t let a crisis go to waste – Take advantage of real-life security incidents to conduct red-teaming and tabletop exercises, which can lead to the development of best practices and improved processes and procedures.

Shift security left in the development cycle – Today security professionals are working in an aftermarket world, usually being asked to secure applications after the fact. Organizations should focus on helping developers apply security processes into their practices and provide them with the right tools and guardrails to support development cycles.

The Biden Administration designated November as Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, drawing attention to the need for “fortifying our information technology and cybersecurity across sectors.” As cyber threats grow in frequency and severity, security operations teams within industrial organizations are regularly targeted due to the importance of their systems and infrastructure.

Given the limited resources at their disposal, security teams within these organizations are struggling to keep up with rapidly evolving threats. The cybersecurity skills gap poses a particularly difficult challenge for organizations with OT environments due to the unique skill set required to navigate the convergence of OT and IT technologies. This is where modern Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) plays an instrumental role.

“Our public utilities and critical infrastructure face unique cybersecurity challenges to detect and respond to the convergence of threats targeting their combined OT and IT environments, and cyber-physical systems,” said Cody Cornell Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Swimlane. “Swimlane is bringing together the best of OT security with our extensible security automation platform to create a robust system of record and control for security operations teams to more quickly process large amounts of security telemetry without needing more resources to defend against breaches.”

Swimlane’s security automation ecosystem for OT environments currently includes the following:

Nozomi Networks for OT and IoT security : Swimlane and Nozomi Networks, the leader in OT and IoT security, also announced today a technology integration that combines low-code security automation with OT and Internet of Things (IoT) security. The combined solution makes it possible for industrial and critical infrastructure security operations to maintain continuous asset compliance and mitigate the risks of attacks from combined OT and IT entry points.

126,A major campaign was found abusing hundreds of top brands with thousands of fake websites.,cybersecurity,15/11/2022,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zxoEkSCbA9b2DJx8urbM8T-1200-80.jpg,techradar,"Audio player loading…

Cybersecurity researchers have recently discovered a huge website spoofing campaign that impersonates major brands to distribute malware or serve malicious ads to visitors.

Researchers from Cyjax (opens in new tab) found a group called “Fangxiao”. This group operates more than 42,000 web domains impersonating companies such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Unilever, Emirates, and others.

More than 400 companies have experienced a form of identity theft in this campaign, researchers said.

How it works

The group, which apparently operates out of China (one of the exposed control panels was allegedly in Mandarin), creates roughly 300 of these domains every day. They then advertise them either through WhatsApp messages or mobile ads.

Victims that click on these links are sent to landing pages that employ all kinds of tactics to keep them engaged and too busy to consider the fact that it’s all one big scam. These landing pages also host ads from ylliX, an ad network labeled “suspicious” by both Google, and Facebook, the publication claims.

The endgame is to have the victims either download an app (a Triada trojan), make SMS micropayments in ignorance, open up fake dating sites, or earn a commission for the attackers via Amazon affiliate links.

In some cases, the victims are also incentivized to download an app from the Play Store called “App Booster Lite - RAM Booster”. While this one isn’t outright malicious, it does request shady permissions and serves a huge number of hard-to-close ads. According to the report, this app was built by the same developer that was previously seen engaged in adware.

Other than the fact that the threat actors are based in China, there is very little information that could lead to its identification. Fangxiao was also observed selling its services for other entities looking to boost web traffic.",Massive adware campaign spoofs top brands to trick users,https://www.techradar.com/news/massive-adware-campaign-spoofs-top-brands-to-trick-users

No. Are we seeing some pockets? Yes.” — Jason ✨Be Kind✨ Lemkin  (@jasonlk) November 8, 2022

So those of us who know Vista Equity Partners (and many of you may not) think of it as one of the largest Private Equity firms buying SaaS companies. Perhaps the largest. Among others, it’s recently bought Gainsight, Salesloft, Drift, BetterCloud, Pipedrive, Avalara (just in August), KnowBe4, and other leaders, along with established folks like Citrix and more.

But I hadn’t really thought of them as a proxy for all SaaS companies until I saw the CEO’s interview from a few weeks back. The companies they own a majority of are collectively at $24B (!) in ARR, so it’s second only to Salesforce in SaaS. And they span dozens of leading vendors in SaaS.

So Vista knows exactly what’s going on in SaaS buying now, especially enterprise and mid-market. It does less in SMB.

And here’s what it’s seeing:

On average, its 50+ SaaS companies at $200m+ ARR are seeing growth ranging from 20%-25% a year, versus 25% last year . That’s some slowdown for sure, but not a downturn.

. That’s some slowdown for sure, but not a downturn. Some sectors aren’t seeing any slowdown, like cybersecurity, productivity, and “no code” . This is also what I’m seeing. Monday, for example, just came out of a blow-out quarter.

. This is also what I’m seeing. Monday, for example, just came out of a blow-out quarter. Vista’s investments are older, established SaaS companies with brands . So it’s less representative of raw startups, but more representative of overall enterprise and mid-market spend.

The environment isn’t getting easier in SaaS, that’s for sure. It’s harder than it was, and some categories are seeing more headwinds than others. And I think the first bullet point is telling. For many of us, we’re still growing at a nice rate. But it’s maybe 20% harder than last year.

Vista has a pretty broad look at SaaS. Revenues are down in some categories, and not others. Growth is probably 20% more challenging than in the best of times. But multiples aside, it’s still Pretty Good Times.

Just not the Crazy Days of 2021.

read more",cybersecurity,15/11/2022,,securityweek.com,"Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) provider Swimlane on Monday announced the launch of a security automation solution ecosystem for operational technology (OT) environments.

The company has teamed up with several companies for this OT security automation ecosystem, including industrial cybersecurity firm Nozomi, event monitoring and risk detection firm Dataminr, and technology and security consulting firm 1898 & Co.

A technology integration with Nozomi combines low-code security automation with OT and IoT security. The Dataminr integration results in a cyber-physical threat response solution that uses automated processes to mitigate risks and quickly warn employees of safety risks.

As for 1898 & Co., it uses Swimlane as the core automation platform for its managed threat detection services.

Swimlane is developing a portfolio of pre-integrated solutions that customers can deploy through managed services or add to their existing environment.

“Our public utilities and critical infrastructure face unique cybersecurity challenges to detect and respond to the convergence of threats targeting their combined OT and IT environments, and cyber-physical systems,” said Cody Cornell, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Swimlane.

“Swimlane is bringing together the best of OT security with our extensible security automation platform to create a robust system of record and control for security operations teams to more quickly process large amounts of security telemetry without needing more resources to defend against breaches,” Cornell added.

Swimlane has raised a total of $170 million in funding, including $70 million in a Series C round announced in July.

Th…",cybersecurity,15/11/2022,https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20221115005386/en/1636700/23/Frank_Kim_headshot_hi-res_%281%29.jpg,business wire,"SAN FRANCISCO & TEL AVIV, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)--YL Ventures, a seed-stage venture capital firm investing in Israeli cybersecurity startups, today announced Frank Kim has joined as its new full-time CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)-in-Residence. The SANS fellow, already a seasoned advisor and angel investor to many cybersecurity startups, will work with the firm’s portfolio companies and vetted entrepreneurs to guide their ideation, value propositions and customer relations.

Having served as a CISO for leading organizations over the course of 15 years, Kim offers deep insight into enterprise cybersecurity’s main customer profile and sales processes. He also brings added expertise as a former technologist with startup experience, which will not only serve entrepreneurs with ideation and product guidance, but also benefit the firm in its due diligence processes. “A celebrated expert on both enterprise security and cybersecurity vendor business development, Frank offers a rare and coveted perspective across the most important facets of ideating and building solutions enterprises actually need,” said John Brennan, senior partner at YL Ventures. “Frank is helping guide us through the technological realities of the enterprise cyber threat landscape and translating them into actionable business objectives,” he added.

Over the past few years, cybersecurity has developed into a top C-suite priority due to soaring cybersecurity attacks on enterprises. As a result, Kim intends to focus his work with entrepreneurs on the business impact of cybersecurity solutions. “I want to help shed the perception that cybersecurity kills productivity,” asserts Kim, adding that many of today’s best-designed tools can actually help promote better workflows and teamwork across organizations.

YL Ventures pioneered the CISO-in-Residence position for investment firms three years ago in a strategic move to advance its vetting processes and value-add program. The program has counted a roster of elite cybersecurity leaders as alumni, including Roger Hale, CSO at Agora; Sounil Yu, CISO and head of research at JupiterOne and Ryan Gurney, former CISO at Looker, acquired by Google. It is an extension of the firm’s strategy to connect entrepreneurs to their companies’ prospective customer base for feedback and opportunities, which additionally relies on the firm’s Venture Advisory Network of more than 115 enterprise cybersecurity leaders from Fortune 500 enterprises. These advisors conduct regular calls to help guide and support the firm’s founders with ideation, go-to-market strategies, product-market-fit and other customer perspectives.

YL Ventures often connects entrepreneurs to CISOs before even formally investing in them and continues to do so across their entire company-building journey. It has helped distinguish the firm in an age where, despite a volatile economy, investors find themselves competing to attract hi-tech’s most qualified founders. By focusing on the niche of early stage Israeli B2B cybersecurity, YL Ventures is able to produce faster due diligence processes as well as cater to its portfolio companies’ specific market and business needs. The firm also keeps a large, multidisciplinary team in both Israel and the U.S. to work closely with its portfolio companies, supporting them from inception through every critical stage of building a category-leading company and bolstering their position in the global market.

Kim’s predecessor, Ryan Gurney, has transitioned to the role of operating partner, joining the firm’s growing roster of in-house CISO experts that also includes Andy Ellis, former CISO of Akamai.

The Data Security Alliance combines best-in-class solutions from industry leading cybersecurity and services companies with exceptional data security and management expertise from Cohesity. Partners in the ecosystem include: BigID, Cisco, CrowdStrike, CyberArk, Okta, Palo Alto Networks, Securonix, Splunk, and Tenable, with new security advisory relationships with Mandiant and PwC.

Security complexities cannot be solved by one vendor alone. According to research commissioned by Cohesity, nearly half of organizations (47%) were hit by ransomware attacks in the first half of 2022.

When an organization is the victim of an attack, companies want to detect and stop the attack as soon as possible, avoid paying the ransom, and if necessary, recover core business operations as quickly as possible. To achieve these goals requires close collaboration and integration of security and data management solutions and services.

This new Data Security Alliance collectively brings together the boldest solutions and the brightest minds in security to provide customers with a comprehensive approach that integrates data protection and resilience into an end-to-end security strategy. This strategy starts at prevention, extends to early detection and protection and also includes rapid recovery -- critical in the event of a cyberattack.

“Today’s non-stop and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats require an all-hands-on-deck approach. It’s not the responsibility of one vendor to solve all cybersecurity challenges, it takes a village to fight the bad guys. That’s why, out of the gate, we’re starting with multiple best-of-breed security partners, with tens of billions in market cap, who are serving thousands of customers globally,” said Sanjay Poonen, CEO and president, Cohesity.

“As a leader in data security and management, we are partnering with these industry heavyweights so they can leverage our platform, the Cohesity Data Cloud, to help customers easily integrate data security and resilience into their overall security strategy. This not only helps enterprises better protect against the threat of cyberattacks but brings together CIOs and CISOs to the collaboration table to fight cybercrime in ways not seen before in our industry,” Poonen added.

“We at CrowdStrike believe frictionless data security is critical to drive business value for our customers. We continuously work to ensure that organizations with their endpoints, workloads and users continue to operate without obstacles, while data is continuously secured against breaches and insider threats, including ransomware exfiltration,” said Michael Rogers, vice president of global alliances at CrowdStrike. “We’re pleased to join this alliance and team up with Cohesity to help organizations strengthen their cyber resilience, in the face of evolving sophisticated adversaries.”

“To any organization hit by a cyberattack, backup environments must be free of security risks – the last thing an organization needs in an emergency situation is to introduce new risk,” said Ray Komar, vice president of technical alliances, Tenable. “Tenable’s Exposure Management capabilities and Cohesity’s data security and management platform deliver complete visibility across the modern attack surface, including backup environments, so customers can reduce their overall risk and improve their resiliency.”

“The Cohesity + Cortex XSOAR value is strong, with the bi-directional flow of data and commands to rapidly detect and respond to ransomware,” said Pamela Cyr, vice president Technical Partnerships, Palo Alto Networks. “Cohesity confirms infection, and the Cortex XSOAR automation platform manages the enrichment and initiates a safe restore of business-critical data. We’re happy to be a part of this growing ecosystem.”

Partners will be able to leverage the Cohesity Data Cloud in a variety of ways to help joint customers advance their security posture. For example, with Cohesity, partners can leverage Cohesity’s AI-based anomaly detection to gain early insights that an attack may be in progress and accelerate response and remediation. Cohesity’s API-first approach makes it incredibly easy for security partners to join the alliance and integrate their solutions with Cohesity’s data security and management platform -- essential as the battle to defeat cyberattacks continues to evolve.

Tenable.io powers Cohesity’s CyberScan to easily assess data backup environments, which can be used as a proxy for sensitive production environments as well as ensure that a recovery situation does not introduce vulnerable conditions into production.

“Cybercriminals continue to up their game, often attacking backups in an effort to neutralize an organization’s options and increase leverage for their ransom demands,” said Kevin Mandia, CEO of Mandiant. “At a time of ever-increasing cyber threats, it’s critical that cybersecurity, data security and management companies work hand-in-hand to collaborate and keep bad actors at bay. We’re thrilled to be part of this security alliance.”

“A major concern of our customers is the increase in the number and severity of ransomware attacks. These destructive attacks have highlighted the importance of organizations not just having strong protection but coupling it with a comprehensive backup and recovery capability,” said Richard Horne, Partner, PwC UK. “Working alongside Cohesity helps us offer an end-to-end strategy to not only protect our customers against cyberattacks, but to quickly recover their core business operations should they fall victim to a successful attack.”

“The Data Security Alliance is an important step towards ensuring customers are better equipped to defend and recover from cyberattacks. Cohesity’s approach to integrate the Cohesity platform with key security providers with an API-first strategy is absolutely the best method to increase protection for customers,” said Randy Kerns, Senior Strategist and Analyst for Evaluator Group. “The incessant threat of ransomware makes it imperative that cybersecurity, data security and management vendors collaborate to provide customers with a solution to identify, prevent, protect, and recover data in the event of an attack.”

132,"BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, ThreatX announced the launch of ThreatX Academy, an online portal hosting an extensive library of cybersecurity training modules.",cybersecurity,15/11/2022,https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20221115005549/en/790902/23/unnamed-2.jpg,business wire,"BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ThreatX, the leading API protection platform, today announced the launch of the ThreatX Academy, an online portal hosting an extensive library of cybersecurity training modules. These courses provide an accessible and approachable opportunity for those looking to begin, or advance, their cybersecurity careers.

ThreatX is providing all foundational 100-level content at no charge. Training content spans many areas of cybersecurity, including Application Security, Data Protection and Privacy, Networking, Secure DevOps and Wireless Security, among others.

The need for cybersecurity professionals has been growing at a rapid pace, and that demand is expected to continue. The number of unfilled cybersecurity positions worldwide grew 350% between 2013 and 2021 (from 1 million to 3.5 million). Further, it is predicted that the same number of jobs will still be open in 2025.

This cybersecurity skills gap, along with the accelerated pace at which both technology and cyberattackers’ tactics are evolving, has made protecting digital assets increasingly difficult for businesses. In fact, 80% of organizations suffered one or more breaches due to a lack of cybersecurity skills and/or awareness within the last 12 months, underscoring the need for solid and robust training content.

Alongside Massachusetts-based training company, Security Innovation, ThreatX developed more than 140 hours of online security training videos beginning at an introductory level and progressing to more advanced subjects, such as Blockchain Security and Automating Security Updates. All 100-level content will be available free of charge, while 200 and 300-level content will be accessible via subscription. Through the integrated learning management platform, users will be able to consume the content in sequential fashion and earn certifications. The ThreatX Academy experience is powered by Raven360, a Massachusetts-based digital Academy business.

ThreatX will share all content, free of charge, with select nonprofit organizations, including participants of the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission’s (MRC) Networking Technology Program.

In addition, ThreatX Academy has partnered with (ISC)2 and is now an approved (ISC)2 CPE Submitter Partner. ThreatX content may count toward (ISC)2 CPE credits. (ISC)², is an international nonprofit cybersecurity professional organization. Through (ISC)², members can earn several well-established security certifications, including:

CISSP

Certified in Cybersecurity

SSCP - Security Administration

CCSP - Cloud Security

CSSLP - Software Security

In order to maintain these certifications, members must earn Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Credits. Through ThreatX’s partnership with (ISC)², security practitioners will now be able to earn CPE Credits for consuming ThreatX Academy content.

“Cybersecurity is a continuous learning experience, and the need for training resources in the industry is only growing stronger,” said Gene Fay, CEO of ThreatX. “We are excited to announce the launch of ThreatX Academy, and we look forward to advancing the program in the future as part of our broader effort to close cybersecurity’s ongoing talent gap.”

Through this partnership, Keeper will leverage GuidePoint’s federal expertise across sales and marketing, operations, engineering and procurement to expand their federal footprint. As part of this program, the Keeper Security Government Cloud (KSGC) password management and security solution is now available under GuidePoint’s GSA Multiple Award Schedule Contract #GS-35F-508CA.

""While many Federal employees are required to use accounts that are external to the agency in order to accomplish their job, this presents a threat to agencies and users. Breached credentials of these accounts, external to Federal Agencies’ control, are commonly used by threat actors and as such we see password management as a key technology to help federal organizations secure their environments and information,” said Jim Quarantillo, Federal Partner, GuidePoint Security. “Keeper Security provides a FedRAMP Authorized password management platform that enables security teams to maintain password security of these external accounts, while improving user experience and productivity.”

“As cybercrime skyrockets, bad actors continue to rely on their most successful attack vector: password-based attacks,” said Patrick Tiquet, VP of Security and Architecture, Keeper Security. “In the public sector, the stakes are particularly high. Organizations that don’t implement password management software are putting themselves, their employees, their data and the nation at risk.”

KSGC is FedRAMP Authorized at the Moderate Impact Level. KSGC helps agencies achieve zero-trust by providing enterprise-wide visibility, security, control and reporting for every user on every device from every location, and follows the White House Executive Order and memorandum by the Office of Management and Budget and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency mandating agencies adopt a zero-trust security architecture by 2024. KSGC is hosted in AWS GovCloud (US), designed to host sensitive data, regulated workloads, and address the most stringent U.S. government security and compliance requirements.

By utilizing both identity and endpoint defenses, joint customers can better investigate and stop attacks, preventing lateral movement and protecting high-value enterprise assets.

“Attackers’ preferred method for exploiting businesses is to target identities and endpoints,” said Matt Bates, Director of Technology Alliances, Ping Identity. “Security teams often rely on multiple siloed solutions to prevent these attacks, which delays mean time to respond and limits their ability to stop attacks in progress. The combination of Ping and SentinelOne brings powerful contextual awareness and automated response capabilities to identity management, leveling the playing field for joint customers.”

Today’s Security Operation Centers (SOCs) typically rely on a mesh of disparate technologies, leading to knowledge silos, gaps in visibility, and a lack of contextual awareness. Furthermore, security teams are often overwhelmed, responding manually to increasing numbers of threats, providing attackers more than enough time to move laterally and gain network persistence.

The SentinelOne Singularity XDR App for PingDirectory and SentinelOne Singularity XDR App for PingOne empowers teams to combine best-in-breed technologies to respond across the two most commonly targeted attack vectors. The integration of Ping Identity’s scalable and reliable identity and access management (IAM) solution and SentinelOne Singularity XDR’s patented StorylineTM technology which observes all concurrent activities, provides unmatched protection against attacks.

With built-in automation, Ping and SentinelOne autonomously prevent and remediate the effects of malware, ransomware, and zero-days. Furthermore, Singularity XDR can instantly take action in Ping Identity to suspend users, force password resets, or force reauthentication.

Key benefits of the integration include:

Autonomous Response: automate incident response across endpoints and identities to contain attacks faster

automate incident response across endpoints and identities to contain attacks faster Defense in Depth: unify leading technologies for comprehensive coverage against advanced attacks

unify leading technologies for comprehensive coverage against advanced attacks No-Code Automation: powerful automation with no scripting, coding, or complex configuration

“Today’s attackers target enterprise data through identity-based access. At SentinelOne, identity is a key component of the Singularity XDR platform through the Ranger AD and Singularity Identity Suite,” said Yonni Shelmerdine, VP XDR Product Management, SentinelOne. “It is critical that security solutions have both the context and autonomous response capabilities to respond to threats quickly across endpoints and identities. With Ping and SentinelOne, organizations can meaningfully increase their protection posture, leveraging attack surface protection with Ping Identity’s leading IAM solution.”

The Singularity XDR App for PingDirectory and SentinelOne Singularity XDR App for PingOne are both available on the SentinelOne Singularity Marketplace. For more information about Ping Identity and SentinelOne click here.

These and other findings in the report reveal that consumers are acknowledging a high-risk environment when conducting different aspects of their lives online. These attitudes signal an emergence of Zero Trust Consumers.

The report, The Era of the Zero Trust Consumer, is based on a survey of over 2,000 U.S. and over 1,000 U.K. consumers conducted in October 2022. It shows that consumers may be accepting the reality of ongoing cybersecurity threats in the same way that businesses are adopting a Zero Trust Architecture. In the enterprise, a Zero Trust Architecture acknowledges constant and ever-changing cybersecurity risks and requires user identity, in and outside organizations, to be authenticated and continuously verified before the user is given access to networks, applications, or data.

“As online breaches, hacks, and fraud targeting businesses, governments and consumers continue to escalate both in frequency and sophistication, consumers are showing a growing awareness of these threats and a determination to do what is necessary to secure their accounts and information,” said Tom Grissen, chief executive officer at Daon. “This emerging state of consumer awareness is what we’re calling Zero Trust Consumers. The lack of trust is primarily about cybercriminals, but it doesn’t need to apply to businesses. Businesses that deploy advanced technology to prove and continually authenticate identities at every trust point across the customer lifecycle will ensure a trust relationship with their customers.”

Despite mounting industry and consumer pressure to move beyond vulnerable passwords, the report shows that passwords persist as the industry standard, with 68% of consumers saying they are both their most used and least trusted security measure. The findings show consumers are ready to embrace stronger security measures and expect the businesses they hold accounts with to meet them halfway in securing their identities.

This expectation holds especially true for their digital financial accounts, where increasing reliance on financial technology has left consumers concerned for the safety of financial information and money – 93% expect stronger security measures, but passwords with one-time codes and simple passwords are still the most used methods of protecting this vital information.

Nearly half (48%) of respondents have experienced a breach or hack of an online account in the past 5 years, and 44% have experienced financial fraud, leading to a greater understanding of the reality of security threats and a strong willingness to embrace more advanced, passwordless technology. 81% say they would be willing to use facial or voice recognition when accessing accounts to better ensure security.

But consumers who are looking for a more secure digital future expect companies to meet them halfway on securing their accounts and information, with 54% saying companies and consumers hold an equal responsibility for protecting their identity.

“The report findings overwhelmingly show that reliance on outdated security technology betrays the trust of consumers who both understand and embrace the reality of security threats. We’ve seen many major industry players already pushing for higher standards of security through initiatives like passkeys, and it shows businesses are now at an inflection point, where they must understand that the path to trust with their customers is through understanding their customers’ views of threats,” concluded Grissen.

Talented cybersecurity professionals are in huge demand. The number of open cybersecurity jobs globally grew 350% between 2013 and 2021, from 1 million to 3.5 million, according to research from Secureworks.

That's a big issue as no one can afford to skimp on skilled IT security staff because of ever-growing macro-economic and geopolitical challenges that present fresh risks to the business.

In fact, research from recruiter Nash Squared suggests managing cybersecurity has never been more challenging – and the bigger an organisation is, the more likely it is to be attacked.

Therefore, it's crucial that enterprises have a talented CISO in situ; someone who is responsible for overseeing cybersecurity and ensuring data and systems are safe and secure.

Also: What is a CISO? Everything you need to know about the Chief Information Security Officer role

So, what characteristics do you need if you're a cybersecurity professional and you want to reach the very top of the career ladder?

For Stu Hirst, CISO at Trustpilot, the answer is clear: integrity, empathy, and resilience.

These three qualities have become increasingly important for CISOs, says Hirst, who has years of practice building IT defences at big-name companies such as Capital One UK, Trainline and Just Eat.

When it comes to integrity, he says a certain level of honesty is crucial for anyone who wants to be an effective cyber chief.

As CISO for consumer review website Trustpilot, a public company that's listed on the London Stock Exchange, Hirst reports to the board.

It's absolutely critical he provides a ""warts and all view"" of what's happening now and what might happen next.

""I don't try and paint a picture that isn't happening,"" he says.

""I try and give a pragmatic view of what the industry is doing, where the company's at, and what's required as the next step. I think you need to have integrity to be able to do that and be comfortable being extremely honest with the information you have.""

In terms of empathy, Hirst says the work that modern CISOs undertake to keep systems and data safe secure means their interactions span the entire range of business activities.

Stu Hirst: ""We deal with a lot of nonsense in security, unfortunately, and it can be a high-stress job."" Image: Trustpilot

""You've got to be empathetic to what's going on in other teams and how your role and the work the security team does might affect them,"" he says.

Finally, CISOs must be resilient. Hirst says working in security is tough at the best of times. But when you're responsible for cyber defences at a big business, you need to be really robust.

""We deal with a lot of nonsense in security, unfortunately, and it can be a high-stress job,"" he says.

""I think you've got to be capable of dealing with changing landscapes, conflicting ideas and priorities, and different people shouting at you at different times from different angles.""

Hirst recognises the pressure that comes with being a CISO can be tough for some professionals to handle.

Cybersecurity work often involves what he refers to as high-stress environments, where you either don't know what's happening or you're waiting for something bad to happen.

Bev White, chief executive at Nash Squared, says the almost-constant demands involved in the CISO role mean cybersecurity professionals should ask an important question: is it the right role for you?

""Be careful what you ask for because it's not easy at the top,"" she says.

""Making sure people have the skills and are fully equipped, resilience-wise, to deal with the role when they get to the top is really important.""

The pressures involved in working in cybersecurity – especially given the context of stretched resources due to an ever-growing skills gap – mean that some people might decide they'd rather leave the industry altogether rather than carry on climbing the ladder.

Also: Tech jobs are changing. Here are the real skills you'll need to get promoted

For White, that's a big shame. ""I think it's a bittersweet decision,"" she says.

""We're finding that more cybersecurity professionals are questioning whether should they take a different career path or whether they should they carry on with the one they have.""

With an ever-growing cyber skills gap, it's a matter of urgency that everyone at the top of the IT industry encourages talented cybersecurity professionals to not just stick around but to hone their craft and feel confident they're developing a long-term and fulfilling career.

That's something that resonates strongly with Hirst, who looks to guide up-and-coming cyber stars and who is heavily involved in the security community, including speaking to ZDNET from the ScotSoft annual tech conference run by trade body ScotlandIS.

He believes many cybersecurity professionals suffer from 'imposter syndrome' and it's something that definitely affected him in the past.

""I've probably just about overcome it over the years,"" he says. ""I think it's more prevalent in security for the simple reason that there are so many things we have to understand. And it's impossible to know all of them.""

Also: Finding a mentor can supercharge your career. Here are 5 big benefits

But despite the trials and tribulations involved in climbing the career ladder, Hirst still relishes the problem-solving aspects of the role and enjoys the cultural side of leadership, particularly trying to build and motivate teams.

Reflecting on his journey to becoming a CISO, Hirst offers five tips for cybersecurity professionals who are looking to make their way in the industry:

Learn from others – If you want to be a CISO, spend time talking to and learning from others who have already done the role

Truly understand risk – Define what risk means to the business and know how to prioritise it because that's the key element of a CISO's day-to-day role

Build a balance of skills – Develop an equal understanding of technical and business knowledge because senior roles demand capability in both of those areas

Look after yourself physically and mentally – Security leaderships is a high-pressure job that can involve some very stressful and intense periods of work

Immerse yourself in cyber communities – Interact with people who can help you grow and learn, as that's where you'll find a huge amount of information

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) regularly publishes lists of the most exploited vulnerabilities and keeps a regularly updated Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog everyone is welcome to use, but as helpful as these resources are, organizations usually stumble when it comes to deciding which security holes should be plugged first.

That’s why the agency has updated and is promoting the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) system they are using themselves.

A step towards better vulnerability management

Better vulnerability management is possible, says Eric Goldstein, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity at CISA, and it involves:

Using automation – and the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF), which “provides a standardized format for ingesting vulnerability advisory information and simplify triage and remediation processes for asset owners.”

– and the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF), which “provides a standardized format for ingesting vulnerability advisory information and simplify triage and remediation processes for asset owners.” Clarifying the impact of vulnerabilities. This hinges on vendors issuing a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) advisory stating whether a product is or is not affected by a specific vulnerability in a machine readable, automated way.

This hinges on vendors issuing a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) advisory stating whether a product is or is not affected by a specific vulnerability in a machine readable, automated way. Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on specific attributes (state of exploitation, technical impact, the potential for automated exploitation, impact on an org’s mission essential functions, impact on public well-being) with the help of the SSVC Calculator and the aforementioned SSVC system/guide.

CISA’s decision tree for vulnerability prioritization (Source: CISA)

Vulnerabilities are thus categorized into four groups:

Track: Not for immediate remediation (just within standard update timelines), but should be tracked for changes in status

Not for immediate remediation (just within standard update timelines), but should be tracked for changes in status Track*: Requires closer monitoring for changes. Remediation: within standard update timelines.

Requires closer monitoring for changes. Remediation: within standard update timelines. Attend: Attention required from the organization’s internal supervisory team, who need to look for more info and may have to publish a notification either internally and/or externally. Remediation should be performed sooner than standard update timelines.

Attention required from the organization’s internal supervisory team, who need to look for more info and may have to publish a notification either internally and/or externally. Remediation should be performed sooner than standard update timelines. Act: Attention required from the organization’s internal supervisory team and leadership-level individuals. Needed: more info or assistance, notifications, internal group meeting to decide on response and actions. Remediation: as soon as possible.

“The CISA SSVC Calculator allows users to input decision values and navigate through the CISA SSVC tree model to the final overall decision for a vulnerability affecting their organization,” the agency explained.

Organizations whose mission spaces do not align with CISA’s decision tree can choose other decision tree models.)

CVSS or SSVC (or both)?

Derek McCarthy, Director, Field Engineering at NetRise, says that everyone in the cybersecurity industry understands that CVSS scores can’t be blindly (or exclusively) used to prioritize vulnerability remediation.

“Context matters (a lot), and SSVC has done incredible work enumerating all the factors that should be involved in determining how to deal with vulnerabilities in any given setting. CISA’s work in extending that should prove to be valuable in boiling up some of the more pertinent details to allow organizations to more easily digest and implement vulnerability management policies and procedures that reflect the goals of the SSVC framework.”",SSVC: Prioritization of vulnerability remediation according to CISA,https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/11/15/vulnerability-prioritization-remediation-cisa/

Our unique approach with modern defense leverages internet observability, collective protection across hundreds of customers, and actionable threat intelligence and disruptions, enables us to win against cybercriminals,” said Tamer Hassan, HUMAN Co-Founder and CEO, and a former decorated Air Force pilot who served multiple tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. “By partnering with Carahsoft and its reseller partners, we’re able to not only protect Government and military entities and Public Sector institutions from sophisticated bot attacks, fraud, and account abuse, but we’re able to adapt quickly to defend them from threats yet to come.”

HUMAN’s modern defense approach protects customers along every step of the digital journey. The following featured solutions are part of the Human Defense Platform:

HUMAN Bot Defender

For digital businesses that need to protect their web and mobile applications and APIs, HUMAN Bot Defender is a behavior-based bot management solution that efficiently detects and mitigates the most sophisticated bot attacks. Unlike competing solutions that provide protection from only basic bot attacks, are hard to integrate and limit your infrastructure choices, HUMAN Bot Defender effortlessly integrates into any existing infrastructure and scales as your traffic grows to safeguard your online revenue and competitive edge.

Defense against: ATO, Content Manipulation, PII Harvesting and Content Scraping, Inventory Manipulation, carding

HUMAN Account Defender

HUMAN Account Defender safeguards online accounts by detecting and neutralizing compromised and fake accounts on apps and websites. It stops fraud and abuse, reduces customer risk and cuts your fraud team’s workload. Account Defender uses behavioral analysis to continuously monitor accounts post-login for suspicious behavior. It generates an evolving risk score based on all activity in an account rather than relying on a single point-in-time check, such as only at login or at the point of transaction. When a risk threshold is met, automated actions such as locking the account are triggered.

Defense against: Compromised Accounts and Fake (New) Account Creation

Code Defender

HUMAN Code Defender is a client-side web application security solution that provides comprehensive real-time visibility and granular control into modern website’s client-side supply chain attack surface. Leveraging behavioral analysis and advanced machine learning, Code Defender identifies vulnerabilities and anomalous behavior to reduce the risk of non-compliance.

Cybersecurity researchers at Varonis disclosed technical details of critical SQLi and access vulnerabilities impacting the Zendesk Explore service. Zendesk Explore allows organizations to view and analyze key information about their customers, and their support resources.

Threat actors would have allowed threat actors to access conversations, email addresses, tickets, comments, and other information from Zendesk accounts having the Explore service enabled. The experts are not aware of attacks in the wild.

“To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first register for the ticketing service of its victim’s Zendesk account as a new external user. Registration is enabled by default because many Zendesk customers rely on end-users submitting support tickets directly via the web.” reads the advisory published by Varonis. “Zendesk Explore is not enabled by default but is heavily advertised as a requirement for the analytic insights page.”

Varonis reported the flaws to Zendesk which started working on a fix the same day they were reported. The company addressed multiple vulnerabilities in less than one workweek.

In order to exploit these flaws, an attacker has to register for the ticketing service of the target’s Zendesk account as a new external user. The experts highlighted that this is a feature that’s likely enabled by default to allow end-users to submit support tickets.

The SQL injection vulnerability resides in the GraphQL API execute-query, an attacker can abuse it to exfiltrate all information (email addresses of users, leads, and deals from the CRM, live agent conversations, tickets, help center articles, and more) stored in the database as an admin user.

The second critical issue is a logic access flaw associated with a query execution API. The researchers pointed out that the execute-query API did not perform the following logical checks:

The integrity of documents was not checked, allowing our team to modify them in ways that exposed the inner workings of the system. “query,” “datasources,” and “cubeModels” IDs were not evaluated to see if they belonged to the current user. Finally, and most critically, the API endpoint did not verify that the caller had permission to access the database and execute queries. This meant that a newly created end-user could invoke this API, change the query, and steal data from any table in the target Zendesk account’s RDS, no SQLi required.

Varonis reported the issues to Zendesk on August 30 and the company addressed it on September 8, 2022.

Researchers from cybersecurity firm Avast observed the recently discovered espionage group Worok abusing Dropbox API to exfiltrate data via using a backdoor hidden in apparently innocuous image files.

The experts started their investigation from the analysis published by ESET on attacks against organizations and local governments in Asia and Africa. Avast experts were able to capture several PNG files embedding a data-stealing payload. They pointed out that data collection from victims’ machines using DropBox repository, and attackers use DropBox API for communication with the final stage.

Avast experts shed the light on the compromise chain detailing how attackers initially deployed the first-stage malware., tracked as CLRLoader, which loads the next-state payload PNGLoader.

“PNGLoader is a loader that extracts bytes from PNGs files and reconstructs them into an executable code. PNGLoader is a .NET DLL file obfuscated utilizing .NET Reactor; the file description provides information that mimics legitimate software such as Jscript Profiler or Transfer Service Proxy.” reads the report published by Avast. “The deobfuscated PNGLoader code includes the entry point (Setfilter) invoked by CLRLoader.”

The malicious code is supposedly deployed by threat actors by exploiting Proxyshell vulnerabilities. Then attackers used publicly available exploit tools to deploy their custom malicious tools.

The experts found two variants of PNGLoad, both used to decode the malicious code hidden in the image and run a PowerShell script or a .NET C#-based payload.

The PowerShell script has continued to be elusive, although the cybersecurity company noted it was able to flag a few PNG files belonging to the second category that dispensed a steganographically embedded C# malware.

“At first glance, the PNG pictures look innocent, like a fluffy cloud,” Avast said.

Avast extends the compromise chain detailed by ESET with the discovery of a .NET C# payload that they tracked as DropBoxControl, which represents a third stage.

DropboxControl is an information-stealing backdoor that communicates abuses the DropBox service for C2 communication.

“Noteworthy, the C&C server is a DropBox account, and whole communications, such as commands, uploads, and downloads, are performed using regular files in specific folders. Therefore, the backdoor commands are represented as files with a defined extension. DropBoxControl periodically checks the DropBox folder and executes commands based on the request files.” continues the report. “The response for each command is also uploaded to the DropBox folder as the result file.”

The backdoor can run arbitrary executables, download and upload data, delete and rename files, capture file information, sniff network communications, and exfiltrate metadata.

According to Avast, DropboxControl was not developed by the author of CLRLoad and PNGLoad due to important differences into the source code and its quality.

“The key finding of this research is the interception of the PNG files, as predicted by ESET. The stenographically embedded C# payload (DropBoxControl) confirms Worok as the cyberespionage group. They steal data via the DropBox account registered on active Google emails.” concludes AVAST. “The prevalence of Worok’s tools in the wild is low, so it can indicate that the toolset is an APT project focusing on high-profile entities in private and public sectors in Asia, Africa, and North America.”

147,"Based on our survey of over 900 ICS security leaders in the United States, Germany, and Japan, we dig deeper into each industry's challenges and present Trend Micro's recommendations.",cybersecurity,16/11/2022,https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/thumbnails/22/electricity-energy-cybersecurity-trends-threats.png,trendmicro.com,"Trend Micro conducted a study on the state of industrial cybersecurity in the oil and gas, manufacturing, and electricity/energy industries in 2022. Based on the results of a survey of over 900 ICS business and security leaders in the United States, Germany, and Japan, we will discuss the characteristics of each industry, the motivations and environmental factors that will drive future cybersecurity improvements. We will also introduce Trend Micro's proposals based on the industry's current state, focusing on manufacturing & production.

Here is for the oil and gas industry.

Here is for the manufacturing

The environment surrounding the electric power industry has changed significantly over the past 10 years, and especially since the adoption of the SDGs to aim for sustainable energy, there is a pressing need to review the supply chain and entire system of the energy industry on a national scale.

A stable supply of electricity supports many industries and lifestyles, including manufacturing, restaurants, transportation such as trains, and households. The impact of power supply instability and outages is more widespread than in other industries.

Due to the nature of electricity, it is not possible to store large amounts of electricity cheaply, so it is essential to match supply and demand (production). To adjust supply according to demand, we have introduced mechanisms such as DR (Demand Response) and VPP (Virtual Power Plant) and are actively utilizing ICT.

In addition, the modernization of power generation, transmission, and distribution systems (digitization, network connection, use of general-purpose software and IT, etc.) is progressing, and at the same time, cyber risks are increasing.

In the United States, ahead of other industries, the Cyber Security Capability Maturity Model (ES-C2M2) was published in 2014 and has been used as a self-assessment procedure. In addition, NERC has decided on a new standard (CIP-012-1) for the protection of communications between large-scale power system control centers, and as a result, guidelines for security measures such as new supply chain risk measures have been introduced.

In addition, in Europe, where electricity is supplied between EU member states, the increase in security threats is not a risk for a single country, but energy and other critical infrastructure operators are required to take security measures (NIS Directive). Security measures are being implemented one after another. Here, we would like to share with you some excerpts from a report conducted by Trend Micro that show trends specific to the electric power industry.

Agenda

1 Characteristics and Considerations of the Electricity/energy Industry Regarding Cyberattacks

1.1 The amount of damage caused by cyberattacks is large

1.2 Causes of system outages

1.3 Current status for security system improvement

1.4 Drivers of Security Improvements

2 Trend Micro Proposal

1 Characteristics and Considerations of the Electricity/energy Industry Regarding Cyberattacks

1.1 The amount of damage caused by cyberattacks is large

The amount of damage caused by cyberattacks was $3,378K (Monetary loss due to interruption of ICS/OT system due to cyberattack in last 12 months), which is the same as Oil & Gas. This is 1.8 times the amount of the manufacturing industry. In addition, system downtime was long, and 56% of respondents answered that the outage period was 3 days or longer, exceeding the majority.

As mentioned above, electricity is cheap and cannot be stored in large quantities, and the risk of supply shortages increases if system outages are prolonged. In addition, it is difficult to stop production (production) in the middle, and even if an incident occurs, it cannot be stopped immediately. It may take several days to several months, or even years, to perform scheduled inspections. Also, considering that electricity is the infrastructure of our lives, there is a risk that it will have a greater impact on society as a whole than the amount of damage caused by the electric power industry.

1.2 Causes of system outages

The number one cause of system outages was “Exploitation of external published applications or cloud service” at 31.3%. The second was ""Compromise of internet accessible device"" and ""Malware infection due to legitimate web browsing"", both at 29.7%. Outages due to the use of removable media and phishing were the lowest compared to other industries.",Electricity/Energy Cybersecurity: Trends & Survey Response,https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/k/electricity-energy-cybersecurity-trends-threats.html

STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Students at the College of Staten Island (CSI) pitched many transformative business ideas during a recent campus-wide competition, and the winners have been announced.

CSI has announced the winners of the 2022 Blackstone LaunchPad Ideas Competition.

Students submitted thought-provoking ideas, with applications spread across several different categories. After careful consideration, the college’s Lucille & Jay Chazanoff School of Business shared the winners in several categories, including Social and Climate impact, Health and Life Sciences, General category, Consumer category, Veteran category, First Generation category and the Historically Underrepresented category.

More than 150 submissions were received for the competition, according to the school.

LaunchPad is open to students from all areas across CSI. The Blackstone LaunchPad entrepreneurship network at CSI makes entrepreneurship accessible by connecting a diverse group of students to resources both on and off campus, according to the college.

Social and Climate

In the Social and Climate category of the competition, Michael Cascio is the first-place winner, with his proposal “Moon Shot,” an app that delivers advanced baseball metrics on the spot. The app would capture bat speed along with ball exit velocity and launch angle, just from setting up behind the batter as they swing. It would also give insights into hit probability, after briefly scanning the field that the batter is hitting on. Cascio said he hopes to make baseball more exciting and relevant for the younger generation using this app, according to CSI.

Health and Life Sciences

First-place winner Aliah Salem’s proposal for a “Modified Seatbelt” stems from an issue that hits close to home. One of Salem’s relatives suffers from a health-related condition that makes the positioning of a typical seatbelt problematic. This has motivated Salem to help both her family member and others with similar conditions.

General

Yekaterina Zelikova pitched her idea of a “Personalized Cybersecurity Software Development Firm.” As major cybersecurity attacks are rising, the idea looks to protect CEOs, wealthy business owners, and their consumers from having their information stolen on the web. It would keep corporations and consumers’ sensitive information safer than software ever could. According to CSI, Zelikova came up with this idea after one of her family members had their identity stolen due to substandard security software.

Consumer

Tal Ohana is striving to keep sneakers looking fresh with his idea, “Klean Kicks,” according to the college. Ohana offers a sneaker cleaning and refurbishing service, in which his expertise and care set him apart from the rest. Ohana gained inspiration for “Klean Kicks” by maintaining his own sneaker collection.

Additionally, Jose Oropeza is also offering his services to “sneakerheads” with his business, “Lifeandsoles.” He is focused on inspiring those who are invested in sneaker culture and streetwear, by allowing them to express themselves in their clothing. The business provides high-end shoe laces, the latest sneaker releases, and its own apparel.

Veteran

Holly Ardern’s idea, “Toilet Access NYC,” is designed to assist New Yorkers with disabilities with their bathroom needs. She is working to build an app that gives users directions to the closest accessible bathroom.

These bathrooms will be rated on the app and evaluated with guidelines that go beyond that of the American Disabilities Act (ADA). The app will also allow users to tailor their bathroom needs based on their specific abilities to ensure that they will find the bathroom that is right for them, according to CSI.

First Generation

Dominick Francois impressed the judges with his idea for “Island Hopper,” a “hop-on-hop-off bus tour of Staten Island.”

“Staten Island is still an untapped market for the New York City tourist. Island Hopper is a great way to tap in to the tourist market in a way that can also tremendously benefit Staten Island businesses too,” he said.

Salvatore Nicolosi said he wants to assist Staten Island drivers in personalizing their vehicle with his business, “Aesthetic Motorsports,” which would allow vehicle owners to express their creativity through their cars through customizable color wraps, seat belts and other aftermarket cosmetic installs. Nicolosi came up with his idea through finding joy in working on and customizing his own car.

Latesha Negron’s proposal, “Digital Price Change,” is designed to give consumers accurate price points on retail items. He would add digital, easily updated price tags to shelves in order to cut out the confusion of expired price markings for both buyers and sellers. With “Digital Price Change,” just the click of a button will allow retail stores to display their current prices.

Historically Underrepresented

Through his proposal “FashionGo,” Adrian Gonzales is looking to give people stylish advice. The app would keep a photo inventory of a person’s clothing and tell them where, when, and why to wear a certain outfit and would also match clothes to create the perfect outfit for any occasion.

CURTIS CLOSET OPENS THIS WEEK

Curtis High School in St. George will open its Curtis Closet for free coat distribution on Thursday.

The school will have brand new and some used coats for all sizes — from infants to XXL. Coats will be available during periods 8 and 9 in the school auditorium.

All coats are free.

The Curtis Closet was created in 2017 by Assistant Principal Diana Aversa and several students. The inspiration for the closet began after Aversa brought gently used and new clothing items to Curtis to see if any students wanted the pieces, such as gowns and Curtis gear.

In the spring, the closet offers prom gowns and suits to students.

The Arizona Department of Homeland Security provides strategic direction and access to federal homeland security resources. It also manages the statewide cyber readiness grant program to further enable the prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery from terrorist attacks and other critical hazards that affect the safety and economic security of Arizona. Tanium was selected to provide cybersecurity and support compliance in a multiframework environment.

“In cybersecurity, we’re expected to hold off the Russian military, as well as the Chinese, the North Koreans, the Iranians, you name it,” said Tim Roemer, CISO for the state of Arizona’s and director of the Arizona Department of Homeland Security. “After all, cybersecurity is homeland security, and I can’t protect 7.5 million Arizonan’s data from an attacker I don’t know about. With a whole-of-state approach supported by Tanium and AWS, we’re now sharing information in real time. I’m stronger as a CISO because I know what other people are seeing, and locals are better protecting themselves from attacks we’re seeing at the state level.”

The whole-of-state approach is rooted in collaboration. It provides coordination and standardization of governance, implementation and validation. In just the first five months of last year, 71 million Americans were affected by ransomware attacks on state, local, and tribal entities, prompting governments to turn to companies like Tanium for help.

“Arizona prioritizes a 21st-century economy and workforce,” said Megan Fitzgerald, public safety and cybersecurity advisor to Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. “State-wide cybersecurity is key to achieving our goals. Best practices such as this are critical to enable effective commerce and innovation, while protecting Arizona families and finances from getting into the wrong hands. We are proud to see Arizona lead the nation in providing security services to all levels of government.”

The situation in Arizona is similar to what exists in other state and local governments. States and municipalities around the country face a critical need to replace their outdated point tools with easily scalable platform solutions.

“Addressing the basics of cybersecurity and fulfilling the standardized cybersecurity frameworks is difficult for any organization, but for government organizations, and specifically smaller governments organizations like rural communities and K12 districts, this challenge is exponentially more difficult,” said Ryan Murray, Arizona’s deputy CISO and deputy director of the Arizona Department of Homeland Security. “We’re working hard to address the cybersecurity poverty line between the have/have nots in the public sector. Utilizing resources at the state level to bring security to the whole-of-state allows the organizations below the poverty line to quickly close gaps and focus their fiscal and human resources on developing a more holistic cyber strategy.”

The AZDOHS pioneering whole-of-state approach will help other states evaluate, select, procure, and execute similar initiatives by providing a proven model for proactive cybersecurity protection and proven governance structure. In fact, Arizona was able to patch more than 326,000 vulnerabilities in fewer than 72 hours with Tanium—more than it had been able to patch in the previous six months.

“Tanium Cloud partner AWS streamlined the procurement process through AWS Marketplace, making it faster, more efficient, and more cost effective for Arizona,” said Rob Jenks, senior vice president of corporate strategy at Tanium. “Buying Tanium in the AWS Marketplace allows customers to make purchases quickly and seamlessly by leveraging their existing agreements and processes with AWS, resulting in a great buying experience to go along with the fast and easy experience of deploying and using Tanium Cloud on AWS.”

Tanium brings IT, Compliance, Security, and Risk teams together with a single trusted source of truth to support statewide IT decision-making. Numerous government organizations already trust Tanium XEM to reduce their attack surface and provide unrivaled access to real-time asset visibility and the ability to patch at scale—including devices that are on or off network or VPN. XEM’s single pane of glass identifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities with vigilant, real-time visibility to remediate potential threats almost immediately.

Part of this includes closely following the latest security threat reports, highlighting trends, and offering valuable insights into methods bad actors use to compromise environments.

Threat intelligence resources like the 2022 Elastic Global Threat Report are critical to helping my team evaluate our organization’s visibility, capabilities, and expertise in identifying and preventing cybersecurity threats. It helps us answer questions such as:

How is our environment impacted by the current and emerging threats identified in this report?

Does this new information change our risk profile and impact our risk analysis?

What adjustments do we need to make to our controls?

Are we lacking visibility in any areas?

Do we have the right detections in place?

How might these insights affect my team’s workflows?

Elastic’s threat report provides a real-world roadmap to help my team make the connections necessary to strengthen our security posture. It influences our overall program roadmaps, helping us prioritize where we focus our resources, including adjusting our defenses, testing incident response plans, and identifying updates for our security operations center (SOC). And perhaps most importantly, the report underscores our belief that providing open, transparent, and accessible security for all organizations is key to defending ourselves against cybersecurity threats.

Check your cloud security, and then check it again

Threat reports often reinforce many of the existing trends and phenomena we see within security, but they can also reveal some unexpected insights. While the cloud enables organizations to operate faster and at scale, it also creates security gaps that leave room for potential attacks as threat actors continue shifting their focus to the cloud.

The Elastic Global Threat Report revealed that nearly 40% of all malware infections are on Linux endpoints, further emphasizing the need for better cloud security. With nine out of the top ten public clouds running on Linux, this statistic is an important reminder to organizations not to rely solely on their cloud provider’s standard configurations for security.

The findings further revealed that approximately 57% of cloud security events were attributed to AWS, followed by 22% for Google Cloud and 21% for Azure, and that 1 out of every 3 (33%) cloud alerts was related to credential access across all cloud service providers.

While the data points to an increased need for organizations to properly secure their cloud environments, it also reinforces our belief that cloud security posture management (CSPM) needs to evolve similarly to endpoint security.

Initially, endpoint security relied on simple antivirus, which was only as good as its antivirus signatures. To avoid increasingly sophisticated malware and threats, endpoint security evolved by employing more advanced technologies like next-gen antivirus with machine learning and artificial intelligence. CSPM is currently facing a similar situation. Right now, we are closer to the bottom of the cloud security learning curve than the top, and our technologies and strategies must continue to evolve to manage new and emerging threats.

The Elastic Global Threat Report demonstrates that native tools and traditional security tactics are ineffective when implemented in cloud environments and offers recommendations for how organizations can adapt to the evolving threat landscape.

Get the basics right first

Security leaders and teams should leverage insights from this report to inform their priorities and adjust their workflows accordingly.

The findings clearly show why focusing on and improving basic security hygiene is so crucial to improved security outcomes. Too often, an organization’s environment is compromised by something as simple as a weak password or failure to update default configurations. Prioritizing security fundamentals — identity and access management, patching, threat modeling, password awareness, and multi-factor authentication — is a simple yet effective way for security teams to prevent and protect against potential threats.

Develop security in the open

Organizations should consider adopting an open approach to security. For example, Elastic’s threat report links to our recent publication of protection artifacts, which transparently shares endpoint behavioral logic that we develop at Elastic to identify adversary tradecraft and make it freely available to our community.

The report also highlights how Elastic Security’s prebuilt detection rules map to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix for each cloud service provider. As an adopter of the MITRE framework since its inception, Elastic understands the importance of mapping detection rules to an industry standard. For my team, this helps us have deeper insights into the breadth and depth of our security posture.

Providing open detection rules, open artifacts, and open code enables organizations to focus on addressing gaps in their security technology stack and developing risk profiles for new and emerging threats. Without openness and transparency in security, organizations are putting themselves at greater risk of tomorrow’s cybersecurity threats.

155,Micron Expands IoT Security Portfolio to Tackle the Cybersecurity Needs of the Intelligent Edge  GlobeNewswire,cybersecurity,15/11/2022,https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/e43481ef-6679-4e19-a04e-0acc19898da7?size=1,globenewswire,"MUNICH, Germany, Nov. 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Electronica – Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU) announced today that it is expanding its portfolio for its silicon root-of-trust solution, Authenta™, making its cloud-based internet of things (IoT) security offerings more widely accessible. Micron is enabling Authenta in a family of Serial Peripheral Interface NOR (SPI-NOR) devices with increased density and packaging options and unveiling the Authenta Cloud Platform to help enterprises deploy and scale trust-based security at the intelligent edge. The company is also collaborating with security solutions expert Swissbit AG and new customer SanCloud as Authenta gains further traction in the market.



“As the IoT market expands, strong cybersecurity at the intelligent edge is becoming even more critical to broad deployment,” said Kris Baxter, corporate vice president and general manager of Micron’s Embedded Business Unit. “With this expansion of our cybersecurity portfolio, introduction of our cloud platform and ecosystem momentum, Authenta is fast becoming a key enabler of IoT trust, helping to deliver secure cloud services at the edge – underpinned by strong hardware security.”

Authenta portfolio growth extends hardware security and services to broader range of devices

As the threat landscape evolves with sophisticated bad actors and hacks on IoT devices ranging from cardiac devices to routers, cybersecurity is often a weak link in broader IoT adoption. Micron’s silicon-based security solution, Authenta, helps facilitate vital cybersecurity operations for IoT and industrial edge with an edge-to-cloud trust solution that is simpler, more robust and more convenient than earlier methods.

Enabling Authenta on a full family of SPI-NOR devices brings customers greater choice and versatility. This includes new availability of automotive and industrial-grade options, 128Mb to 256Mb memory sizes, 1.8 volts (V) to 3V, and a wide selection of packaging options that include wafer-level chip scale, ball grid array, SO16 and WPDFN. These new offerings allow Authenta technology to be more easily integrated into a growing array of industry-standard servers, automotive, industrial IoT and consumer systems, such as wireless routers and smart home appliances.

Through its silicon root of trust, Authenta provides a unique level of protection for the lowest layers of IoT software. Starting with the boot process, Authenta uses strong cryptographic identity and secure element features directly embedded in the flash memory.

Micron’s newly announced Authenta Cloud Platform incorporates the capabilities of its existing Authenta Key Management Service and adds new billing and ordering functionality to streamline essential operations required by edge services via cloud-based infrastructure. Authenta Cloud Platform’s new end-to-end capabilities allow Micron’s customers to scale and pay for these cybersecurity services in one streamlined cloud platform, in addition to providing them with the ability to pass down these simplified onboarding and automated billing capabilities to end customers. These robust platform capabilities allow real-time, in-field device authentication across customers’ supply chains and throughout the device lifecycle, building trust and offering an open, scalable foundation to power end-to-end cloud services across the IoT ecosystem.

Authenta ecosystem adoption illustrates expanding market opportunities for IoT security

As Micron’s Authenta gains more traction in the market, new customers such as SanCloud are integrating Authenta flash in its BeagleBone® Enhanced Single Board Computer systems to deliver device management and secure data analytics for applications such as connected lighting, automotive gateways and preventative machine maintenance. SanCloud’s BeagleBone Enhanced systems are highly capable embedded devices with a blend of on-board sensors, wireless connectivity, I/O and processing power used by a varied range of industrial customers. SanCloud’s SanTrack IoT cloud solution uses the Authenta Cloud Platform to activate, gain control and configure the security functions of the Authenta flash and ensures the trust and security of these embedded devices from the manufacturing stage to secure onboarding to deployment.

The addition of Micron Authenta to SanCloud’s devices opens up a range of powerful security features for SanCloud customers including secure boot, golden image locking, memory block allocation, secure over-the-air updates and device integrity monitoring.

Swissbit, a leading European security and memory solution provider for IoT applications, and Micron are also now collaborating to embed Authenta technology in Swissbit’s security and storage solutions for IoT and industrial markets — bringing Micron’s unique silicon root-of-trust security features to Swissbit’s broad base of customers across areas such as industrial automation, automotive, IoT, medical, networking and communication. The first Swissbit storage product with integrated Authenta technology will be a microSD card, ideal for retrofitting IoT systems. An embedded product, eMMC, will follow later.

The integration of Authenta’s secure element features in Swissbit’s flash storage modules gives Swissbit customers the ability to use the Authenta Cloud Platform for its simplified silicon-to-cloud onboarding and authentication capabilities.

“IoT applications demand the highest level of security to store, process and protect sensitive data and thus to power vital operations across broad industrial segments,” said Hubertus Grobbel, vice president of security solutions at Swissbit. “Micron’s silicon root-of-trust security features combined with Authenta Cloud Platform deepen our cybersecurity offerings and will equip our customers with a hardware foundation they need to deliver rigorous security and trust at the edge.”

The cyberthreats of the past year offer a preview of the challenges government agencies will continue to face in defending U.S. critical assets. To address these threats, Tenable believes the Biden administration should work to quickly implement the recommendations of the recent National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) report to the President on Information Technology and Operational Technology (IT/OT) Convergence.

While the report’s primary recommendations are critical, the NSTAC offered three additional steps to secure U.S. OT infrastructure, outlined below:

1. Clearly articulate roles, responsibilities and accountabilities

While conducting its research, NSTAC discovered that, when responding to cybersecurity incidents or concerns, many in the critical infrastructure community are confused about whom to engage within the U.S. federal government. Stakeholders face duplicative reporting requirements to local, state and/or federal agencies, each with different reporting formats and deadlines. This challenge seems to be particularly compounded with OT and industrial control systems (ICS).

NSTAC recommends:

The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) and the National Security Council (NSC) should clearly articulate the respective roles and responsibilities for the various executive branch departments and agencies that provide support to stakeholders across critical infrastructure and other sectors. Clarifying responsibilities would help critical infrastructure owners and operators more effectively respond to cybersecurity incidents and guide them on where to turn within the government if additional support is needed.

2. Streamline cyber regulations for critical infrastructure

Currently, the U.S. government addresses critical infrastructure cybersecurity risks through a patchwork of federal and state laws. These laws can create duplicative or even conflicting cybersecurity requirements for owners and operators of critical infrastructure OT systems. The ONCD is currently working on a national cybersecurity strategy, which presents an excellent opportunity to address cybersecurity regulatory alignment.

NSTAC recommends:

ONCD, in collaboration with CISA, should initiate an interagency study that evaluates conflicting regulations for OT operators within the same sector. The end goal of this initiative would be to identify opportunities to synchronize conflicting requirements and simplify the regulatory landscape for critical infrastructure entities.

3. Take advantage of Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funding opportunities

According to subject matter experts who briefed the NSTAC, OT cybersecurity has been historically underfunded by the U.S. government, especially when compared to appropriations dedicated to mitigating IT threats. Fortunately, new government funding provides opportunities to help drive OT cybersecurity forward.

NSTAC recommends:

Critical infrastructure OT owners/operators should leverage grant and funding programs included in the November 2021 IIJA. The recent law allocates $2 billion to modernize and secure federal, state and local IT and networks; protect critical infrastructure and utilities; and support public or private entities as they respond to and recover from significant cyberattacks and breaches.

The State and Local Government Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLGCP), as well as grant and funding vehicles focused on transportation, energy and water/wastewater, can all be used to enhance OT cybersecurity defenses. These dollars have recently been made available.

Emerging OT security policies

CISA’s recently released Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals significantly aims to address some of the most common and impactful cyber risks facing the U.S., placing a special emphasis on OT security. The CISA document states that OT cybersecurity is often overlooked and under-resourced. The common set of IT and OT cybersecurity protections detailed in the paper is intended to help address this problem, offering OT-specific guidance.

Tenable believes this emerging policy focus on the cybersecurity of OT systems is a very good start. IT/OT convergence will continue to be a security concern for years to come, but the sooner organizations can start planning to address these challenges, the sooner they can start improving cyber hygiene and work toward securing U.S. critical infrastructure.

157,"Ransomware attacks are often talked about in terms of the financial cost. But in reality, these incidents can have a much bigger impact.",cybersecurity,15/11/2022,https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/c6b1e9eb1f40d47787ab475354dd6d087415ede8/2020/08/17/834d26eb-b459-4eee-b55f-df511d55806e/istock-1040991478.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,zdnet,"Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto

It's well known that ransomware attacks are one of the most significant cybersecurity challenges facing the world today, and often the financial impact on victims is the most obvious and most discussed consequence. But that's far from the only cost.

The Ransomware Harms and the Victim Experience project by the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI) and the University of Kent looks to explore and draw attention to the psychological harms and other affects that ransomware can have on its victims and wider society.

""We've seen lots of mentions of ransomware, but what we haven't seen is a focus on the victims and the impact,"" said Jason Nurse, professor in cybersecurity at the University of Kent and associate fellow at RUSI, speaking at an event in London to launch the project.

""There's focus on the financial impact of ransomware, but what we're especially interested in for this project is what are the harms beyond the financial impact? How are victims, be it organizations or individuals, impacted by ransomware?"" he added.

Also: The scary future of the internet: How the tech of tomorrow will pose even bigger cybersecurity threats

The project aims to draw attention to the disruption ransomware can cause to organisations and individuals. The project wants to provide a framework to make it easier to understand the impact cyberattacks can have on the 'real world' and prevent them from causing widespread disruption.

While cyberattacks might be viewed as a problem for the cybersecurity industry, a major incident can have far-ranging consequences, which means ransomware can have a huge impact beyond the problems it causes for IT professionals. The UK's National Health Service (NHS) got a taste of this impact in 2017 when it was one of the most high-profile victims of the global WannaCry ransomware attack.

While this was not a traditional ransomware attack – the campaign was launched by North Korea and the malware appears to have got out of hand – it demonstrated the impact a cyberattack can have, as many hospitals and GP surgeries found themselves without access to computer systems and appointments – and patient services were delayed or cancelled.

""A ransomware attack can have such far-reaching and damaging consequences that isn't a targeted attempt to undermine critical infrastructure per se, it's an attempt to make money. And in so doing, almost by accident, it actually cripples critical infrastructure,"" said Eleanor Fairford, deputy director for incident management at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

Hospitals and healthcare appear to be particularly vulnerable to ransomware attacks. It is difficult to keep systems up to date with security patches because it's hard to apply an update to a vital machine that must be online at all times.

This vulnerability means cyber criminals know that hospitals are potentially easy targets. While organizations in many other sectors could potentially work without computer systems, while attempts are made to restore the network without paying a ransom, a healthcare provider might not have that luxury.

In May 2021, Ireland's Heath Service Executive – responsible for healthcare and social services across Ireland – fell victim to a major ransomware attack. The body didn't pay the ransom, which was reported to be a demand of $20 million – and even despite receiving the right decryption key, restoring the network was a slow and arduous process that disrupted services for months on end.

Advice from security agencies and cybersecurity professionals is that ransom payments shouldn't be made as it only encourages further attacks. But that's hard when key services are under threat.

""We in security often sit in a bit of an ivory tower and we speak about these things academically and theoretically – but we have to remember there are victims at the end of this chain and it impacts their lives,"" said Jen Ellis, co-chair of the Ransomware Task Force (RTF).

Also: The ransomware problem won't get better until we change one thing

Just weeks after the HSE incident, another major ransomware attack hit the headlines – this time US meat processor and food production company JBS was compromised by ransomware. The company paid a ransom of $11 million to cyber criminals for a decryption key to help restore the network and food production services, but the attack caused problems for farmers and the livestock industry more broadly.

Another popular target for ransomware gangs has been local government, which – like healthcare – often doesn't have the budget or staff required to invest heavily in cybersecurity but provides vital services to the local population. Disrupting those services can lead to significant issues.

""It's less the ransomware itself than the knock-on impact and the human factor – it's really powerful,"" said Fairford, who as an incident responder at the NCSC has been involved in dealing with attacks. ""I've always been struck by how powerfully it's felt by those who aren't the victims.""

For example, in October 2020, the London Borough of Hackney was hit by what the NCSC has since detailed as a ransomware attack. The borough didn't pay the ransom, but services were disrupted for many months while systems were repaired and restored. For many people living in Hackney, the incident was emotionally and psychologically damaging.

""We've had various testimonies – and the testimony from Hackney, people are still tearful when they talk about how they were unable to continue to do their jobs or provide services and look after their community,"" said Fairford.

Also: Ransomware: Why it's still a big threat, and where the gangs are going next

Ransomware is an expensive problem – it cost Hackney more than £12 million to recover from the attack, even without paying a ransom. However, it's also clear that cost isn't just a financial one, because there's a human cost too – one that can be extremely distressing.

That's why it's imperative that organizations take action to prevent their networks from falling victim to ransomware in the first place; if cyber criminals can't get into networks to encrypt them, then they can't hold organizations – or wider society – hostage.

Steps that organizations can take to bolster their defences against cyberattacks include applying avoiding the use of default passwords across networks, providing all users with multi-factor authentication, and applying security patches as soon as possible after they come out – or to ensure mitigations are in place, so systems that can't be patched aren't on networks that are facing the internet.

Only if networks are protected against ransomware, will it stop being a problem for the for tech teams – and the rest of us.

159,"From antivirus to NGAV to MDR, cybersecurity tools evolved to keep pace with attacks. But new tools require new skills and people.",cybersecurity,15/11/2022,https://www.channele2e.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/radar-threat-hunting-security-GettyImages-1219565719.jpg,channele2e,"Antivirus (AV) has been around since the early age of networked computers, emerging in the 1980s to more commercially available products in the 1990s. Early antivirus worked by scanning for and blocking known virus signatures. As new viruses and malware emerged, you’d have to update your AV database, then run a scan looking for these new bad signatures. In 1994 there were about 30,000 malware samples in most AV databases.

AV was doing its job, researchers were discovering new malware and submitting samples, databases were being updated, and we were scanning and blocking threats. This really worked for quite a while, but as computer and the internet became more common, the cybersecurity community (attackers and defenders) started to realize something.

Attackers were persistent. They’d write new malware to get through protections, each new malware sample creating a new signature. Defenders would discover it, apply the hash to their signature database, and block it. This cat and mouse game went on for a while, but it was tough to keep up, neither side really getting ahead. New malware would be created, it would be discovered and blocked, and the cycle continued.

In 2005 there were roughly 333,000 malware hashes in any given database. As you can see, this number is quite a bit more than what we were seeing in the mid-90s, but AV was still working well. By 2007 though, there were almost 5.5 million unique malware samples reported and that was just two years later! AV was struggling to keep up and things needed to change.

Attackers were also starting to use our own tools against us—such as PowerShell scripts and Office document macros. These were things that traditional AV had a much more difficult time detecting, as the software and execution itself were supposed to be safe.

Cybersecurity experts started to realize we could no longer keep up using this antiquated technology and we had to make some improvements. Next-generation AV (NGAV) started to emerge in the early 2010s. Instead of relying on known hashes, we realized we could look for patterns in the malware and attempt to detect new strains by using the behavior of the malware itself. Instead of looking for just the known bad, we could utilize NGAV to look at everything that executes on the endpoint and determine whether it was malicious or not by the way it behaved.

But not everything is 100%, especially in security. We started seeing new threats all the time, including ransomware, fileless malware, and zero-day attacks. NGAV was good, but we also needed to be able to respond to and remediate the things that weren’t initially stopped by NGAV.

Shortly after NGAV, we evolved into using endpoint detection and response (EDR) platforms. These platforms took the best pieces from AV and NGAV and combined them. Even though malware variants change all the time, there is a much smaller number of ways the malware behaves. This led to the development of the MITRE ATT&CK framework that many EDR solutions are now using today. If we can map these behaviors to the primary 14 techniques, it’s much easier to detect.

Even if malware isn’t detected at that initial infection, chances are it’s going to do something that we know about, and that’s where the response comes in. Like NGAV, EDR solutions track everything on the endpoint. Eventually, that malware will get caught and we’ll be able to step back through the processes, learn what was done, and remediate those changes, cleaning up your endpoints.

You may have heard of an even newer technology, extended detection and response (XDR) and that’s the next evolution. EDR is great at protecting your endpoints, but as the internet of things (IoT) grows, there are a lot more devices than just endpoints on your network. There are printers, phones, cameras, fridges, coffee makers, and so many other things that cannot be protected by EDR—and most of these IoT devices are great ways to get into a network. So how do we protect all these other things? We look at the network traffic going to and from all these devices, then start to learn what’s normal and what isn’t. XDR could be a whole article itself, so we’ll leave it here for now.

As you can imagine, with these new tools comes new skillsets and people required to manage them—that’s where ConnectWise can help. We not only offer some of the best EDR tools available, but we also have the manpower to manage and respond to all these new threats we’re seeing. The ConnectWise security operations center (SOC) operates 24/7/365 and along with the ConnectWise Cyber Research Unit (CRU), is filled with the cybersecurity experts you need.

He recalls that in a past job he inherited some very expensive vaporware under a long-term services agreement. His predecessor had purchased an “innovative” beta identity and access management platform but hadn’t done any analysis on the product, simply accepting the vendor’s claims of its efficacy. It was a dud.

Inversely, as CISO at his current company Grand Canyon Education, Manrod set his team up to evaluate an allegedly “brilliant” web application security product only to discover through testing that its client-side validation was easy to bypass and thus subvert the product. That basic test saved them from making an expensive mistake. “Startups are trysforming, and sometimes they go back to the drawing board. Nothing wrong there, but if we as security leaders purchase something that’s not ready yet, that’s on us,” he says.

A mature evaluation program begins with a clear understanding of a problem and the solutions intended to solve it, Manrod says. An immature team, by contrast, might chase products for no better reason than an executive saw something they liked at a conference without first defining a clear business need for it.

Furthermore, a mature evaluation team understands and reviews a wide range of solutions before narrowing down to those that meet the business-defined needs, Manrod says. Mature organizations also put greater reliance on testing, rather than believing a vendor’s marketing pitches without question. For example, he says, an advanced testing team would replicate the exact tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of an attacker to try and bypass the tool altogether.

No universal framework for vetting cybersecurity vendors

The most important hallmarks of a mature program – standard assessment formats and repeatable processes – are pretty much nonexistent at an industry level, leaving buyers to develop their own checklists and spreadsheets for each new type of solution they’re considering. This causes difficulties on the buyer and seller sides alike, says Chenxi Wang, longtime cybersecurity expert and managing general partner at cybersecurity VC firm Rain Capital, which currently funds 13 cybersecurity startups, such as Living Security and JupiterOne.

“There is no universal framework that people use to evaluate their security vendors, which is a pity because people replicate work across many different vendors, products, and services. And I am on both sides of this issue – I evaluate companies for investment purposes. Then once we invest, we’re on the sell side,” she says. “I would love it if there were universal frameworks and standards to use. That would make the sell-side job a lot easier – knowing what to prioritize and how to communicate to customers.""

Part of the problem with standardizing evaluations for security services comes from pushback on the part of vendors and testers, suggests Simon Edwards, founder of the UK-based security product assessment provider, SE Labs. Vendors, he says, don’t want criticism because it costs them buyers, while testers tell him that they don’t generally like standards because they’re limiting, although Edwards feels that standards are not restrictive based on his experience. “Another point to make is that testing security products is really hard,” he adds, because of how many types of solutions there are to solve a single problem and how many ways products can be configured and deployed.

Mature vendor evaluation is aligned with business needs

A mature evaluation process begins with business-to-product alignment. For example, Edwards says, antivirus requirements for banking ATM endpoints are more focused on compliance, whereas antivirus on an employee’s laptop must comprehensively protect against continuous and evolving threats such as phishing and “dodgy downloads” coming from almost anywhere on the internet. These must be clearly spelled out in the requirements stage of an evaluation.

This level of analysis also helps form the questions to determine vendor types, which in turn can reveal how well the vendor serves the needs of the business, says Adrian Sanabria, a well-known product tester and director of product management at supply chain risk management vendor Tenchi Security. “Will the solution solve the actual problems you’ve identified? In doing so, will it reduce the load on the security team, or will it require new skills and produce more work for them?”

At a high level, Sanabria sets evaluation requirements and resulting performance indicators around least expensive effort, interoperability, and integration and overhead, with success metrics such as time-to-value, labor ratio, true cost of product, and reliability.

Align vendor evaluation with the standards that do exist

Although there are no standardized methodologies and processes for evaluating cybersecurity vendors, mature programs utilize industry-recognized standards and frameworks to set requirements and conduct tests against them. But these frameworks are not uniformly prescriptive. For example, SE Labs follows the AMTSO Testing Protocol standard for anti-malware solutions and uses what Edwards calls full-attack chain testing, which goes beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Choosing a framework early is important to align the business and technical goals, adds Manrod. “The process doesn’t start at selecting a vendor. It begins with a strategy anchored to something like the MITRE ATT&CK framework,” he says. “If you’re trying to prevent attacks on email, identities, or websites, then map the need across your exact environment. That leads to your product category. Your functional requirements are defined by your framework of attack and defense, and then aligned to the exact job the product will do.”

Mature organizations base evaluations on frameworks suited to their businesses, including NIST CSF, ISO, SOC 2, and others. Deloitte, for example, is often asked to collect SOC 2 and ISO attestations for critical security partners that their clients are considering. These requests usually come from risk-averse clients in industries such as energy and finance and many of those are international, says Sharon Chand, secure supply chain leader for Deloitte’s cyber risk group.

Frameworks approach different security domains, such as protect, detect, identify, respond/recover, she continues. So, mapping evaluations to these domains will help the organization focus on what type of outcomes are needed from those security services. For example, she adds: “Am I buying a firewall or zero trust product? Or am I buying an outcome around increased security of my protected control environment?”

Evaluate the cybersecurity vendor, not just the product

Mature programs also have the means to assess vendor stability. If the provider is based in a political hotspot, there could be service interruptions, says Richard Steinnon, who researched 2,800 security vendors for Security Yearbook 2022. A vendor should also show growth, so he advises buyers to look up investor reports, follow the founder or CEO’s leadership background, and check with peers.

Vendor attestation is a part of a mature evaluation process. But if it is the only evaluation process in place, then accepting the vendor’s word for it without review and testing is an indicator of an immature evaluation process, experts say.

Ian Poynter, an established CISO who conducts numerous cybersecurity product evaluations for corporate clients, says that attestation boils down to questions and response. “With a recent client, we started with a list of thirty vendors in the space. We narrowed it down to three, then sent a long list of questions to those vendors, which they answered during our demo.”

The way the vendors respond to the questions is also telling about the vendor, he says. For example, if the vendor doesn’t answer half of them, it indicates that either the product doesn’t meet the standards or the vendor won’t be responsive as a service provider. If this happens with a lot of vendors, however, it could indicate that the buyer’s perceptions are out of alignment with what the products in that space are capable of, Poynter adds.

Test efficacy and security of the vendor

Mature programs have processes in place to test the efficacy of products, according to Sanabria. The depth of the evaluation program depends on criticality of the security service being acquired. For example, if a product is truly critical, testing would go beyond functional requirements to include red team testing against the service itself.

Mature organizations have these skills in-house or have easy access to these testing skills through outside third parties, Manrod suggests. The key to a mature test process, he adds, is to “Test under your terms with your actual use cases to prove whether or not the product properly fulfills your strategy. The test is worth the cost. If your EDR is a big spend, how much more is it to use in-house skills or hire a consultant for a day to make sure your spend is appropriate?”",Build a mature approach for better cybersecurity vendor evaluation,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3679431/build-a-mature-approach-for-better-cybersecurity-vendor-evaluation.html

The identified trends provide organizations with the operational intelligence needed to fortify their security technology and the strategies required to observe and protect mission-critical business systems against cyber threats. This report is produced by Elastic Security Labs, the company’s threat research, malware analysis, and detection engineering team, and compiled using telemetry from worldwide deployments of Elastic Security from August 2021 to August 2022.

Key trends covered in the report include:

Human error poses the greatest risk to cloud security as users overestimate the security of their cloud deployments

Nearly 1 in 3 (33%) attacks in the cloud leverage credential access, indicating that users often overestimate the security of their cloud environments and consequently fail to configure and protect them adequately.

Additional key cloud security findings:

Nearly 57% of cloud security telemetry came from AWS, followed by 22% for Google Cloud and 21% for Azure. AWS : More than 74% of alerts related to credential access, initial access, and persistence tactics, with nearly 57% of techniques related to attempted application access token theft—one of the most common forms of credential theft in the cloud. Google Cloud : Nearly 54% of alerts related to service account abuses, with 52% of techniques leveraging account manipulation and indicating that service account compromise remains rampant when default account credentials aren’t changed. Microsoft Azure : More than 96% of alerts related to authentication events, with 57% of authentication events attempting to retrieve OAUTH2 tokens.

58% of initial access attempts used a combination of traditional brute-force attempts and previously-compromised password spraying.

Commercial software designed to help security teams is being used by threat actors to evade those same teams

While commercial adversary simulation software such as CobaltStrike is helpful to many teams’ defense of their environments, it is also being used as a malicious tool for mass-malware implants. Elastic Security Labs found that CobaltStrike was the most widespread malicious binary or payload for Windows endpoints accounting for nearly 35% of all detections, followed by AgentTesla at 25% and RedLineStealer at 10%.

Additional key malware findings:

More than 54% of all global malware infections were detected on Windows endpoints, while more than 39% were on Linux endpoints.

Nearly 81% of malware observed globally are trojan-based, followed by cryptominers at 11%.

MacKeeper ranked as the highest threat for macOS at nearly 48% of all detections, with XCSSet in the second-place position at nearly 17%.

Endpoint attacks are becoming more diverse in efforts to bypass defenses

More than 50 endpoint infiltration techniques are being utilized by threat actors, suggesting that endpoint security is working well, as its sophistication requires threat actors to continually find new or novel methods of attack to be successful.

Three MITRE ATT&CK® tactics represented 66% of all endpoint infiltration techniques:

A combined 74% of all defense evasion techniques consisted of masquerading (44%) and system binary proxy execution (30%). This indicates that in addition to bypassing security instrumentation, defense evasion techniques also bypass visibility, resulting in longer dwell times for threats.

techniques consisted of masquerading (44%) and system binary proxy execution (30%). This indicates that in addition to bypassing security instrumentation, defense evasion techniques also bypass visibility, resulting in longer dwell times for threats. 59% of execution techniques related to command and native scripting interpreters, followed by 40% attributed to Windows Management Instrumentation abuses, indicating that adversaries abuse PowerShell, Windows Script Host, and Windows shortcut files to execute commands, scripts, or binaries.

techniques related to command and native scripting interpreters, followed by 40% attributed to Windows Management Instrumentation abuses, indicating that adversaries abuse PowerShell, Windows Script Host, and Windows shortcut files to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. Nearly 77% of all credential access techniques are attributed to OS credential dumping with commonly known utilities. This follows the trend of adversaries relying on valid accounts to draw less suspicion of administrators in hybrid-based deployment environments between on-premise hosting and Cloud Service Providers.

While credential access techniques have long been a priority for attackers, adversary investment in defense evasion techniques indicates a reaction to improvements in security technologies that have been impacting their success. When combined with execution techniques, attackers are able to bypass advanced endpoint controls while remaining undetected within organizations’ environments.

Compared to other industries surveyed, financial institutions are much more concerned about users who have legitimate access to their cloud infrastructure. Indeed, 44 percent of respondents in this sector say their own IT staff poses the biggest risk to data security in the cloud and 47 percent worry about contractors and partners, compared to 30 percent and 36 percent respectively in other verticals surveyed.

“Financial organisations experience accidental data leakage more often than companies in other verticals: 32 percent of them reported this type of security incident within the last 12 months, compared to the average of 25 percent. This is a good reason for them to be concerned about users who might unintentionally expose sensitive information. To address this threat, organisations need to implement a zero-standing privilege approach in which elevated access rights are granted only when they are needed and only for as long as needed,” comments Dirk Schrader, VP of security research at Netwrix. “Cloud misconfigurations are another common reason for accidental data leakage. Therefore, security teams must continually monitor the integrity of their cloud configurations, ideally with a dedicated solution that automates the process.”

All sectors say phishing is the most common type of attack they experience. However, 91 percent of financial institutions say they can spot phishing within minutes or hours, compared to 82 percent of respondents in other verticals.

“Even though financial organisations detect phishing quickly, it is still crucial for them to keep educating their personnel on this threat because attacks are becoming more sophisticated,” adds Schrader. “To increase the likelihood of a user clicking a malicious link, attackers are crafting custom spear phishing messages that are directed at the person responsible for a certain task in the organisation and that appear to come from an authority figure. Regular staff training, along with continuous activity monitoring, will help reduce the risk of infiltration”.

The restrictions will make it increasingly difficult for Chinese companies to obtain or manufacture advanced semiconductors and integrated circuits, which are critical for the development of artificial intelligence. The new rules also bar U.S. individuals and companies from providing direct or indirect support for the development or production of such chips in China and will make it harder for Chinese companies to develop supercomputers with potential military applications.

Taken together, these new restrictions impose an effective embargo against China in these technology sectors. In imposing the restrictions, the U.S. government explained that it developed this sweeping set of new regulations to curtail China’s use of these items in the development of weapons of mass destruction, artificial intelligence and supercomputing-enhanced war fighting, and in technologies that enable violations of human rights.

These new changes have already proven to be disruptive. U.S. suppliers have already reportedly cut ties to Chinese chipmakers, and there are reports of “mass resignations” of U.S. employees in China’s semiconductor industry.

Hear from our experienced export controls attorneys in the U.S. and Hong Kong about these new restrictions and their potential impact. We discuss:

This development in the context of a series of efforts by both the U.S. and China to “decouple” in the technology sector

How these new restrictions are affecting Chinese companies as well as U.S. companies with operations in China

A Purdue University student charged with murder in the stabbing death of his dormitory roommate has filed notice in court that he plans to use an insanity defense.

In a motion electronically filed Friday, Ji Min Sha’s attorney, Kyle Cray, requested the court to appoint “two or three competent and disinterested psychiatrists, psychologists or physicians who have expertise in determining competency to examine the Defendant and report to this Court on his competence to stand trial.”

The motion also sought to schedule a competency hearing for Sha, the Journal and Courier reported.

Sha, a 22-year-old cybersecurity major from Seoul, South Korea, faces one count of murder in the slaying of Varun Manish Chheda, 20, of Indianapolis. The two lived in McCutcheon Hall on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) northwest of Indianapolis.

Prosecutors allege that Sha stabbed Chheda, a data science major, several times in the head and neck with a folding knife that officers found on the floor near the chair where Chheda's body was discovered.

Purdue Police Chief Lesley Wiete has said Sha called police early on Oct. 5 and told them his roommate was dead in their dorm room. Officers who arrested Sha found him wearing clothes with blood on them, prosecutors have said. An autopsy found that Chheda had died of “multiple sharp-force traumatic injuries.”

A cybersecurity researcher's claim on vulnerability affecting Google Pixel phones might cause concern among Android phone users.



David Schutz, the cybersecurity expert, has claimed that the vulnerability can allow anyone to bypass the screen lock feature and unlock the smartphone. According Schutz, all the miscreant needs is a SIM card and the access to the device to unlock it, Livemint reported.

I found a vulnerability that allowed me to unlock any @Google Pixel phone without knowing the passcode. This may be my most impactful bug so far.



Google fixed the issue in the November 5, 2022 security patch. Update your devices!https://t.co/LUwSvEMF3w — David Schütz (@xdavidhu) November 10, 2022

“I found a vulnerability that allowed me to unlock any @Google Pixel phone without knowing the passcode. This may be my most impactful bug so far. Google fixed the issue in the November 5, 2022 security patch. Update your devices!"" Schutz tweeted.



The cyber security expert also demonstrated how he managed to unlock the Pixel phone. He claimed to have forgotten his SIM PIN and entered three incorrect codes. After the SIM card locked itself, Schutz says he entered the PUK code available on the SIM card to unlock it. The cyber expert says he ended up on the home screen of his phone.



Calling the experience weird, David Schutz said he repeated the process and the result was same.

“As I did before, I entered the PUK code and choose a new PIN. This time the phone glitched, and I was on my personal home screen. What? It was locked before, right? This was disturbingly weird.

After 15 years on the front line protecting people's online privacy, this VPN service has been showing some serious commitment to improve itself lately.

A few months back, PureVPN's major revamp equipped users with improved connection speeds and security features. These included manual configuration support for its secure WireGuard protocol, as well as a proxy access extended to all its apps.

It wasn't long after that when the provider joined forces with Samsung to build a safer online world. The plan is to integrate Enhanced Privacy Protection (EPP) technology into Samsung's Secure Wi-Fi feature, setting up the next level of mobile data security.

As its latest move, PureVPN has now revealed a massive rebrand of its software. From its classic green lock and keyhole logo to shining purple layers, it intends to symbolize the extra layers of protection its VPN provides.

It's not just a new logo and interface, though. In an effort to cope with an ever-changing online world, PureVPN has enlarged its product offering, now including a secure password manager, identity theft protection tool and a file encryption software.

Introducing an all new PureVPN with advanced tools to complement our flagship VPN product, as a cybersecurity ecosystem to provide you with a safe and private connected experience, virtually & beyond.Learn more: https://t.co/VhjU9nncX5#BeYouOnline #PrivateByConsent pic.twitter.com/aCLgELOD8nNovember 4, 2022 See more

PureVPN's new identity, visual and beyond

""We’re evolving from our iconic lock and keyhole logo to one that isn’t about what we do or what we produce, it’s about what we provide and what we support: authenticity and freedom,"" a PureVPN spokesperson told TechRadar.

Different shades of purple circle around a central white space, the latter representing a safe and personal space. At the same time, the translucent layers symbolize what PureVPN tools offer: protection, transparency, empowerment. Its true meaning is perhaps not quite as easy to parse as PureVPN might like, but it's a thoroughly noble cause.

However, the real big news lies in its extended range of new privacy tools.

""Not only have we redone the user interface from scratch, but also added new features that are sure to make your life easier,"" said the provider.

PureKeep is its own password manager software. The tool also helps users to safely store all their login details, while generating stronger passwords across 10 different devices at the same time.

From carefully making sense of lengthy privacy policies to going over the permissions granted to all your apps, staying on top of your digital hygiene can be really time consuming.

PurePrivacy is the provider's response to this issue, aiming to assist users in taking back control of their privacy settings online. It can help to customize the data you share on your social media, for example. Or, to halt invasive ads from tracking you online. This should minimize the risk of some cyberattacks like identity theft.

Finally, PureEncrypt is a tool for shielding any type of files with a layer of end-to-end encryption, password-protected vaults and/or other security checks like face ID and fingerprint. Users can encrypt all their sensitive files in a couple of clicks, to then store them on their chosen cloud storage platform.

For a small additional fee, users can add just one or more tools to their VPN subscription.

Is PureVPN any good?

PureVPN has been in the game a long time now, gaining a reputation as a reliable and affordable provider.

With more than 6,500 high-speed servers across 78 countries, it allows 10 simultaneous connections with just one subscription. That makes it ideal if you want a service that can cover all of your family's devices.

Great news if you're after a good streaming VPN, too. While we struggled to access some platforms in the past, we managed to unblock everything we tried this time around. These include Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus and BBC iPlayer.

PureVPN is also known as a private VPN service with strict no-log policies. The provider even backed up its no-log claim with an independent audit recently. However, in our review process, we did find some app issues and inconsistencies that many rivals don't suffer from – but despite this PureVPN remains a solid mid-pack choice.

It is worth mentioning that PureVPN isn't the first provider to have extended its product offering. Quite the opposite actually, VPN firms are adapting as users are now facing multifaceted risks when online.

Among our favorites, ExpressVPN has its own password manager too (ExpressVPN Keys) that comes free of charge. NordVPN's Threat Manager and ProtonVPN's NetShield features aim to block malware, web trackers and intrusive ads at no extra cost. One of the best cheap VPNs around, Surfshark, now even comes with a complete security suite Surfshark One including its VPN, private search engine, data leak detection system, and antivirus software.",PureVPN's rebrand goes way beyond a new logo,https://www.techradar.com/news/purevpns-rebrand-goes-way-beyond-a-new-logo

181,Organisations often combat threats by placing too much emphasis on technology alone and too little emphasis on people and their behaviour.,cybersecurity,15/11/2022,https://securitybrief.com.au/uploads/story/2022/11/16/compatible_GettyImages-1016968886.jpg,securitybrief.com.au,"Increased digital engagement, widespread remote working, and greater use of IoT (internet of things) are expanding attack surfaces and exposing many cybersecurity postures as inadequate. Organisations often combat threats by placing too much emphasis on technology alone and too little emphasis on people and their behaviour. A sole focus on technology is not the solution to this complex problem. People are an organisation’s biggest single vulnerability, so any cybersecurity posture needs to be people-centric.

As part of my role at Proofpoint, I speak to many different CISOs within the private and public sector across our region each week. Some are very advanced in their cyber posture and maturity and know they can’t rest on their laurels. However, CISOs in many other organisations have much work to do to drive the required cyber uplift. So, where do they start?

No doubt, organisations have invested heavily in cybersecurity controls. But these investments are commonly focused only on preventing breaches, have limited access controls, and are often designed based on an assumption that sensitive data is accessed from office locations – not work-from-home/work-from-anywhere or other remote sites, as is more often the case.

Crucially, many companies cannot detect breaches quickly, and this, coupled with a constrained ability to speedily recover from an incident, places organisations in a perilous position. No wonder that the impact caused by such breaches is so high. This can leave organisations with operations down, legislative breaches, financial loss and brand damage.

Organisations can address these challenges by gradually developing a cybersecurity posture which assumes that breaches will occur and ensures that organisations can recover quickly and with minimal impact.

Essential Eight provides checklists but additional frameworks are needed

There are multiple frameworks that can be used to ensure that cybersecurity postures are able to adapt and morph in response to changing threat and regulatory environments, while remaining aligned with accepted levels of risk. Within Australia, the ‘Essential Eight’ is one such framework.

The Essential Eight is an Australian cybersecurity framework developed by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). Considering the rapid digitalisation leading to expanded attack surfaces, the Australian government aims to significantly improve the cyber resilience of Australian organisations. The government mandates the use of the framework for federal government entities. The government also hopes that the private sector will widely adopt it.

The framework covers a series of technical controls relating to eight key areas, namely: application control; application patching; Microsoft Office macro settings; application hardening; restriction of administrative privileges; operating system patching; multi factor authentication; and regular backups. Organisations can measure their maturity levels against each of these eight areas and line up their desired maturity level with their risk management goals.

The framework offers significant benefits in that it provides clear technical goals, a range of mitigations that can align with desired cybersecurity postures and allows quick compliance checks. Importantly, many of the recommended controls permit policies and processes to be implemented by changing settings and configurations rather than making sizeable investments in new technologies.

Organisations that want a simple checklist approach to cybersecurity and have skills to implement recommended controls, can use the ‘Essential Eight’ to identify major gaps in their cybersecurity posture and make changes aligned with their risk tolerance. But merely following a checklist is not necessarily the key to building a well-protected organisation.

Essential Eight framework is not a ‘silver bullet’

Although the ‘Essential Eight’ is a useful framework, it is not a ”silver bullet,” and ideally needs to be used in conjunction with other frameworks and guidelines such as NIST and MITRE ATT&CK. It does have a strong focus on prevention, which of course is especially important. But many recent attacks have shown that organisations need to change their posture to one that assumes breaches will occur and emphasises people-centred controls.

It is impossible to always prevent attacks linked to zero-day vulnerabilities such as Log4j and advanced persistent threats like nation state attacks. For this reason, organisations need to incorporate controls that can minimise the damage caused by breaches. These controls include but are not limited to micro-segmentation that restricts lateral movement, rapid detection of breaches and a proportionate automated response, and greater focus on security awareness and behaviours.

In Australia, there has been a series of high profile, large, data leaks involving sensitive customer data. These leaks are expected to lead to increased penalties for failure to adequately protect data. Now is the time for Australian organisations to step back, assess their risks and risk tolerance, evaluate their current controls, identify the gaps, and put people and processes in place to implement an adaptable posture – aligned with acceptable risk levels in new, more distributed technology environments

Cybersecurity technology investments should come after determining a desired set of policies and processes. The role of technology is to implement these policies and processes. Too often, companies buy technology reactively, after they encounter a threat and fail to pay appropriate attention to people and policies. Understanding attitudes and behaviours, identifying and focusing on people who pose the biggest risk, is fundamental to any cybersecurity posture. To be most effective, companies must pivot their thinking and strategies, putting people at the centre.

Australia faces a chronic skills crisis in most industries. This crisis is worsening in the cybersecurity business. Accessing needed cybersecurity skills is becoming almost impossible for some. This accelerates the need for non-technical staff to play a bigger role in cybersecurity and for much greater and better automation.

The Essential Eight framework is useful as a technical checklist, but checklists are not always focused on the risks at hand. It should be used in conjunction with other frameworks and guidelines while placing greater emphasis on making people more security-conscious and aware of the risks they and their organisations face. When combined with such a people-centric approach to cybersecurity, Essential Eight can serve as a valuable weapon in the defender’s arsenal.",Building on the ‘Essential Eight’ with a people-centric approach to cybersecurity - SecurityBrief Australia,https://securitybrief.com.au/story/building-on-the-essential-eight-with-a-people-centric-approach-to-cybersecurity

The report noted that the education sector's cyber maturity lags behind other sectors due to limited internal resources for defense against threat actors, with nearly a fifth of K-12 schools spending less than 1% of their IT budget on cybersecurity. It also found that K-12 schools lack cybersecurity strategies, with 81% not fully implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and 29% not using MFA at all.

""Many K-12 school districts are data-rich and resource-poor, making them attractive targets for financially motivated cyber threat actors, and relatively easy targets for hacktivists, those who break into a computer system for politically- or socially-motivated purposes, determined to grow their reputations and name recognition,"" the report read.

While the study found 83% of schools have cyber insurance, Karen Sorady, vice president for member engagement at the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), said that more can be done.

“Cyber liability insurance is one tool that can help schools recover in the event of a cyberattack. However, it is not always affordable, particularly for smaller schools, and it will not stop an attack from happening. Therefore, it is also as important for schools to adopt cybersecurity basics, such as CIS Controls, to prevent successful attacks,” Sorady told SC Media.

The report comes two weeks after the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) hosted a national summit on K-12 school safety and security to address the complex threats facing the education sector.

Jen Easterly, director of CISA, said during the event that ransomware is one of the most impactful and persistent threats targeting the K-12 schools and districts, which aligned with the CIS report. In response to increasingly frequent ransomware attacks, CISA recently launched an information channel to share ransomware-related resources.

Besides ransomware threats, the report found that Shalyer and CoinMiner were two top malicious malware targeting K-12 entities over the past year. Shayler targets Apple macOS devices, functioning as a dropper for other macOS malware whose purpose is to spam victims with online ads, while CoinMiner, applies Windows Management Instrumentation to mine for coins.

According to Easterly, those threat actors are not ""discriminatory"" and target schools regardless of their locations and sizes.

""Impacts have ranged from restricted access to the network, delayed exams, canceled school days, to unauthorized access to personal information regarding students and staff,"" Easterly said. ""[Those attacks] start at the core of the school's financial security ability to provide a safe, secure, and protected place for staff and students, and the ability to carry out the fundamental educational mission.""

CISA has worked with the Department of Homeland Security to provide guidance and tools related to school safety and security.

The CIS report recommends that K-12 schools claim no-cost membership and join MS-ISAC to connect with peer organizations and collaborate with security professionals.",K-12 Schools Remaining Top Target For Cyberattacks,https://www.scmagazine.com/analysis/ransomware/k-12-schools-lack-resources-remaining-top-target-for-cyberattacks

These new offerings allow Authenta technology to be more easily integrated into a growing array of industry-standard servers, automotive, industrial IoT and consumer systems, such as wireless routers and smart home appliances.

Through its silicon root of trust, Authenta provides a unique level of protection for the lowest layers of IoT software. Starting with the boot process, Authenta uses strong cryptographic identity and secure element features directly embedded in the flash memory.

Micron’s newly announced Authenta Cloud Platform incorporates the capabilities of its existing Authenta Key Management Service and adds new billing and ordering functionality to streamline essential operations required by edge services via cloud-based infrastructure. Authenta Cloud Platform’s new end-to-end capabilities allow Micron’s customers to scale and pay for these cybersecurity services in one streamlined cloud platform, in addition to providing them with the ability to pass down these simplified onboarding and automated billing capabilities to end customers. These robust platform capabilities allow real-time, in-field device authentication across customers’ supply chains and throughout the device lifecycle, building trust and offering an open, scalable foundation to power end-to-end cloud services across the IoT ecosystem.

Authenta ecosystem adoption illustrates expanding market opportunities for IoT security

As Micron’s Authenta gains more traction in the market, new customers such as SanCloud are integrating Authenta flash in its BeagleBone® Enhanced Single Board Computer systems to deliver device management and secure data analytics for applications such as connected lighting, automotive gateways and preventative machine maintenance. SanCloud’s BeagleBone Enhanced systems are highly capable embedded devices with a blend of on-board sensors, wireless connectivity, I/O and processing power used by a varied range of industrial customers. SanCloud’s SanTrack IoT cloud solution uses the Authenta Cloud Platform to activate, gain control and configure the security functions of the Authenta flash and ensures the trust and security of these embedded devices from the manufacturing stage to secure onboarding to deployment.

The addition of Micron Authenta to SanCloud’s devices opens up a range of powerful security features for SanCloud customers including secure boot, golden image locking, memory block allocation, secure over-the-air updates and device integrity monitoring.

Swissbit, a leading European security and memory solution provider for IoT applications, and Micron are also now collaborating to embed Authenta technology in Swissbit’s security and storage solutions for IoT and industrial markets — bringing Micron’s unique silicon root-of-trust security features to Swissbit’s broad base of customers across areas such as industrial automation, automotive, IoT, medical, networking and communication. The first Swissbit storage product with integrated Authenta technology will be a microSD card, ideal for retrofitting IoT systems. An embedded product, eMMC, will follow later.

The integration of Authenta’s secure element features in Swissbit’s flash storage modules gives Swissbit customers the ability to use the Authenta Cloud Platform for its simplified silicon-to-cloud onboarding and authentication capabilities.

184,He was a billionaire who had quickly amassed political and philanthropic influence. What happened?,cybersecurity,15/11/2022,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxlPHA8nCyUmVmziZfUsj8uW4Wc=/0x0:4200x2199/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24196747/GettyImages_1242563523.jpg,vox,"A week ago, Sam Bankman-Fried was the boy-wonder face of crypto: A 30-year-old who founded one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, a celebrated philanthropist worth an estimated $16 billion, and a major Democratic donor who quickly found favor in Washington. By Friday, he was at the center of an epic flameout that left his empire and his image as an uncannily sharp, altruistic billionaire in ruins.

In the annals of crypto disasters, the tale of Bankman-Fried may go down as one of the most jaw-dropping. He resigned from his crypto exchange, FTX, as it collapsed from a domino effect of a surge in customers trying to withdraw their funds, and the company filed for bankruptcy. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Bankman-Fried may have illegally taken about $10 billion in FTX customers’ funds for his trading firm, Alameda Research, whose future is also in peril. And Bankman-Fried is now worth close to nothing.

The downfall of FTX isn’t a typical story of crypto’s volatility or investor risk-taking; it didn’t crumble due to bad luck, but what now appears to be unsustainable layers of deception. On the surface, FTX appeared to be thriving — in the past year, it made several high-profile acquisitions and bailed out other failing crypto companies. In reality, it was drowning in debt. At least $1 billion in customer funds is reportedly missing. The stunning contrast between image and reality has resulted in Bankman-Fried facing a reputational fall from grace swifter than any in recent memory. According to reporting from several news outlets, the DOJ and SEC are investigating FTX, and his friends and admirers in crypto, philanthropic, and political circles have quickly begun distancing themselves from the man widely dubbed the king of crypto.

A senior Democratic strategist who wished to maintain anonymity to protect their clients told Vox that politicians who’ve received donations from Bankman-Fried, who spent around $40 million during the midterm election cycle, are considering returning that money.

On November 10, Bankman-Fried publicly apologized. “I fucked up, and should have done better,” he wrote on Twitter. “I also should have been communicating more very recently.” He pointed to “a poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts” as one reason why FTX didn’t have the liquidity to return money to clients.

In the last year, Bankman-Fried had soared to buzzy prominence as a paragon of how the ultra-rich, who have seemingly endless wealth, might use it for good. He’s been the subject of countless profiles; he was on the cover of Fortune’s September issue. The media portrayed him as an unassuming, nerdy savant, frequently noting his down-to-earthness, his messy mop of hair, his penchant for wearing T-shirts and shorts, his Toyota Corolla. Investors were enamored of the fact that he wasn’t a buttoned-up entrepreneur; he played computer games during pitch meetings, and like other modern-day founders, his eccentricities were taken as proof of his distinct genius.

Bankman-Fried, meanwhile, came off as a billionaire refreshingly unimpressed by the glitz and pomp of a typical billionaire’s lifestyle. The FTX Foundation, Bankman-Fried’s philanthropic arm, says it has donated over $190 million to date. (Disclosure: This August, Bankman-Fried’s philanthropic family foundation, Building a Stronger Future, awarded Vox’s Future Perfect a grant for a 2023 reporting project. That project is now on pause.)

“It’s hard to spend more than millions a year in an effective way on yourself, even if you wanted to,” he told Yahoo Finance earlier this year. “And I think that’s why we see superyachts — because a lot of people literally can’t figure out anything else to do with their money.”

But Bankman-Fried seemingly had figured it out. That he had articulated a data- and evidence-based plan for how to give away his wealth is, in part, what makes his downfall so stunning. Who is Bankman-Fried if not a political megadonor? Who is he if not a philanthropist and not a billionaire? Who was he all along?

How he earned his money and how he spent it

Bankman-Fried went to Wall Street because he wanted to make as much money as possible. That’s not especially notable. What set him apart was how effectively and quickly he turned those intentions into a reality. The son of two Stanford professors, he majored in physics at MIT, but then, influenced by effective altruism leader and Oxford philosopher Will MacAskill, decided to work for a trading firm where he could earn a lot more money, a lot quicker — ostensibly with the aim of ultimately giving it away almost as quickly.

The effective altruism movement attempts to use evidence and reason to determine the best ways of doing good in the world. When it comes to charitable giving, effective altruists often focus on causes that they view as important, tractable, and neglected — areas where a little bit of funding could have an outsize impact.

Some effective altruists also believe in “earning to give” — entering a lucrative field over a poorly paying one so that more money can be given away. “If what you’re trying to do is donate, you should make as much as you can and give as much as you can,” Bankman-Fried told Recode in an interview last year. In other words, the ends justify the means. If the math shows that it’s magnitudes better to be an investment banker than work at a nonprofit, that’s what you ought to do. In recent days, prominent voices in the effective altruism world, including MacAskill and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who is a major funder of the EA-aligned nonprofit Open Philanthropy, have both disavowed that sort of utilitarian calculus.

Bankman-Fried started his career on Wall Street in 2013, when he was 21. He made his riches through cryptocurrency arbitrage — buying coins for a lower price on one crypto exchange, then quickly selling them for a higher price on a different exchange. He convinced a few fellow effective altruist friends to help in this arbitrage model and founded his trading firm, Alameda Research. By 2019, it was turning enough profit that Bankman-Fried launched his own crypto exchange, FTX. Part of FTX’s draw for investors was that it allowed riskier trades than other exchanges; it allowed people to make highly leveraged bets — at least until 2021, when it reduced the amount of leverage it offered clients. Bankman-Fried was quickly branded as a brilliant disruptor in crypto. That year, at the age of 29, he was worth $22.5 billion.

2022 was an incredibly turbulent year for crypto, yet Bankman-Fried not only seemed to remain unscathed, he seemed poised to keep the industry from falling apart. Bankman-Fried positioned himself as a beacon for other companies. He gave crypto lender BlockFi a $250 million line of credit; he bailed out bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital. He also launched his venture fund FTX Ventures this year, which manages about $2 billion in assets. It looked like Bankman-Fried was going to come out of the crypto winter stronger than his competitors, mostly by turning someone else’s loss into his opportunity.

Bankman-Fried appeared to be settling comfortably onto the throne of influence. In June he signed the Giving Pledge, joining the ranks of other billionaire mega-philanthropists like Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and MacKenzie Scott in a commitment to give away at least 50 percent of his wealth. “A while ago I became convinced that our duty was to do the most we could for the long run aggregate utility of the world,” Bankman-Fried wrote in his pledge letter. In some ways, signing this pledge was repeating himself — he had already promised to give away 99 percent of his fortune. In February 2021, he founded the FTX Foundation, which supported causes such as improving animal welfare and fighting global poverty, and funded research and projects that would improve “humanity’s long-term prospects” through the foundation’s Future Fund. On November 10, in light of FTX’s collapse, all the members of the Future Fund resigned.

At just 30 years old, he was making waves in the political world, too. Bankman-Fried was one of the biggest individual donors to Joe Biden in 2020, and the sixth largest individual donor overall for the 2022 midterm cycle, contributing almost $40 million to various candidates and PACs, including a $1 million donation to Beto O’Rourke’s failed campaign for Texas governor. One of Bankman-Fried’s top aims was getting more political investment in pandemic preparedness — he spent millions backing the congressional run of effective altruist Carrick Flynn, whose platform prioritized pandemic prevention; Flynn lost his primary race.

In short, Bankman-Fried had been building a bona fide political machine, hiring staff to advise him on his various interests, which included crypto regulation. He was something of a media patron too, investing in new news site Semafor and awarding grants to other publications.

He was the key liaison for Congress and the White House on the matter of crypto regulation, even testifying in front of Congress this year. He told the Los Angeles Times in August that he was “spending a lot of time talking with members about what constructive things would be on crypto policies and about what can be done to provide federal oversight of it.” Critics and skeptics argued that Bankman-Fried’s presence in Congress was more about ensuring crypto would fall under the oversight of the CTFC rather than the SEC, because the CTFC is seen as the less powerful of the two.

Bankman-Fried appeared ready to spend even larger sums of money in Washington and in media. Earlier this year, he floated the idea of spending up to $1 billion on politics in 2024 if it meant blocking Trump. He also texted Elon Musk this spring, signaling his interest in spending billions to join in on the Twitter acquisition deal.

In hindsight, there may have been signs of trouble. Weeks before the midterms, Bankman-Fried suddenly walked back his intent to spend quite so much on politics in the coming years, calling the $1 billion figure a “dumb quote” on his part. He didn’t spend much in the lead-up to the midterm election, saying, “I think primaries are more important.” At the same time, Democrats were warning that a lack of funding in the last weeks of the election cycle could jeopardize their chance of securing a House majority.

What the fall of a crypto billionaire says about scrutiny of the ultra-rich

It’s not every day that a billionaire suddenly loses everything — that dishonor belongs to a small and ignominious circle including the likes of Elizabeth Holmes, Bernie Madoff, and Archegos founder and investor Bill Hwang — and it’s rarer still for a renowned philanthropist and political megadonor’s wealth to topple like a house of cards.

Given just how wide-ranging Bankman-Fried’s influence is, his downfall has caused turmoil in several circles. FTX’s customers were mostly individual traders — some now fear they’ve lost their life savings. FTX’s fall has affected the stability of the broader crypto market, and the price of bitcoin, the world’s most highly-valued digital currency, has plunged. The FTX Future Fund has said it likely wouldn’t be able to honor all the commitments it made to grantees, and Bankman-Fried’s financial ruin could cause further shockwaves in philanthropy: The effective altruism nonprofit Open Philanthropy has already acknowledged that the FTX Foundation’s shuttering would affect its grantmaking strategy. Bankman-Fried had essentially earmarked 99 percent of his wealth for the public good — and now, all of that is lost.

If the allegation that FTX used $10 billion in customers’ funds to help Alameda Research is true, the possibility that Bankman-Fried could face jail is “very realistic,” said John Reed Stark, a former SEC enforcement attorney and expert in cybersecurity law. “If these facts are true, someone came to me as a client and said, ‘Here’s what I did, I robbed my customers to enrich myself,’ that’s very serious. It goes far beyond securities violations.” According to a New York Times interview with Bankman-Fried, federal prosecutors in New York are inquiring into Bankman-Fried’s management of FTX.

Stark compared the magnitude of any potential crime to that of Holmes, who defrauded investors, or financier Madoff, the mastermind behind the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. “I think this is worse because there is a retail investor component to this imbroglio.”

Bankman-Fried and his companies are based in the Bahamas, out of the reach of the US regulatory reach, but “it’s going to be illegal, no matter where you are, to take stuff that’s not yours,” said Stark.

That so many people in different industries are rocked by a single person’s financial ruin illuminates the magnitude of influence billionaires have. It also shows why that influence needs serious, careful examination. How much credence can we give to a sales pitch? Bankman-Fried has defended the crypto industry, and specifically his exchange, against the perception that it was rife with scams or danger. “He says FTX is running an honest market, checks customers’ backgrounds, buys carbon credits to offset its emissions, and is more efficient than the mainstream financial system. But it’s clear the main appeal for him is getting rich quick,” Bloomberg’s Zeke Faux wrote in a profile from April.

Bankman-Fried may not have been forthcoming when concern about FTX started to bubble up. On November 7, before the degree of FTX’s financial disorder was evident, Bankman-Fried tweeted that everything was fine. “Assets are fine,” he wrote. “FTX has enough to cover all client holdings. We don’t invest client assets (even in treasuries),” he wrote in another. But it now appears that wasn’t true. He has since deleted those tweets.

In a Twitter DM interview with Future Perfect reporter Kelsey Piper following the implosion of FTX, Bankman-Fried revealed a cynical view of ethics that seemed to contradict the more nuanced views of right and wrong he’d discussed in the press before.

“[M]an a lot of the dumb shit I said,” he wrote. “[I]t’s not true, not really.”

By his accounting, a person’s virtue is largely perception — as much about whether someone is seen as a winner or a loser as it is about actually acting virtuously. “[E]veryone goes around pretending that perception reflects reality,” he wrote in the candid, at times shocking, exchange. “[I]t doesn’t. [S]ome of this decade’s greatest heroes will never be known, and some of its most beloved people are basically shams.”

read more",cybersecurity,15/11/2022,,securityweek.com,"A Chinese state-sponsored cyberespionage group tracked as Billbug has been observed targeting a certificate authority in Asia, along with other entities, Symantec reports.

Also tracked as Lotus Blossom and Thrip, Billbug is an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor mainly targeting entities in Southeast Asia and the United States. It’s believed to have been active since at least 2009.

Starting March 2022, the group has been targeting multiple entities in Asia, including a certificate authority, a government organization, and defense agencies.

“The targeting of a certificate authority is notable, as if the attackers were able to successfully compromise it to access certificates they could potentially use them to sign malware with a valid certificate, and help it avoid detection on victim machines. It could also potentially use compromised certificates to intercept HTTPS traffic,” Symantec notes.

According to the security company, however, there is no evidence to suggest that the threat actor has managed to successfully compromise digital certificates.

As part of the observed attacks, the APT used multiple public tools and custom malware, including AdFind, Certutil, NBTscan, Ping, Port Scanner, Route, Stowaway Proxy Tool, Tracert, Winmail, and WinRAR, as well as the Hannotog and Sagerunex backdoors identified in 2019.

The Hannotog backdoor, Symantec explains, can update firewall settings, create a service for persistence, stop running services, upload encrypted data, harvest system information, and download files to the machine.

The Sagerunex backdoor, which uses multiple methods of communication with the command and control (C&C) server, supports commands to list running proxies, execute programs, steal files or drop files, and get configured file paths.

“While we do not see data being exfiltrated in this campaign, Billbug is widely regarded as being an espionage actor, indicating that data theft is the most likely motivation in this campaign. The victims in this campaign – government agencies and a certificate authority – also point to an espionage and data-theft motive,” Symantec notes.

The cybersecurity firm also points out that the threat actor likely targeted government victims for espionage purposes, and likely hit the certificate authority to steal legitimate digital certificates.

“This is potentially very dangerous, as if Billbug is able to sign its malware with a valid digital certificate it may be able to bypass security detections on victim machines. The ability of this actor to compromise multiple victims at once indicates that this threat group remains a skilled and well-resourced operator that is capable of carrying out sustained and wide-ranging campaigns,” Symantec concludes.

The Purdue University student who last month was accused of fatally stabbing his former roommate is planning to use an insanity defense amid an ongoing criminal trial. The student's defense team filed a notice to the court asking that medical professionals are appointed to evaluate his psychological state and decide whether he is fit to stand trial.

In a motion electronically filed Friday, Ji Min Sha's attorney, Kyle Cray, requested the court to appoint ""two or three competent and disinterested psychiatrists, psychologists or physicians who have expertise in determining competency to examine the Defendant and report to this Court on his competence to stand trial.""

The motion also sought to schedule a competency hearing for Sha, the Journal and Courier reported.

Varun Manish Chheda Park Tudor High School

Sha, 22, is a junior studying cybersecurity at Purdue and is originally from Seoul, South Korea. He faces one count of murder for his alleged involvement in the killing of Varun Manish Chheda, 20, a senior studying data science who was Sha's dormitory roommate. The two lived in McCutcheon Hall on Purdue's West Lafayette campus, about 65 miles northwest of Indianapolis, where Chheda was from.

Prosecutors allege that Sha stabbed Chheda several times in the head and neck with a folding knife that officers found on the floor near the chair where Chheda's body was discovered. Results of the preliminary autopsy ruled Chheda's cause of death to be ""multiple sharp force traumatic injuries,"" according to the Tippecanoe County Coroner's Office, which conducted the exam. The suspected manner of death was homicide.

Purdue Police Chief Lesley Wiete has said Sha called 911 at around 12:45 a.m on Oct. 5 and was rerouted to local authorities, to whom he reported his roommate's death in their shared bedroom. Officers who arrested Sha found him wearing clothes with blood on them, prosecutors have said, although Wiete noted shortly after the stabbing that early evidence suggested the act was ""unprovoked"" and ""senseless.""

189,An FBI official will be deposed in a lawsuit over alleged collusion between the Biden administration and social-media companies to censor speech on topics...,cybersecurity,15/11/2022,https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_review_738/37c0a43835de7e231d832368772f9aa0,yahoo entertainment,"An FBI official will be deposed in a lawsuit over alleged collusion between the Biden administration and social-media companies to censor speech on topics ranging from Hunter Biden’s laptop to Covid-19, a judge ruled Monday.

The ruling comes in response to a lawsuit by Missouri attorney general Eric Schmitt and Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry accusing the federal government of working “hand-in-hand with social media companies to censor freedom of speech on their platforms.” The lawsuit has grown to include 67 defendants, including top officials at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the White House, and others.

Last month, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana granted the two states’ request for depositions from several top-ranking governmental officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, director of White House digital strategy Rob Flaherty, surgeon general Vivek Murthy, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly, and FBI supervisory special agent Elvis Chan.

Lawyers for the Biden administration sought to block several of the depositions, including Chan’s. The lawyers noted that Meta, Facebook’s parent company, has said that Chan, an assistant special agent in charge (ASAC), did not advise the company to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story.

“Based on this newly received evidence, the Court should amend the Deposition Order, and withdraw its authorization of a deposition of ASAC Chan,” the lawyers argued.

However, the two attorneys general opposed the motion, arguing they never suggested Chan told Facebook to suppress the story but that the special agent participated in talks that led to the suppression.

“Moreover, there are additional compelling reasons to depose Chan—including that he is the principal point of contact between social-media platforms and the FBI Section that combats so-called ‘disinformation’ on social media; that he routinely organizes and participates in oral meetings with social-media platforms about election-related disinformation; and that he has openly boasted about coordinating with social-media platforms to combat misinformation and disinformation,” they said.

U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty rejected the federal government’s motion to block the deposition.

🚨BREAKING: In our lawsuit against the Biden Administration for colluding with social media companies to censor speech, the deposition of an FBI official will move forward after our big win in Court earlier today. pic.twitter.com/G7GrshpUb7 — Eric Schmitt (@Eric_Schmitt) November 14, 2022

“If Chan played no role in the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story, then such information will be made clear in his deposition,” Doughty wrote.

“Chan had authority over cybersecurity issues for the FBI in the San Francisco, California region, which includes the headquarters of major social-media platforms and played a critical role for the FBI in coordinating with social-media platforms related to censorship. Even if Chan played no role in the Hunter Biden laptop communication issue, he may have knowledge of who did, and his deposition is nonetheless warranted,” the judge added.

When the New York Post first reported on some of the contents of the laptops in October 2020, Big Tech platforms including Facebook and Twitter censored the story and dismissed it as potential foreign disinformation. The New York Times has since authenticated key files from the laptop, as has the Washington Post.

Doughty added that plaintiffs established that Chan “has personal knowledge about the issue concerning censorship across social media as it related to COVID-19 and ancillary issues of COVID-19” and that he was “identified as the FBI Agent who communicated with Facebook to suppress a story about the Hunter Biden laptop.”

In the original complaint, Schmitt and Landry claim federal officials participated in a pressure campaign against social-media platforms to “increase censorship of views that diverge from the government’s.”

“CISA Director Jen Easterly, for example, texted with Matthew Masterson about ‘trying to get us in a place where Fed can work with platforms to better understand the mis/dis trends so relevant agencies can try to prebunk/debunk as useful,’ and complained about the Government’s need to overcome the social-media platforms’ ‘hesitation’ to working with the government: ‘Platforms have got to get more comfortable with gov’t. It’s really interesting how hesitant they remain,’” the complaint reads.

The complaint adds that a “veritable army of federal bureaucrats are involved in censorship activities ‘across the federal enterprise,'” adding that CISA Director Easterly and Matthew Masterson “complained in text messages that ‘chaos’ would result if all federal officials were ‘independently’ contacting social-media platforms about so-called misinformation. . . . On information and belief, as alleged above, the ‘Disinformation Governance Board’ was created to impose a bureaucratic structure on the enormous censorship activities already occurring involving dozens of federal officials and many federal agencies.”

Quadrant Knowledge Solution defines Privileged Access Management (PAM) as a solution that minimizes security risks and enables organizations to protect, control, manage, automate, and monitor privileged access and accounts like Local administrative accounts, domain administrative accounts, break glass accounts, service accounts, active directory accounts, and application accounts to avoid security breaches. PAM solution enables organizations to minimize risks that are related to cyberattacks outside of the network perimeter, malicious insider threats, and third-party access.

Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud and hybrid infrastructure to effectively manage and access information or data from devices or locations in less time. With cloud and hybrid infrastructure, organizations were able to minimize the IT cost, increase the ROI, simplify the IT infrastructure, and effectively manage IT resources. However, by adopting cloud and hybrid infrastructure, organizations are now facing challenges like increasing attack surface, cybersecurity vulnerabilities and managing and monitoring privileged data. Additionally, organizations and IT teams are facing issues while coping with identities and resources across cloud and hybrid environments, as cybercriminals are now leveraging advanced technologies to easily access and damage privileged data and user credentials in any organizational IT system. Therefore, organizations have started adopting cloud-native PAM solutions to mitigate and prevent advanced attacks. With the PAM solutions, organizations can provide improve protection and govern security risks, track the movement of data and workloads, protect data sharing between public and private cloud, and manage privileged access across traditional, virtual, and cloud environments.

DOWNERS GROVE, Ill., Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Buoyed by resilience developed during the uncertainty of the past two-plus years, the global technology industry and technology professionals are optimistic about business and employment prospects in 2023, new research from CompTIA, the nonprofit association for the IT industry and workforce, reveals.

CompTIA is the voice of the world's information technology industry. (PRNewsFoto/CompTIA)

""The tech industry remains a robust choice for business growth and career advancement.""

CompTIA's ""IT Industry Outlook 2023"" identifies 10 trends likely to impact technology companies and workers in the new year.

The annual forecast finds that technology companies have generally positive views about 2023. Among firms in six geographic regions, the average rating for tech industry prospects skews toward the top of the measurement scale (excellent) rather than the bottom (terrible).1 Similarly, the turmoil of recent years is not dampening spirits for IT professionals. Nearly 80% are optimistic about their job role, including 38% who feel very optimistic.

""Even with economic uncertainties and societal issues, the tech industry remains a robust choice for business growth and career advancement,"" said Seth Robinson, vice president, industry research, CompTIA. ""To be sure, there are some negative elements, especially as technology applications reach massive scale and trigger unintended consequences. But there are many positive outcomes and countless more opportunities as technology influences every business and industry.""

Trends to watch in 2023

1. Business As Usual Gets a Hard Reality Check.

""Business as usual is no more and doing things as we always have may no longer be the safe option, even for companies that are content with flat or minimal growth,"" said Carolyn April, senior director, industry analysis, CompTIA. ""Many technology businesses will have to leave their comfort zone to thrive. That means thoroughly examining and adjusting their current operations, sales and marketing, human resources and strategic innovation efforts.""

Story continues

The evolution of the customer is why these steps are necessary, according to April.

""Customers are as enthusiastic as ever about the role technology plays in their success, but they're also much more scrutinous and demanding in their tech journey,"" she explained. ""If you sell technology, the ability to convincingly make a specific business case for every product or service is not just a nice sales differentiator anymore, it is essential.""

2. Metaverse Initiatives Will Focus on Holistic Customer Experiences.

""Instead of viewing the metaverse as a new VR-based phase of the internet, it might be more accurate to view it as an extension of omnichannel customer experiences,"" Robinson said. ""As organizations build their own metaverse for their customers, there will be less focus on headsets and virtual real estate and more focus on building depth in customer relationships and creating connections between the many digital experiences a customer might choose.""

3. Worker-employer Relationship Gaps Expose New Challenges in Hiring and Retaining Tech Talent – Employers will be tested to fill positions with workers skilled in new and emerging tech disciplines and support roles, while balancing a newly empowered workforce and macroeconomic uncertainty.

4. Cloud Acceleration Drives Demand for Orchestration and FinOps – Acceleration in cloud computing adoption has led to most organizations taking on a cloud-first approach. The next stage of adoption will focus on handling the complexity of a multi-cloud environment.

5. New Players in Digital Ecosystem Put More Competitive Pressure on Established Practices – Today's era of choice explosion and decision fatigue in the tech marketplace will prod both new and established players to up their game to stand out among the rest.

6. Vendors and Partners Eye Greater Automation With Optimism – and Concern – Tech vendors and their partners will need to work together to find automation comfort zones that are efficient and connected rather than disconnected and cumbersome.

7. Cybersecurity Metrics Are Tied to Evolving Risk Analysis Approach – Risk analysis has grown in popularity as a way for organizations to measure progress in cybersecurity. But most firms are not yet performing analysis in a comprehensive way. That will change, driven heavily by ongoing digital transformation.

8. Inflation Uncertainty and Supply Chain Issues Continue to Complicate Sales Forecasting – A confluence of economic factors has found countries and companies grappling with high inflation rates not seen in decades. In 2023 companies will have a much-diminished ability to forecast sales accurately quarter to quarter.

9. Decentralized Identity Will Become the Heart of Web3 Efforts – The noise around Web3 will continue in 2023, but the key area to focus on is the evolution of digital identity.

10. Advances in AI Spur Debate Over the Future of Tech in Society – Simply understanding how to use a piece of technology is becoming inadequate. Responsible use now entails some knowledge on how the technology functions and what societal impact it might have.

CompTIA surveyed business and IT professionals in September and October for its ""IT Industry Outlook 2023"" – 500 in the U.S. and 125 in each of the international regions. The report is available at https://connect.comptia.org/content/research/it-industry-trends-analysis.

I’m also happy to say that these cameras, and all Axis solutions, can be demoed anytime at one of our Axis Experience Centers across the Americas including our new Manhattan AEC.”

Axis Communications will launch its new network cameras—showcasing several of them along with other industry-leading video, analytics, audio, intercom and end-to-end solutions—at ISC East, Jacob Javits Center, New York City, November 15-17, 2022, including:

AXIS Q6225-LE: Heavy-duty PTZ camera with long-range IR for tough conditions

The AXIS Q6225-LE PTZ Network Camera is a robust PTZ camera ideal for wide and long-distance surveillance. This heavy-duty camera meets the MIL-STD-810G standard, ensuring reliable operation in the toughest conditions.

AXIS Q6225-LE offers HDTV 1080p resolution and a very light-sensitive ½” inch sensor with 31x optical zoom. Featuring, Forensic WDR, Lightfinder, and long-range OptimizedIR, it ensures sharp, clear images in any light conditions. In addition, high-speed pan/tilt performance ensures exceptional coverage of large areas and great detail when zooming in.

This high-performance camera is packed with built-in analytics such as AXIS Motion Guard, AXIS Fence Guard, and AXIS Loitering Guard for detecting motion, intrusion, and loitering. Axis Object Analytics also makes it possible to detect and classify people and vehicles.

AXIS Q6225-LE is available through Axis distribution channels.

AXIS Q1656-DLE: Unique device fuses video and radar to deliver next-level detection and visualization

The AXIS Q1656-DLE Radar-Video Fusion Camera is a unique device that delivers state-of-the-art deep learning-powered object classification based on the fusion of two powerful technologies: video and radar.

To achieve the 2022 ratings, Transmit Security was evaluated against 24 and 22 vendors respectively for product functionality, innovation, market presence and financial position. Transmit Security is just one of four vendors to be named an overall leader in the latest two reports, and the only vendor to achieve such a distinction in all three aforementioned reports.

As noted in the 2022 Leadership Compass: Passwordless Authentication - Transmit Security’s CIAM platform is recognized for its ability to satisfy strong omni-channel and cross-channel use cases simply and seamlessly. Identity orchestration strength is called out as a key strength, allowing companies to configure and build flexible customer journeys, including those that do not require a specialized mobile app for authentication. KuppingerCole states, “The platform has one of the most feature-rich offerings in the passwordless authentication market and would likely be suitable for any type of organization looking to adopt a passwordless solution.”

“Improving the consumer experience is often a goal in deploying or upgrading CIAM solutions,” said KuppingerCole lead analyst John Tolbert. “With the increasing digitization of Business-to-Consumer (B2C) interactions, consumers are asked to create and use more and more accounts and passwords. Managing the escalating numbers of digital accounts can be burdensome for consumers if the CIAM systems with which they are engaging are not optimally designed, implemented, and continuously tuned.”

“We equip businesses with a modern identity platform with best-in-class identity security that makes the user experience better while continually protecting both businesses and customers from today’s risk,” said Niv Goldenberg, Chief Product Officer at Transmit Security. “Our deep experience in identity orchestration, true passwordless and multifactor authentication, real-time account protection and identity proofing are essential keys to our unique approach. We’re pleased to be recognized by a top cybersecurity and identity management analyst firm for these and other capabilities that digital leaders need today.”

Transmit Security serves a diverse array of companies across the globe with its modular, cloud-native CIAM platform, providing FIDO2-based, multi-factor and passkey-based authentication, identity verification, and risk & trust controls, underpinned by omni-channel identity orchestration. These companies include Alight, America’s Car-Mart, Citigroup, Banco Santander, BRED Banque Populaire, Fintecture, Gruppo Cattolica, Prime Healthcare, Rogers Communications, Telecom Italia and many others.

About Transmit Security

Transmit Security gives businesses the modern tools they need to build secure, trusted and end-to-end digital identity journeys to innovate and grow. CX-focused, cybersecurity-conscious leaders rely on Transmit Security’s Customer Identity and Access Management platform to provide their customers with smooth experiences protected from fraud across all channels and devices. Transmit Security serves many of the world’s largest banks, insurers, retailers, and other leading brands, collectively responsible for more than $2 trillion in annual commerce.

Hotspots of business activity and recruitment remain, even as parts of the tech industry cool amid rising inflation and interest rates and the changing post-pandemic landscape, analysts told CNA.

“The days of just hiring left, right and centre, in fear of losing out on talent – that will probably come to a stop for a while,” said Assistant Professor Ng Weiyi of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.

Among those employers likely to become more “fiscally prudent” are fintech start-ups that have been highly reliant on venture capital and private equity for funding, he said.

Competition has also intensified with the increased supply of job seekers after several high-profile layoffs that impacted the Singapore tech sector.

Facebook parent Meta, which terminated more than 11,000 employees worldwide, laid off dozens of employees in Singapore in departments ranging from marketing to engineering. Twitter slashed half its global workforce, or around 3,700 employees, though it is not known how many in Singapore were affected.

E-commerce giant Amazon is planning to lay off 10,000 employees, reports on Tuesday (Nov 15) said. Singapore-based online marketplace Shopee has held three rounds of retrenchments since June this year, which included staff in its food delivery and online payment teams. Both companies have not responded to queries about the number of employees affected in Singapore.

The larger pool of tech talent available for hire now will give companies leverage to dictate the terms of employment, which means they could end up paying employees less, said Asst Prof Ng.

But outside the start-up world, companies that have traditionally not been regarded as tech firms – such as banks – are seeking to deepen their digital capabilities. The layoffs in tech could be a boon for them, and also present new opportunities to tech job seekers.

“There’s a potential mobility shift for companies that want to reinvent themselves to pursue the top tech talent that would otherwise not be available,” said Asst Prof Ng.

“Now you are seeing an opportunity to recruit top tech talent that has otherwise been lured away by the very juicy compensation packages that were offered by the venture-backed companies.”

Ms Yorlin Ng, COO of venture outfit Momentum Works, said this was the silver lining of the Big Tech layoffs for non-tech companies and start-ups that want to innovate and are now able to grab hold of tech talent.

“A few founder friends of ours already find it easier to hire talent recently,” she said.

“I believe there will be a boom in tech again – perhaps very soon. The landscape might be different from what we are familiar with now though.”","Tech talent still in demand in Singapore despite mass layoffs, say analysts",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/tech-talent-layoffs-workers-jobs-hiring-meta-twitter-3070876

Camunda’s SOC 2 Type 1 audit provides transparency into the company’s information security, privacy, and compliance practices.

“The advantages of utilizing external cloud service providers often come with increases in operational, legal, and reputational risks to the businesses consuming those services. These increased risks can only be mitigated by building trust and confidence in the operations of your cloud service providers,” said Scott Foote, managing director of the Phenomenati Group. “Such trust is best placed in those organizations that have been independently and annually verified as meeting SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria.”

Conducted by Tevora, a specialized management consultancy focused on cybersecurity, risk, and compliance services, this SOC 2 audit affirms that Camunda’s information security practices, policies, procedures, and operations meet the rigorous Trust Service Criteria for Security and Availability as developed by the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants.

“Ensuring data security and availability is an imperative for every organization that relies on cloud-based services,” said Daniel Meyer, Camunda chief technology officer. “Our customers carry this responsibility every single day, and it’s important that the vendors they choose to process their data in the cloud approach that responsibility in the same way.”

November 15, 2022 — 6.30am Sharm el Sheikh: A senior Egyptian official has dismissed allegations of covert surveillance being deployed against dissenters at the COP27 climate talks, suggesting the allegations were made as a political distraction. German media has reported that the German government complained that Egyptian security staff were reported to have monitored and filmed events held at the German pavilion inside the summit venue in Sharm el Sheikh, while Reuters has reported that German federal police have warned its delegates that they may be getting spied on by the host country’s security agents. Some of the events hosted by Germany at the COP relate to human rights rather than climate change and the German Press Agency reported that Egyptian officials took photographs and videos and disrupted proceedings on at least two occasions. “We expect all participants in the UN climate conference to be able to work and negotiate under safe conditions,” Germany’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “This is not just true for the German but for all delegations, as well as representatives of civil society and the media.” … Read more: https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/imprecise-inaccurate-ludicrous-egypt-dismisses-accusations-of-spying-at-climate-talks-as-distraction-20221115-p5by9g.html

‘Weaponised app’: Is Egypt spying on COP27 delegates’ phones? Security analysts warn smartphone app for Sharm el-Sheikh climate talks could be used for spying as it has ‘highly intrusive’ access to locations, conversations and images. By Beatrice Zemelyte

Published On 12 Nov 202212 Nov 2022 Cybersecurity concerns have been raised at the United Nations’ COP27 climate talks over an official smartphone app that reportedly has carte blanche to monitor locations, private conversations and photographs. About 35,000 people are expected to attend the two-week climate conference in Egypt, and the app has been downloaded more than 10,000 times on Google Play, including by officials from France, Germany and Canada. Egypt’s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology developed the app for the summit’s delegates. It is meant to assist attendees in smoothly navigating the conference, but “the government of Egypt may have weaponised the app and now has the ability to surveil all of the summit attendees”, David Bader, an expert in data science and cybersecurity, told Al Jazeera. … Read more: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/12/expert-warn-egypts-cop27-app-could-be-used-for-surveilliance

I’m sure espionage scandals are nothing new to COP conference events. My question is, why has this suddenly become a public issue?

Perhaps Germany doesn’t like the Egyptian regime, and has triggered an agitated response from Egypt through a principled decision to hilight Egypt’s alleged human rights issues.

But there is a small but intriguing possibility delegates might be manoeuvring to blame Egypt for the COP27 failure to produce a meaningful climate agreement, as part of an attempt to deflect blame for the failure, and perhaps to destabilise the el-Sisi regime.

Egypt’s dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, despite accusations of mass human rights violations, is a US ally. I’m no fan of el-Sisi, it is unfortunate that successive US administrations seem to find it geopolitically necessary to support Egypt’s el-Sisi, as they supported Hosni Mubarak before him.

But if el-Sisi is toppled, US regional interests could suffer a significant setback. Other nations might see the resulting chaos as an opportunity to grow their influence in the region.

Despite ongoing US support, the el-Sisi regime might be vulnerable. The apparent uptick in alleged human rights abuses over the last few years could be a sign he is losing his grip on power.

By Friday, FTX had filed for bankruptcy.

After a stupendously profitable asset bubble in 2021, the cryptocurrency industry suffered harsh reversals in 2022. A string of high-profile collapses – Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital – lost investors a fortune, tanked prices and demolished market confidence. But FTX’s sudden collapse caught almost everyone by surprise.

FTX was founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, the child of two Stanford academics. He had worked at quantitative trading firm Jane Street until 2017, when he struck out on his own with his Alameda Research crypto hedge fund. With Alameda as its market maker, FTX rapidly became one of the most popular crypto exchanges. Traders loved its complex futures and options products. A more restricted branch for US customers, FTX US, opened in 2020.

When bitcoin and crypto-assets hit the headlines in 2021, Bankman-Fried positioned himself as a billionaire public intellectual. Bankman-Fried would only be photographed in shorts, a T-shirt or hoodie, and untied shoes. He marketed himself to venture capitalists as a genius eccentric, beyond their comprehension. How did this mere boy of 29 hit the heights so quickly? What was his secret?

FTX marketed hard to the US public: a Super Bowl ad, sports sponsorships, even ads in fortune cookies. Bankman-Fried spent tens of millions on candidates for the US midterms. He even went to Washington, promoting his vision of crypto regulation, to create an environment where he could market FTX to large institutional investors – though this rankled others in the crypto industry, who felt that FTX was trying to freeze them out.

FTX worked hard to promote itself as a trustworthy financial institution run by a dynamic genius, in the mold of Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. In fact, the institution was operating outside all effective regulation, and was an all but hollow shell after the collapse of the crypto market. The Forbes billionaire list entry for Bankman-Fried warned that most of his fortune was “half of FTX and a share of its FTT tokens”.

FTT was an internal token created for traders on FTX – very like supermarket loyalty card points. But FTT was also a crypto-asset, traded outside FTX. It had a mark-to-market value, and people traded against it – such as Bankman-Fried’s other company, Alameda. On 2 November, an Alameda balance sheet was leaked showing that its claimed assets were substantially composed of FTT tokens. Alameda had borrowed from other crypto companies using this pile of FTX-Alameda loyalty card points. It had the FTT because FTX had needed to bail out Alameda after the collapse of Terra-Luna, and sent over its own made-up FTT tokens, claiming these were assets of value.

The crypto markets assumed that trouble at Alameda meant trouble at FTX, and customers got their cryptos out as fast as they could. FTX closed withdrawals on Tuesday. FTX’s competitor Binance announced a bailout a few hours later, but this offer was withdrawn the next day: Binance had looked at FTX’s books and seen that at least $6bn was missing. The Bahamas, where FTX is incorporated, froze FTX’s assets on Thursday; the next day, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US.

The celebrity billionaire is a perennial favorite in the US. The archetype is Jobs: eccentric, acerbic, prickly, and spent 10 years solidly delivering through the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Musk put himself forward similarly, promoting electric cars and energy transition.

When the ultra-wealthy seek the limelight, it’s a stage-managed production for publicity purposes. Sometimes it’s a Steve Jobs. Sometimes it’s an Elizabeth Holmes, dazzling the business world with charm while promoting a fraud.

Bankman-Fried promoted himself as an eccentric genius with financial acumen beyond normal minds, and policy insight to take this new asset class into the future. In reality, his image was a distraction from what was going on inside FTX: an ever-widening balance sheet hole, as FTX and Alameda, working together as a shadow bank, tried to plug the hole with customer funds. Bankman-Fried’s secret turned out to be a financial shell game.

The wider issue is that crypto is all but unregulatable. Legislators can pass lots of detailed rules for US entities, but all the trading in crypto happens in opaque and unregulated offshore casinos – such as FTX.

Further frauds will reveal themselves. When crypto goes out of fashion, new financial shenanigans will step up – fronted by an eccentric genius who nobody understands, but assume they must be as good as they say they are.

Aptos, a Layer 1 blockchain with a lot of backing, will partner with South Korean gaming studio Npixel to bring Web3 tech to its gaming initiatives platform.

Palo Alto, California-based Aptos said that Npixel’s millions of gamers already engaging with its games will be able to safely own and share assets on Aptos’ upgradeable and user-friendly network.

This strategic ecosystem partnership with one of South Korea’s fastest-growing game developers signals Aptos’ build blockchain-based gaming projects. That’s interesting because the South Korean game companies appear to be all-in on blockchain games.

“It’s no surprise to us that the market in South Korea, which is digitally native, is really excited about the technology and what Web3 can bring to the consumer experience,” said Mo Shaikh, CEO of Aptos, in an interview with GamesBeat.

And Palo Alto, California-based Aptos has raised more than $400 million to build out its Web3 technology, said Shaikh.

Shaikh said the Aptos Network is now live in the market, launched a few weeks ago.

“We’re not only the builders of this protocol, but we are now focused on building user-facing applications and tools that will help support Web3 companies where they are today and also help Web2 companies enter this space,” Shaikh said. “Within Web2, as you look at look across various industries, gaming has been one of the industries that’s been most excited about the potential for Web3. But it has sat on the sidelines. And obviously, with our partnership with Npixel, we’re going to help accelerate that adoption.”

Founded in 2017, Npixel hit unicorn status with its Series B round in August of 2021. The firm is best known for its first massively multiplayer online role-playing game titled Gran Saga, which became a top-grossing game on the Apple App store with a four million downloads since its first launch in Korea and Japan. Npixel aims to expand its user base with the upcoming Gran Saga’s global release this year.

“Our team chose Aptos because of their vision of bringing masses into Web3 through better user experience, unparalleled technology, and easy developer onboarding. We could not be more thrilled for this strategic partnership, not only with Aptos, but also with the Aptos community,” added Jeonghwan Ko, head of blockchain department of Npixel.

This partnership comes at a time when the Web3 gaming industry is in serious need of remodeling, Aptos said. Npixel has top-tier expertise in triple-A-quality and engaging gameplay, while Aptos provides a fast-growing ecosystem, scalable network, and focus on user and developer experience, the company said.

“We are excited to partner with one of the world’s largest gaming companies to build the next generation of games on Aptos. This is an amazing opportunity to bring quality gameplay and open user ownership together for the first time,” said Shaikh. “The Aptos network was built for enjoyable development of projects that share a vision for an open and accessible Web3 ecosystem. Partnering with Npixel has been a dream, and we look forward to optimizing the use cases on the Aptos ecosystem even further as we onboard these top-tier strategic ecosystem partners.”

Aptos origins

Aptos founders Mo Shaikh (left) and Avery Ching.

Ching has a doctorate in high-performance computing and working on things like finite element analysis and protein-folding simulations for some of the largest supercomputers. He also worked on search and data infrastructure to support web search, indexing and analytics.

Then he worked for Facebook for 10 years, working on infrastructure stack for analytics across the company. In his last three years at the company, now Meta, he worked on the Libra cryptocurrency project and the Novi wallet. He became the technical lead of the cryptocurrency platform team, but Meta chose not to launch it due to opposition.

There, he worked with Shaikh, who became the CEO at Aptos.

“With every single product there along the way, I built systems that scaled to millions of machines,” he said. “When the project was winding down at Novi, we decided that we weren’t done yet. We had a lot of excitement for the technology and the societal problems we were trying to solve. A lot of our team came with us to start Aptos. This company is only about 11 months old, but the passion behind the project has been going on for many years.”

Ching said it turned out to be a good thing that the crypto technology — across a lot of different companies — now exists outside of Meta. He said it shouldn’t be owned by just one big company. Instead, it should be owned by the people who operate it, he said. And Aptos is an Ohlone word for “people.”

“We’re obviously excited to be able to actually bring those ambitions to fruition, with Web3 and blockchain. And crypto has often tried to give people the value back, give creators the value back where large platforms have benefited and extracted that value along the way with middle parties,” Shaikh said. “And we believe in that Web3 mission of bringing that proximity and that value creation back to the original creators. Web3 and good architecture allows us to do that. And when you think about, you know, who are not only the creators, but people that consume, whether that be art or music, or in-game assets, those people also should be able to benefit as a result of more efficient technology.”

FTX fallout?

Because of the background of the founders, the company has had good results raising money. The company raised its $400 million from investors such as a16z, FTX Ventures, Jump Crypto, Binance Labs, Katie Haun, Multicoin Capital, PayPal Ventures and Coinbase Ventures. Shaikh noted the company has received its money from FTX (which is filing for bankruptcy) and taken the cash upfront and so is not impacted.

As for the current crypto crisis triggered by the collapse of FTX, Shaikh said he came from a world where managing billions of dollars and trust were very important.

“With the unfortunate circumstances with FTX, we see how that has played out. I think it has impact on the entire space. But we think, overall, that it is quite healthy that bad actors are no longer going to be in the space,” Shaikh said. “And it actually gives an opportunity for folks that are very serious about this technology that we talked about, operating with the best of ethics, with amazing investors to actually to rise and take advantage of this opportunity. And that’s where our focus is today. Our heads are down and we continue to build.”

“We launched our mainnet just a couple of weeks ago and I’m really excited about how the ecosystem is building up rapidly around it,” Ching said in an interview.

On to the metaverse

Npixel is building the Metapixel.

Npixel’s Metapixel is a next-generation Web3 gaming ecosystem that will introduce a metaverse consisting of triple-A game IPs, through cooperation with Aptos. By providing quality games using original IPs, true ownership of game assets, and cutting-edge gaming models, such as free-to-own, to open up a new open economy for gamers, Metapixel will shape how true Web3 gaming is perceived, Aptos said.

Ching said the aim was to create a battle-hardened infrastructure that could operate at scale. The company has partnered with Google, which is testing and running validators for the network.

“We’re gaining a lot of confidence from these large enterprises and gaming companies that trust our infrastructure relative to all the infrastructure that’s been out there in the past.”

Aptos is trying to make its technology friendly for users, who shouldn’t have to worry that they might get hacked and lose everything. You should be able to transfer your assets from one account to another if needed. You should be able to customize the recovery scheme if you lose a crypto key. Such things are very important for a non-technical audience, Ching said. The network must also be robust enough to handle billions of users and transactions.

“It’s designed in a way to protect gamers, who have been spending hours collecting assets or building their identity within different games,” Ching said.

Those gamers should be able to travel through the metaverse and take their assets within them from one place to another in an open way with real portability.

Aptos is helping Npixel with its metavere plans.

“It’s very exciting to see these game companies with hundreds of millions of users and an awareness of how to build games come into this,” Ching said.

The company has more than 90 people and there are developers in the ecosystem working on more than 200 projects.

As for the backlash from gamers against the scams in blockchain games, Shaikh said they are aware of those concerns, and there are good reasons for them, given the “events of last week.” But Shaikh said those who are investing a lot of time in the topic see this as the future.

“[The companies in this space are] looking for the right technology partners that are very long-term thinkers in the space,” Shaikh said. “They will build for not just one or two games, but for a period of five or 10 years and they want technology partners they can trust.”",Aptos partners with South Korea’s Npixel on Web3 gaming,https://venturebeat.com/games/aptos-partners-with-south-koreas-npixel-on-web3-gaming/

Ether rival clobbered by FTX crash  Reuters",blockchain,15/11/2022,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/kIJpob8JK2grB5jO88V6XC1isRE=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/T2XOLHT65JOUTLMMKCPVEWNM6A.jpg,reuters,"













Nov 15 (Reuters) - Solana, a poster coin of the crypto future, is in trouble.

The cryptocurrency, which had been lauded by FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried, has been hit harder than any other major coin by the collapse of the exchange.

The Solana token, or SOL , has dropped 53.8% since the furor began unfolding on Nov. 2. By comparison, ether has fallen about 20% and bitcoin 19%.

""In the current crypto shakeout, the most unfortunate innocent victim is the Solana ecosystem,"" said Stefan Rust, CEO of blockchain wallet company Laguna Labs. He and several other crypto players said FTX and sister firm Alameda Research likely sold a large amount of the coin in an attempt to stay afloat.

Many investors and app developers look to be leaving the Solana blockchain, which is widely used for decentralized finance applications; the number of SOL coins deposited there has fallen to 24.74 million, some way south of the 68.2 million seen in June, according to data from aggregator DeFiLlama.

FTX and Alameda Research didn't respond to requests for comment. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko tweeted that development company Solana Labs didn't hold any assets on FTX and had enough financial runway for around 30 months. Another co-founder, Raj Gokal, said this was a ""crucible"" moment for the ecosystem, adding ""each time, we're stronger"".

Nonetheless, uncertainty stalks the blockchain that's been dubbed an ""Ethereum killer"" in the past because of its lower transaction fees, faster processing speed and potential to scale.

""It's not the end for Solana,"" said Adam Struck, at LA-based venture firm Struck Capital. ""It has established itself as a thriving ecosystem and competitor to Ethereum. But do I think valuation is a little frothy? Yes.""

Some see a silver lining.

""It's much better for Solana that the connection with Sam Bankman-Fried's empire is ending now, even if the result is serious short-term pain,"" said Jack Saracco, co-founder of digital bank and payments solutions firm Ping.

SOL's market capitalization has shrunk about 55% since Nov. 2, from $11.6 billion to $5.1 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. Ether's market cap has fallen 21% to $150.7 billion, while bitcoin's has fallen 18% to $319 billion.

'BLOOD IN THE STREETS'

The FTX saga began unfolding in early November when news website CoinDesk reported a leaked balance sheet that showed Alameda Research was heavily dependent on FTX's native token, FTT. Reuters was unable to verify the report. See timeline.

The exchange filed for bankruptcy on Friday after traders rushed to withdraw $6 billion from the platform in just 72 hours and rival Binance abandoned a proposed rescue deal.

The collapse of the company has seen more than $190 billion wiped from the value of the overall crypto market.

""This is what the old guys used to call 'blood in the streets',"" said Martin Leinweber, digital asset product strategist at MarketVector Indexes. ""There is no Fed or Treasury here to support prices, so the market simply cleans things up.""

Yet even amidst the blood-letting, there was some unexpected stability from stablecoins, which are pegged to the value of mainstream assets such as the U.S. dollar in an effort to reduce tame crypto volatility.

Despite the biggest stablecoin Tether having a brief wobble when it touched $0.985, according to CoinMarketCap, it managed to maintain its peg to the dollar, as did USDCoin , the second largest.

""Most stablecoins performed within their normal volatility bands with the exception of some small algorithmic ones,"" Leinweber added.

That's a reversal from earlier in the year when these coins, notably Tether, lost their peg as the market was hit by volatility following the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin..

Some investors attributed the new resilience of the stablecoins, often used to move funds between crypto and regular cash, to greater transparency over their reserves.

""Everyone expected Tether would be the first to fall but it hasn't,"" said Saracco at Ping. ""I think a lot of observers don't realize how battle-tested Tether really is.""

Polycade has made a new kind of arcade machine you can hang on a wall and it has teamed up with Atari to launch a Web3 art collaboration dubbed Polycade Limiteds.

Portland, Oregon-based Polycade is creating a cultural crossover collaboration between video games and art, orchestrated by Web3. The collaboration will have prominent contemporary artists reskin original Atari games, which will be released as limited editions of “digital cartridges,” available for purchase on the blockchain. The official launch will be celebrated at ComplexCon (November 19 to November 20) with a tournament.

There is a sweet symmetry to this deal, as Polycade was started by CEO Tyler Bushnell, son of Atari cofounder Nolan Bushnell, oft-called the father of video games.

“Atari is obviously very close to our hearts. And so it felt like a natural choice for the launch of our greater platform here,” said Tyler Bushnell, in an interview with GamesBeat. “We’re basically launching a series of collaborations pairing classic Atari Games with modern contemporary artists. And so what this will do is take classics games like Asteroids and see all of the artwork reskinned by the artist.”

Art from Shantell Martin gives a new face to Asteroids.

Polycade Limiteds will feature 12 artist collaborations, where each artist will redesign a classic Atari game, such as Asteroids, Pong, Centipede, Missile Command and Breakout.

“It’s bringing the artist’s vision for the game to life, but also, you know, honoring the original with the same gameplay,” Tyler Bushnell said. “The games will be playable through our website, on any of our machines as well, and then also through our downloadable desktop software.”

Each reskinned game will be fully playable and reimagined with the artist’s vision — redesigning all graphics and backgrounds. Polycade Limiteds will kick off its first limited title with contemporary artist Shantell Martin reskinning the classic Atari game Asteroids.

The Digital Cartridge will include three editions with the minting date set for November 19, timed to ComplexCon. The sale of the Artist Edition will be located on nft.coinbase.com and the auction for the Gold Edition will begin on November 19. Digital Cartridges will be stored on the Ethereum Blockchain and a pre-buy and auction accept list to purchase will also be found on Polycade’s website.

The classic Asteroids and the new version from Polycade Limited collaborator Shantell Martin.

“Shantell Martin’s black and white line art really embodies the kinetic energy of Asteroids,” said Tyler Bushnell. “Video games have influenced many traditional artists over the years, but the ability for them to put their mark on games and monetize their artistic creation has been extremely difficult and expensive. Blockchain technology has made it possible for digital goods to behave like the physical collectibles commonly produced by artists.”

Bushnell added, “Whether you’re a nostalgia gamer, collector, or art fan, we’re excited to bring to market a new type of interactive, playable art that honors fantastic video games and incredible artists by bringing them together, providing transparent ownership via our Digital Cartridges, and gamifying the experience through tournaments and achievements.”

Owners can play on the Polycade website, Polycade downloadable software, and on any physical Polycade arcade machine, including those in public places like bars. Tyler Bushnell said he likes the utility that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can offer in enabling that to happen.

Video games today have a physical cartridge or physical media, which is paired with a specific piece of hardware to run it. Or digital media like on Steam. Both of these models have their own flaws and their own sort of like bonuses, Tyler Bushnell said. You can resell the physical cartridge. He said that with digital goods, you can can access them from anywhere, they can’t be damaged, and they can be updated.

Polycade’s arcade machine can hang on a wall. This is a special Polycade Limiteds black edition.

“We wanted to kind of take both of these media and create a new one that sort of represents the positives from both sides. So what we’re doing could not be possible it wouldn’t be possible without blockchain technology,” Tyler Bushnell said. “The digital cartridge is an ERC-721 contract.”

If you own that digital cartridge and log into the web site, you can have access to the game, log in on any of the arcade machines, and have access to the game.

“So it’s essentially your digital cartridge or deed to the game,” Tyler Bushnell said.

The digital cartridge’s will use a regular blockchain wallet, which will hold that digital cartridge. While some hardcore gamers don’t like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Tyler Bushnell said the project wouldn’t be possible without them. Polycade worked with AtariX, the blockchain division of Atari.

Each redesign will be available in three editions — Artist, Silver and Gold — with unique variations in each design. Artist editions will be limited to 1,000 digital copies, Silver editions 10 digital copies, and the Gold edition will be limited to one digital copy which includes a physical Polycade machine designed by the artist.

“Polycade Limiteds is embracing the spirit of ‘what is old is new again’ through the experience of playing Atari games reimagined by top artists. We are excited to see these games played in the traditional format with a new Web3 twist”, said Tyler Drewitz, head of strategy and growth at Atari, in a statement.

Martin is a visual artist, intuitive philosopher, cultural facilitator, teacher, choreographer, songwriter, and performer, is the first artist to kick-off the collaboration. She will be bringing her large-scale, black-and-white line drawings, to the classic game Asteroids.

“Never could I have ever imagined that the hours and hours I spent as a child playing Asteroids would one day lead to me being able to play my own version as an adult,” said Martin, in a statement.

“We’re culture lovers, collectors, gamers. I think when you look at industries fashion, music, art, there is a lot of crossover and collaborations between all of those media. But video games typically exist outside of that, or the collaborations are very surface level, like events and that kind of thing,” he said. “You rarely see these collaborations that dig deeply into the game. And then on the other side, visual artists have never really been able to use video games as a medium for expression. So this enables artists to put their mark on a game that they loved while also showing fans of the game the title in a new light.”

The new Polycade Limiteds Asteroids in action.

In addition, New York street artist Buff Monster will be the second artist collab. The game he will be reskinning has not been announced yet. Buff Monster’s art exudes pop art using bright colors and bold lines, which is seen mostly in large-scale murals and paintings.

“If you own one of these new titles, you’ll be able to access it from any of our arcade machines, including the ones that are in bars and restaurants,” Tyler Bushnell said. “The arcade machines are essentially modern consoles. They can be placed in commercial environments or residential environments. You have a player account, you can log into the machines, wherever they may be, and your games go with you.”

Polycade, founded in 2015, is on a mission to build community through gaming by combining the social arcade experience with modern games and technology. Users can experience Polycade through the Polycade Arcade Cabinet and the downloadable Polycade software. Polycade allows users to play games from any generation and use one interface to combine all of their favorite platforms.

Polycade has about 1,000 machines in the market, including a few at Two-Bit Circus, a big arcade and entertainment center owned by Tyler’s brother Brent Bushnell. Investors include Founders Fund, Wavemaker Partners, Gaingels, and MVP All-Star Fund. It has six people.

Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin cautioned critics of FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried to be more discerning, even as he suggested the crypto exchange's collapse was due to fraud.

Buterin, a vocal supporter of widespread crypto adoption and blockchain technology, said it would be a mistake to dismiss everything Bankman-Fried did, even as his crypto empire collapses amid federal probes into the potential mishandling of customer funds.

""Automatically downgrading every single thing SBF believed in is an error,"" Buterin tweeted. ""It's important to actually think and figure out which things contributed to the fraud and which things didn't.""

Market commentators have compared the FTX crash to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy as well as infamous cases of fraud like Theranos, Bernie Madoff and Enron.

After failing to secure a rescue, FTX and 130 affiliates last week filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried stepped down from his position as CEO.

Still, for those who do broadly dismiss SBF, Buterin appeared to reference Adolf Hitler, who was a vegetarian.

""Don't be the guy who would have tried to cancel vegetarianism in 1945,"" the crypto cofounder wrote.

When crypto markets went into freefall earlier this year, Buterin tried to find a silver lining. After the token Terra had collapsed in May, he said that was something that could actually bode well for the sector.

He wrote in a blog post that the turmoil could be an opportunity to go back to ""principles-based thinking,"" and warned against expectations for limitless growth in the cryptocurrency market.

Buterin urged investors to ""evaluate how safe systems are by looking at their steady state, and even the pessimistic state of how they would fare under extreme conditions and ultimately whether or not they can safely wind down.""",Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin says it's a mistake to dismiss everything FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried did despite 'fraud',https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-alameda-bankruptcy-crypto-2022-11

The European Union may prevent ban banks and crypto providers from dealing in privacy-enhancing coins such as monero and zcash under proposed amendments to anti-money laundering rules, CoinDesk reported Tuesday, citing a leaked draft obtained by the news site.

Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that keep information hidden on the blockchain. The measure under consideration at the EU is aimed at avoiding risk stemming from crypto assets that are designed to avoid traceability, an EU diplomat told CoinDesk.

The proposal calls for crypto asset providers to verify the identity of customers even for occasional transactions of under 1,000 euros ($1,040) and to probe the nature of the business for larger payments, the report said.

""Credit institutions, financial institutions and crypto-asset service providers shall be prohibited from keeping …anonymity-enhancing coins,"" said a legislative draft circulated by Czech officials to the EU's other member states for comment. The Czech Republic will hold the EU Council presidency until the end of 2022.

Crypto service providers conducting business outside the EU would need to verify whether their counterparty is licensed.

The European Council and the European Parliament must agree to the bill to pass it into law. Such an agreement would widen the effort by the European Parliament to tackle so-called dirty money moved through digital channels including NFTs and decentralized finance.

The European Commission proposed its Anti-Money Laundering Regulation last year in part to vet practices at large financial institutions.

Bitcoin holders are skittish following the dramatic collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, according to blockchain analysts at Glassnode. Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals have hit a record rate of 106,000 monthly, indicating that customers may be losing trust in third-party services.

Glassnode tweeted that there had been three other periods in recent years with similar withdrawal patterns, April and November 2020 and June to July 2022, when combined factors — including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the failure of the Terra LUNA stablecoin — caused the crypto market to nose-dive.

Following the collapse of FTX, #Bitcoin investors have been withdrawing coins to self-custody at a historic rate of 106k $BTC/month.

In the past, similar outflows have sometimes signaled a bull run. In this case, it's much more likely to be a sign that investors have lost faith in big-name exchanges. As Markets Insider noted, these actions ""suggest crypto investors are reconsidering how to manage their digital assets now that the once third-largest crypto exchange in the world has faltered and the value of the fortune built up by FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried [has] now been wiped to $1.""

CoinEdition quoted Hong Kong Digital Asset Operations Manager Alan Wong, who said that after FTX, ""things will continue to simmer"" and that with an $8 billion gap ""between liabilities and assets, when FTX is insolvent, it will trigger a domino effect, which will lead to a series of investors related to FTX going bankrupt or being forced to sell assets.""

The patent application title is ""Tracking Unique In-Game Digital Assets Using Tokens on a Distributed Ledger,"" as reported by Video Games Chronicle.

The patent application details a system where the history of a unique in-game item would be tracked with blockchain technology, including details of who created the item, who owned it in the past, and whether it has been modified along the way.

In the background section, Sony compares the digital assets in question to sports memorabilia, saying ""individuals often find it meaningful to own or use unique physical items related to respected celebrities or activities.""

The patent application suggests fans might want to collect in-game objects that were owned or created by notable esports players or gaming influencers, saying that the tracked data could show if an item was the one used by a player to win a major game tournament, as one example. The patent application also mentions transferring items between games and even across platforms.

Crypto has been in a months-long rut, with the market dropping more than two-thirds of its value since November of last year.

Following the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD, contagion concerns from the fallout of centralized lender Celsius and now-defunct overleveraged hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, along with the Federal Reserve's painful interest-rate hikes, crypto markets haven't been able to regain their footing.

Last week, however, prompted a whole new slew of problems for the nascent space. One of the biggest players in crypto is swiftly unraveling.

After facing serious liquidity concerns, FTX, the once-reputable crypto trading platform, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday. The company's US subsidiary, FTX.US, quant trading firm Alameda Research, and 130 other companies were listed in the proceedings.

FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried – previously helmed as a crypto wunderkind for bailing out ailing firms – stepped down as chief executive of the company he started on November 11. ""I fucked up, and should have done better,"" SBF said in a tweet a day before he resigned.

Both bitcoin and ethereum are down more than 74% from their all-time highs on the news, according to crypto research and data firm Messari. Some have described the catastrophic series of events as crypto's ""Lehman Moment.""

""The real concern is these issues with FTX's offshore operations raising questions about the universe of crypto intermediaries as a whole,"" Kevin Gallagher, a principal in Deloitte's Casey Quirk asset management practice, told Insider.

Crypto adoption on Wall Street

Until last week's slew of bad news, traditional investors have been plunging into crypto despite the prolonged bear market.

In August, BlackRock announced a partnership with the crypto exchange Coinbase, allowing institutional clients to manage and trade bitcoin. The world's largest asset manager, which oversees $8 trillion in assets, previously invested in the stablecoin issuer Circle. Elsewhere, Fidelity continues to expand its digital-asset unit, per Bloomberg, with 100 additional hires since May.

Over the past year, the private-equity powerhouse Apollo Global amped up its digital-asset strategy as well, poaching the former JPMorgan blockchain exec Christine Moy to oversee the firm's crypto efforts. Apollo previously invested in Anchorage Digital and plans to make more investments in Web3 startups.

""My role is to walk in two worlds,"" Moy, who pulled an 18-year stint at JPMorgan, told Insider in an October interview. ""I take everything that I learn and bring it back to the executive boardrooms of Wall Street to help traditional finance navigate what the future of finance looks like in a Web3, tech-enabled world.""

Adoption from major firms have been a boon for firms like Paxos, a blockchain-infrastructure platform that helps institutions adopt crypto strategies. The company, led by CEO Charles Cascarilla, has worked with payment-processing giants like Mastercard to help banks offer crypto trading.

Crypto sentiment from Wall Street giants has come a long way over the past few years. BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink, described bitcoin as an ""index of money laundering"" in 2017, while JPMorgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, described the industry as ""fraud"" in 2018. Both institutions now offer crypto exposure to clients.

But after the astounding and swift downfall of a multi-billion dollar crypto empire, questions remain on how these firms will approach digital assets moving forward.

FTX's failure and its impact on crypto regulation

The industry (now more than ever) will have to jump through some serious regulatory hurdles before it can go mainstream. After FTX's disaster, a crackdown on digital assets is imminent.

Prominent government officials quickly spoke out against the crypto platform last week. ""It is clear that there are major consequences when cryptocurrency entities operate without robust federal oversight and protections for customers,"" Maxine Waters, the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are both investigating FTX for potential civil and criminal violations of securities laws, the Wall Street Journal reported.

""Investors need better protection in this space,"" Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, said during an interview on CNBC Thursday.

Gensler has long expressed the need for tighter regulation on digital assets even before the FTX drama. In a sign of a crackdown, the SEC fined Kim Kardashian over an insufficient disclosure when she promoted a cryptocurrency, dubbed EMAX token, on her Instagram account. Gensler says that the agency's aggressive stance on digital assets is an effort to protect investors and may encourage further crypto adoption.

""This is not like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq,"" he said, according to a transcript of his remarks. ""These platforms — there's just a handful of lending platforms, and a handful of so-called exchanges — which commingle. It's also another toxic combination, where they take people's money, they borrow against it. It's not much disclosure, and then they trade against their customers.""

Gensler added: ""We're going to be clear in our voice about the risks, the speculative risk, and what appears to be largely non-compliant actors. We are going to continue to be working with industry to try and get them properly registered, but also that cop on the beat.""","Wall Street has made serious strides to embrace crypto this year.

209,Market researcher Newzoo has revised its forecast downward to predict games will decline 4.3% in 2022 to $184.4 billion.,blockchain,15/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Newzoo_Global-Games-Market-per-Segment_Nov-2022.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Did you miss a session from GamesBeat Summit Next 2022? All sessions are now available for viewing in our on-demand library. Click here to start watching.

For the first time in Newzoo’s history of covering the global games market, the market researcher has revised its forecast downward to predict games will decline 4.3% in 2022 to $184.4 billion.

That isn’t necessarily a reason for the industry to panic, as 2022 is a corrective year after two exceptional boom years, and the overall long-term outlook for games remains positive, Newzoo said.

The downward revision is largely based on a slower-than-expected year for console games. I guess all those delayed games and console shortages have finally come home to roost. Newzoo has been covering the game market since 2012 and the industry has had positive growth every year since then.

“We knew that this was going to happen because we had our earlier forecast from July, but then the data that we had coming in each quarter influenced it,” said Tom Wijman, lead analyst for games at Newzoo, in an interview with GamesBeat. “There were still positive signs in Q1, but as we saw Q2 and Q3 come in, we saw what was happening. It was not a shock.”

And while it is a setback for games, Newzoo said the sum of revenues generated from 2020 to 2022 is almost $43 billion higher than it originally forecast pre-pandemic. Overall, the games market will grow from $179.1 billion in 2020 (up 29%) to $211.2 billion by 2025, growing at a 3.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). In 2021, revenues for games was $192.7 billion, up 7.6%. The pandemic boosted games in 2020 and 2021, but Wijman believes that in 2022, the pandemic had a negative effect as people went out more and didn’t have as much time or money for games.

The severity of the economic downturn in the world can affect gaming revenues, Wijman said. He noted that mobile games are likely to be impacted more by that, as casual gamers may be more sensitive to economic effects such as lower income and those players may choose not to spend more in games.

“It hits mobile spending harder than it does PC and console,” said Wijman.

Wijman said that Newzoo tracks actual results coming in from the top 150 public game companies around the world and then it takes that into account in judging how accurate its forecast is. It also makes estimate based on data from private companies and sources such as Steam.

The new 2022 market forecast

Newzoo expects games to shrink 4.6% in 2022.

The game market will generate $184.4 billion in 2022, down 4.3% year on year. This is a significant downward revision from the previous (July 2022) estimate of $196.8 billion.

“Even though this year is not a great year for gaming, we also want to say it’s important to emphasize that it doesn’t mean that for the coming years we’re forecasting a decline as well,” Wijman said. “The fact the installed base is not high yet can mean that those sales will happen later and maybe more good games will be coming out next year.”

However, the PC games market will generate $40.5 billion in 2022, up 0.5% year on year. This is slightly higher than Newzoo’s previous forecast of $40.4 billion.

The mobile games market will generate $92.2 billion in 2022, down 6.4% year on year. The outlook for the mobile games market changed significantly compared to Newzoo’s previous forecast, where it expected the mobile games market to grow 5.1% year on year.

The console games market will generate $51.8 billion in 2022, a decline of 4.2% year on year. This is lower than the July forecast of $52.9 billion (2.2% decline year on year).

“It’s a compounding effect of not having the installed base for consoles now that you would expect,” Wijman said. “It’s been two years now since the consoles launched. In my area, it’s possible to buy a PlayStation 5, which it hasn’t been for the past two years. But still, you would have expected by now that it would have been bigger.”

On top of that, he said we don’t have enough new games to buy.

“If there is no new content coming, then the impact is bigger. There aren’t that many new games to buy, and we saw it hurting services like Xbox Game Pass,” Wijman said.

Meanwhile, Newzoo said that 2022’s VR games market will generate revenues of $1.82 billion, a 26.4% year-on-year increase. This number does not include VR hardware.

The resilience of PC gaming

The observatory in Al Mazrah in Call of Duty: Warzone.

The forecast takes into account an analysis of the financial results of more than 150 publicly listed game companies (for the first six months of the calendar year 2022). That prompted the revision.

Browser PC games are declining, even though the year 2020 saw a brief resurgence of these games. The

segment will decline another 16.7% year on year to $2.3 billion, as more people migrate to mobile

games and those remaining spend less on average.

However, the downloaded and boxed PC segment will grow 1.8% year-on-year growth, more than offsetting the shrinkage in browser games.

PC gaming’s revenues are not as hit-driven as console gaming; a year light on releases such as 2022

affects PC gaming revenues less, as the top-grossing games typically have been around for multiple

years (if not longer than a decade).

Similarly, PC gaming is still a place where independent publishers can flourish, Newzoo said. Unlike the local mobile games segment, PC game revenues are still growing in China and Japan.

Mobile games weaken

Mobile marketing may not be as precise as it once was, due to rising privacy concerns.

Newzoo is forecasting the mobile games market will generate $92.2 billion in 2022, down 6.4% year on year. The outlook for the mobile games market changed significantly compared to the previous forecast. While Newzoo anticipated that the removal of IDFA (Apple’s focus on privacy over targeted advertising) and pressure on people’s disposable income would dampen spending on mobile games, the first quarter of 2022 was still relatively strong.

However, spending in the second quarter was significantly lower than last year’s, and signs show that it did not recover in the third quarter. The second half of 2021 was a particularly strong period for the mobile games market; Newzoo does not foresee the market being able to repeat these results, let alone show growth. This is something that the entire mobile game industry got wrong, in my opinion.

Wijman said Newzoo knew the IDFA impact was coming but the severity of it changed, as mobile game companies said at first they would not likely be affected. In the first quarter, results were still pretty good for mobile game companies. But that changed over the rest of the year. That may have been foreseeable, at least for the companies in the space, Wijman said.

Mobile’s low barrier to entry (compared to PC and console gaming) also implies a lower barrier to exit.

Two main factors are contributing to mobile players’ behavior this year. First, as other forms of

entertainment and leisure spending became available once more, competing for players’ time and

budget.

Most players haven’t stopped gaming completely, but they play less and, therefore, pay less. On top of that, the current economic climate, especially inflation, limits people’s disposable income. These two

drivers theoretically affect all spending on gaming.

However, based on Newzoo’s research this year, the company found it will hit mobile more than PC and console. The more important the role of gaming in people’s lives, the less likely people will lower their spending on games in face of economic uncertainty or with alternative options for entertainment.

Console weakness

God of War Ragnarok

Newzoo is forecasting the console games market will generate $51.8 billion in 2022, a decline of 4.2% year on year. The console segment is having a slow year as the release schedule throughout 2022 remains light. More than other segments, console is a hit-driven market, and a lack of triple-A releases hurts the market.

While some blockbusters were recently launched (such as Call of Duty Modern Warfare II and God of War: Ragnarok), Newzoo does not expect that these hits alone will offset the decline of the first half of the year.

Asia-Pacific’s gaming market hit hardest

Newzoo’s 2022 forecast of game revenues by region.

During the year, the Chinese government continued cracking down on gaming in China, limiting new game releases and young people’s gaming time (out of fear kids won’t study and will become addicted). Despite this, the Chinese games market will still be the largest in the world in 2022, generating $45.8 billion. PC games were stable, but mobile games declined a lot in China, thanks in part to the regulatory situation in the country and restrictions on new game launches, Wijman said.

This is slightly more than the U.S.’s $45.0 billion, the second-largest market. Together, these two markets represent 49% of global spending on games.

Notably, revenues of breakout mobile hits of the past years, such as PUBG Mobile and Umamusume:

Pretty Derby, are declining rapidly. And no new titles have been as successful.

The corrective factor of this post-lockdown spending is especially notable in the three major Asian markets: China, Japan, and South Korea. Newzoo now forecasts a decline in all three markets, and, largely because of this, the Asia-Pacific region is forecast to decline most out of all major regions.

Wijman said some revenue was lost because of the war in Ukraine and disruptions in the Ukraine and Russian markets. But the effect was unclear. Still, Wijman said if an official estimate on Eastern Europe was made, that would have declined.

However, the downturn in the mobile market affects all regions; Newzoo now also forecast mobile gaming revenue to decline in Western markets.

Asia-Pacific will remain the biggest region by revenues by a massive margin, despite the performance of

its biggest markets. It will generate $87.9 billion in 2022, a year-on-year decline of -5.6% and represent

48% of the global market. Revenues will also decline in North America (-5.1%) and Europe (-3.5%) year

on year. Console is a massive segment in both markets, which means a slow year for console is a slow

year in these two regions.

Newzoo still forecasts the market to grow in the emerging gaming regions of Latin America and the Middle East and Africa, driven by new players entering the (mobile) gaming ecosystem and better access to payment methods. However, average spending in these regions is still low compared to other big regions. So growth in these regions does not offset the decline in mature gaming markets.

Overall brightness

Nintendo Switch Sports debuted on April 29.

Newzoo doesn’t want us all to get depressed. The lockdown years may have pushed the games market to unsustainable levels of revenue, especially in the current economic climate, but the coming years look promising, particularly for console gaming. Newzoo is now forecasting the games market will grow from $179.1 billion in 2020 to $211.2 billion by 2025, growing at a 3.4% CAGR.

Console gaming will grow rapidly in the coming years, as the next two years will bring loads of new content for a rapidly growing user base of PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. Furthermore, we expect a new

Nintendo device somewhere around 2024-2025, as the Nintendo Switch will then have launched eight

years ago.

Cloud gaming revenues are factored into the forecast. But Wijman said that we see a lot of economic activity around games that isn’t counted in these numbers. As examples, esports, VR hardware sales, streaming revenues for creators, blockchain games and more, Wijman said. Next year, he expects good growth for console games and console hardware. (Sales of console hardware and PC gaming hardware also not included in the forecast numbers).

“We don’t look at blockchain gaming as part of this games market yet,” Wijman said.

He acknowledged this was a $5.8 billion market in 2021, but he noted that the sales were likely dramatically lower in 2022 as Axie Infinity and the crypto market declined a lot. In that respect, blockchain games on their own couldn’t rescue the 2022 forecast.

“It’s just it’s, it’s very hard to put a number to [blockchain games],” Wijman said.

Metaverse revenues for gaming isn’t measured either.

“Arguably some of the activity around metaverse is being fueled by gaming roles, but it’s not well known as to direct spending on gaming,” Wijman said.

With esports, it’s more like a semantic discussion. It’s clearly not game revenue if an esports fan buys a T-shirt for a team at a tournament. But if it causes a fan to spend money in League of Legends, then that is revenue that can be counted. Nevertheless, such numbers are hard to come by and are not part of the forecast.

Wijman noted that current growth will “backload” the revenues for 2023 and beyond in contrast to how the pandemic boost “front-loaded” revenues in 2020 and 2021. If we sell more consoles and get a lot of good console games in 2023, that growth will come later. The growth in 2023 probably won’t be as big as the growth in 2021, in percentage terms (7% in 2021), but it will be positive, Wijman said.

While this year shows that price-sensitive players spend less during tougher economic times, engagement remains high across segments. The number of global players is still growing across the globe. Gaming proved resilient during turbulent economic times in the past; today, free-to-play monetization and subscription services mean that playing games is more democratized than ever before. Gaming is now embedded in consumers’ lives, and that will not change, Newzoo said.

“We are still optimistic about the future,” Wijman said.",Newzoo forecasts game market will shrink 4.3% to $184.4B in 2022,https://venturebeat.com/games/newzoo-forecasts-game-market-will-shrink-4-3-to-184-4b-in-2022/

""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary has had his hands full lately, deciding where to put his money after gauging interest in a potential rescue of FTX that ultimately fell through.

A paid spokesperson and investor in the bankrupt exchange, the market veteran spent the weekend on calls trying to sort through rumors surrounding founder Sam Bankman-Fried and determine how much of his money could be recovered.

""I'm writing that all down to zero,"" O'Leary told Insider. ""It's not clear what can be recovered. There's a lot of allegations flying around. But frankly, I've seen this movie before. It's a difficult situation, there's no question about it. There'll be a mountain of litigation.""

On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Bankman-Fried is trying to raise money to pay back clients, while FTX warned that it could have more than 1 million creditors.

The company's collapse rattled trust across the cryptocurrency sector, and O'Leary, a native Canadian, has started moving his assets elsewhere. Canada is the only country that offers fully-regulated broker-dealer exchange accounts, he said.

In his view, unregulated exchanges aren't safe, regardless of their size, so he's turned to crypto exchange WonderFi, which is regulated by the Ontario Securities Exchange. He's a shareholder in the parent company, and it was also the first crypto-trading platform on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

""We have confidence that the regulatory environment in Canada scrutinizes accounts that can't be commingled,"" O'Leary said. ""I can't find another place on Earth right now safer than Canada.""

A phone call with Bankman-Fried

O'Leary said he doesn't think the market has seen the bottom of the FTX fallout yet, marking a stark reversal from two-and-a-half years ago, when FTX's management team approached him to arrange a 30-minute meeting with Bankman-Fried.

That turned into a three-hour lunch. O'Leary then met Bankman-Fried's parents — both lawyers — and gained more confidence from seeing other large, global investors backing FTX.

While federal regulators are reportedly investigating FTX and Bankman-Fried, who last week resigned as CEO, for potentially mishandling client funds, O'Leary maintains he's never met a more brilliant mind when it comes to crypto and blockchain.

""He's a savant,"" he said. ""He's probably one of the most accomplished traders of crypto in the world, and so I was very impressed.""

Given his astuteness, O'Leary finds it hard to believe Bankman-Fried didn't realize the risks he was taking, as reports say he transferred billions in FTX client funds to his Alameda Research trading arm. The 30-year-old founder will have a ""fair amount of explaining to do"" when all the facts emerge, he said.

O'Leary said he spent last Thursday fielding calls from prospective investors in FTX. Sovereign wealth funds were interested to the tune of $6 billion-$8 billion, according to O'Leary, but there wasn't clarity on which was the correct amount. O'Leary messaged Bankman-Fried asking about it, and he received a call immediately.

""He confirmed that it was $8 billion, and that's the number I took forward,"" O'Leary explained. ""We had a brief conversation. He was very rational. We discussed a few things about, you know, the timing on that $6 to $8 billion. But it was enough information for me to go back to the interested sources and confirm the number was eight.""

Bankman-Fried also said on the call, according to O'Leary, that regulators were going to ""come down hard"" on the situation.

But as reports swirled that the Securities and Exchange Commission and other global regulators were closing in on FTX, rescue offers dried up shortly after the pair's phone call.

""All of those interested parties were gone,"" O'Leary said. ""I texted that back to Sam. I did not have a conversation with him, and I told him that was not going to be an option.""

Still, O'Leary believes that if a sovereign wealth fund or other buyer had put in roughly $4 billion, then investors would've again felt safe keeping their assets in FTX.

""So really what was on the table and being debated all around the world was you could buy a $32 billion asset for $4 billion,"" he said.","Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary, an FTX spokesperson, explains his next move after the crypto collapse and how he tried to rescue Sam Bankman-Fried",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/shark-tank-kevin-oleary-sam-bankman-fried-crypto-ftx-crash-2022-11

Ken Sweet and Thalia Beaty, The Associated Press





NEW YORK (AP) - Just days after cryptocurrency's third-largest exchange collapsed, the public is starting to get an idea of how messy FTX's bankruptcy case could be. Other crypto firms are failing as a result of FTX's unraveling, events reminiscent of the domino-like meltdowns of the 2008 financial crisis.

Users remained frustratingly in the dark Tuesday about when they might get their funds back, if at all, directing much of their anger toward FTX's founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.

In a court filing, FTX's lawyers said there were already more than 100,000 claims against the company and estimated that figure could grow to more than 1 million, most of them customers, once the case is complete. The court ordered FTX to provide at least a list of the company's 50 biggest creditors by Nov. 18.

The lawyers said the company is in contact with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as well as dozens of other state, federal and international authorities, confirming earlier reports that the U.S. government is probing the possibility that Bankman-Fried and his lieutenants violated U.S. securities law.

FTX filed for bankruptcy protection Friday, sending tsunami-like waves through the cryptocurrency industry, which has seen a fair share of volatility and turmoil this year, including a sharp decline in price for bitcoin and other digital assets. For some, the events are reminiscent of the failures of Wall Street firms during the 2008 financial crisis, particularly now that supposedly healthy firms like FTX are failing.

The Wall Street Journal reported that BlockFi, which had halted withdrawals over the weekend following FTX's bankruptcy, is now actively considering bankruptcy and plans to lay off its staff. In previous public comments, BlockFi's management made it clear that FTX's failure had pushed the company towards being out of business. FTX had provided financial aid to BlockFi this summer, including a $400 million credit facility backed by its own balance sheet.

“We are shocked and dismayed by the news regarding FTX and Alameda,” BlockFi said Saturday, referring to FTX and Bankman-Fried's hedge fund Alameda Research. “Given the lack of clarity on the status of FTX.com, FTX US and Alameda, we are not able to operate business as usual.”

Another crypto firm, crypto lending firm SALT Blockchain, also appeared to be on the verge of failure. The company Bnk to the Future pulled out of its agreement to buy SALT, citing its exposure to FTX. In tweets, SALT's CEO Shawn Oren said he is “fully committed still to recover from the damages as victims.”

In a sign of how fearful investors are that the cascading effects could do long-term damage, cryptocurrency exchange Binance proposed the creation of a rescue fund that would save otherwise healthy crypto companies from failure. Binance's founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao effectively laid out the possibility of a crypto-like central bank or deposit-insurance pool to be a lender of last resort to keep healthy firms from failing.

Meanwhile, FTX's users bemoaned their losses in Telegram chat groups for traders who used the FTX exchange, writing that they'd lost access to amounts ranging from thousands to millions of dollars.

Some pleaded for information. Others speculated on the likelihood of getting back their funds, while others counseled that they should accept that their investments were gone.

Moderators for one group posted intermittently, saying things like, “No death threats please.” They wrote that they had no information about the whereabouts of Bankman-Fried or what would happen to his companies.

“No news,” posted one moderator.

Many of FTX's users pointed to Bankman-Fried as responsible, making puns on his name like “Sam Bankrun-Fried” and calling for him to be prosecuted.

On Tuesday, a support account for FTX US was responding on Twitter to posts from people asking about their funds and directing them to send messages to the Twitter account to get assistance.

Mohit Sorout, 30, said he has lost access to 95% of the value of his cryptocurrency holdings when FTX halted its services last week, posting on Twitter, “The pain is f(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)ing real.”

An electrical engineer based between New Delhi and Dubai, he started trading in 2017 and quit his job in 2018 to work full time trading cryptocurrencies. Along with a business partner, he built a custom algorithm, and grew an investment of a couple thousand dollars into a sum many times that size, though he didn't want to disclose the value of his holdings when he lost access to them.

It's not clear what will happen to the funds of retail investors like Sorout, which are locked within the FTX ecosystem. His requests to withdraw the funds were not honored last week and now he can't even log onto the exchange, he said on Monday.

Sorout didn't intend to keep all of his investments on a single platform, he said, but the tools that FTX had built for traders like himself were very effective and his algorithm worked well there. He also trusted Bankman-Fried in part because of his high profile.

“The problem was the founder, who is donating eight figures in presidential campaigns, he's meeting with the top bureaucrats, he is sponsoring chess tournaments, he's out there sponsoring stadiums,” Sorout said. “You don't really expect such a huge business, especially the CEO of that business, to defraud its customers, you know?”","Size, scope of FTX failure gets clearer as users fear worst - CP24",https://www.cp24.com/world/size-scope-of-ftx-failure-gets-clearer-as-users-fear-worst-1.6154350

214,Understanding the differences between true customer loyalty and reward programs can help brands build lasting relationships with their customers. Here's how (and why).,blockchain,15/11/2022,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1668197966-GettyImages-1133786941.jpg,entrepreneur,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

There are about 4 billion loyalty program memberships in the U.S., and they're all fueled by some type of reward. Yes, even Starbucks' recently-announced metaverse loyalty program is expected to deal in NFTs (a fancy way of saying a digital asset as a reward).

Entrepreneurs, take note: There will be significant changes over the next decade in the expectations consumers have for brands and banks. Between stocks, NFTs and advancements in blockchain and crypto, ""loyalty"" is a category that will undergo significant advancement to keep an enticed consumer. What's driving this change, and what will move the needle for the consumer while bringing a solid return on investment to the brand?

A reward alone doesn't necessarily create loyalty. In fact, a reward often brings a customer in for just one more transaction at a time. Brands are learning that there is a difference between loyalty and rewards: one creates lasting, long-term company success rooted in a relationship with aligned incentives, and the other merely extends a brand's lifeline to the next quarter's earnings.

Loyalty means an attachment to the institution one spends with. It means awareness of the decision being made to shop at one brand or another. It's going out of the way to arrive at the store, gas station or restaurant the customer cares most about. When a customer is merely incentivized to return one more time via a disposable reward, this generally doesn't speak to loyalty as much as it does to the ""deal"" they will get by doing so at that moment.

My team talks with brands every day about rewards currencies and the merits or drawbacks associated with the most common incentives. There are so many different kinds of programs; these include points, cash back, rebates and miles. Brands have spent the last two decades building different combinations of the same rewards currency — many of them to great success by tying their rewards to brand values and their most popular and beloved products. So how does a brand ensure rewards turn into loyalty, rather than just a second transaction?

Related: 3 Secret Reasons Why Your Brand Needs a Rewards Program

Keep it simple, keep it connected

Consumers have been burnt by complexity — frustration in managing multiple loyalty platforms with various web-based logins has led to a wave of brands building and launching their own self-contained loyalty programs. Recent additions to this ""self-contained loyalty"" approach include the McDonald's MyMcDonald's Rewards or Taco Bell's mobile app. These brands realized that asking customers to do the work of tracking, managing, and redeeming their rewards could be more of a burden than a relationship-building experience. So, they threaded ordering, rewards and other user engagement all into the same space.

The beauty of this approach? Rewards don't disappear. They are reimagined in ways that spark creativity, engagement and camaraderie with the customer. They become personalized and presented with choices that the customer can make along the way.

The quickest way for a loyalty program to feel out of touch or antiquated is if it's a disjointed experience — a program that assigns arbitrary points that deliver inconsistent rewards or a program that only rewards on a transaction, but doesn't open the opportunity for additional customer behaviors and engagement. Instead of focusing on that reward, a bond must be built between the customer and the brand.

Related: Why Small Businesses Should Be Utilizing Customer-Loyalty Programs

How we can evolve rewards programs

Classic rewards currencies incentivize transactions. They create fleeting, one-off moments that don't serve the connection to the customer. In some cases, they can even tarnish the brand. Those are the rewards we want to move modern loyalty away from.

Let's use coupons as an example: The customer may come into the store to use a coupon they earned for a recent purchase. That coupon (while serving the transactional purpose) sets the expectation that what is being sold has a lower value than it's listed for, and it tells the customer to make their choice based on the price tag alone. The traditional rewards equation prioritizes low cost over quality, convenience and value alignment — the transaction over the relationship.

That's not to say that coupons (or miles, points or a free frozen yogurt at the end of a 10-visit punch card) don't have their place in a loyalty program. They simply need to be connected to more than a transaction. What other ways can customers earn those rewards? Is there an option to redeem vs build for a larger reward? Does the reward currency provide tangible value? Maybe that coupon is offered because a customer has exhibited loyalty and earned the coupon through loyalty, rather than as a way to achieve such loyalty.

Matching rewards currencies to loyalty programs

Brands don't need to build and launch full-scale interactive apps to connect with their customers (it doesn't hurt, of course, but it all comes down to intention). In many cases, they can reassess or add reward currency options that can grow with their customer relationship. There are so many more ways that brands can reward their customers than when the loyalty and incentives space was created. They can give ownership of digital assets via NFTs, unlock access to exclusive events or offerings and can even give shares of stock as a reward.

Using the example I know best, let's look at how some of these new reward mechanisms change the customer experience. When a brand rewards its customers in stock rewards, also known as ownership, they can:

Deliver immediate validation for the consumer, which can power more immediate behavior change

for the consumer, which can power more immediate behavior change Reinforce long-term brand/consumer relationships instead of cherry-picking, couponing or continuously discounting

instead of cherry-picking, couponing or continuously discounting Create meaningful access points to financial markets that half of Americans don't currently have

Related: Customer Loyalty Brings Long-Term Sales

With standard points programs, customers usually need to rack up a significant number of points, miles or whatever the chosen type of currency is to start seeing any benefits. But the opportunity to reward in stock or ETFs, even in small amounts can create immediate gratification — which then can serve as an entry point to other aspects of a loyalty program. Stock-related rewards can potentially grow over time, along with the consumer's confidence, loyalty and brand love.

Most importantly, this is a program that speaks to long-term vitality for a brand and consumer. According to user surveys through our company, Bumped, 65% of users have told friends about a company they own after becoming a shareholder. The customer now has a new thread of relationships that coupons can't create. A total of 31% of users who become shareholders are willing to pay more for a product from a brand they own, versus expecting to pay less the next time they're in the store. Most importantly, the consumer may even feel awkward shopping with a competitor once becoming an owner — now that's loyalty.

Let's work to build a world of incentivized, aligned and motivated consumers, one where everybody wins and is a part of what they care most about. That is the future of alignment that extends beyond a single transaction, whether in the form of crypto, NFT, points or stock.",How Brands Can Turn Short-Term Rewards Into Long-Term Loyalty,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-brands-can-turn-rewards-programs-into-long-term-loyalty/437118

As reported by CNN, the pair of Birkenstock Arizona went under the hammer this week with an initial estimate of $60,000 - $80,000. However, 19 bids later the lot sold for more than $200,000.

According to the listing, the sandals were owned and worn by Jobs in the 70s and 80s and were previously owned by Jobs' house manager Mark Sheff. Sheff says that he acquired the sandals and other items from Jobs because Apple's founding father didn't like to keep things.

No small feet

According to Sheff, Jobs may have even made his own sandals in the 1970s. The listing says Jobs wore the sandals ""during many pivotal moments in Apple’s history"" including the beginnings of Apple in his family Los Altos garage with Steve Wozniak. Jobs' ex-partner and mother of his child Lisa said the sandals were ""were part of his simple side. They were his uniform. The great thing about a uniform is that you don't have to worry about what to wear in the morning.""

The sandals as seen here have been displayed at multiple exhibitions in the U.S. and abroad in Germany and Italy. The Sandals were described as ""well used"" but intact, and feature their original Birkenstock adjustable buckles and stamping. The footbed still has the imprint of Steve Jobs' feet and the soles show signs of heavy wear.

Original and unique Apple memorabilia often fetch high prices at auction. Last month an original factory-sealed iPhone sold for over $39,000. A historic Apple-1 prototype board that was damaged sold at an auction in August for a whopping $677,000.

The events surrounding FTX have shaken the confidence of many. How did one of the largest crypto exchanges collapse so quickly? Why do meltdowns like this seem to keep happening?

At times like this, it helps to have a long-term view of web3 as a sector, not just a forward-looking long-term view, but also some perspective on where we have come from.

As longtime investors in web3 and board members (also individual shareholders) of Coinbase, one of the oldest and best-known companies in the space, we thought we might share some thoughts.

Web3 is a software-driven innovation that has a built-in financial system. This has been both a strength and a weakness. On the one hand, tokens enable developers and users to contribute to open-source protocols and participate in the economic upside of doing so, leading to strong developer communities. That’s been a positive relative to how software has been developed, monetized, and governed in the past. On the other hand, tokens lend themselves to boom/bust cycles and a sense by many that web3 is simply a speculative endeavor with no real substance behind it.

This perception is only reinforced by the companies and individuals who started web3 companies and projects with the exclusive intent of making a lot of money very quickly through leveraged trading and speculation, pumping and dumping, and, sometimes, outright fraud.

Most of the well-known meltdowns in web3, going all the way back to Mt Gox and including recent failures like 3AC, Celsius, and Alameda/FTX, have happened to centralized companies operating trading, lending, and speculating businesses. Many of the failures have been offshore and all of them were largely unregulated. These companies and their activities have given web3 a bad name. We have also seen high-profile decentralized projects, like Terra, fail due to flawed design but those failures happen out in the open in a transparent way that is much healthier than the way centralized companies fail.

Contrast that with regulated web3 businesses like Coinbase, Kraken, and Anchorage that operate in the US and you will see that the companies that have followed the rules and behaved properly have weathered these storms. Coinbase’s early innovation was creating a secure, easy-to-use, regulated bridge from fiat currencies to crypto and a safe place to store crypto assets. Coinbase provides a number of important services that have allowed the web3 ecosystem to grow and thrive.

The most important software innovation of the last decade, which started with the Bitcoin white paper fourteen years ago, is the emergence of open-source software and decentralized protocols that are the foundation of web3. These protocols have survived recent market volatility. It is the promise of software that is not controlled by a company, but instead by an open-source community with built-in safeguards and increased transparency relative to today’s tech and financial systems, that gives us so much confidence in the future of web3.

These web3 protocols are in active development for mainstream adoption and some key features are still missing. For example, blockchains as they were originally architected are public by default. This is not suitable for most applications. Imagine if your email, banking, and social data were public for everyone to see on a blockchain. Also, blockchains are slow and complex networks. Improvements to performance, scalability, and privacy are happening at the infrastructure level of the web3 technology stack. Emergent technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and rollups are starting to address these issues without compromising decentralization. These breakthroughs are still in the early stages of deployment among a small subset of developers. This is the kind of important work that happens behind the scenes without any coverage. But it is these developments that are preparing web3 for the mainstream.

Eventually, as the web3 infrastructure improves, the user experience gap between self-custody and storing assets on centralized entities will shrink. More users will feel comfortable self custodying their assets in software they control and managing the keys that provide access to their assets themselves. This is how many web3 users interact with decentralized applications, like NFT marketplaces, today.

When web3 becomes a credible alternative to web2 for the masses, large centralized companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Google will have to compete for access to our data thus redefining how we use the web. Software development will be more open-source and composable. And large financial institutions like banks and brokerage firms (which includes the FTXs of the world) will no longer control our assets and lend them out without our permission.

Ironically, web3 is about giving control of data and assets back to the people and taking it away from large centralized companies. But the transition from web2 to web3 has been slow and messy and many of the early web3 companies have been copycat versions of what came before them. That is where the risk has been in the web3 ecosystem and what we need to move away from.

The lesson of these recent events for policymakers should not be that web3 is bad and must be constrained. It should be that pushing innovation offshore is bad. We need trusted and well-regulated centralized entities to survive and thrive and we also need decentralized web3 protocols to flourish and provide a path to a fully decentralized web. Both are possible and the good news is we are already on a path toward both. We need to stay that course, provide for a healthy web3 sector in the US, and stop pushing US users to risky/shady offshore entities with unclear, uneven, and unfair policy actions.

This is another hard moment for web3 and we will see negative headlines about “crypto” for some time. But it’s important to remember that these headlines are all about the speculating/trading part of web3. The much more important underlying software innovation continues unabated. And that is what we remain so excited about and will continue to fund and champion.

223,Larry David's appearance in a Super Bowl Commercial as a crypto skeptic is going viral as crypto markets spiral.,blockchain,15/11/2022,https://s3.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/4/0/7/880407.jpg,cracked.com,"The world of cryptocurrency has been completely upended after the shocking collapse of FTX, a Bahamas-based company which was the world’s third largest crypto exchange before it plunged into bankruptcy this past Friday amid speculation of embezzlement and fraud on behalf of its CEO and founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Those who have been critical of the volatility of the crypto world and the arrogance of its most terminally online blockchain evangelists are now enjoying some delectable schadenfreude courtesy of an unlikely Nostradamus – Larry David.

FTX aired an ad during last year’s Super Bowl that featured the Seinfeld co-creator playing various historical naysayers as he shot down mankind’s greatest technical achievements. Almost 100 million viewers watched a doubtful David reject the wheel, the fork, the indoor toilet and the moon landing in a colorful array of period-appropriate outfits before the modern day star of Curb rejected a suggestion to use the FTX app to invest in crypto currency. The hilariously hubristic message “Don’t Be Like Larry” then flashes across the screen, which should have been followed by the Curb theme song and the “Directed By Robert B. Weide” credit.

In the span of just one week, FTX went from a $32 billion company at the front of the pack of the crypto market to a bankrupt and embattled business with a yet-to-be-accounted-for $8 billion shortfall after a run on deposits exposed the instability of the platform and sparked an industry-wide panic.

Investors were sold on crypto schemes by the simplistic and fantastical messaging found in promotions such as FTX’s Super Bowl commercial which promised that anyone who dumped their real-world money into the volatile crypto market was getting in on the ground floor of the future of the economy. Now, the smug crypto bros and disingenuous influencers who had been spreading fairytales of limitless returns to their gullible followers are being forced to face the reality that even the most respected and ostensibly stable crypto companies could simply be a house of cards. If only an Emmy-winning comedy icon had warned them about it during the most-watched event of the year, then maybe they wouldn't have lost all their money on ChungusCoin.

The FTX Super Bowl commercial has been getting mass-posted on crypto Twitter and in crypto-focused Discord servers since the warning signs about FTX’s future first appeared on November 6, when the company’s most vocal critic, Changpeng Zhao, a former investor in FTX, announced that he was selling all of his FTT, FTX’s flagship cryptocurrency. The sell-off that ensued resulted in the company’s collapse, and angry investors are now demanding an investigation into the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research, an investment firm founded by Bankman-Fried which had borrowed significant funds from FTX.

Six months ago, YouTuber Coffeezilla released the above video breaking down an interview with Bankman-Fried in which the FTX CEO basically described his company’s entire business model as one big Ponzi scheme. With investors now searching for that mysteriously absent $8 billion, this video is making the rounds next to David’s deliciously ironic FTX commercial, and the curmudgeonly comedian’s message of “I’m never wrong about this stuff” feels prudent and prescient.

Maybe we have to rethink this whole “wheel” thing after all = back to the mattress we go with our shekels.",Reminder: Larry David Predicted the FTX Crash,https://www.cracked.com/article_35992_reminder-larry-david-predicted-the-ftx-crash.html

Ethereum, the pioneering blockchain for innovative technologies such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, recently completed its much-anticipated Merge – sparking institutional interest and unlocking yield-generation opportunities via its proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain.

Miles Fuller is the head of government solutions at TaxBit. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.

As an emerging asset class, crypto raises many perplexing questions for investors and regulators alike. At the same time, an October poll conducted by the Crypto Council for Innovation indicated that a majority of U.S. voters want more crypto regulation and believe that lawmakers should treat cryptocurrency as a serious and valid part of the economy. But the lack of regulatory clarity has been a significant barrier when it comes to crypto adoption for both individuals and institutions.

In order to address this problem, we should seek to better understand a key component of regulation: taxes. Especially as they relate to NFTs, staking and yield farming.

How are NFTs taxed?

In November, Meta announced that Instagram will soon allow creators to mint and sell non-fungible tokens directly on the social platform. Reddit is helping take NFTs mainstream as well. Since opening its NFT marketplace in July, over 2.5 million new wallets have been created, and cumulative Reddit NFT sales have surpassed $6.5 million. As NFT initiatives by the world’s top enterprises continue to take flight, users should carefully consider the key tax implications:

NFTs are not taxable upon creation but are taxable when sold according to the fair market value (FMV) of the cash or cryptocurrency received.

The value of assets received upon the sale of an NFT is considered gross income that then may be reduced by costs related to the creation and sale (such as gas fees) of the NFT.

The resulting net income from the sale of NFTs is characterized as ordinary income for tax purposes and may also be subject to self-employment tax if the NFT creation activity rises to the level of a ""trade or business."" However, there are currently no clear rules or guidance for when NFT activity rises to the level of a “trade or business.” Traditionally, an activity needs to be conducted with continuity, regularity and an intent to make a profit in order to be considered a trade or business for tax purposes.

Commissions or royalties received from downstream resales of an NFT are almost certainly income, but there’s no official guidance on this yet.

The resale of an NFT would be a taxable sale of property similar to other cryptocurrencies (which are considered to be property under the tax code).

It is possible some NFTs could also potentially constitute a ""collectible"" for tax purposes, and would thus be subject to a higher tax rate of 28%. But there is currently no clear guidance from the IRS on when an NFT is considered a collectible, and existing law likely limits it to NFTs that are works of art.

How is staking taxed?

Given the historic upgrade of Ethereum to proof-of-stake, and that many leading exchanges offer custodial staking opportunities (such as ETH annual percent staking yields as high as 4-5%), questions about staking rewards are top of mind for many U.S. investors. There’s no official guidance on how staking should be taxed, but the Internal Revenue Service appears to view it as taxable according to the following points:

The initial act of staking crypto is likely not a taxable event in itself, although there is probably an exception with regard to ""liquid staking"" on Ethereum that gives you a fungible token in return for your staked ETH.

Delegation of units to a staker (such as staking via a pool versus solo staking) is also likely not taxable as long as only the staking rights are transferred by the delegator and not the actual units.

Units received from staking (via block rewards and transaction fees) are taxable upon receipt. In the case of Ethereum, staking rewards are currently locked and cannot be directly withdrawn, raising an open question as to whether the rewards should be taxed as income at fair market value (FMV) according to the moment of receipt or at fair market value only once they can be unlocked.

FMV is treated as the gross revenue from staking, and can also be reduced by costs of staking (such as the costs of running a dedicated node).

Net income is treated as ordinary income and may be subject to self-employment tax if the staking rises to the level of a “trade or business.” (Similar to what’s noted above for NFTs, this threshold is not yet officially defined.)

Often, units received will be treated as a capital asset in the hands of the recipient, meaning they will likely receive a favorable tax rate upon the latter-day sale.

Given the lack of official guidance, an alternative view has been posited that rewards received from staking are not taxable upon receipt. Instead, any rewards received from staking may not be taxable until the eventual sale. Upon eventual sale, the rewards would be taxable as ordinary income (rather than capital gains), so they will not receive a favorable tax rate.

This view was being litigated in federal court in Tennessee regarding Tezos staking rewards as part of a claim for a tax refund, but the government granted the refund and the case was dismissed. So, unless the IRS makes an express statement about the matter or it arises in litigation again, the issue will remain unresolved.

In the case of Ethereum staking rewards via a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the platform may issue a 1099-MISC to individuals and the IRS for users who earn at least $600 in “miscellaneous” income. Regardless of whether or not rewards can be unlocked, the safest path is likely to treat all rewards as income at fair market value according to the moment of receipt.

How is DeFi yield and liquidity farming taxed?

The 2022 U.S. individual income tax return prominently highlights “Digital Assets” for hundreds of millions of taxpayers to see. As part of the instructions, the 1040 Form says: “Check ‘Yes’ if at any time during 2022 you: Received new digital assets as a result of mining, staking, and similar activities.”

As discussed above, this question reveals that the IRS likely views the receipt of staking rewards as a taxable event. Separately, the inclusion of “similar activities” also indicates that the IRS likely views any receipt of a digital asset that was not made through a purchase with cash or exchange of other property as a taxable event. The language appears to encompass a wide array of income-generating activities, including DeFi activities such as yield farming and liquidity farming.

While there is no official guidance on the tax treatment of DeFi activities such as yield farming, there are key points to consider:

Depositing funds into a liquidity pool is likely a taxable event if control over the units is surrendered in exchange for a token received in return from the pool, particularly where the contribution is tied to the value contributed rather than the number of units contributed, exposing the individual to impermanent loss.

If the deposit into the pool was a taxable event, any exit or withdrawal from the pool will also be a taxable disposition of the token that was received from the pool.

Units received as yield are likely treated as ordinary income according to the fair market value of the units at the moment of receipt. The moment of receipt may be difficult to track because the receipt of units by a user is often tracked inside the smart contracts controlling the DeFi protocol and is only visible through a user interface rather than on a public blockchain. The user’s receipt of units only appears on the blockchain when the user actually withdraws the units from the DeFi protocol.

The lack of explicit guidance and the disconnect between the actual receipt of yield in DeFi and data reflecting that receipt for record-keeping purposes makes DeFi currently one of the more difficult aspects of digital asset taxation.

Although there are still many gray areas, crypto adoption is continuing at a remarkable pace. Individuals and institutions should carefully consider their tax obligations, and in the absence of official guidance, should consult tax professionals or take the most conservative approach so as to avoid costly audits in the future.

Some of this uncertainty should be resolved as the IRS continues to issue guidance. Proposed regulations implementing tax reporting rules for digital asset brokers will help clarify some of the tax rules and make things easier for taxpayers to report their taxes accurately.

The IRS recently identified tax guidance relating to digital asset transaction validation, including staking, as a priority during 2023. As the digital asset ecosystem continues to grow and the tokenized economy takes hold, it will be imperative for the IRS to, whenever possible, issue guidance clarifying the tax treatment of certain activities.","Understanding the Tax Implications of NFTs, Staking and Yield Farming",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/understanding-tax-implications-nfts-staking-222208914.html

Over the past few years, the world of cryptocurrencies has ballooned from a niche experiment to a sprawling, trillion-dollar financial sector, complete with its own heroes and villains and warring tribes.

You know it’s buzzy — Matt Damon and Tom Brady promoted it during the Super Bowl. And you know that it’s controversial because you don’t live under a rock. (See: the train wreck that is FTX)

But maybe you find yourself nodding along at parties when the conversation turns to the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire, or the merits of proof-of-stake versus proof-of-work. (Or better yet, maybe your parties aren’t dominated by insufferable nerds?)

At any rate, it’s 2022, and a lot of people still can’t really wrap their heads around cryptocurrencies. If you’re one of them, stick around. We’re breaking down what this industry is and why it matters, even if you have no intention of ever investing in it.

So, what is crypto?

The tl;dr version: Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital assets that are secured by a decentralized network of computers.

Unlike traditional “fiat” currencies, such as the euro or US dollar, cryptos reject the idea of being controlled by a central bank or government. The original crypto, bitcoin, emerged in 2009, out of the ashes of the worst financial crisis in modern history.

The pioneers of the digital currency world basically said, to heck with your government control, we want our own currency that can’t be manipulated by any one entity. (It’s that anti-establishment origin that makes some of the crypto faithful rather, shall we say, intense when they get a chance to talk about it.)

The term “crypto” harkens to the way the networks are secured, using cryptographic systems (think: really, really elaborate encryptions) that make the tokens virtually impossible to counterfeit. When we talk about “crypto,” we could be talking about the virtual tokens themselves, or the entire ecosystem of digital assets.

The blockchain

The other key ingredient to be familiar with is the blockchain. To save us all time, I’m going to dramatically oversimplify here: The blockchain is a digital public ledger that records transactions. It’s the record-keeping system upon which most cryptos are built.

“Think of the blockchain as a Google spreadsheet,” said Gareth Rhodes, former deputy superintendent at the New York State Department of Financial Services, who is now the managing director at research and advisory firm Pacific Street.

“If Gareth gives Allison $10, and Allison gives someone else that same $10, how do you know that Allison is giving those same $10 that she received from Gareth to her friend? You need some sort of way of verifying that every entry on that Google spreadsheet follows the one in front of it.”

Basically, there’s a vast community of auditors out there who are invested in the project (more on them in a minute).

Once the transaction is verified by the network it is stored — forever — in an immutable “block.”

Bottom line: Blockchain is the underlying technology of the crypto world. It’s the bones. And if you engage a crypto evangelist on it, you’re bound to get an earful about how it’s the most important technological innovation of our time.

And like, sure, people are starting to adopt blockchain systems outside the world of crypto, and they do seem to hold promise. Think about medical records — those need to be super secure but historically have been messy and inefficient to transfer. The global food supply is another area where a blockchain is making it easier for big food producers and distributors like Walmart to track items from farm to fork, and respond more quickly when contaminated items get into the mix.

But if I’m being honest, the hype around blockchain feels out of proportion to the use cases that have so far been laid out by its proponents.

If you want to dive deeper, the tech news site the Verge has a helpful article on blockchain here.

Where does crypto come from?

It may seem that crypto was invented out of thin air. To some extent, that’s true.

The bitcoin network went public in 2009, created by an anonymous developer (or group of developers) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

Fast forward to today, after several booms and busts, and that community is now a massive global network of very expensive, very powerful computers whose only function is to run algorithms that solve math problems in a process called mining.

Mining is a tricky concept — there are no headlamps or pick axes — so Rhodes suggests thinking of it as “auditing.”

“Mining is basically just a process through which people who are invested in securing and verifying the network verify those transactions” on the blockchain/Google spreadsheet, he said.

All the computers in the network are essentially racing toward a “target hash” — aka a really long numerical sequence — and the first computer to spit out the right sequence to match the target gets to create the new block, and is rewarded with bitcoin.

It’s basically a game with two functions: verifying transactions and putting new bitcoin into circulation. Another way to think of it is playing Powerball, where you have to match a set of numbers to win, and the more tickets you buy — or in the case of crypto the more hashes your computer can spit out — the better your chances of winning.

This computer competition is happening all the time, with a winner creating a new block in the chain roughly every 10 minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The whole process eats up a stupid amount of computing power, which is why you hear people saying bitcoin is an environmental disaster. That may be something of an exaggeration — and advocates are quick to note that traditional finance isn’t exactly a green business — but it’s absolutely true that mining requires a huge amount of power, much of which is derived from fossil fuels.

That’s one of the main arguments made by devotees of the second-largest crypto, ether, which uses a different protocol to verify transactions that is far less energy-intensive.

What can I buy with it?

LOL, not much. At the time of this writing, the number of things you can actually buy with crypto is growing, though it’s still very small. Some retailers and shopping platforms have warmed up to bitcoin — Home Depot, Overstock and Shopify, to name a few.

But the vast majority of retailers don’t accept it. Which kind of undermines its whole “currency” part of the cryptocurrency promise.

Then what can I do with it?

Most people who own crypto are treating it like an investment (albeit a speculative one).

The combination of FOMO and a bored populace stuck at home in the pandemic helped drive up demand for bitcoin and other tokens, a wave that peaked in late 2021. Since then, prices have cratered. Bitcoin has lost some 75% of its value since its high in November 2021. Ditto for ether.

If you’re thinking of investing, be prepared for wild and unpredictable swings in value. Crypto not for the faint of heart.

Sounds more like a stock than a currency…

Indeed! And the US regulator in charge of overseeing stock markets agrees.

Gary Gensler, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, earlier this year announced the agency was nearly doubling the size of its crypto department and warned that unregistered crypto exchanges may be operating “outside the law.” He’s also vowed to work with Congress to craft regulations for the industry.

That won’t happen overnight. Crypto is the Wild West, and writing rules for an industry founded on doing its own thing outside of government oversight is … complicated. As Bloomberg’s Matt Levine put it: “If you try to write all the rules from scratch in one go you will get things wrong. And then people will ruthlessly exploit whatever you get wrong.”

Is crypto a scam? Someone told me it was a scam…

Ah, good question. The answer is yes. And no.

Are there scams within crypto? 100%. There are also plenty of scams within traditional finance (or TradFi, in crypto lingo). In addition to just generally high-risk bets and shady companies with snappy names, there are actual crypto Ponzi schemes playing out.

But are all cryptos a scam? Probably not. There’s still plenty of debate about the utility of assets such as bitcoin and ethereum, and whether their grand vision for the future is one we all want to get on board with.

What is that vision? What is the point of all of this?

The potential utility of cryptos can be a difficult concept for Americans to grasp because the US has a very sophisticated financial system, Rhodes tells me. “We can put our money in the bank and we don’t have to worry about it.”

But things aren’t always so reliable in other parts of the world. “You have all these scenarios outside of the United States where government control over the financial system can give authoritarian regimes enormous power over citizenry, and also the mismanagement of some of these countries’ economies.”

Being decentralized puts the power, in theory, in the hands of the people.

To be sure, the technology isn’t there — yet. A person wanting to stash their money in bitcoin because the dictator running the economy is letting inflation run wild could do so, and they could trade it within the crytpo ecosystem.

The document was signed by its co-authors on Nov. 14, according to regional media.

The roadmap proposes a set of measures for promoting Web3, such as the launch of a regulatory sandbox for blockchain and Web3 projects, creation of a national blockchain-backed land and realty register, preparation of a “blockchain plan” to rebuild the country after the war, and integration of Ukraine into the European Blockchain Partnership.

VAU and Blockchain4Ukraine also intend to work on a self-sovereign identity pilot project and to seek ways of implementing blockchain into Ukraine’s healthcare and education systems.

The list of potential partners of the roadmap includes civil society and nongovernment organizations as well as business and scientific communities. The group working on the roadmap will prepare a set of bills to promote its initiatives on the legal level.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, CEO of VAU Konstantin Yarmolenko confirmed that the governmental memo on the roadmap ""is being prepared right now"" and will be signed between the Parliamentary Group ""Blockchain4Ukraine, Public Union VAU and Government of Ukraine.

In June, Ukraine became the third country outside of the European Union to join the European Blockchain Partnership, an initiative derived by the EU’s 27 member states to deliver cross-border public services. Back then, Yarmolenko revealed Ukraine’s interest in running test-node of the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure and pilot use cases of the cross-border public services based on blockchain technology.

In March 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed the country’s first major cryptocurrency-related legislation, the bill “On Virtual Assets.” The bill establishes the National Securities and Stock Market Commission of Ukraine and the National Bank of Ukraine as two major regulators of the crypto market. According to Yarmolenko, the bill will adopt some of the pan-European Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework's norms.

Dubai, UAE, Nov. 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- One of the most promising properties of blockchain has been the ability to fractionalise any underlying asset and share the ownership within multiple entities. The implementation of this idea and innovation was majorly restricted to the go-to asset class such as Real Estate, Art works and Commodities.

But with further scope and successful case-studies new asset classes are coming onto Web3 to turn those largely fragmented and centralised industries into more community-centric platforms. One such protocol emerging out is ShipFinex.

To encounter the conventional systems and central-authority dependent financial solutions in the Shipping Finance, ShipFinex is emerging out to revolutionise the trillion-dollar Maritime economy. Started with their launch in July, 2022, they have been able to steer the way to attract sizable traction and are on an eventful spree.

Beginning by participating in community events from India Blockchain Week, Fintech Festival to making their presence at the world stage in Token 2049, Singapore; Fintech Blockchain Summit, Dubai and lastly leaving a big mark at the World Blockchain Summit, Dubai at the Startup World Cup organized by Pegasus Tech Ventures.

The Startup World Cup is a world-renowned competition inviting regional winners from over 70+ countries to compete for a prestigious title of “Best Startup”. The regional chapter for the year 2023 finale started with a bang, showcasing 16 enterprising Startups from the field of Artificial Intelligence, IoT, Food Tech, Development Infrastructure Metaverse and Real-World Asset Tokenisation.

The jury for the Startup World Cup Pitch competition featured an esteemed panel with the likes of Vinnet Budki (Managing Partner & CEO, Cypher Capital), Alexander Fazel (Chief Partnership Officer at SwissBorg), Ajeet Khurana (Founder Reflexical, Ex CEO-Zebpay) bringing together over 100+ experience of running successful tech enterprises and venture capital firms.

Story continues

Over 16 projects shared the stage with ShipFinex and while all of them had an amazing concept, ShipFinex stood out with its vision of decentralising the Maritime economy and alternative asset investment space and introducing Maritime Assets on-chain. Key components of this positioning were the vision to enable decentralisation in the Maritime sector and the infrastructure layer of real-world asset tokenisation ShipFinex is creating.

ShipFinex is creating a convergence between 2 trillion-dollar markets, converging the two industries into a single solution through a multi-layer infrastructure setup, bringing tokenisation of assets in the maritime industry to address the liquidity flow in the maritime economy, making shipping assets accessible for everyone through Web3-based tools.

According to Vikas Pandey, COO & Co-Founder of ShipFinex

“The overwhelming response received from over 500 attendees as well as the organisers of the event motivated us even further in our mission. We are thrilled to have won the Regional Startup World Cup Pitch Competition and could not be more thankful for the support of the whole Trescon and World Blockchain Summit to conduct this eventful night, bringing together the most sought-after Web3 and Tech community.”

Mr.Jagdish Pandya, Founder of BlockOn Capital , who has incubated many early-stage projects including ShipFinex added

“ShipFinex is the kind of project that uncovers the true potential and purpose of Blockchain technology. In the midst of all the hype and assumptions, we need solutions like ShipFinex to create global impact through real-life use cases. I am excited to see a potential unicorn in Shipfinex and be a part of their progress and entire journey.”

After winning the Regional Chapter in Dubai, ShipFinex Team will fly to San Francisco to participate in the Final Chapter of the Startup World Cup Pitch Competition for the mega prize of $1M and showcase how far along they can take the concept of real-world asset tokenisation and bridge the gap in Shipping Finance through their groundbreaking Web3 solution.

Market beaters in the last two decades have come from e-commerce, electric vehicles, streaming, and more. But what businesses are set to be disrupted today?

The three companies that I think have disruptive potential are Spotify (SPOT 4.00%) in audio, Coinbase (COIN 5.02%) in Web3, and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 2.39%) in space tourism and travel.

Spotify

Most people know Spotify as a place where they listen to music, but the company's true disruption comes from podcasts. Podcasts have the potential to disrupt radio, news, and even other video apps.

Spotify starts with the idea of ""owning your ears"" with music, podcasts, and, most recently, audio books. Its initial business model involves charging a monthly fee to listen to music and collecting revenue from ads for members using the free ad-supported tier. However, Spotify's future aim is to be a platform for creators to build podcasts and monetize what they create, while owning the user experience as well.

To execute this strategy, the company has built and acquired creator tools like Anchor for podcasting. Once both creators and listeners are on the platform, the challenge is monetizing the business somehow.

Where Spotify could be building a very durable competitive advantage is in advertising. In the most recent quarter, ad revenue was up 24% from a year ago to $273 million, which is a small but quickly growing base. If Spotify can both target ads more effectively and increase spending on its platform, the business could be extremely disruptive.

YouTube showed that creators will build a business on a company's platform if they're given a way to monetize. Spotify could do what YouTube did, but for the ear, which is a market that's still in major need of disruption.

Coinbase

The last week has been chaotic for the crypto industry, with major exchange FTX filing for bankruptcy on Friday. That's a major blow for the industry, though possibly good for Coinbase, which is going to absorb some of FTX's customers. If the world is ever going to use cryptocurrency or the blockchain in a meaningful way, I think Coinbase will be key to the industry.

It's easy to see Coinbase as a company reliant on a volatile exchange business, but in the third quarter it generated $210.5 million from subscriptions and services (up 45% year over year) and $365.9 million in trading revenue (down 66% year over year). Services need to grow significantly to drive profitability, but with more institutions getting involved, security needs rising, and cloud-services demand growing, the company has a chance to take an important place in the market.

The disruption Coinbase brings is in abstracting away a lot of what the blockchain and crypto are today. I think the future isn't about people having their own wallets or convoluted sign-in pages for non-fungible token (NFT) holders; it'll look more like ""Sign in with Coinbase"" to see your digital assets. This would allow the company to be an identity, financial, and cloud solution for the next generation of internet companies. If Coinbase succeeds, it'll be a massive win for investors.

Virgin Galactic

If any company can make a trip to space attainable for the average person, it will be incredibly disruptive. Virgin Galactic is closer than any company before it, and has already flown civilians into space.

After a number of delays, the company plans to launch commercial operations for its space tourism business in the second quarter of 2023. Tickets for a flight could be over $400,000, and the company hopes to ramp up both flight frequency and the number of spaceports it has in the coming years.

The challenge is that we don't know the upside of this business. The company has a $1.5 billion market cap, and if it can hit the goal of 1,565 passengers flown per year set forth in its special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) documents, this could be a business with over $600 million in annual revenue.

Space tourism and any disruption that comes after that (like mach speed travel) are highly risky, but that's part of investing in disruptive companies. Of the three, this is the one with the most potential and the highest probability of not getting off the ground.

Risk and reward from disruptive stocks

The audio space, cryptocurrencies, and space travel are in need of disruption, and these three companies are leaders in the disruptor space. That means they have big potential markets and could be huge winners for investors. But with big rewards come big risk, so be aware that not all disruptors come out on top in the end.",3 Disruptors I Love Right Now,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/3-disruptors-i-love-right-now/

Revenue grew by 515% to $41,815 for the second fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 over the previous quarter. The growth was driven by an 840% increase in the number of transactions processed in fiscal Q2 vs. fiscal Q1. Fiscal Q2 revenue was higher than the previous four quarters combined.

Management Commentary

“We are very pleased with our over 5-fold increase in revenue for the quarter, which is being driven by our recent acceleration in transactions, which we expect to see continue for the foreseeable future,” said Peter Jensen, Chief Executive Officer of RocketFuel.

“As more and more of our payment partners’ merchants go live, we saw the number of crypto payment transactions grow exponentially, resulting in a significant increase in revenue from the previous quarters. Our sales strategy of selling indirectly through payment service providers and other partners is paying off. Our E-Commerce transactions were up 840% from fiscal Q1 to fiscal Q2 and transaction growth accelerated toward the end of the quarter and has continued since.

“We had an increased number of merchants go live in the quarter, including at least one with over $1 billion in overall revenue. As soon as they turned on the ability to pay with crypto, we immediately saw some of their customers switch from paying with credit card to crypto and the transactions started rolling in. As more and more of their shoppers see the benefits of paying with their cryptocurrencies over credit cards, our share of this overall $1 billion revenue will increase. We are following the same proven model for startups such as Amazon, Salesforce and others by focusing on revenue and growth. And we’re seeing it work. As our business progresses, our team is also moving forward with our capital markets strategy in order to increase our visibility, awareness and shareholder value,” Jensen concluded.

During the same period, the company’s net income also decreased from $59.8 million in the prior year’s quarter to a loss of $37 million.

Hive Blockchain’s net income was notably higher than its revenue in Q2 2022, as the company also recognized over $22 million worth of gains on the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) it mined. Although the company did not suffer material capital losses on coins in Q2 2023, it did, however, record a $26.2 million impairment expense to its mining rigs.

The company’s losses appear to have intensified even though its Bitcoin mining capabilities have further scaled. Year over year, Hive Blockchain mined 31% more BTC than in Q2 2022 for a total of 858 coins, which still has more value after accounting for a 15.9% year-over-year decline in its ETH mining, which amounted to 7,309 coins in the quarter.

The overall production increase was attributed to the opening of the firm’s New Brunswick Bitcoin mining facility over the past 12 months, which brought over 17,300 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners online. Expressing his optimism about the company’s operations, executive chairman Frank Holmes commented:

“Strategically, we have not borrowed expensive debt against our mining equipment or pledged our Bitcoins for costly loans, thus our balance sheet remains healthy to weather this storm. We believe our low coupon fixed debt; attractive green renewable energy prices and high performing energy efficient ASIC chips will help us navigate through this crypto winter.”

However, the company has warned of higher operating expenses going forward due to record-high mining difficulty. Currently, Hive Blockchain encompasses approximately 0.85% of the Bitcoin network’s hash rate. At the quarter’s end, Hive Blockchain reported holding 1,116 BTC, worth $48.4 million, and 25,154 ETH, worth $74.7 million, on its balance sheet.",Hive Blockchain revenue declines by 44% Y/Y despite overall mining production surge,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hive-blockchain-revenue-declines-by-44-y-y-despite-overall-mining-production-surge

While traditional banks have successfully earned customer loyalties and successes over the years, in today's times customer experience plays a much more significant role than anything else. And, this is where fintech comes in. India is home to 20+ fintech unicorns, and the fintech industry is expected to reach $1 trillion in throughput and $200 billion in revenue by 2030. Like every other startup, fintech needs tech too, but they have a different kind of approach towards it, owing to the involvement of huge financial data.

In the frame: Souparno Bagchi, COO, Balancehero India, Hardika Shah, Founder and CEO, Kinara Capital (Online), Amit Tyagi, CEO, Payworld Sumit Chhazed, Co-founder and CEO, OTO

According to Souparno Bagchi, COO, Balancehero India, there are fundamentally two things which are very different in the fintech space deep domain orientation and having a good understanding of the regulatory expectation. ""Any product which is coming across deep domain orientation be it from the aspect of safety, responsibility, regulation put together, if you are not imbibing, it is going to be difficult to build a good product which a consumer

is looking for.""

Says Hardika Shah, Founder and CEO, Kinara Capital, ""Regulator is bringing in control. But even though we are a fintech, we are building a newer version of old school so that regulatory frameworks remains intact. One must understand that we want to work with the regulator.""

Amit Tyagi, CEO, Payworld, opines, ""If you are a consumer tech startup, it is you and the

consumer by default. But in fintech, you work with regulators, other industry participants and consumers.

If your head is not in the right space, the regulator ensures that there is no starting of

the business unless you have got the basics sorted from the security and consumer perspective.""

But what about disruptive technologies like blockchain in fintech? Industry insiders say that blockchain technologies with wider use cases is going to really amplify the trust quotient in the sector. Sumit Chhazed, Co-founder and CEO, OTO, says, ""Fundamentally there are three things for-any technology to thrive-trust and transparency, making processes more efficient, reducing the cost. In blockchain the cost of running the payment decision is getting lower. When it comes to assets, blockchain can give real time access to data. There is a lot more trust and transparency.

Fintech companies have made money accessible for all. Says Pallavi Shrivastave, Co-founder & Director, Progcap, ""There has been openness from the regulator side to explore and let fintech

experiment. Concus Chitresh Sharma, CEO & Co-founder, Refyne ""We are taking

financial wellness to the last mile. And when you do that you are servicing 93% of the

crowd who are not used to credit scores .

Another interesting aspect of the fintech industry is the payment system, its subset. One example of this is UPI. ""It is here for multiple reasons-ease of payment from customer point of view to zero MDR (merchant discount rates) for merchants,""says Krishnan Vishwantahan,

240,FTX's stunning meltdown last week is forcing lawmakers and regulators who bought into the vision to regroup.,blockchain,15/11/2022,https://static.politico.com/50/ab/82459c47404f9f79906bf1d7a33a/gettyimages-1440504626-594x594.jpg,politico,"“It is crucial that we develop a clear understanding of the chain of events and management failures that led to this collapse,” said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), one of the industry’s most vocal skeptics on Capitol Hill. “To date, efforts by billionaire crypto bros to deter meaningful legislation by flooding Washington with millions of dollars in campaign contributions and lobbying spending have been effective.”

Finger-pointing over who failed to see the collapse coming has regulators playing defense and warning that there was nothing they could have done because FTX’s parent company is offshore. The chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday said it was urgent that Congress pass legislation to empower his agency.

“We don’t have the luxury of time anymore,” CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said. “If we wait, we’re just going to be waiting for the next crisis.”

The tumult has the potential to upend the Washington crypto debate as industry champions find their influence diminished. Crypto critics like Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whose warnings about the industry’s excesses were on the verge of being drowned out by its cheerleaders, are trying to leverage the moment to crack down on what’s left of the ailing industry.

“My focus has always been on the fraud, scams, volatility and outright theft in the crypto industry,” Brown said in a statement Monday. “FTX’s bankruptcy and the many other recent instances of instability have proved why we need a comprehensive regulatory approach that protects consumers and our economy from the risks of crypto.”

The crisis — which includes allegations of potential fraud, misused customer accounts and, by Bankman-Fried’s own admission, terrible internal accounting practices — is threatening to derail legislation that startups in the digital asset industry had championed.

One FTX-backed bill from the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee would give the CFTC — the smaller sister agency to the Securities and Exchange Commission — broad oversight over digital currency exchanges and brokerages. The legislation was poised for a committee vote in the coming weeks, in what would have been a huge victory for crypto interests trying to avoid regulation by the SEC. Lobbyists now believe the legislation has been delayed, after Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas, the lead Republican co-sponsor, said it was undergoing a “top-down look” in the wake of the FTX collapse.

FTX had lobbied heavily in support of the bill from Boozman and Senate Agriculture Chair Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). Congressional staff also drafted the bill in consultation with leaders at the CFTC.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who may be vindicated after spending much of the Biden era warning of crypto’s risk to consumers, said after FTX’s collapse that the bill is “too light-touch” and cited the company’s support for the proposal. The legislation would let crypto trading platforms make their own determination — through a process known as self-certification — if the tokens on their platforms comply with financial regulations.

“This is really a chance to look hard in the mirror and say, ‘Are the proposals that we’re putting forward here the right ones or are they a proposal that’s been flawed from the start?’” said Americans for Financial Reform senior policy analyst Mark Hays, who advocates for tougher crypto regulation. “If it’s the latter, they need to go back to the drawing board.”

While Stabenow and Boozman have said they’d like to move forward with the bill, it now faces intense opposition from consumer advocacy groups that have blasted the measure as an example of FTX’s political influence. Other crypto industry players — including the Blockchain Association, the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz and the DeFi Education Fund — had also raised objections to the bill because it would restrict decentralized finance networks while empowering centralized operations like FTX.

“It’s still too hard to get anything done anytime soon,” said one lobbyist who requested anonymity to speak frankly about negotiations over the bill. “There’s going to be more contagion. They’re going to have to make changes as we get more facts. More companies are going to go under. I just don’t see it happening in the lame duck.”

The episode is thrusting the CFTC’s role into the spotlight, amid questions about its response to the FTX debacle and whether it should be granted new authority to oversee the industry.

Behnam, who served as an aide to Stabenow before taking the helm of the agency, said lawmakers need to give the CFTC more power to regulate digital asset markets. He made the pitch as one prominent consumer advocacy group — Better Markets — said the agency “failed miserably” at supervising FTX’s Bahamas-based parent company via regulation of FTX’s U.S.-based subsidiary. Reports that Bankman-Fried’s business empire tapped into FTX customer funds echoed the 2011 MF Global bankruptcy, a mishap that occurred on the agency’s watch.

Before FTX’s bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried and FTX U.S. head of policy Mark Wetjen — the CFTC’s former acting chair — had been lobbying the agency to sign off on a plan that would have allowed the company to loan money to retail investors for round-the-clock crypto trades. Wetjen late last week removed the company from his LinkedIn profile and deleted his Twitter account, which had included his title.

Behnam said the problem was that the CFTC lacked the ability to police the activities of the central FTX operation in the Bahamas. The CFTC’s international reach has been a contentious policy debate since Congress expanded its authority in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when offshore derivatives trading by AIG nearly toppled the insurer.

“We don’t have the authority to go past the regulated entity itself,” Behnam said, referring to U.S. firms under its jurisdiction. “But those are the types of questions that we have to ask to see what those non-U.S. entities are, what those relationships are like, and whether or not we want to pierce through those.”","Crypto giant’s failure exposes cozy Washington ties, weak regulation",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/14/crypto-exchange-ftx-regulation-bankman-fried-00066815

Major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Huobi, OKX and Crypto.com have made efforts to share details of their assets and portfolios to assuage the wider space. This comes after investor confidence has been shaken, with users across the ecosystem moving Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens off exchanges to avoid potential contagion from the FTX fallout.

Blockchain analytics platform Nansen provides industry insights and is known for its wallet-labeling features that track addresses across multiple blockchains. In a series of tweets posted on Nov. 15, Nansen listed seven major exchanges, their relevant portfolios and explanatory statements of accounts.

The assets and net worth of the exchanges are the sum of holdings in wallet addresses provided by the firms on blockchains that Nansen monitors. The analytics platform also notes that the figures are not an “exhaustive or complete statement of the actual assets/reserves held.”

The exchanges accounted for include Binance, Crypto.com, OKX, KuCoin, Deribit, Bitfinex and Huobi.

Binance, widely regarded as the largest global exchange by transaction volume, holds around $64.3 billion worth of assets across the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron and BNB Chain blockchains. This eclipses the other exchanges by a substantial amount.

Bitfinex has the second-largest asset holdings in reserve of the seven exchanges, according to data provided by the company. $8.23 billion of assets are held across the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, Solana, Acala, Avalanche, Cosmos, Fantom, Near, Terra and Terra Classic blockchains.

Huobi’s assets amount to a traced $3.3 billion across eight different chains. OKX reportedly holds $5.84 billion in cryptocurrency assets across the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Tron and Avalanche blockchains.

Crypto.com holds an estimated $2.36 billion in assets across seven chains. KuCoin addresses account for $2.65 billion in assets on eight different blockchains, and Deribit holds around $1.46 billion worth of assets on the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

Que la escena de los NFT esté por los suelos no significa que todo haya terminado. De hecho, hay compañías que consideran alguna posibilidad a futuro para este tipo de tokens digitales y mientras esperan a que eso suceda (o no) ya tienen planes registrados. Muestra de lo anterior es una patente de Sony | PlayStation relacionada con estos polémicos activos digitales, algo que al menos por ahora desagrada a un sector de jugadores.

PlayStation ya marca terreno para el futuro de los NFT

Un reporte de VGC compartió información sobre una patente de Sony publicada en la Oficina de Marcas y Patentes el pasado 10 de noviembre, la cual propone un sistema de NFT y Blockchain que podría aplicarse en el ecosistema de PlayStation. La patente lleva por nombre ""Seguimiento de Activos Digitales Únicos en un Juego Mediante Tokens en un Registro Distribuido"".

De acuerdo con la descripción del registro, esta patente propone un sistema de reconocimiento y seguimiento de NFT vinculados con la cuenta de un usuario con todos los activos creados o adquiridos por distintas vías pero siempre relacionados con los videojuegos.

Sony piensa en los NFT desde la perspectiva de los coleccionistas de artículos deportivos

Según Sony, en este momento el ecosistema de videojuegos no cuenta con tecnología acorde a las operaciones de NFT y Blockchain, por lo que su propuesta es una estructura de reconocimiento y seguimiento en caso de que los tokens tengan presencia en experiencias de gaming o streaming.

Al respecto, la compañía japonesa señala el valor que van ganando los NFT haciendo una comparativa con los coleccionistas de objetos deportivos: ""las personas a menudo encuentran significativo poseer o usar artículos físicos únicos relacionados con celebridades o actividades respetadas. Por ejemplo, los fanáticos del hábil jugador de béisbol Babe Ruth, o del béisbol en general, a menudo buscan comprar y poseer pelotas de béisbol autografiadas por Babe Ruth, pelotas de béisbol golpeadas por Babe Ruth en un juego de béisbol importante, tarjetas intercambiables que representan a Babe Ruth y similares"".

En ese sentido, el sistema presentado en esta patente confirmaría a poseedores e interesados en un NFT que se trata de un token legítimo susceptible a operaciones relacionadas con criptomonedas y respaldadas por tecnología de cadena de bloques.

Como toda patente, esto es una idea que podría o no hacerse realidad, sin embargo no hay que olvidar que Sony en la era actual de PlayStation 5 y con la renovación de PS Plus, creó el programa PlayStation Stars que entre otras cosas cuenta con piezas digitales inspiradas en la historia de la compañía y relacionadas con la cuenta de usuario,

Continuation of the development strategy focused on various Web3.0 and AlphaVerse pillars, with the implementation of new universes and partnerships notably in football

CRYPTO BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRIES (""CBI"", Euronext Growth Paris: FR00140062P9 - ALCBI) announces its preliminary consolidated results for the first half of the 2022-2023 financial year, ending September 30, 2022. The results under audit were reviewed by the Board of Directors on November 2022. The audit procedures for the consolidated financial statements are being finalized. The auditors' limited review report will be published in the half-yearly financial report 2022-2023.

Frédéric Chesnais, Chairman and CEO, said: ""These first six months have been very important in laying the foundation for the development of AlphaVerse and we are delighted to have been able to test the core part of our virtual world with first-time users. With careful design and innovative technologies, we have secured important partnerships, notably in the field of music, digital art and charitable organizations and caritative programs. With our open and connected Web3.0 platform, we are able to offer a variety of experiences: games, content sharing, NFT creation and exchange, and many community management solutions. We are now working on developing partnerships in the field of sport, and in particular football, which has its own place within AlphaVerse. To ensure broad accessibility, access to AlphaVerse is open to all. Prior acquisition of crypto-currencies is not a prerequisite. Similarly, we also offer microtransactions in traditional currencies as much as possible, an essential feature to capture a large number of users and modulate our development according to the fluctuations of the blockchain industry.”

CBI: Strategy and development of a connected and open virtual world

The core of the business is currently focused on the development of AlphaVerse, a well-designed and feature-rich digital virtual world. AlphaVerse is organized around a central place, the ""Hub"", which connects many worlds in the field of games and entertainment. AlphaVerse is an open and versatile Web3.0 online platform that offers gaming and interaction experiences, as well as content creation and sharing. AlphaVerse operates on the traditional side with payments in traditional currencies, and on the blockchain side with major cryptocurrencies as well as the Crystal token, AlphaVerse's cryptocurrency. 600 million units of the Crystal token have been created on the blockchain with first private sales already completed for US$ 1.8 million on a valuation basis of US$ 50.0 million for all Crystal tokens (i.e. US$ 0.083 per Crystal token).

Some universes are developed by CBI for its own account, others are developed by CBI in association with partners, and others by third parties with a view to being linked to AlphaVerse through the Hub. The Hub was first opened in September 2022 for a test phase, which generated a lot of positive and rewarding feedback. After an initial development phase during which priority was given to video games, music and the associative world, all of which are major fields with large international communities, the following universes are currently being developed:

MetaCoaster: a blockchain-based theme park simulation game. Users will be able to play solo to hone their skills or participate in global park building competitions and win cryptos.

United At Home // Beat AlphaVerse: a universe dedicated to electronic music and philanthropy developed for and with the famous DJ and music producer David Guetta, in particular to deploy his charity programme ""United at Home"" in the metaverse.

HorYou AlphaVerse : a metaverse dedicated to social good, sustainability and the fight against climate change. Built in partnership with the Horyou social network and the Horyou Foundation.

Qtopia AlphaVerse: a social metaverse for the LGBTQ community and its allies to connect to each other and to trusted brands. In Qtopia, users can participate in activities, events and mini-games while giving back to charities important to the community.

Artech AlphaVerse: Those nostalgic for the digital works of the 90s will find their place in Artech. Artech is a metaverse entirely dedicated to digital art and artists, where we create a whole digital art ecosystem with artists, galleries, events and exhibitions through the use of NFT and blockchain technology.

Chi Modu AlphaVerse: this metaverse provides a virtual space dedicated to the life and work of Chi Modu, a legendary photographer, where emerging artists can find the inspiration and resources to pursue their dreams while giving back to the community.

Xave World: Xave AlphaVerse immerses the user in an ever-expanding and evolving open virtual world, where music fans discover a new world filled with music, incredible shows, festivals and events. This metaverse is being acquired by CBI, for $1 million paid mainly in CBI shares and an earn out clause.

Chain Games: Chain Games is a blockchain-integrated gaming network that offers decentralized skill games, Skill-Based and Play-to-Earn contests, allowing players to earn crypto-currencies for their efforts.

Rave-Age: Rave-Age is dedicated to the rave and electronic music community, its history, key figures and the latest industry news. Visitors to the Rave-Age AlphaVerse will be able to watch videos, collect NFTs and share experiences and content related to rave culture and electronic music. Users will be able to organize artistic events, such as festivals, concerts and exhibitions around the rave culture and electronic music community.

Apex Islands: Apex AlphaVerse is a digital animal sanctuary powered by the metaverse where the public can purchase digital artworks (NFTs) based on powerful animals, both living and extinct. This world is owned, developed and operated by Very Rare, LLC.

In addition to AlphaVerse, CBI invests and shares its expertise in various projects related to blockchain technology. In particular, CBI has invested in four companies: two premium video games that are being adapted to incorporate blockchain technologies (OP Productions, LLC and Free Reign East, LLC), a transportation marketplace company developing a blockchain-based solution (National Carrier Exchange), and a talent management agency (Blockchain Artists Agency) that works with celebrities from all walks of life to develop their image on blockchain, notably through NFTs and community animation tools.

Highlights of the first half of the 2022-2023 financial year

Highlights of the first half of the 2022-2023 financial year, ending on September 30, 2022, are as follows:

On July 26, 2022, CBI entered into a partnership agreement with Chain Games, publisher of Skill-Based and Play-to-Earn games, for the creation of dedicated spaces for its games and the development of content in the AlphaVerse, in exchange for a license fee of US$ 2 million paid by Chain Games to CBI.

CBI and Chain Games have entered into a series of agreements, under which:

(i) the Company sold to Chain Games the right to own space in the Hub, for US$ 2 million paid by Chain Games in CHAIN tokens;

(ii) the Company and Chain Games have agreed to share future revenue generated in this Hub space;

(iii) Chain Games has agreed to develop a separate world, with the Company being entitled to receive a portion of the revenue generated by that separate world;

3. Loan agreement for 5,000,000 CBI shares

On July 29, 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement for 5 million CBI shares with its main shareholders, Ker Ventures, SARL. The loan is short-term, valued at EUR 5 million and bears interest at 2% per annum. It is a regulated agreement. This loan agreement has not yet been implemented and will be implemented as and when required by the Company.

4. Change of listing compartment

On August 3, 2022 CBI was able to transfer its shares from the E1 listing group (private placement) to E2 (public offering) on the Euronext Growth Paris market. This transfer was carried out by way of direct admission and did not involve the issue of new shares or the placement of existing shares.

5. Amendment to the liquidity contract with TSAF

200,000 in cash was withdrawn from the liquidity contract at TSAF on September 5, 2022.

6. Opening of the AlphaVerse

7. Conflict between Ukraine and Russia

Crypto Blockchain Industries (CBI) is not exposed to the situation in Russia and Ukraine. CBI has no suppliers, customers, employees, affiliates or financial ties to Russia and Ukraine.

Events after the balance sheet date

As of the date of this press release, the following events occurred after the end of the period:

1. Proposed acquisition of Xave World

Upon completion of the acquisition of Xave world, a music-centric metaverse, will become part of AlphaVerse. Xave world will offer a wide range of features and experiences: communities, NFT marketplace, concerts, recordings and a dedicated cryptocurrency. With this acquisition, CBI continues to strengthen its footprint in the music space. The purchase price is €1.0 million: €0.1 million in cash and €0.9 million paid in CBI shares to be issued, valued at €1.0 for each CBI share. The acquisition is expected to be completed by March 31, 2023.

2. Risk factors

The Company has decided to draw the public's attention to the inflationary risk and will detail the exposure and management of this risk in its Half Yearly Financial Report 2022-2023. The Company's exposure to this risk is medium.

The Company has decided to draw the public's attention to the risk of bankruptcy of trading platforms, and will detail this in its 2022-2023 Half Year Financial Report. The Company does not deposit any of its crypto assets on exchange platforms held by third parties, so the Company's exposure to this risk is nonexistent.

Preliminary consolidated accounts for the first half of the 2022-2023 financial year

The preliminary consolidated financial statements as at September 30, 2022 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS accounting principles and standards. In particular, they include the activities of the operating companies Crypto Blockchain Industries, SA, OP Productions, LLC and Free Reign East, LLC from April 1, 2022 to September 30, 2022. The figures in the tables in this press release are rounded to thousands of euros.

PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT





Analysis of preliminary consolidated results

At September 30, 2022, CBI recorded preliminary revenue of €2,395.5k, mainly from licenses and services concluded with partners Chain Games and Cornucopias.

Over the 6 months of commercial activities, the revenue from the sale of NFTs and tokens is mainly derived from sales or pre-sales made for AlphaVerse, with Chain Games and Horyou AlphaVerse in particular.

The pro forma gross margin was 98.64% of revenue for the period.

Preliminary research and development costs of €538.9K are related to the operation and development of AlphaVerse. The Company mobilizes significant external resources, including 3 independent studios, specialized in the development of blockchain-based worlds and innovative video games. This allows to keep a flexible cost structure and to benefit from a pool of skills adapted to the pace of AlphaVerse’s development. Concerning the metaverse, the value of the intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not given rise to amortization as of September 30, 2022, as this amortization starts at the opening of the metaverse.

Preliminary marketing and sales expenses of €667.0K include the promotion of AlphaVerse through the launch of online marketing campaigns. Expenses for the period are also related to the OP Productions game.

Preliminary general and administrative expenses for the period mainly reflect the salaries of the management and holding staff (6 full-time equivalents), as well as general expenses related to the listing of the Company’s shares on the Euronext Growth market.

The preliminary operating profit from ordinary activities for the first half of the year, at €587.8K, or 24.5% of revenue, reflects the increased development of the activities, particularly AlphaVerse.

Other income and expenses in the amount of €(1,243.0) K consist of the depreciation of crypto-currency inventories and tokens valued at the closing price of September 30, 2022, in connection with the change in the value of its assets over the period. After taking this impairment into account, preliminary operating income was €(655.2)K, compared to €134.9 K for the same period last year.

Preliminary consolidated financial expenses reflect interest on the Ker Ventures loan at the legal rate and IFRS 16 restatements relating to rents. Preliminary consolidated financial income mainly reflects capital gains realized by the investment services provider TSAF in the context of the CBI share liquidity contract. Preliminary consolidated minority interests represent the amount attributable to the 23% owners of OP Productions, LLC and Free Reign East, LLC and amounted to €2.1k for the period.

The preliminary consolidated net result (Group share) for the period amounts to a net loss of (694.7) K€, compared to a profit of 96.3 K€ for the same period of the previous financial year, in a phase of increasing activity and projects, which will strengthen the commercial activity as they progress.

PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

Analysis of the preliminary consolidated balance sheet

Amounts invested in the development of the games and the metaverse are capitalized and then amortized from the time they are brought into use. The value of the intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not been amortized as at September 30, 2022. This amortization will start at the opening of the metaverse after the test phase. Thus, as at September 30, 2022, preliminary consolidated intangible assets amounted to €11.5m, compared with €11.0m as at March 31, 2022.

The portfolio of shares and financial instruments is unlisted and valued on the basis of the contribution value, i.e. €8.1m for this first half.

The inventory of cryptocurrencies is initially recognized on the basis of the acquisition price. At the accounting year end, each cryptocurrency is then valued based on the volume weighted average price at that date to reflect the value of each cryptocurrency and the overall portfolio. If the cost price of a cryptocurrency is less than its market value, no unrealized gain is recognized. If the cost price of a cryptocurrency is higher than its market value, an impairment is recognized in the income statement. It is reflected in this first half-year in the category of operating ""Other income and expenses"".





The Company has not deposited its assets on any trading platform. They are retained in the Company's own wallets.

Preliminary consolidated equity, Group Share, amounts to €16.7m as at September 30, 2022. The change is due to the profit for the year 2021-2022, the asset contributions made by Ker Ventures, EURL during the period, the October 2021 private placement of shares, all reduced by the redemption price of the warrant issued to the Atari Group, as part of the agreement of March 30, 2022.

Preliminary consolidated net cash / financial liabilities

At September 30, 2022, the Group had €582.7k in cash and cash equivalents.

IFRS 16 (restatement of leases) has been applied and has resulted in the recognition of assets of €2,104.7k and liabilities of €2,134.7k (of which €1,894.6k is long term and the balance short term).

Outlook for the year 2022-2023 (ending March 31, 2023)

CBI intends to continue to develop AlphaVerse to become one of the leading Web3.0 players worldwide.

For the 2022-2023 financial year, CBI's objective is to achieve significant growth in its community, which will ensure the growth of its future activities. Revenue and profit levels for 2022-2023 will depend on the pace at which the universes are opened and the progress of pre-sales of NFTs linked to these universes. In a highly volatile market, these levels are difficult to predict at this stage. All employees are focused on the development of AlphaVerse, both technologically and in the implementation of new partnerships, particularly in the field of football.

Disclaimer:

The realisation of projects, as well as their operational budget and financing plan, remain fundamentally subject to uncertainties, and the non-realisation of the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of assets and liabilities.

The crypto industry’s very own “Lehman Brothers moment” pushed regulators to react. United States Senator Cynthia Lummis, famous for her openly pro-crypto position, promised deliberate with her colleagues on whether there was market manipulation, while Maxine Waters, chair of the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, pushed for additional federal oversight of crypto trading platforms and consumer protection.

European Parliament economics committee member Stefan Berger has compared the current situation with FTX to the 2008 financial crisis and said that the Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework should prevent such crises in Europe. United States senators Debbie Stabenow and John Boozman have doubled down on their commitment to publishing a final version of the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act 2022.

Tom Emmer, the recently reelected Republican representative representing Minnesota’s 6th district in the United States House of Representatives, shocked the public with allegations that the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) helped the FTX to obtain a “monopoly” in the U.S. Specifically, Emmer believes the SEC Chair Gary Gensler to be the one who was helping Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX “work on legal loopholes.” However, the lawmaker did not provide any evidence, claiming that his office is working on it.

The pro- and anti-crypto winners and losers from the U.S. midterms

Results from many election races for seats in the United States Senate and House of Representatives are still coming in, but a number of candidates who have expressed staunch views on digital asset regulation won on Nov. 8. Pro-crypto House incumbents including Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer and North Carolina Representative Patrick McHenry won re-election, as did crypto skeptic Brad Sherman in California. Democrat Tim Ryan lost on Nov. 8 to Republican J.D. Vance, who got more than 53% of the vote. Vance previously disclosed he held up to $250,000 in Bitcoin, while Ryan supported legislation aimed at simplifying digital asset tax reporting requirements.

A new blockchain and cryptocurrency-focused association has been launched within Abu Dhabi’s free economic zone to further the development of blockchain and crypto ecosystems across the Middle Eastern, North Africa and Asia regions. The Middle East, Africa & Asia Crypto & Blockchain Association will aim to facilitate regulatory solutions, create commercial opportunities and invest in education to support industry growth.

The Clearing House opposes CBDC in comments for U.S. Treasury

The Clearing House claims a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is “not in the national interest” of the U.S because the risks of the possible issuance outweigh the benefits. As the company, owned by 23 banks and payment companies, has written in its letter to a Treasury Department, “the foundational requirements in place to prevent criminal and illicit use of commercial bank money must be applied to a U.S. CBDC” should it become a reality. The Clearing House also called for a federal prudential framework with standards for digital assets service providers that are equivalent to those for depository financial institutions engaged in functionally similar activities.

Hotspots of business activity and recruitment remain, even as parts of the tech industry cool amid rising inflation and interest rates and the changing post-pandemic landscape, analysts told CNA.

“The days of just hiring left, right and centre, in fear of losing out on talent – that will probably come to a stop for a while,” said Assistant Professor Ng Weiyi of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.

Among those employers likely to become more “fiscally prudent” are fintech start-ups that have been highly reliant on venture capital and private equity for funding, he said.

Competition has also intensified with the increased supply of job seekers after several high-profile layoffs that impacted the Singapore tech sector.

Facebook parent Meta, which terminated more than 11,000 employees worldwide, laid off dozens of employees in Singapore in departments ranging from marketing to engineering. Twitter slashed half its global workforce, or around 3,700 employees, though it is not known how many in Singapore were affected.

E-commerce giant Amazon is planning to lay off 10,000 employees, reports on Tuesday (Nov 15) said. Singapore-based online marketplace Shopee has held three rounds of retrenchments since June this year, which included staff in its food delivery and online payment teams. Both companies have not responded to queries about the number of employees affected in Singapore.

The larger pool of tech talent available for hire now will give companies leverage to dictate the terms of employment, which means they could end up paying employees less, said Asst Prof Ng.

But outside the start-up world, companies that have traditionally not been regarded as tech firms – such as banks – are seeking to deepen their digital capabilities. The layoffs in tech could be a boon for them, and also present new opportunities to tech job seekers.

“There’s a potential mobility shift for companies that want to reinvent themselves to pursue the top tech talent that would otherwise not be available,” said Asst Prof Ng.

“Now you are seeing an opportunity to recruit top tech talent that has otherwise been lured away by the very juicy compensation packages that were offered by the venture-backed companies.”

Ms Yorlin Ng, COO of venture outfit Momentum Works, said this was the silver lining of the Big Tech layoffs for non-tech companies and start-ups that want to innovate and are now able to grab hold of tech talent.

“A few founder friends of ours already find it easier to hire talent recently,” she said.

“I believe there will be a boom in tech again – perhaps very soon. The landscape might be different from what we are familiar with now though.”","Tech talent still in demand in Singapore despite mass layoffs, say analysts",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/tech-talent-layoffs-workers-jobs-hiring-meta-twitter-3070876

257,The bankruptcy of FTX may mark a necessary reset for the crypto sector ahead of a rebound higher. Find out why this is good news for Bitcoin investors.,blockchain,15/11/2022,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1238503209/image_1238503209.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,seeking alpha,"Anthony Kwan/Getty Images News

The collapse of FTX (FTT-USD) from one of the world's largest crypto exchanges into bankruptcy in just over a few days has been disturbing. Despite its air-of-secrecy as a private firm, FTX was seen as one of the few winners going back to the Q2 crash in crypto by making headlines capable of extending lines of credit to more troubled industry players. Indeed, the events of the past week turned out to be the proverbial latest shoe to drop in crypto, sending prices to a new cycle low.

That said, we see a few positives emerging as it relates to the outlook for Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which can consolidate its position as the ""gold standard of crypto"". The fall of FTX is more of a story based on possible misbehavior and lack of regulatory compliance than a critique of the potential of digital assets. By this measure, nothing has changed in the long-term bullish case for BTC.

What may be getting lost in the discussion is that the decentralized public blockchain of Bitcoin remains as secure as ever, with the confidence of the protocol helping to affirm its role as a store of value and alternative asset. The setup here is that by getting past this near-term volatility, Bitcoin can emerge stronger into the next bull market.

The Fall Of FTX

With the details from the demise of FTX still playing out, the essence of the story has all the hallmarks of a classic bank run. Rumors floating around social media of a liquidity crunch drove a wave of withdrawals from the platform. FTX was forced to halt further transactions based on a lack of adequate capital reserves. The situation was exacerbated based on the group's dependency on the funding FTT token (FTT-USD), which faced an accelerated selloff, losing more than $7 billion in value over a week.

Seeking Alpha

Disgraced CEO Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted about his misunderstanding of some high-level risk metrics, apparently based on poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts, leaving a substantial deficit in the spread with user margins. The latest update is simply that FTX and its more than 130 affiliates have filed for bankruptcy.

For us, the development came out of left field, in part, because the crypto sector had been building up a sense of stability over the last few months. There wasn't a market volatility event that triggered the company's apparent crisis. At the same time, one thought is that this was the final capitulation necessary for the sector to reset and move forward.

Alts Are Bad

The way we're looking at the situation is that the real losers in 2022 are the ecosystem of centralized players and a group of crypto ""alts"" that have failed to live up to their hype. FTX and its FTT token are the latest, but let's also remember some of the other failures this year like ""Celsius Network"" (CEL-USD) exposing the risk of ""stablecoins"" as the TerraUSD coin (UST-USD) and LUNA token (LUNC-USD) crashed.

There was also the collapse of crypto lender Voyager Digital (OTCPK:VYGVQ), which was curiously subsequently purchased by FTX in a firesale for $51 million, down from a peak valuation of $1.5 billion. The broader sector has also been plagued by hacks and marketing scams.

Again, the important distinction is that these groups and related alternative cryptocurrencies are unrelated to Bitcoin where the confidence in the security of its peer-to-peer blockchain network underpins its value. There may be other firms to fall and centralized exchange security will always be a concern, but the setup here is that Bitcoin can remain the king of the hill.

Even as Bitcoin bulls from the early run in 2020, one of the knocks on the upside price potential was that even with its supply cap of 21 million, the universe of alternative cryptocurrencies was unlimited. The allure of alts has always been this underlying hope that ""maybe you missed out on Bitcoin's run from under $1.00 to $10,000"", but that type of return could be possible with the latest and greatest coin gimmick. That type of thinking will likely take a seat from going forward.

While some top-tier alts like Ethereum (ETH-USD), Litecoin (LTC-USD), Ripple (XRP-USD), and Cardano (ADA-USD) have their place with defined utility or unique applications, consider that there are over 9,000 other cryptocurrency examples with many questionable structures. In our view, the bubble in crypto that popped this year was in the atmosphere of tokens being created just for speculative purposes. While we can debate which cryptos are ""bad money driving out the good"", FTT and LUNA are just two examples everyone can agree should not have existed.

Bullish On Bitcoin

The way we see it playing out is that more regulation is coming to the sector with an effort of improving security and financial transparency in the name of investor protection. Much of that will likely be targeting crypto finance or DeFi, which often utilizes a related token as a critical piece of their blockchain infrastructure. The effect will likely be fewer initial coin offerings going forward with higher thresholds, allowing the current sector leaders to capture a larger share.

All these changes can be positive for Bitcoin because it has already established itself as the most important asset in the public blockchain space. Investors recognizing this dynamic will continue to place BTC higher up on the sector hierarchy, as the target of institutional capital in the digital assets segment. In other words, an investment into BTC can be seen as having a better return to risk profile compared to any other crypto alt or especially over crypto finance startups.

It's worth recapping some high-level secular trends that support both increasing adoption of Bitcoin and higher price long-term. First, the concept of BTC being digital gold is alive and well. Like any other asset class, there are risks, but Bitcoin can play an important role in the context of a diversified portfolio for all investors.

The move by high-profile institutional asset managers to facilitate the adoption of crypto has moved forward. Everyone from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM), BlackRock Inc (BLK), to Goldman Sachs (GS) offer crypto-related products and have worked to facilitate investor access, making crypto more legitimate. An important milestone in the regulatory framework has already moved forward as an important foundation in the U.S. and globally.

Second, adoption is increasing. The last few years have proven BTC as an effective form of decentralized non-state money. Reports of consumers utilizing bitcoin for international remittances in emerging markets highlight its global appeal. Its ability to transcend the traditional financial system is useful to a large number of potential users. The collapse of FTX or any token doesn't change that.

The point we're getting at here is that Bitcoin is here to stay and its outlook is possibly stronger than ever. As bad as the correction and extreme volatility has been, keep in mind that BTC is still outperforming the S&P 500 (SPY) from levels before the pandemic nearly 3-years ago. The recent performance is all relative. There are several ""blue-chip"" stocks that have dropped farther in percentage terms from their 2021 highs.

Data by YCharts

BTC Price Forecast

We mentioned being surprised by the FTX news and a case could be made that if there was ever a spot for the bottom to completely fall out, this was it. By this measure, it's encouraging that BTC currently trading around $17,000 is off by just a few points from its June low suggesting an underlying level of support, with long-term investors still holding on.

The next few weeks will be important regarding any immediate fallout from the FTX bankruptcy. We want to avoid any headlines of other major companies sinking on this matter, but recognizing the price action in the crypto sector will lead the story. Staying above last week's low of $15,632 in BTC is a good first step. The main risk right now is that an even bigger shoe drops, which would point to some sign of a more structural weakness in crypto.

Fast forward, other macro indicators look more favorable. An outlook for declining inflation with stabilizing interest rates has already helped to kickstart a pullback in the U.S. Dollar that had been trading particularly strongly. A weaker USD by definition should be positive for all foreign currencies and crypto like Bitcoin. In a scenario where risk sentiment improves in financial markets through 2023, supported by better-than-expected macro data, we believe Bitcoin as a high-beta trade will outperform the upside.

The resulting net income from the sale of NFTs is characterized as ordinary income for tax purposes and may also be subject to self-employment tax if the NFT creation activity rises to the level of a ""trade or business."" However, there are currently no clear rules or guidance for when NFT activity rises to the level of a “trade or business.” Traditionally, an activity needs to be conducted with continuity, regularity and an intent to make a profit in order to be considered a trade or business for tax purposes.

Commissions or royalties received from downstream resales of an NFT are almost certainly income, but there’s no official guidance on this yet.

The program aims to connect international startups with the founding partners to pilot the startups' technologies and drive the future of Crypto and Digital Assets as world-class leaders.

""Plug and Play is excited to partner with Visa, AllianceBlock, The INX Digital Company, IGT, and Franklin Templeton to launch our new program and multiply our reach and impact in the crypto space. We look forward to accelerating enterprise-level adoption and bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3,"" said Maximillian Jungreis, Head of Crypto and Digital Assets at Plug and Play.

""At Visa, we believe partnerships can unlock a deeper understanding of the emerging use cases in the payments ecosystem,"" said Dan Roesbery, Vice President, Global Fintech Partnerships at Visa. ""We're excited to partner with Plug and Play to innovate with fintech and crypto platforms at all stages of the startup lifecycle on new money movement experiences.""

Headquartered in Sunnyvale, Calif., Plug and Play connects startups and leading corporations worldwide through industry-specific accelerator programs. The founding partners of the Crypto and Digital Assets program will access a global network of startups developing new digital technologies and innovative tools. In addition to our partners' specific interests, Plug and Play's new Crypto and Digital Assets vertical will have four broader focus areas:

Stablecoin Adoption: Stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to an underlying financial asset — have emerged as a leading crypto use-case by providing global access to the world's strongest fiat currencies. Businesses adopting stablecoins get all the benefits of crypto without the volatility: lower fees, secure transactions, and instant cross-border payments.

Story continues

Decentralized Finance: By making units of value — stocks, bonds, real estate, currencies, etc. — interoperable, programmable, and composable on blockchains, capital markets will become more efficient and accessible to everyone on the planet.

Crypto Economics: Tokens create opportunities for innovation in capital formation and human coordination that extend beyond the digital world and into the physical. Crypto-economic systems are enhancing access to core commodities like file storage and decentralized wireless — and the business benefits are significant.

Enterprise Blockchain: Enterprise blockchains are networks designed for large companies and organizations. They retain the core benefits of blockchains, such as efficiency and immutability, but tweak the underlying permissions to help businesses with data safety, faster transactions, and better supply chain management.

""AllianceBlock is excited about our partnership with Plug and Play Crypto and Digital Assets. Our ecosystem benefits from their broad network of innovative startups, industry pioneers, and thought leaders, as well as the value that we will provide to the Plug and Play ecosystem as experts in the decentralized space and the infrastructure for builders and developers to build on top of. We share the vision of a participatory economy, one that is fair, transparent, sustainable, and inclusive, and together we are working tirelessly to make that a reality.""

Blockchain technology and crypto economics will transform how we do business on the internet and across multiple industries. At Plug and Play Crypto and Digital Assets, we will accelerate enterprise-level adoption and bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3.

""As we continue our mission to increase access to the wealth of opportunities in the digital economy for both companies and investors, we are thrilled to be a founding member of Plug and Play's Crypto and Digital Assets program in Silicon Valley. Not only will this unique partnership offer deeper connections on the West Coast and Silicon Valley, but it will also allow us to put our leadership and expertise to work as we advise companies on the benefits of participating in the rapidly growing ecosystem of blockchain, tokenization, and cryptocurrency,"" said Douglas Borthwick, Chief Business Officer at INX. ""Together with Visa, AllianceBlock, IGT, and Franklin Templeton, we look forward to working with a variety of companies - from startups to established names - about the digital future and how they can leverage opportunities now to garner long-term growth.""

They say – it’s blockchain!”,blockchain,15/11/2022,"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1124907092-e1668524987673.jpg?resize=1200,600",fortune,"Charlie Munger has never been shy to share his feelings about Bitcoin, but with the spectacular implosion of FTX in the past week, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway is ratcheting up his criticisms in a big way.

Speaking on CNBC, Munger ripped cryptocurrencies, calling them “partly fraud and partly delusion.”

“This is a very, very bad thing. The country did not need a currency that was good for kidnappers,” Munger said. “There are people who think they’ve got to be on every deal that’s hot. I think that’s totally crazy. They don’t care whether it’s child prostitution or bitcoin.”

FTX has warned that it could have over 1 million creditors in an updated bankruptcy filing, a breathtaking jump from the initial estimate of over 100,000. Bitcoin prices, meanwhile, have lost 74% of their value in the past year (and tokens are worth just half of what they were in May).

Munger said that combination of fraud and delusion was to blame.

“Good ideas, carried to wretched excess, become bad ideas,” he said. “Nobody’s gonna say I got some shit that I want to sell you. They say—it’s blockchain!”

The criticisms, while amped-up, are nothing new for Munger, who has long been a skeptic of digital currencies, saying he has saw no value or potential in them.

“In my life, I try to avoid things that are stupid and evil and make me look bad…and bitcoin does all three,” he said in April. “In the first place, it’s stupid because it’s still likely to go to zero. It’s evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve System…and third, it makes us look foolish compared to the Communist leader in China. He was smart enough to ban bitcoin in China.”

He has also likened it to “rat poison” and a “venereal disease.”","Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger dunks on crypto once again, saying it’s “good for kidnappers” and “not a real asset”",https://fortune.com/2022/11/15/charlie-munger-cryptocurrency-criticism-ftx/

The collection “minted out” in 10 minutes, and it intentionally differed from previous successful projects in several respects.

There was no “mint price,” which meant that project developers could only be paid from royalties on secondary market trades, rather than initial sales. The initial “free minters” would merely have to pay the cost of “gas,” the standard fee to create a token on the blockchain.

The minting website explicitly rejected many of the established NFT conventions. Bluntly, it said there would be: “No roadmap. No Discord. No utility. CC0.”

“No roadmap” meant that the (initially anonymous) developers would not advance some vaunted plan for new features or future revenue, since the bear market — and, honestly, the often scammy nature of NFTs — had jaded buyers to the inevitability of impossible or broken promises.

“No Discord” meant that the team would not manage a separate Discord channel, where community culture and solidarity might be built, yet which, in practice, often seemed to silo content from the outside world.

“No utility” meant that the team would not promise any clear, tangible benefits from ownership, beyond the unclear value as interactive tokens on a blockchain.

And, finally, CC0 (or “Creative Commons 0”) meant that, rather than promise holders any specific intellectual property rights, as, for example, the popular “Bored Ape Yacht Club” collection had done, the entire collection would be copyright-free and “open source” for other creators to reuse and riff on at will. This would indeed become the case as goblintown framed the aesthetics of many other projects, like corntown.wtf and hobotown.wtf.

Despite the lack of promises, a wave of hype quickly developed, as the project’s “floor price” shot up to a high of around 8ETH (almost $15,000) in a matter of days. Mystery over who created the clever collection was one factor, as many speculated that a leading NFT team or media company was responsible.

Additionally, using Twitter Spaces chatrooms as a theatrical stage, goblintown advanced a new method to fashion characters and stories for large audiences. As investors and people curious about the goblins and their origins desperately sought information, the goblintown account started a space on May 25. Yet, rather than have representatives from the team offer any detail or explanation, for three hours thousands of attendees heard a cacophony of high-pitched goblin voices muttering and talking about nonsense, or making jokes and puns about bodily functions, especially “piss.”

Although one might have assumed that the developers had hired a cast of paid actors for this and subsequent performances, goblintown social media, marketing, and community manager Sydney Clara Brafman told me that the performers had actually come from the community itself, and that the style was largely spontaneous. In this and in subsequent spaces, her own background in film became an advantage as she could direct these communal improv performances by choosing who was elevated to speak.

As characters, goblins are earthy, abrupt, sexually hyperactive, and irreverent. They live in a world oblivious to, or mocking of, human problems of scandal and financial losses. Hard workers, despite their insane or pointless objectives, they invent their own elaborate schemes of trickery and commerce.

Goblins became a fitting identity for NFT enthusiasts, who are uncertain about their future, yet are still darkly proud of their fast-paced, albeit often conniving, subculture. Many have invested huge sums of money into dreams divorced from real-world concerns (and some have had to absorb the psychological pain of feeling “scammed” or “rugged”).

With characters fleshed out in Twitter Spaces and through the main goblintown Twitter account (with its distinctive language and script), the blockchain itself became a setting for further stages of the “story.” Holders of NFTs were able to “build” their own McGoblin Burgers, with disgusting ingredients like “pulld ork dongz,” “eer funguss,” “dwarf pyoobz,” and “pee soss.” Subsequently, these NFT burgers were used as “bait” to trap grumpls, a much cuter creature that farts a lot.

As to where goblintown fits into an “art world” that is still trying to figure out NFTs and their tech-inclined, self-referential subculture, it is an open question. The core art was designed by “Process Grey,” an imaginative illustrator who created a unique, comic aesthetic for the entire universe. More recently, the new “grumpl” NFTs were crafted in various styles by an array of established web3 artists, showing the team’s commitment to utilizing and recognizing real talent.

The performative element also has its own momentum, with community members continuing to organize Twitter Spaces and “radio theater” of goblin adventures and news broadcasts. New characters include a goblin Freudian psychoanalyst and big-box store proprietor.

Nevertheless, in the months after the team revealed itself as Truth Labs rather than some larger, well-capitalized entity, the collection entered its own bear market, with the cost of a single goblin now declining to around 0.8ETH, or $1,250, at publication. Perhaps the attraction of the bear market theme has faded somewhat in a scene anxious for a positive turn-around, or perhaps the project has revealed the difficulty of sustaining attention for “storytelling” elements over long periods of time.

Still, the goblintown collection alone has done nearly 50,000ETH in volume (around $80 million at the current Ethereum price). Under a royalty rate of 7.5%, this has produced at least $5 to $6 million dollars in royalties for Truth Labs, and the team pledges to continue to invest in the goblintown “ecosystem.”","In a Bear Market, the NFT Scene Embraces Goblins",http://hyperallergic.com/780309/in-a-bear-market-the-nft-scene-embraces-goblins/

Through the end of the year, users will be able to stake their USDT on the SeedOn platform for a 10-day locked staking pool with 50% APY. SeedOn users who invite at least one new user to the platform automatically receive a 10% cashback on their friend's first swap from $BNB or $USDT to $SEON. Users can invite up to three friends for a total of 10% cashback from their friends’ first token purchase up to $25.

SeedOn’s platform makes equity crowdfunding safer for investors and entrepreneurs alike by leveraging the transparency provided by blockchain technology. The platform releases the raised funds in stages based on the achievement of specific milestones, returning remaining funds if a project falls short of any milestone. Projects looking to raise money on SeedOn undergo a three-step verification procedure before they are approved.

The startup screening process starts with an AI algorithm checking for copyright infringements, and ultimately ends up with a human manually checking and validating the AI system’s findings. SeedOn protects project creators by requiring investors to sign an NDA, which protects intellectual property by only allowing registered investors access to the project's sensitive information.

“The lucrative USDT yield opportunity and Referral Program are a great way for people to learn about SeedOn and the unprecedented levels of security, trust, and transparency that the platform offers,” says Constantin-Claudiu Minea, Co-Founder and CEO of SeedOn. “We always look for ways to give back to our community while promoting growth.”

About SeedOn

Headquartered in Iasi, Romania, SeedOn has developed the blockchain-based solution that will revolutionize the crowdfunding process to ensure transparent transactions. Utilizing the native $SEON token, users can invest in projects on the platform, with funds being held in escrow and released periodically for additional investor security. Projects and founders will go through an intensive validation process before being granted access to the platform. The smart contract escrow model guarantees safe transfer of funds, expanding the future of crowdfunding for project developers and investors alike.

Despite all the technical progress made over the years, crypto remains niche relative to the five billion+ monthly active users on the Internet.

A key problem is that onboarding new users is still a jarring experience that necessitates a massive learning curve…you need to download a crypto wallet like Coinbase Wallet or Metamask, then purchase crypto to fund the wallet, etc. It still lacks the practical usability of Web 2 and is a major friction point for mainstream users.

That’s why we’re excited to announce that we are leading a $2.1 million seed round for Peaze, a developer platform that simplifies Web3 onboarding.

Peaze gives developers an SDK that enables frictionless Web3 user experiences through familiar authentication and payment methods, making Web3 UX indistinguishable from Web2. Users can basically operate on-chain with just an email and credit card. The immediate roadmap includes EVM compatible chains, with the intent of supporting all major blockchain development ecosystems. By simplifying onboarding, Peaze helps eliminate significant points of friction, so Web3 applications can serve the billions of non-crypto natives.

Today Peaze is officially launching their product. We’re so proud to officially welcome them to the team!

“Our direct exposure to FTX exchange was confined to mid-seven figures held in custody. Our investment into the equity of FTX was made prior to the launch of our fund, and we did not invest any LP capital into FTX,” Sino Global said in a tweet on Tuesday .

Sino Global added it “deeply regrets that misplaced trust” put into FTX, which now faces legal inquiries tied to the handling of customer funds and its relationship with trading arm Alameda Research, to which FTX loaned billions of dollars.

Sino Global was among the earliest investors in the now-embattled FTX and reported some $300 million in assets under management in January 2022. It launched its “Liquid Value Fund 1” in partnership with FTX, the pitch deck shows, highlighting its early entry into the Solana ecosystem alongside FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, a prominent Solana backer.

Alameda Research and Sam Bankman-Fried were listed among the “direct owners” of that fund, filings show.

Several of Sino Global’s previous investments were focused on the Solana ecosystem, usually alongside FTX and Bankman-Fried.

Meanwhile, Sino Global said it was functioning as normal and was focused on blockchain infrastructure and gaming projects at its current fund.","Crypto Fund Sino Global Regrets Its 'Misplaced Trust' in FTX, Reports 'Mid-Seven' Figure Losses Tied to Exchange",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-fund-sino-global-regrets-082640606.html

""When we started, we didn't know Covid was coming and nobody called it the 'hybrid workforce' back then,"" says John Hartigan, CEO of Domain-U. ""We just knew there had to be a better way to train a decentralized workforce and that is what we set out to do and are now doing.""

d Domain-U Experimental Training Platform

The Hybrid Future of Work is bright, and we are excited to be on the forefront of it. Join us on the bright side!

The unprecedented shift, in attitudes, behaviors, and expectations of workers in this next phase of living with Covid has literally forced companies to demand new solutions. For the first time in history virtual training is no longer in the back seat, it is driving the bus. The problem for companies is, most of the products on the market were built as back seats. ""Domain-U is built to drive,"" Hartigan states passionately.

Confluent Medical Technologies agrees, recently signing a multi-year enterprise contract to re-invigorate their training process for its rapidly growing global workforce. ""Domain-U's on-demand, interactive video platform, allows us the flexibility to create short impactful trainings for a mobile device on the manufacturing floor as a refresher, and larger format multi-screen intensives at the office, in a conference room, or at home,"" says Richard Brown, SVP of Quality and Regulatory at Confluent Medical Technologies.

Jon Cholak, Managing Director, Adit Ventures had this to say, ""The evolution of the workforce from an on-premises to a hybrid model requires an evolution of the training tools necessary to equip employees with the appropriate skills and certifications. Legacy training methods such as static presentations and limited interaction videos have inadequate efficacy; next-generation training tools need to be thorough, efficient and empower employees. Domain-U's platform achieves those aims and we're excited for their continued growth.""

Story continues

Organizations in medical device, building materials, trade schools, and soon heavy equipment utilize the platform to train on everything from general onboarding topics, to manufacturing quality, compliance, software systems, and even product and services trainings that focus on understanding and tapping the emotional motivation and connection of the product with the buyer.

Another step into the future is something being called ""digital verifiable credentials"" or portable digital work documents that workers keep in the digital wallets on their phones which can be quickly verified via blockchain. Domain-U is the first training platform to issue these credentials via the Velocity blockchain ecosystem which is also being used by the largest names in HR tech, such as SAP, Oracle, Infor, Jobvite and many more.

""The Hybrid Future of Work is bright, and we are excited to be on the forefront of it,"" says Hartigan. ""Join us on the bright side!""

273,LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Archax partners with Ownera to distribute digital securities over the Ownera FinP2P network.,blockchain,15/11/2022,https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20221115005819/en/1637769/23/ArchaxOwnera.jpg,business wire,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Archax, the first FCA regulated global digital securities exchange, custodian and broker, today announced a partnership with Ownera, provider of a global inter-trading network based on the open-source FinP2P protocol, to distribute digital securities over the Ownera FinP2P network.

The digital securities industry is growing fast but has lacked regulated, institutional-grade exchanges and market infrastructure, as well as a common global distribution network for connecting issuers, investors, exchanges, and other market participants. As a result, the rate of institutional adoption and investor access to high-quality digital assets has been limited up until now.

To help address this, Archax is rolling out a digital asset ecosystem, built with institutions in mind, and designed to allow them to raise funds through digital issuances, as well as custody and trade a variety of digital assets, such as digital securities, NFTs and cryptocurrencies. Coupled with this, Archax subsidiary Montis is leveraging blockchain technology to revolutionise the post-trade space by building a blockchain-based Central Securities Depository (CSD), which will allow regulated digital securities to realise their full potential.

On the distribution side, Ownera has brought the industry together to develop the FinP2P open-source routing protocol to orchestrate the instant exchange of digital assets held on any blockchain platform, for digital cash held on any ledger. It supports primary issuance, secondary trading and DeFi-style instant borrowing against assets pledged as collateral. This routing network has the power to open up digital distribution for the private markets and unlock global liquidity in a way that no single institution or exchange can achieve on its own.

Speaking about the partnership, Graham Rodford, CEO and co-founder of Archax, said: “Together Archax and Ownera are perfectly positioned to help move the institutional adoption of digital assets forward to the next level. It is clear that tokenisation and the use of natively digital assets are the future for capital markets, and recent investments in this space by established traditional players into both Archax and Ownera, clearly demonstrate this.”

“Ownera and Archax have had a close relationship for some time - two UK companies with a very well aligned vision for the digital transformation of the global private markets. As such we are particularly pleased to be able to cement this collaboration by enabling Archax’s Issuers and Investors to benefit from access to the global Ownera FinP2P network.” Adds Ami Ben David, the Founder and CEO of Ownera.

About Archax:

Archax is a global, regulated, digital asset exchange, brokerage and custodian based in London. Founded by experts from the financial markets world and backed by an accomplished advisory board, Archax offers a credible bridge between the blockchain-centric crypto community and the traditional investment space.

Archax is the first-ever firm to receive FCA regulation as a digital securities exchange, custodian and brokerage. It was also the first firm to be listed on the FCA’s Cryptoasset Register as a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider).

Archax has been designed specifically for institutional investors to trade in all types of digital assets, from cryptocurrencies to digital securities. It is built using existing, proven, resilient, scalable, high-performance exchange infrastructure, hosted in top-tier datacentre space, and integrated into the existing institutional trading workflow.

(File image)

Crypto mining firms listed in Toronto expect more turmoil and a lingering crisis of confidence in digital assets after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.

Bitcoin dropped as low as $15,804.76 on Monday and has lost nearly a quarter of its value since Nov. 5, shortly before FTX began to unravel. The falling price of the largest cryptocurrency, as well as smaller ones, is squeezing overleveraged miners and hedge funds that have lent money to the sector, according to the executive chairman of Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd.

“There are still many more bankruptcies” to come, Frank Holmes said in a phone interview. FTX’s stunning tumble into bankruptcy has even affected already-insolvent firms like Voyager Digital Ltd., a crypto brokerage that filed for Chapter 11 in July and for which FTX had made a takeover offer, he noted. Voyager announced Friday that it’s reopening a bidding process as part of its own bankruptcy proceedings.

“I just don’t know who’s next. Maybe this is the Lehman Brothers event,” said Holmes, likening the FTX collapse to that pivotal moment in the global financial crisis of 2008 when the Wall Street firm toppled.

Toronto-listed crypto miners have plunged as the FTX saga has unfolded. Hut 8 Mining Corp. has led the way, plummeting 37% this month, while Hive has fallen 22% and Bitfarms Ltd. 24%.

All Bitcoin miners’ margins have been compressed, Bitfarms President Geoffrey Morphy said Monday during an earnings call that focused on the company’s attempts to keep costs low to survive the “crypto winter.” For miners, high energy costs are compounding the problem of falling crypto prices.

For many crypto entities, the capital markets are now firmly shut. “In the coming weeks and months, we will uncover how many executives and insiders knew what was happening under the hood,” Ether Capital Corp.’s CEO Brian Mosoff said in an email, noting that he expects “many dominos” to fall.

“Companies -- startups or established -- looking to raise capital in this environment will likely be met with resistance,” Mosoff said. “I expect this will take months, if not years, to play out.”

Hive Blockchain is organizing webcasts and meeting with investors to address concerns about investor sentiment. Part of the message: the Vancouver-based company has never used FTX as a trading firm and doesn’t leverage its crypto holdings, and any exposure Hive might have to FTX is “de minimus,” Holmes said.

Pulling Funds

Bitvo Inc., a Calgary-based cryptocurrency trading platform, has given assurances to customers that it continues to operate. FTX announced plans to buy the firm in June, but the deal did not close.

The trading platform operates on a full reserve basis and doesn’t lend money, CEO Pamela Draper said by phone. While “volatility” on the platform has increased, the company hasn’t paused deposits or withdrawals.

“It hasn’t affected our platform at all,” she said. For now, Bitvo is still bound by the FTX acquisition agreement, but the company will disclose “when or if” that’s canceled, Draper said.

The crash of Bankman-Fried’s empire has fueled outflows across global crypto exchanges, with users pulling $3.7 billion worth of Bitcoin and $2.5 billion of Ether from Nov. 6 to Nov. 13, according to data provider CryptoQuant.",Bitcoin miner expects âmany moreâ bankruptcies after FTX collapse,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/bitcoin-miner-expects-many-more-bankruptcies-after-ftx-collapse-9524921.html

With their innate scarcity and the ability to represent just about anything digitally, NFTs have a lot of potential for a wide variety of applications. Unsurprisingly, this has led to a boom in their popularity over the past few years, with more and more people becoming interested in collecting and trading them.

In fact, NFTs became so popular last year that the market surpassed $40 billion. However, the volume has dropped significantly in recent months as the overall market sentiment has cooled off.

But even though the hype around NFTs has died down a bit, there are still a lot of people who are excited about their potential. And one area that seems to be particularly promising is the use of NFTs in a social media context.

What are SNFTs (social NFTs)?

The term “social NFT/SNFT” is used to describe a type of NFT that is connected to a social media platform in some way. This means that the owner of the SNFT will have access to the social media account that it represents, allowing them to take control of the account and use it however they want.

For example, if you purchase an SNFT that is connected to a Twitter account, you will be able to tweet from that account and view the account’s followers just as if you were using your own personal Twitter account.

The main difference is that, since the SNFT is stored on the blockchain, it can be traded or sold just like any other NFT. This makes SNFTs a unique and interesting new way to monetize social media accounts and the digital assets that they represent.

How do SNFTs work?

Currently, Smashverse, an upcoming blockchain-based battle royale game, will be the first and only platform to utilize SNFT technology in this way. In the game, players can purchase SNFTs that represent playable characters, otherwise known as “Titans”, which they can use to battle against each other.

However, rather than being stored on the game’s servers, the Titans are stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

As a result, Titan SNFTs can be ported to other games (or even other metaverses), which means that they could potentially become a valuable commodity in the gaming world.

Of course, as with any other NFT, they can also be bought, sold, or traded on secondary markets, allowing players to monetize their in-game progress. But here is where it gets interesting.

Smashverse automatically connects each of the Titan SNFTs to its very own Twitter account,

thus allowing the SNFT owner to create and build the digital brand of their Titan. So, if you’re good at promoting your Titan and are able to gain a large following, you could potentially earn a healthy profit.

Managing your SNFTs

In most cases, it is likely that SNFTs must be accessed through a proprietary platform that has in-built wallet integration so that you can easily manage your SNFTs.

For example, in order to access SNFTs on Smashverse, you must first authenticate yourself using your wallet before you will be given access to core Twitter features such as Tweeting and commenting from the portal.

How are SNFTs traded?

The good news is that SNFTs can be traded just like any other NFT, which means that they can be bought and sold on a variety of different exchanges. Since you must hold the SNFT in your wallet to access the social media portals, they will benefit from the same trustlessness, security, and immutability that are characteristic of other NFTs.

As the technology grows and becomes more widely adopted, it’s likely that we will see more platforms emerge that allow users to buy, sell, and trade SNFTs exclusively. For now, however, Smashverse appears to be leading the way in this space.

A new way to express digital identity

Overall, NFTs have become a critical part of expressing digital identity. SNFTs further develop this notion by giving NFTs their own existence on social platforms. It’s a way of building an even stronger connection with your NFT, and also allows you to interact with other like-minded NFT collectors.

While the technology is still in its infancy, it’s clear to see the potential SNFTs have, and not just in the gaming world. We could easily see SNFTs being used to represent all sorts of digital assets in the future, from social media accounts to blog posts and even digital art.

Adding value to NFTs in such as way has never been done before, and it will be extremely interesting to see how the Web3 industry takes to this novel concept. In the meantime, we’ll just have to wait and see if SNFTs prove to be a success for Smashverse and whether or not other platforms decide to follow suit.",Are Social NFTs the Next Big Trend?,https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2022/11/are-social-nfts-the-next-big-trend.html
276,A Bank for International Settlements (BIS) report alleges Bitcoin (BTC) buyers are purchasing the cryptocurrency mainly due to rises in price.,blockchain,15/11/2022,https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjItMTEvYTUyNWNiZmUtMDAxYS00MmQ2LTgyMGEtZTFjYzZlMjg0NDdmLmpwZw==.jpg,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors are more likely enticed by the cryptocurrency’s rising prices, rather than their dislike of banks or its perceived use as a store of value, a new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggests.

In a “BIS Working Papers” report published on Nov. 14, the central bank body looked into the relationship between Bitcoin prices, crypto trading and retail adoption.

It studied the drivers of crypto adoption by retail investors using crypto trading app downloads as a proxy for adoption and user investments at the time of download.

It found that “a rise in the price of Bitcoin is associated with a significant increase in new users, ie entry of new investors” and that most retail investors “downloaded crypto apps when prices were high.”

The BIS presented evidence that daily downloads of crypto exchange applications increased with the rapidly rising price of Bitcoin between July and Nov. 2021, peaking when Bitcoin’s price was between $55,000 and $60,000, roughly one month before its Nov. 2021 all-time high of just over $69,000.

It added 40% of crypto app users were men under 35 and were part of the most “risk-seeking” segment of the population, from this, it surmised:

“Users [are] being drawn to Bitcoin by rising prices — rather than a dislike for traditional banks, the search for a store of value or distrust in public institutions.”

“The price of Bitcoin remains the most important factor when we control for global uncertainty or volatility, contradicting explanations based on Bitcoin as a safe haven,” it added.

The BIS assumed app users purchased Bitcoin at the time of downloading a crypto app and subsequently supposed that up to “81% of users would have lost money” if they had purchased Bitcoin over $20,000.

The BIS’s assumptions seemingly correlate with data from blockchain analysis firm Glassnode, who on Nov. 14 confirmed that just over half of Bitcoin addresses are in profit, reaching a two-year low.

The BIS added its analysis of blockchain data found as Bitcoin prices rose, smaller users purchased and “the largest holders (the so-called ‘whales’ or ‘humpbacks’) were selling — making a return at the smaller users’ expense.”

It also documented the geography of crypto app adoption and found between Aug. 2015 to June 2022, Turkey, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom had the highest total downloads per 100,000 people, respectively.

India and China had the lowest, the latter seeing only 1,000 crypto app downloads per 100,000 people, with the BIS opining that greater legal restrictions on crypto hamper retail adoption in those countries.","Bitcoin buyers drawn by rising prices, not dislike for banks: BIS report",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-buyers-drawn-by-rising-prices-not-dislike-for-banks-bis-report

Fast facts

“There won’t be another situation like this for institutional investors ever again, we’re simply not going to put capital to work until this stuff gets regulated,” said O’Leary, adding that he will take the push to Washington.

Notable cryptocurrency bills, such as the Central Bank Digital Currency Study Act of 2021 and the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act of 2022, have been introduced to the U.S. Congress but have yet to be passed.

O’Leary said that U.S. regulators should start by passing the Stablecoin Transparency Act that was brought to Congress in March, which would require issuers of stablecoins to publish monthly reports on reserves and undergo third-party audits. Stablecoins are defined in the bill as digital assets backed by a non-digital currency on a one-to-one basis.

“If I’m going to put serious capital to work in a broker-dealer, in an exchange, it’s going to be one that’s regulated, has transparency, and has the same rules that every other exchange that deals in stocks and bonds have,” added O’Leary.

O’Leary maintains that he is “a huge advocate” for the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, calling the recent crash in token prices “the bottom of the crypto market.”

The Canadian businessman and television personality signed a multi-year contract in 2021 to serve as a spokesperson for FTX and promote its brand and affiliates.

278,A unique narrative NFT project has a story to tell.,blockchain,15/11/2022,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZyrEFzaQ3eCrGSWRaYkQT-1200-80.jpg,creative bloq,"Upcoming NFT Broadside is a unique new project that is aiming to build a complex and engaging 'storyworld' and it could just make the New York best-seller list. Like all good NFT projects, if you're one of the 7,290 anonymous heroes of this story you could be a part of a new best-seller.

We've been talking about NFTs for a while, and my guide 'What are NFTs?' goes into detail, but essentially non-fungible tokens are a way to register digital files on a blockchain and create scarcity.

This isn't the first time Broadsider's co-create Vector Meldrew put together a list of the best NFT games for Creative Bloq. The VJ and artist has sold out collections with Bonhams, Nifty Gateway and Foundation to name just some successes. Co-creator Charlie Stratford-Rex, the author behind Broadside's story, is a longterm NFT collector and writer.

One of the advantages of NFTs is buyers can own a work of art and its uses, and Broadside NFTs will come with either cc0 (license free) or full commercial rights – take a look at the Broadside website (opens in new tab) for more details. If you get a Broadside NFT you could develop your own fiction, decide how your character is used and more. You can truly begin to tell your own stories. But also, so perhaps can others (which we go into a little more later).

An upcoming NFT years in the making

Broadside is a story NFT that enables owners to print and sell the finished book (Image credit: Broadside)

There will be 11 episode NFTs and artefacts dropped to each owner of a Broadside, telling a deep and involved story of a decentralised future. The story took creators Stratford-Rex and Meldrew 10 years to develop and became an NFT because traditional media failed to grasp how this story could be told.

Stratford-Rex tells me he's had many meetings with DreamWorks to develop the script but the animation studio had cold feet about a film with an anonymous hero and couldn't make the project work.

""I wanted to make this very fun, fictional book. And we wanted the main character to be anonymous and sort of decentralised, so then it was in development at DreamWorks for a while but they didn't really understand what a decentralised anonymous hero is,"" explains Stratford-Rex.

""I had this story about these kids in the future playing this weird AR game and they decided to pirate it and hack it,"" says the writer of Broadside. ""It all goes horribly wrong, of course, and they're forced to think about abundance and scarcity in decentralisation and centralisation, but in a very personal journey, a hero's journey, [with an] action movie story arc.""

NFT Broadside could be a best-seller

After 11 episode drops owners can mint a 1/1 edition of the book (Image credit: Broadside)

This story is told as an NFT 'book' released in chapters that features an owner's specific character, both in the text and on the cover. Once all 11 'episodes' are dropped owners can burn these chapters into a 1/1 book NFT featuring their Broadside character on the cover. Owners can print and sell this book and each one will feature an ISBN number so you can sell it on Amazon, which is where Broadside gets ambitious.

""All 7,290 possible versions of Broadside will have different ISBN numbers. We can hack the New York Times bestseller list if we get everyone to start selling these on the same day. With so many it's going to look more like a DDoS attack,"" jokes Stratford-Rex.

He continues: ""Let's take this into the most old-school publishing possible with the community that's growing around Broadside. And let's do something crazy to put this story about decentralisation into a completely different context, a completely different medium at the end of Phase One.""

Who really owns a Broadside?

Vector Meldrew has created the art, and some famous NFT artists such as XCOPY are involved too (Image credit: Broadside)

There's a playful approach to Broadside that can be found as Stratford-Rex discusses the underlying themes of the project that plague NFTs in general. The reason for offering both cc0 (effectively creative commons, licence free art) and commercial licences for Broadside is to cause debate and focus the attention onto how NFTs are used.

""There's been this big debate in NF T's about full commercial rights versus cc0,"" begins Stratford-Rex, explaining Meldrew brought some big names to the Broadside project, including XCOPY, Cryptopunk #5046 and Rektguy.

Some Broadside NFTs will feature art from these major NFT artists, but they'll be on cc0 contracts. ""That means you can go and open a restaurant and make a movie or do whatever you want with it,"" adds the writer. ""So can anyone else, it's not just not exclusively yours.""

Broadside the story will dive into a future of decentralisation but the NFT itself, right now, is asking questions about how far decentralisation can go, what communities can do and create around these unique ownership and copyright models.

There's a ""tension"" at play to owning a Broadside says Stratford-Rex, as the models ensure you can do whatever you wish with your Broadsider, and those already involved are developing video games and new fiction, but there is a tussle between ccO and full commercial licensing, with different Broadside NFTs holding one or both licensing models.

Stratford-Rex clarifies: ""The only tension there that we had to play with was you're able to do anything, as much as you can, with your Broadsider, without affecting what anybody else can do with theirs.""

Broadside shows ambition

Now is the time for inventive NFT projects (Image credit: Broadside)

It's been a while since I've seen an NFT project quite as ambitious as Broadside. In some respects the current downturn in the value of NFTs and the 'crypto winter' the scene is suffering means that creative NFTs like Broadside that look at new ways to use non-fungible tokens may have gone under the radar a year ago as all that interested people was flipping NFTs and not collecting.

Artist Vector Meldrew has his view: ""We saw that crazy, low effort stuff, people just getting stuff out just because they knew the market was hot, and people ready to flip. And it just led to a mania. […] We felt that a lot of the things missing from there was starting with a story, which we feel is the root of all good projects or all good IP. So we definitely wanted to be story led, and then we wanted to take our time on the ark.""

Tellingly Meldrew says, ""Even if we wanted to, we couldn't have really minted during that period that's known for that kind of work [NFTs such as Pixelmon] because I just want it to be right and that's why it's taken this long.""

Broadside has been years in the making, the Rex-Meldrew duo have worked together since school. And it shows in their passion for what Broadside represents. ""Hopefully it does change people's opinions on what NFTs are,"" says Meldrew thoughtfully.

Broadside is minting now, and you can find the project on NFT marketplace OpenSea (opens in new tab), and follow along with the community on the Broadside Twitter (opens in new tab).

(NEO: INXD, OTCQB: INXDF, INXATS: INX) (the ""Company"" or ""INX""), the owner of digital asset trading platforms, a broker-dealer, and an inter-dealer broker (through its subsidiaries), announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2022.

INX MAKES HISTORY WITH THE LISTING OF THE WORLD’S FIRST SEC-REGISTERED DIGITAL SECURITY, COLLAPSES TRADING FEES

Investment gains/losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance. Earnings of The INX Digital Company, Inc. for the third quarter of 2022 are summarized below.

2022 Q3 Financial Highlights:

Cash and cash equivalents of $25.8M and an additional $8.7M in short and long-term investments. Approximately 95% of the short and long-term investments are held in U.S. Government Treasury instruments and investment-grade corporate bonds.

Reserve fund maintained at $36.0M.

INX Revenue for Q3 2022 is at $1.1M and $3.5M year to date, primarily from transaction fees.

Year-to-date net cash used in operating activities is $17.8M.

INX reports a quarterly loss of $10.1M, which includes an unrealized loss of $5.3M from the issued INX Token, a loss on the token warrant liability of $0.4M, and an income of $0.4M from the fair value adjustment for the above-mentioned non-cash item as well as one-time items. The company's adjusted net loss for Q3 2022 is $4.8M. The adjusted net loss is a non-IFRS measure.

Noteworthy steps and milestones in Q3 are expected to lead the company forward

During the third quarter of 2022, the Company has taken significant actions to put in place innovative technology that allow the pioneering of a new and responsible digital economy. In addition, it forged new and strategic global partnerships and multiple initiatives to expand the Company's services and outreach and promote brand recognition and drive future revenues.

The Company reached a major milestone at the end of this quarter when it launched INX ONE , the world's first fully regulated platform integrating cryptocurrency and security token trading, investment opportunities in primary security token offerings, and capital raise services. The WSJ noted that INX's breakthrough platform is aligned with the envisioned model of SEC's chairman.

Story continues

To promote its vision of a true democratization of finance, the Company has opened its shares to global investors by commencing trading on the OTC Markets (""INXDF""); it now provides convenient access to millions of U.S. investors and gives institutional and retail investors worldwide the opportunity to trade INX shares on additional platforms.

INX has also launched its capital raise services with its first global issuer. The Company's platform facilitates the Trucpal Digital Security Token offering for accredited U.S. and non-U.S. investors. This is the first digital security token for the Chinese freight market, enabling people worldwide to potentially earn a portion of future profits and dividends.

The Millennium Sapphire (""MSTO"") Token was also added for secondary market trading on INX's ATS. Token holders are entitled to receive dividends from Millennium's NFT Studio.

During the third quarter of 2022, two additional cryptocurrency assets (Compound and Aave) were added to the Company's cryptocurrency exchange. As part of INX's mission to provide investment opportunities to all, it has also accumulated additional money transmitter licenses, allowing the company to offer cryptocurrencies in 43 U.S. states and territories. The cryptocurrency exchange is also available to customers in over 120 countries.

Since its establishment, the company has always taken bold steps to design and develop new safe and reliable paths that advance the transition from a traditional to a digital economy. This past quarter, the Company welcomed to our board two new financial leaders who themselves made the transition from traditional to digital and will therefore guide and assist in promoting INX's mission.

As the Company continues to expand, it is expanding its team of professionals. During this last quarter, the Company hired a new Global General Counsel to play a significant role in achieving INX's global goals.

INX CEO Shy Datika: We are here for the long run. We knew it would be a bumpy ride and came prepared to realize our forward-looking vision. The INX way, yet again, proved to be the right one. As industry giants are challenged by regulators, we have armed ourselves with regulations. As investors become more aware and more concerned with the pitfalls of unregulated trading platforms, we can provide a secure and safe harbor. INX puts customers first! We have a fully audited and segregated cash reserve fund as described in our INX Token F-1 prospectus . We maintain 1:1 balances for customers and do not use customer assets. We do not, in any way, shape, or form, leverage or re-invest customer assets. On our INX Securities ATS, customers get full transparency as they control their assets, their keys, and their wallets. We will continue developing new services and technologies to further expand opportunities while keeping our clients safe.

NEW YORK (AP) — Just days after cryptocurrency’s third-largest exchange collapsed, the public is starting to get an idea of how messy FTX’s bankruptcy case could be. Other crypto firms are failing as a result of FTX’s unraveling, events reminiscent of the domino-like meltdowns of the 2008 financial crisis.

Users remained frustratingly in the dark Tuesday about when they might get their funds back, if at all, directing much of their anger toward FTX’s founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.

In a court filing, FTX’s lawyers said there were already more than 100,000 claims against the company and estimated that figure could grow to more than 1 million, most of them customers, once the case is complete. The court ordered FTX to provide at least a list of the company’s 50 biggest creditors by Nov. 18.

The lawyers said the company is in contact with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as well as dozens of other state, federal and international authorities, confirming earlier reports that the U.S. government is probing the possibility that Bankman-Fried and his lieutenants violated U.S. securities law.

FTX filed for bankruptcy protection Friday, sending tsunami-like waves through the cryptocurrency industry, which has seen a fair share of volatility and turmoil this year, including a sharp decline in price for bitcoin and other digital assets. For some, the events are reminiscent of the failures of Wall Street firms during the 2008 financial crisis, particularly now that supposedly healthy firms like FTX are failing.

The Wall Street Journal reported that BlockFi, which had halted withdrawals over the weekend following FTX’s bankruptcy, is now actively considering bankruptcy and plans to lay off its staff. In previous public comments, BlockFi’s management made it clear that FTX’s failure had pushed the company towards being out of business. FTX had provided financial aid to BlockFi this summer, including a $400 million credit facility backed by its own balance sheet.

“We are shocked and dismayed by the news regarding FTX and Alameda,” BlockFi said Saturday, referring to FTX and Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund Alameda Research. “Given the lack of clarity on the status of FTX.com, FTX US and Alameda, we are not able to operate business as usual.”

Another crypto firm, crypto lending firm SALT Blockchain, also appeared to be on the verge of failure. The company Bnk to the Future pulled out of its agreement to buy SALT, citing its exposure to FTX. In tweets, SALT’s CEO Shawn Oren said he is “fully committed still to recover from the damages as victims.”

In a sign of how fearful investors are that the cascading effects could do long-term damage, cryptocurrency exchange Binance proposed the creation of a rescue fund that would save otherwise healthy crypto companies from failure. Binance’s founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao effectively laid out the possibility of a crypto-like central bank or deposit-insurance pool to be a lender of last resort to keep healthy firms from failing.

Meanwhile, FTX’s users bemoaned their losses in Telegram chat groups for traders who used the FTX exchange, writing that they’d lost access to amounts ranging from thousands to millions of dollars.

Some pleaded for information. Others speculated on the likelihood of getting back their funds, while others counseled that they should accept that their investments were gone.

Moderators for one group posted intermittently, saying things like, “No death threats please.” They wrote that they had no information about the whereabouts of Bankman-Fried or what would happen to his companies.

“No news,” posted one moderator.

Many of FTX’s users pointed to Bankman-Fried as responsible, making puns on his name like “Sam Bankrun-Fried” and calling for him to be prosecuted.

On Tuesday, a support account for FTX US was responding on Twitter to posts from people asking about their funds and directing them to send messages to the Twitter account to get assistance.

Mohit Sorout, 30, said he has lost access to 95% of the value of his cryptocurrency holdings when FTX halted its services last week, posting on Twitter , “The pain is f(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)ing real.”

An electrical engineer based between New Delhi and Dubai, he started trading in 2017 and quit his job in 2018 to work full time trading cryptocurrencies. Along with a business partner, he built a custom algorithm, and grew an investment of a couple thousand dollars into a sum many times that size, though he didn’t want to disclose the value of his holdings when he lost access to them.

It’s not clear what will happen to the funds of retail investors like Sorout, which are locked within the FTX ecosystem. His requests to withdraw the funds were not honored last week and now he can’t even log onto the exchange, he said on Monday.

Sorout didn’t intend to keep all of his investments on a single platform, he said, but the tools that FTX had built for traders like himself were very effective and his algorithm worked well there. He also trusted Bankman-Fried in part because of his high profile.

“The problem was the founder, who is donating eight figures in presidential campaigns, he’s meeting with the top bureaucrats, he is sponsoring chess tournaments, he’s out there sponsoring stadiums,” Sorout said. “You don’t really expect such a huge business, especially the CEO of that business, to defraud its customers, you know?”","Size, scope of FTX failure gets clearer as users fear worst - The Associated Press",https://apnews.com/article/cryptocurrency-technology-business-financial-crisis-a729281a5ef02a03ab3fcd95e152c2a8

Mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions (and a ""mining rig"" is a colloquial metaphor for a single computer system that performs the necessary computations for ""mining"". This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The blockchain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. Bitcoin nodes use the blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.

These courses provide an accessible and approachable opportunity for those looking to begin, or advance, their cybersecurity careers.

ThreatX is providing all foundational 100-level content at no charge. Training content spans many areas of cybersecurity, including Application Security, Data Protection and Privacy, Networking, Secure DevOps and Wireless Security, among others.

The need for cybersecurity professionals has been growing at a rapid pace, and that demand is expected to continue. The number of unfilled cybersecurity positions worldwide grew 350% between 2013 and 2021 (from 1 million to 3.5 million). Further, it is predicted that the same number of jobs will still be open in 2025.

This cybersecurity skills gap, along with the accelerated pace at which both technology and cyberattackers’ tactics are evolving, has made protecting digital assets increasingly difficult for businesses. In fact, 80% of organizations suffered one or more breaches due to a lack of cybersecurity skills and/or awareness within the last 12 months, underscoring the need for solid and robust training content.

Alongside Massachusetts-based training company, Security Innovation, ThreatX developed more than 140 hours of online security training videos beginning at an introductory level and progressing to more advanced subjects, such as Blockchain Security and Automating Security Updates.

All 100-level content will be available free of charge, while 200 and 300-level content will be accessible via subscription. Through the integrated learning management platform, users will be able to consume the content in sequential fashion and earn certifications.

The ThreatX Academy experience is powered by Raven360, a Massachusetts-based digital Academy business.

ThreatX will share all content, free of charge, with select nonprofit organizations, including participants of the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission’s (MRC) Networking Technology Program.

In addition, ThreatX Academy has partnered with (ISC)² and is now an approved ((ISC)² CPE Submitter Partner. ThreatX content may count toward (ISC)² CPE credits. (ISC)², is an international nonprofit cybersecurity professional organization.

Through (ISC)², members can earn several security certifications, including:

CISSP

Certified in Cybersecurity

SSCP – Security Administration

CCSP – Cloud Security

CSSLP – Software Security

In order to maintain these certifications, members must earn Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Credits. Through ThreatX’s partnership with (ISC)², security practitioners will now be able to earn CPE Credits for consuming ThreatX Academy content.

“Cybersecurity is a continuous learning experience, and the need for training resources in the industry is only growing stronger,” said Gene Fay, CEO of ThreatX.

“We are excited to announce the launch of ThreatX Academy, and we look forward to advancing the program in the future as part of our broader effort to close cybersecurity’s ongoing talent gap.”, he added.",ThreatX Academy increases access to cybersecurity expertise,https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/11/16/threatx-academy/

300,It's all too easy to believe in the illusion of neverending data storage and streaming. But it's destroying the natural world.,cloud computing,15/11/2022,"https://media.wired.com/photos/6372f5948cea9c334692604e/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/infinite-cloud-fantasy.jpg",wired,"Since the turn of the millennium, the tech industry has spent billions to conjure a seductive narrative that the cloud—a term most nontechnical people use to mean everything the internet touches —is limitless and weightless, that it is “greener,” more durable, and securer than the analog data storage practices that preceded it. They have trained us to upload, download, stream, post, and share to infinitum. In turn, we have come to expect seamless and instant access to digital content anytime, anywhere, as if data were immaterial.

What exactly is the cloud? Where does it begin or end? Is it the fiber optic cables that transmit our data packets across oceans and continents? Is it cellular towers and mobile phones? Is it servers whirring in the halls of data centers? Since 2015, I have been asking this question as an ethnographic researcher, shadowing technicians and interviewing executives and residents who live near digital infrastructure sites. I have found that the answer depends greatly on who you are asking. For the less technically minded person, the cloud is the entirety of the information and communications technology network (ICTs). In the data storage industry, the cloud refers to a specific class of ultra-efficient data centers called hyperscalers (which make up just over a third of data centers in operation), run by a handful of companies like Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Tencent, and Alibaba. In either case, the cloud is a metaphor we use to abbreviate the complexity of the infrastructures behind the digital sphere.

SUBSCRIBE Subscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.

That so many laypeople struggle to specify what the cloud is speaks to the dazzling success of Big Tech’s marketing, but also its careful obfuscation of the cloud’s material residues. In the wake of recent megadroughts, gigafires, heat domes, and hurricanes, however, this marketing illusion of an immaterial cloud is evaporating before our eyes. Thanks to the work of activists, scholars, and journalists, we know now that the cloud warms our skies and drains our watersheds. It pollutes our communities with electronic waste and harmful noise. It is an accomplice to global heating, desertification, and the toxification of our environment, an epoch and force that I call nubecene (nubes is Latin for “cloud”).

The cloud’s voracious expansion has not been met without resistance. In some communities, residents are organizing, citing pollution, power grid failures, excessive land use, or lack of job creation as reasons to oppose the construction of new data centers. Even so, the cloud’s exponential growth shows little sign of ebbing, which raises the question: Is it too late to fix it? What reforms can be implemented to curb the cloud’s increasing environmental impacts? Much of the work of activists has been devoted to answering these questions, but fewer are asking this: Is the cloud an inherently unsustainable paradigm? Must the cloud as we know it come to an end, for our collective survival?

Enter the Nubecene

Data centers are anything but homogenous. The first data center I visited was nothing like the sleek cyberpunk technoscape depicted in films or Google’s marketing content. Instead, I arrived in a crumbling shell of an office building, where racks of blinking servers were arrayed in opposing rows and columns, and cold air was pumped up from an air-conditioned plenum beneath the floor. A typical data center spans about 100,000 square feet, but I have been inside of facilities that are the size of a small home or as large as a university campus. The average data center can consume as much electricity as a small city in order to power and cool its computing equipment, drawing energy from electrical grids that in many parts of the world are coal-fired. To maintain our expectations for constant availability without as much as a hiccup, data centers run diesel generators in a state of hot-standby to supply power in the event of an electrical grid failure. The carbon dioxide trail thickens if you look at the footprint of facility construction or the supply chains of servers, power supplies, and other equipment that must be continuously cycled through the glittering halls of these facilities.

In an effort to minimize operational costs and reduce their carbon footprints, data centers are increasingly turning away from conventional computer room air conditioners (CRACs) as a cooling method. It takes a great deal of energy to refrigerate air, so more operators are resorting to a more efficient fluid medium for cooling computers: freshwater. Like humans, the thirst of servers can be quenched only with treated water, due to the corrosive effects of sediments on delicate electronics. Few facilities recycle their water, consuming millions of gallons per day to keep the cloud afloat. Others use chemicals to treat the water they cycle through their facilities, dumping the resulting wastewater into local watersheds with unknown effects to local ecosystems, as has reportedly occurred in the Netherlands. In places like the American southwest, which is currently experiencing a megadrought spurred by climate change, data centers are flocking to Arizona’s desert, lured by tax breaks and business-friendly legislation and seemingly unhindered by the catastrophic threat they pose to local populations and ecosystems. There, data centers are guzzling water to cool servers in stressed watersheds, while farmers are being asked to ration water. Arizona, where I spent six months researching data centers as an ethnographer, is not an outlier but part of a wider trend of data centers taking root near vulnerable watersheds.

As part of my dissertation research on the cloud’s ecological footprint, I visited and worked inside data centers in Iceland and, within the US, New England, Arizona, and Puerto Rico. Working as a novice technician, I helped decommission servers that reached the end of their warrantied lifespans (an average of three years). I unplugged, unscrewed, and hauled cart upon teetering cart of bulky servers, magnetizing their drives to securely erase their contents before stacking them in discard heaps. In the weeks before the waste removal subcontractor’s truck arrived to cart them away, I witnessed my colleagues pilfering valuable chips or graphic cards from the husks of these condemned computers, a shadow salvage economy that was certainly illegal but not penalized, given the fate of the electronic waste. The United Nations estimates that less than 20 percent of electronic waste is recycled annually. Millions of metric tons of expired electronics with toxic components are disposed informally in computer graveyards in places like Ghana, Burundi, or China, where salvagers (often women and children) smelt them down to retrieve rare metals, poisoning watersheds, soils, and their own bodies in the process.",The Infinite Cloud Is a Fantasy,https://www.wired.com/story/cloud-data-storage-climate/

BRUSSELS, Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) is seeking European Union antitrust approval for its $61 billion bid for cloud computing company VMware (VMW.N), Broadcom said on Tuesday in a statement.

""We are confident that this deal does not present any competition issues and look forward to working with the European Commission throughout this process"", the company said.

The EU competition watchdog will decide by Dec. 20 whether to clear the deal. It can open a four-month investigation if it has serious concerns.

Announced in May, the deal is the second biggest globally so far this year and marks Broadcom's attempt to diversify its business into enterprise software.

Tech deals have drawn intense scrutiny from regulators around the world concerned about power being concentrated in a few players and the possibility of bigger companies acquiring startups only to shut them down.

303,MotherDuck's ability to spin up DuckDB instances and query data where it is nets the company new funding and a $175 million valuation.,cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1344617573.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

Today, startup analytics platform MotherDuck revealed it has received $47.5 million in funding. That figure includes $35 million in Series A funding and $12.5 million in seed funding, for a total valuation of $175 million.

The company’s founders have worked at some of the most notable organizations in the tech industry, including BigQuery, Amazon Web Services, Databricks and Snowflake. MotherDuck’s solution pairs the functionality of DuckDB with a scale-up approach to collaborative cloud analytics.

Its value proposition, of painlessly querying data where it is, is based on the notion that the size of data involved in such computations isn’t as important as the ease of use. According to MotherDuck CEO Jordan Tigani, who was one of BigQuery’s founding engineers, “Everybody’s focused on this scale-out big data. That’s actually not what’s important. It’s like, can you make it easy? Can you make it simple so people can ask questions and get their answers?”

Several aspects of MotherDuck are designed to do just that. The platform couples serverless computing architecture with what Tigani termed “a hybrid engine that combines local and server side execution.” Consequently, users can query data where it is—at the edge, on laptops, in data lakes or in popular frameworks like Python and Tableau.

Moreover, they can do so without elaborate (and costly) data pipelines, while minimizing data movement and utilizing query optimizations to maximize the user experience.

MotherDuck: Queries on demand

DuckDB’s lightweight imprint and rapid processing is central to MotherDuck’s query-in-place approach. When users issue queries, MotherDuck spins up a DuckDB instance “in 30 milliseconds or less,” Tigani estimated. “Human reaction time won’t even know it happened.” The instance remains as long as the session lasts, enabling the solution to utilize caching and in-memory approaches to optimize performance. The platform enables organizations to scale up or down as needed. Users can store data in the cloud with MotherDuck “just like you can with Snowflake, BigQuery and Redshift,” Tigani said. “We do have separation of storage and compute so you can scale up the compute independently of the storage infrastructure.”

A key point of distinction between MotherDuck’s method and that of the established cloud data warehouse Tigani named is that with the former, individual users get respective instances. “So, you only have to scale up to the size of each individual user’s workload,” Tigani commented. This approach assists with concurrency and cost reductions, since organizations don’t have monthly costs regardless of how much (or little) they use their data in other cloud warehouses.

>>Don’t miss our new special issue: Zero trust: The new security paradigm.<<

Local querying

Many of MotherDuck’s ease-of-use benefits pertain to its local querying capabilities—which are again traced to DuckDB’s utility. Every MotherDuck client will run DuckDB. It’s possible to run the database in browsers and connectors. This functionality enables business intelligence and data science platforms like Tableau and Python to run DuckDB locally, as well. It also means edge devices, such as laptops, can use MotherDuck to run DuckDB locally. “We can actually push data down to the end user,” Tigani revealed. “With DuckDB you can have all of the code locally so you can do a lot of work without hitting any kind of server.”

The possibilities this model enables are significant, if not novel. Users could download a Salesforce report on their laptops as a CSV file, for example, and start asking questions—without configuring data pipelines and moving data to a warehouse. Similarly, developers can ask questions of data locally to begin using it to impact code creation for applications—simply, quickly, and without the complicated infrastructure of pipelines and cloud warehouses. “That’s a lot of work to get some basic questions answered,” Tigani remarked about the pipeline approach.

Ensuing implications

Granted, numerous aspects of data governance, regulatory compliance, and auditing must be answered to fully exploit MotherDuck’s edge computing potential. But its basic value proposition to the enterprise is difficult to deny. Laptops today are more powerful than they ever were before (Tigani called them “supercomputers”). The sizes of data individual users require isn’t always at the scale of big data.

With conventional methods, “If I run a query against Redshift and it takes five seconds, my supercomputer is sitting idle, while this expensive cloud hardware is being used,” Tigani said. MotherDuck is attempting to invert this paradigm to lower costs and make the query process—and data management itself—simple via local computations and minimal data movement.

As the company’s funding announcement and valuation seem to imply, there is an audience with more than an academic interest in the matter.","MotherDuck announces query-in-place capabilities, $47.5 Million in funding",https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/motherduck-announces-query-in-place-capabilities-47-5-million-in-funding/

With a long history as one of the world’s top financial capitals, this is a costly place to live.The city tied for 17th place with Helsinki, a notoriously expensive location, in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) Worldwide Cost of Living index in 2021.

The index is compiled by comparing prices in US dollars for goods and services in 173 global cities. While this is just one indication that London is a pricey place to live and work, there are plenty of others.

A 2019 survey from SpareRoom found that 33% of people aged 20 to 30 living in the city didn’t have access to a living room. Rental costs are rocketing, says property website Rightmove: in July this year, average monthly rent in London reached an all-time high of £2,257, or 11.8% higher than last year.

Then there’s inflation and the cost of goods and services to contend with. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) suggests that web-scraped supermarket data for 30 everyday grocery items indicates that the lowest-priced items have gone up by 17% in the 12 months to September 2022.

While London has long been hailed as a mecca for talent, thanks to the sheer scale of opportunities on offer plus its unrivalled access to culture and nightlife, other factors beyond the price of milk, bread, and rent are now clamouring for attention. Brexit, in particular, has reduced the size of the opportunity here with about 44% of UK-based financial services firms moving or planning to move some of their operations or staff to the EU, according to EY.

Rising layoffs among tech companies, political uncertainty — the UK is on its fifth prime minister in just six years — and a looming recession are not helping either. The ONS reported that Britain’s economy shrank in the three months to September, ushering in what is expected to be the beginning of a recession.

But despite all that, there are still plenty of opportunities. The key for workers is to focus on areas of stable growth, and careers within those sectors. Here are three sectors with high growth potential for 2023.

Cybersecurity

Following on from the UK’s initial National Cyber Security Strategy 2016 to 2021, the government launched the National Cyber Strategy 2022, which sets out a five-pillar approach to protecting and promoting the U.K.’s interests in cyberspace. The plan aims to shape its cyber sector so that it can stay ahead of adversaries, strengthen its abilities, and influence and shape tomorrow’s technologies so they are safe, secure, and open.

As a result, the U.K. is developing domain excellence in cybersecurity with companies such as BAE Systems, Clearswift, Sophos, and PwC leading the field. As we move towards an increasing level of digitization, digital security becomes increasingly important to secure our data in the first instance, and also protect it from attack.

Cybersecurity jobs are particularly prevalent in the financial and fintech sectors, but are becoming more and more common across the workforce to secure sensitive data in healthcare and education.

This essential sector doesn’t look like it is going anywhere. If you’re looking to build your career further in this sector, Citi is seeking a Head of Network Security Services in London. You’ll have end-to-end responsibilities for engineering and operations of network security services and will ensure a service-oriented organization that meets the business needs of a digital bank.

Cloud

Gartner reports that worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services is forecast to grow 20.4% this year, with spending expected to reach nearly £489 billion by 2023.

The big boom in cloud adoption was driven by the pandemic: In April 2020, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella said, “We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months.” That rapid pace has only continued as businesses first introduced remote working and now hybrid and flexible options.

As a result, this is a great area for career growth. A recent report from Public First and AWS found that digital technology could grow the UK economy by over £413 billion by 2030, which is more than twice the annual output of the UK’s manufacturing sector (£183 billion). The research also revealed that cloud computing will play an integral role in underpinning the technology stack that will enable the UK’s digital future.

Interesting jobs at companies large and small are available. Google has a Cloud Security Consultant role in its Google Cloud Professional Services division on offer in London, for example. You’ll provide advice and guidance to customers adopting Google Cloud Platform services, and work with them to design and develop cloud security architectures and solutions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

A recent study from software analytics company, SAS, assessed the AI-readiness of London’s boroughs, discovering that Camden, Westminster, and Hackney came in the top three places. The study looked at the number of AI-related jobs, R&D spend, GDP, business growth, and the number of relevant academic courses available within each area. In 2021, the city was home to 1,300 AI companies, or 65% of the entire UK AI industry ecosystem, with companies including Brainpool.ai, iTransition and Signal AI.

The government wants to make the UK a “global AI superpower” and aims to do that with its 10-year National AI Strategy, which will place a wider focus on AI and data science skills, recognizing how these can be used to increase resilience, productivity, growth, and innovation across both the private and public sectors.

If you’re looking for an AI or machine learning role in London right now, you’re in luck as any number of companies are hiring. For example, check out Amazon EU SARL which is seeking a Machine Learning Scientist. You’ll be building state-of-the-art machine learning systems for the most complex, and fastest growing transportation network in the world and focus on the development and research of machine learning solutions and algorithms for core planning systems.

Watch now.

One of the hottest trends in artificial intelligence (AI) this year has been the emergence of popular generative AI models. With technologies including DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, there are a growing number of startups and use cases that are emerging.

Generative AI builds on a number of foundational technologies including the use of transformer models. The use of transformers for generative AI and other use cases can be resource intensive on the inference side, where systems predict and build out the results of a model.

Among the vendors that is building technology to help accelerate AI inference for transformer models is startup d-Matrix, which raised $44 million in a series A round of funding in April to help build out its AI accelerator hardware technology. The company has developed a digital in-memory compute (DIMC) technology that isn’t publicly available yet, but it’s already gotten the attention of Microsoft.

Microsoft and d-Matrix today announced that the Microsoft Project Bonsai reinforcement learning will be supported on the d-Matrix DIMC technology, which the two vendors hope will provide a significant acceleration for AI inference.

“Project Bonsai is a platform which enables our version of deep reinforcement learning and we call it machine teaching,” Kingsuk Maitra, principal applied AI engineer at Microsoft, told VentureBeat. “We have trained a compiler for d-Matrix’s one-of-a-kind digital in-memory compute technology and the early results are very encouraging.”

What Microsoft’s Project Bonsai is all about

Project Bonsai has been in development at Microsoft for the last several years and is currently available as a preview.

Maitra said that the goal of the effort is to abstract away the complexities that are associated with deep reinforcement learning networks. An initial target for Project Bonsai is industrial controls, including chip design and manufacturing. Part of the technology is a capability to train models using a high-level language developed at Microsoft Project Bonsai called Inkling to train deep reinforcement agents to do control tasks.

Deep reinforcement learning doesn’t require labeled data, Maitra explained. Rather, it essentially learns with feedback from the environment, which can be emulated with a simulator. At the end of a training loop, the result is a trained reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which Microsoft refers to as “brains.” The brains, when deployed, can take meaningful actions to complete the task at hand.

“We are running active real-life workloads and training the compiler, relative to those real-life workloads, most of them with well-known large language models with different Bonsai brains,” Maitra said.

The d-Matrix Corsair is coming in 2023

Currently d-Matrix doesn’t have any chips that are publicly available, but the first one, code-named Corsair, is set to debut in 2023.

“We’re building an accelerated computing platform for transformers and specifically focused around generative AI,” Sudeep Bhoja, cofounder, CTO at d-Matrix told VentureBeat.

Bhoja explained that the chips that d-Matrix is developing can be built in a very modular way and could be packaged together with a CPU or could be integrated on a PCI card that plugs into a server in the cloud. The d-Matrix technology is designed to help accelerate AI inference, with its DIMC technology that provides high performance and low latency.

With Microsoft’s Project Bonsai, d-Matrix now has a compiler that can build deep reinforcement learning tools for its silicon. A key end goal for d-Matrix is to help support the continued growth and deployment of generative AI models.

“We want to enable [generative AI models] because it takes a lot of processing power, there are latency constraints and it is user facing,” Bhoja said. “You have to be able to do it in a very energy-efficient way so that the data centers don’t have to bring in more power….”",New Microsoft partnership accelerates generative AI development,https://venturebeat.com/ai/new-microsoft-partnership-accelerates-generative-ai-development/

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is a dreamer who turned a bold idea into one of the world's most admired brands. When Bezos took the company public in 1997, he began writing annual letters to shareholders, a habit that continued until he stepped aside as CEO in 2021.

Bezos wrote just over 48,000 words in all. His letters fueled Amazon's growth and created innovative communication strategies.

""The Bezos letters give us a unique opportunity to see a genius explain his work,"" says Jean-Louise Gassee, a former Apple executive and Silicon Valley venture capitalist. ""The letters would make splendid material for a business school course on strategy and communication.""

Thankfully, you won't need to wait for a business school to offer a class on the Bezos letters. I did the analysis in my new book, The Bezos Blueprint.

1. Make the mission your mantra

In his first letter, Bezos laid out the principle that would drive the company's decisions for the next quarter century: customer obsession.

Bezos formalized the principle into the company's mission two years later when he wrote that Amazon was on a quest to build ""Earth's most customer-centric company.""

A company's mission statement means very little without a repeater-in-chief who explains and amplifies the mission at every opportunity. For example, Bezos cited the ""customer"" 506 times across 24 letters, an average of 21 times per letter. He credited the mission for creating Amazon's secret sauce, ""the number one thing that has made us successful.""

2. Use simple words to talk about hard things

A full 70% of Bezos' letters are easy to read for most people with an eighth or ninth-grade education (13 to 15 years old). Remarkably, as Amazon grew larger and infinitely more complex, Bezos chose simpler words to express big ideas.

For example, in the 2007 letter (written in eighth-grade language) Bezos described the Kindle e-reader for the first time — using almost entirely one and two-syllable words:

""If you come across a word you don't recognize, you can look it up easily. You can search your books…If your eyes are tired, you can change the font size. Our vision for Kindle is every book ever printed in any language, all available in less than 60 seconds.""

When you write simply, you're not dumbing down the content. You're outsmarting the competition.

3. Use the active voice (most of the time)

Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in 1994. The previous sentence is ""active"" because the subject (Bezos) performs the action (founded). The passive form of the sentence is: Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994.

Stephen King blames the passive voice for ruining ""just about any business document ever written."" Bezos must have read King's advice because passive sentences make up just 6.5% of the text in his shareholder letters.

Sentences written in the active voice require fewer words, get to the point faster, and are easier to understand. Strive to write in the active voice as much as possible.

4. Master the metaphor

Bezos named his company Amazon because it acted as a metaphor, a comparison between two things that share similarities. In 1998, Bezos explained that he wanted to communicate that Amazon the company is ""Earth's biggest bookstore"" just as the Amazon in South America is ""Earth's biggest river.""

Neuroscientists say that the human brain evolved to use metaphors to communicate and process the world around them. When we encounter something new, our brains kick into gear and search for familiar comparisons. Good communicators do the work for their readers and listeners, using metaphors as education instruments.

Bezos filled his letters with carefully-chosen metaphors to explain complex ideas. He introduced flywheels to propel growth, created two-pizza teams, and hired missionaries over mercenaries.

Aristotle once called metaphor a speaker's ""most formidable weapon,"" and Bezos wielded it like a master.

5. Recognize that good writing takes time

In the summer of 2004, Bezos made a decision that rattled his leadership team. He banned PowerPoint. He replaced presentations with ""narratively structured six-page memos.""

In his 2017 shareholder letter, Bezos explained that while the quality of written memos varies widely, some have ""the clarity of angels singing.""

Writing is hard, and good writing takes time, Bezos explained. He said people mistakenly believe that a six-pager that meets high stands can be written in a day, or even a few hours.

""It really might take a week or more,"" Bezos said. ""The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can't be done in a day or two.""

6. Surround yourself with superstars

In his 1998 letter, Bezos revealed the questions Amazon hiring managers ask themselves when they evaluate job applicants.

Will you admire this person? Bezos says he always tries to work with people he can learn from or look up to as an example of excellence.

Will this person raise the effectiveness of the group? If you want to be successful in life or your career, hang around people who challenge you to be your best self.

On what dimension will the person be a superstar? Spend your time around superstars who inspire you to aim higher than you've ever dreamed

7. Work backward to get ahead

Bezos challenged his executives to work backward from the customer's perspective by writing a mock press release before building a product.

""Kindle is a good example of our fundamental approach,"" Bezos wrote in 2008. More than four years before the introduction of the product, the Kindle team wrote a press release that read: ""Every book, ever printed, in any language, all available in less than 60 seconds.""

Before engineers write a line of code at Amazon, they start with a press release. According to CEO Andy Jassy, who wrote a press release years before launching AWS, Amazon's giant cloud-computing division, ""The press release is designed to flush out all the benefits of the product to make sure that you're really solving the customer problem.""

8. Maintain a ""Day 1"" culture

Beginning in 1998, Bezos attached a copy of his first letter with the reminder, ""It's always Day 1.""

Day 1 is not a thing — it's a mindset that stands for obsessing over the customer, thinking long term, and bolding innovating to meet the customer's needs.

Bezos revealed what ""Day 2"" looked like in 2016. Bezos wrote, ""Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.""

Jeff Bezos ran Amazon for 9,863 days, but he always showed up to work on day one. By referencing Day 1 with striking consistency, Bezos turned a metaphor from a figure of speech into a blueprint on how to think, act, and lead.

There was a lot to unpack from this report. Consumer demand in the personal computer sector has been weak for the last several quarters, and management believes this trend will continue due to cyclical trends such as inflation.

Moreover, the company's social networking platform, LinkedIn, is experiencing a decline in advertising revenue, which isn't entirely surprising given the overall waning demand for ad spending.

However, the beauty of a company like Microsoft is that the company has a number of different levers to generate revenue. And despite the macro environment affecting its core hardware and advertising businesses, there is one end market that seems to be resilient even during times of economic volatility. In this article, we are going to analyze Microsoft's cloud business and how its growth should encourage long-term investors.

Unpacking the big picture

For the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2022, Microsoft reported $50.1 billion in total revenue, up 11% year over year. The primary laggards during the current quarter were the company's gaming services and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) segments, which declined 3% and 15%, respectively. Additionally, devices only increased 2% annually due to weakening demand for the company's flagship hardware product, Surface.

At first glance, this can appear alarming for investors. After all, Microsoft made a name for itself with popular products like Xbox and other hardware. However, the company's CEO Satya Nadella did a nice job of explaining the current economic climate by stating, ""based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader commercial business to grow at around 20% in constant currency this fiscal year, as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our consumer business.""

Microsoft's CFO, Amy Hood, echoed Nadella when she stated:

The PC market is cyclical. And we had some great benefits for a couple of years during the pandemic, and we chose not to spend against that favorability over the past couple of years, and it fell to the bottom line, and you saw substantially increased margins over that time period. And we did that potentially because it is a cyclical market. And so in the same way I see it now is that PCs are going to be a tough headwind for us for the year.

Nadella and Hood illustrate that while the consumer business battles lingering market conditions, namely from inflation impacting spending habits, the overall picture for the company appears quite strong. Additionally, it should not be entirely surprising that the personal computing market has cooled down as consumers around the globe ratcheted up their hardware needs during the peak days of the COVID-19 pandemic and remote work. While working from home is still common, consumer needs for additional devices such as laptops has plateaued.

Another segment where Microsoft is experiencing headwinds is LinkedIn. It's important to note that LinkedIn's quarterly revenue increased 17% year over year, which was ahead of management's expectations. However, Hood made it clear that investors should temper expectations for LinkedIn when she said, ""reductions in customer advertising spend, which also weakened later in the quarter, impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions.""

It is important for investors to remember that the above statements and figures all apply to Microsoft's consumer business. The company also has a large commercial business that is thriving. Let's analyze how and why Microsoft's commercial business seems to outmaneuver the current cyclical dynamics of the market.

The power of the cloud

Cloud computing has become a pillar of modern-day enterprise. Companies rely on data to make decisions, demand top-notch security modules to protect devices such as laptops or phones, and need to be able to communicate with team members around the world seamlessly and efficiently. The power of the cloud provides all of these functions.

For this reason, despite tightening corporate budgets in areas such as advertising, companies like Microsoft, and its competition in Amazon and Alphabet, still generate strong demand from commercial cloud needs. Stated differently, lingering inflation and the prospects of recession are not enough to deter a corporation's need to invest in a scaling cloud business.

A cloud instance can help organizations move forward with existing infrastructure in a more efficient and secure way. For example, one of the biggest selling points for Microsoft Cloud is that Azure can integrate with both SAP and Oracle. This means that companies that use SAP for their workloads or Oracle databases can access sensitive information horizontally, across the organization, among different product groups and do so in a secure environment.

Valuation looks attractive

The notion of valuation can be tricky. It can be tempting to buy a stock that appears cheap due to its low price or pass up on a stock because it seems expensive. And while there is a multitude of valuation methodologies, for a mature and consistently profitable business like Microsoft, price to earnings is usually an acceptable multiple to analyze.

As of the time of this writing, Microsoft is trading at 26 times price to earnings. While this is lower than the 35 times it was trading at during this time last year, Microsoft is definitely commanding a premium. For reference, the long-run average of the S&P 500 is between 15 and 16 times price to earnings.

However, when it comes to Microsoft, there certainly is more than meets the eye. As I've written about previously regarding Alphabet and Amazon, big-tech cloud businesses can almost be thought of as high-growth start-ups operating within a mature business.

For the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2022, Microsoft reported $25.7 billion in cloud revenue, up 24% year over year. Given management's bullish outlook on the commercial business, it is not out of the question for Microsoft to generate $100 billion of annualized revenue for the cloud business alone. Microsoft's current market capitalization is $1.8 trillion.

Similar to what hedge fund analyst Daniel Loeb did for Amazon Web Services, in a scenario where Azure represents just 10% of Microsoft's total value, that implies the cloud could become a $200 billion revenue stream. Given the positive momentum the company has in the cloud, coupled with management's outlook, the rate at which the cloud is growing most likely makes Azure worth materially more than 10% of Microsoft. For this reason, even though the company's overall multiple appears a bit expensive, it's key to remember that it has a multi-hundred billion business that is growing and has not yet peaked. Given these robust growth prospects, Microsoft certainly looks like a compelling long-term buy.",The Multibillion Business Inside of Microsoft That No One Is Talking About,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/the-multibillion-business-inside-of-microsoft-that/

The growing field of generative AI

Generative AI is a hotly-discussed topic of late: Next-gen tools are seeing significant gains in just a short period of time.

Just this week, IMARC Group released a study forecasting the global generative AI market size to exhibit a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 20% between 2022 and 2027.

As noted by Gartner distinguished VP analyst, Arun Chandrasekaran, much of the technology progress in generative AI owes its origins to technical advancements in its underpinning foundation models.

Large labs, including OpenAI, Google Brain and Microsoft Research, are deploying vast resources to build these large-scale models, he said, and cloud computing provides a “tremendous avenue” for them to reach developers who want to try them without spending too much money or undergoing complex training.

Thus, use cases are expanding, Chandrasekaran pointed out. For instance, due to advances in prompt engineering, foundation models are capable of generating “original and coherent text in a highly contextualized way,” he said, which lends itself to use cases including writing headlines and paragraphs, creating product descriptions, generating conversational responses and completing text.

Foundation models are also increasingly being used in broader natural language capacities, such as summarization, rewriting, language translation and classification. And, fine-tuned diffusion models such as Dall-E 2 and Stable Diffusion are creating images from text, which can be extremely useful for synthetic data generation for scenarios where real data is scarce or unavailable.

“The image generation capabilities could positively affect design and marketing functions within the enterprise,” Chandrasekaran said, “enabling them to create faster and better visuals for websites, blogs, ads and other content.”

Chandrasekaran forecasted that generative AI use cases where humans act as filters — aiding in content creation — will be adopted far more quickly than automatic content creation. As an augmentation technology to human tasks, he noted, there will be rapid adoption of foundation models in the next few years.

“In the future, we will see more use case-specific models as well as more innovation in the open-source community,” said Chandrasekaran, “which will hopefully enhance the access and transparency of these models.”

A new kind of video editor

When it comes to video and generative AI, Descript calls itself a “new kind of video editor that’s as easy as using a word processor.”

The company’s platform enables users to record themselves and their screen, write, storyboard, collaborate and edit in real time. For instance, they can remove silence and filler words (like the above-mentioned podcaster), overdub and add crossfades, titles, shapes and images.

As LeBoeuf explained, the company uses AI to create a text-to-speech voice that sounds like a user, so they can make corrections to recordings by deleting or typing in new words (as one would with a doc). The Studio Sound feature addresses issues around technical problems that creators struggle with, such as poor sound quality caused by an echoey room or bad mic.

“These are very practical use cases that enable a new class of people to edit video for whom it would have been prohibitively time-consuming otherwise,” said LeBoeuf.

Akin to making a slideshow, any creator in any type of workflow can create anything from simple screen recordings, all the way up to sophisticated narratives, with multiple layers of video, b-roll and audio, with video and audio effects and transitions, said LeBoeuf.

The company has quickly made progress improving its AI features, he said, and has reduced the length of time users need to set up their voice in Overdub, its text-to-speech voice-cloning service.

LeBoeuf pointed out that Descript powers many YouTube and TikTok channels, “9 out of the 10 top podcast publishers.” As well as businesses, including Shopify and HubSpot, that use video for marketing, sales and internal training and collaboration.

“The stage is set for video to take its place alongside text as something everyone uses to create and communicate — the only things holding it back are the tools,” said Andrew Mason, Descript CEO. “With the new Descript, we’ve replaced the drudgery of timeline editing with a tool that’s as familiar as the word processor — so you can make, edit and share video without breaking your creative flow.”

Similarly, one of Descript’s competitors, Runway, recently rolled out a tool that can edit video from written prompts; others in the emerging space include Type Studio and Reduct.

Empowering creation with generative AI

Descript’s enhanced platform now includes more than 30 new visual and AI-powered editing tools, including:

Premium stock media: Free access to millions of premium stock videos, images, sound effects and music tracks.

Templates: A gallery of layouts, title sequences and social clips (or creators can make their own).

Multitrack screen recording: Descript’s recorder is now integrated into the editor, with separate tracks for screen and camera.

Green screen: Creators can put their videos in any setting with AI background-removal capabilities.

Write mode: Creators can use Overdub to write their script in Descript while laying out visuals as they go. Then, they can choose one of its realistic text-to-speech voices, or swap it out with their own recording.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s COO and manager of the OpenAI Startup Fund, lauded Descript for bridging the divide between idea and creation.

“We started the OpenAI Startup Fund to accelerate the impact that companies building on powerful AI will have on the world,” he said, “and we’re particularly excited about tools that empower people creatively.”

Andreessen Horowitz, Redpoint Ventures, Spark Capital and Daniel Gross also participated in the round, which brings the company’s total funding to $100 million.",How Descript’s generative AI makes video editing as easy as updating text,https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-descripts-generative-ai-makes-video-editing-as-easy-as-updating-text/
312,"The cloud is big and only getting bigger, and DigitalOcean has a lot to gain in the coming years.",cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/709250/three-people-using-laptop-computers-in-a-coffee-shop.jpg,motley fool,"Many expected DigitalOcean (DOCN 4.68%) to disappoint in the second half of 2022. With global economic conditions worsening, this small cloud computing infrastructure service could easily have shrunk back. After all, it focuses on small businesses -- which many investors view as getting hit hardest by a deteriorating economy (versus larger and slower-moving big businesses). And DigitalOcean's high rate of international revenue was never going to help either, not with the U.S. dollar on a record run-up (which lowers the value of overseas sales).

Instead, DigitalOcean surprised the naysayers during its Q3 2022 report and showed it is more than keeping up with its cloud titan peers. In fact, this one metric shows just how well it's doing right now.

What economic slowdown?

DigitalOcean reported total revenue growth of 37% in Q3 2022, or 33% on an organic basis (excluding the acquisition of cloud hosting service Cloudways back in September). What's impressive about the 33% rise is that it was an acceleration from 29% in Q2. That stands in contrast to the cloud titans Amazon (AMZN 1.00%) Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT 1.04%) Azure, both of which decelerated in the third quarter of the calendar year compared to earlier in the year. Alphabet's (GOOGL 1.45%) (GOOG 1.53%) Google Cloud, also far smaller than AWS and Azure, also notched a healthy acceleration in cloud infrastructure growth in Q3.

Company Q3** 2022 Revenue Q3** 2022 Revenue Growth (YOY)

Q2** 2022 Revenue Growth (YOY)

DigitalOcean* $148 million 33% 29% Amazon AWS $20.5 billion 27% 33% Microsoft Azure Not reported*** 35% (Azure-only growth) 40% (Azure-only growth) Google Cloud $6.87 billion 38% 36%

Of course, this is just one quarter of results. DigitalOcean could see weakness in its financials going forward, especially if the U.S. dollar continues to take a heavy toll on revenue from outside the U.S. But as of right now, DigitalOcean is looking incredibly resilient. The outlook for the final quarter of 2022 implies year-over-year revenue growth of 34% at the midpoint of guidance -- hardly a picture of a business struggling against uncertain economic conditions.

Is DigitalOcean stock a buy?

DigitalOcean CEO Yancey Spruill noted on the earnings call that it's too soon to say when weakness in the global economy will ease. However, the fact business is holding up well in spite of various issues is notable. As Spruill pointed out, many investors view small and medium-sized businesses (or ""SMBs,"" companies with under 500 employees) as being particularly vulnerable to economic downturns.

Thus far, DigitalOcean's revenue growth would prove otherwise. SMBs are nimble, and in the face of uncertainty can quickly pivot. Moving operations to the cloud is a way to save money, and clearly many SMBs are choosing DigitalOcean to cater to their digital needs.

To capture expected demand in the coming years, DigitalOcean is working on new specific use cases for its platform (like upping its game in data storage). It's also expanding its geographic footprint, like the recent opening of a new data center in Australia. All the while DigitalOcean is still able to maintain robust profitability. Free cash flow was $22.4 million in Q3, or just shy of a 15% profit margin.

After the last earnings update, DigitalOcean stock trades for over 85 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. That's a steep premium, especially in these market conditions that have put profitability under a microscope. Nevertheless, if you think DigitalOcean can continue to grow sales at about a 30% pace, and continue to increase its profit margins along the way, this is a quality cloud computing platform to invest in for the long-term. I continue to nibble on this stock, building a larger position over time as I expect the cloud industry to continue expanding at a rapid pace for the rest of the 2020s.",1 Impressive Metric Shows How Well DigitalOcean Is Doing -- Is the Stock a Buy?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/impressive-metric-how-well-digitalocean-stock-buy/
313,The company is doubling down on its most important growth driver in times of crisis.,cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/709033/business-presentation-investing.jpg,motley fool,"Of all the tech titan stocks that have been clobbered this year, Amazon (AMZN 1.00%) is arguably one of the more surprising losers. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud computing giant have fallen over 40% so far in 2022. That fall comes despite Amazon holding onto the retail gains it picked up during pandemic lockdowns, and the continual growth in its AWS cloud segment by a strong double-digit percentage.

Investors weren't pleased with the Q3 2022 report. Management indicated more slowing growth could lie ahead as a record run-up in the dollar (a result of the U.S. Federal Reserve's huge interest rate increases this year). But, despite this weakness, Amazon is putting massive amounts of cash to work to bolster its most important business. Is now a once-in-a-decade buying opportunity for this top tech stock?

Re-allocating investments from e-commerce to tech

Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on the last earnings call that the company was going to wind up allocating about $60 billion on capital expenditures (or capex, spending on property, plant, and equipment) in 2022. This figure is roughly in-line with capex spend in 2021, even though Amazon's growth has slowed significantly. This level of capex also dwarfs the capex spend of fellow tech titans -- even Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and its huge bill on data center equipment in support of its metaverse aspirations.

Why does Amazon spend so much more on capex than its peers? For one thing, Amazon isn't just tech. It's also an online retailer. While an online store like Amazon looks like an asset-light business, it isn't. Behind the scenes, Amazon has been spending heavily on things like distribution centers and delivery services to accommodate the explosion of sales it picked up in 2020 and 2021.

But there's something interesting going on with Amazon's capex. Specific numbers were not revealed, but Olsavsky said that $10 billion in capex has been reduced from fulfillment and transportation projects as e-commerce has quieted down. However, that $10 billion has been reallocated to ""technology infrastructure, primarily to support the rapid growth, innovation and continued expansion of ... [its] AWS footprint.""

Betting big on the business that matters most

This is incredibly significant, especially considering that the AWS cloud computing segment is -- and has been for years now -- the primary engine of Amazon's profitable growth. You see, as great as a seemingly endless collection of products and fast delivery times may be, e-commerce just isn't all that profitable a business for Amazon. Add-on services via Amazon Prime and selling ads within its marketplace are. But at the end of the day, it's AWS that's generating the positive income.

Amazon Segment First Nine Months 2022 Operating Income (Loss) Operating Margin (as % of Segment Revenue) North America ($2.61 billion) -1.2% International ($5.52 billion) -6.6% AWS $17.6 billion 30%

But why allocate so much extra capex to AWS now, especially given the tough economic climate we're weathering right now? After all, lots of companies out there are cutting spending to boost profits. It was even reported that AWS customers have been working with the company to reduce their spending on the cloud right now, by switching to lower-cost computing workloads and services.

As a result, while AWS has grown revenue by 32% so far in 2022, management indicated Q4 year-over-year growth was trending toward just a mid-20% growth rate. Meanwhile, Amazon has dipped deep into the red as it puts lots of money to work to promote future (and uncertain) growth. Free cash flow (operating income minus capex) was negative $26 billion over the last 12 month stretch.

Nevertheless, Amazon sees a big opportunity, so it's expanding its cloud footprint into new geographies and bolstering its capabilities in existing data centers. Just as disruption from the pandemic forced many organizations around the globe to accelerate their adoption of the cloud, Olsavsky said inflation (especially in energy and computing hardware costs) is having a similar disruptive impact right now. By switching their tech infrastructure to a cloud provider like AWS, a company can ultimately get more flexible with, or reduce, their expenses. Olsavsky explained:

[T]he benefit of cloud computing is really showing up right now because we allow customers to turn what can normally be a fixed expense into a variable expense, and they can let us manage the highs and lows of inflation and other cost of electricity and everything else. And they can get ... to do their business using our services in a very highly secure way. So I think just like in 2020, these time periods are good for long-term adoption on cloud computing. But the offset in the short run is that some companies have demand that drops.

Long story short, Amazon sees behavior-altering changes happening in the economy right now, which spells opportunity for AWS to get aggressive and acquire lots of new customers. Wall Street clearly isn't comfortable with the company spending so heavily, but what else is new? This is far from uncharted territory for Jeff Bezos' empire. If AWS's expansion right now pays off like it has in times past, Amazon stock's giant drop this year can mean opportunity for farsighted investors as well.

Of course, since Amazon has fallen into unprofitability at the moment, it's difficult to accurately stick a fair value on shares. However, management also said it expects to taper down its aggressive spending in the coming years, which would create some earnings leverage. In other words, this stock is incredibly cheap right now. That is of course, assuming you think Amazon's profitability, as measured by earnings per share, will sharply spike at some point in the next couple of years, and then level back off to a high single-digit or low-teens percentage growth rate after that. (Or if you think free cash flow will spike and turn positive again).

New York, Nov. 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Cloud Computing Platform Market by Service Model, by Deployment Model, Organization Size, Vertical And Region - Global Forecast to 2027"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05749258/?utm_source=GNW





As per the service model, IaaS to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period

As per the service model, Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is estimated to hold the highest Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 22.5% in the cloud computing platform market. Cloud Computing Service Models are further categorized into IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. IaaS, or Infrastructure as a service, is a type of cloud computing that offers basic computation, network, and storage capabilities to customers on demand, via the internet, and on a pay-as-you-go basis. It describes a set of services, including hosting, provisioning, hardware, and the fundamental ones required to run a cloud. With this, an enterprise can use this service to outsource servers, storage, hardware, servers, and networking components, as well as other equipment needed to support operations. Further, PaaS, or platform as a service, is an all-inclusive environment for cloud development and deployment that has the tools necessary to provide anything from basic cloud-based apps to complex business systems. It consists of application infrastructures (middleware) services, such as application platforms, development tools, integration, business process management, Business Analytics/BI, and database management services. SaaS refers to a cloud-based method of providing software to users. Users subscribe to an application rather than purchasing it once and installing it. Users can log into and use a SaaS application from any compatible device over the internet. The actual application runs in cloud servers instead of each user installing the software on their device. For large organizations, updating software was a time-consuming process.



As per platform as a service, analytics and reporting segments to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period

As per PaaS, Analytics and reporting are anticipated to develop at the highest CAGR of 23.4% during the forecast period, while the data management segment is expected to hold a larger market share based on platform-as-a-service. Analytics and reporting are data management solutions implemented in organizations to collect historical and present data while using statistics and software to analyze raw information and deliver insights for making better future decisions. BI is the process of collecting, storing, and analyzing data from business operations. It provides comprehensive business metrics in near-real-time to support better decision-making.



As per software as a service, the supply chain management segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period

As per SaaS, supply chain management is estimated to hold the highest Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 17.6% in the cloud computing platform market. Applications, such as logistics, inventory, and production planning, are covered under the SCM segment. Improving supply chain operations for different capital-intensive industries requires explicit consideration, as the multidisciplinary nature of different sectors makes SCM practices more complex. Cloud-based SCM applications help to reduce all these challenges and improve the business processes associated with managing supply chain activities.

General Manager of Federal Growth, Microsoft

Leveraging her experience as a former Navy officer and from key leadership roles in industry, Charlene Mowery leads the Microsoft federal growth organization, focusing on organic growth and partner expansion across the U.S. federal market.

Under Mowery’s leadership, her organization expanded in 2021 to provide enhanced support for business development, strategic capture, mission strategy and proposal services across Microsoft Federal in response to industry needs. As a result, these teams offer more personalized experiences for strategic opportunity engagement.

Microsoft’s mission is to “empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more,” and this serves as a key motivator.

“It’s exciting to lead these teams to drive growth,” Mowery said. “For me, the most effective business development motions are through an ‘operationalized’ mindset, whereby the teams anticipate, inspire and innovate with strategic outcome-based intents to best enable customers and partners.”

Why Watch

In 2022, Mowery and her teams will continue to drive long-term growth, leveraging unique capabilities to identify opportunities to solve the toughest problems, with a specific emphasis on the federal mission space and the Microsoft classified clouds.

Cloud computing empowers digital transformation through a portfolio of artificial intelligence and machine learning services, high-performance computing, quantum and capabilities offered by the connected cloud ⏤ from space to the tactical edge. Microsoft is accelerating that innovation.

Mowery added:

“We embrace a growth mindset and work collaboratively across the business to develop compelling differentiating solutions and durable long-term pipelines. It’s an incredible experience to work with the talented teams at Microsoft and to see the impact to our customers and partners every day.”",Top Business Development Execs to Watch in 2022: Microsoft's Charlene Mowery - WashingtonExec,https://washingtonexec.com/2022/11/top-business-development-execs-to-watch-in-2022-microsofts-charlene-mowery/
320,These companies are pushing innovation through their artificial intelligence research.,cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/708978/car-tech.jpg,motley fool,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the buzziest terms in technology at the moment. Given how complex AI is, it is hard to separate the pretenders from the real innovators.

The industry is expected to grow at 20% annually through 2029 and hit over $1 trillion in annual spending worldwide. Companies that are the leaders in AI and machine learning can capture a lot of this spending, helping their businesses grow and leading their stocks to put up great returns for shareholders.

Here are two AI stocks that look ready to make a bull run over the next decade.

1. Alphabet: Multiple AI machines working in tandem

Alphabet (GOOG 1.53%) (GOOGL 1.45%) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, and the Google Cloud platform. The technology giant is one of the premier AI companies worldwide, using it to help its search, mapping, and other functions.

CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted Google's research multiple times on Alphabet's recent earnings call, saying that the company is using AI to bring ""significant improvements to search,"" and that he thinks AI is the next big revolution after mobile phones.

Here are a few examples of how this can work in practice. With trillions upon trillions of pieces of information across Google Search, YouTube, and Google Maps, Alphabet is able to harness AI to greatly improve search results, no matter where customers start their inquiries.

This means that if, for example, you search Google for how to fix a particular device, it will bring up a YouTube tutorial that you can play to learn exactly what you need to do. As these AI models ingest more data, they will continue to improve search results, which will improve Google's customer experience.

Through Google Cloud, Alphabet's cloud infrastructure segment, the company is selling its AI capabilities to other businesses. Companies of all sizes that want to use AI but don't have the internal research capabilities (and there are very few that do) can buy Google's machine-learning products through the cloud. That's a big reason Google Cloud revenue grew 38% year over year last quarter.

With the stock down 34% this year, Alphabet has a market cap of $1.2 trillion. Over the last 12 months, it has generated $67 billion in net earnings, giving the stock a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.9, which is below the market average. For a company with such an advantage in AI and a huge opportunity to grow its business this decade, now looks like a great time to pick up shares of Alphabet.

2. Ansys: spurring innovation through simulation

Alphabet is a leader in AI for the internet, but there are multiple companies working on AI for more-physical applications like semiconductors, the space economy, and the automotive sector. Enter Ansys (ANSS 1.20%), the global leader in simulation software for research & development departments.

Ansys has dozens of software products that cover a variety of end markets, but all with a common goal: to simulate the real world in a multiphysics environment. ""Multiphysics"" is a broad term that means replicating real-world physical properties like electricity, heat, or stress loads on a product, but in a simulation.

Along with other engineering software companies, Ansys helps companies like Tesla and Rocket Lab perform simulations for their manufactured products all within a realistic software environment, saving time and money with their research budgets.

Engineering simulations require vast computing power, which Ansys is trying to improve through its AI and machine-learning research. The company claims AI can help with the speed and accuracy of these simulations, which makes sense since machine learning is generally just one big data problem.

These developments should not only help Ansys improve its products for customers but also distinguish it from any software challengers, insulating it from competition.

Today, Ansys has a market cap of $22 billion. Over the last 12 months, it has generated a net income of $469 million, giving the stock a P/E of 47. This is much more expensive than Alphabet, but with the huge growth opportunity Ansys has within fields like semiconductors, the space economy, and electric vehicles, I think the stock is still a great buy even at today's premium price.

(Axiom Space Illustration)

When Houston-based Axiom Space starts putting together its commercial space station, some out-of-this-world infrastructure for cloud computing could be close behind — and Microsoft could help make it happen.

That vision of “infrastructure as a service” in low Earth orbit, or LEO, is what’s behind a strategic collaboration agreement involving Axiom Space, Microsoft Azure Space and a Virginia-based venture called LEOcloud. The deal sets the stage for developing and delivering space-based cloud services from commercial assets.

“It’s been an amazing ride to bring all this to this level of reality,” LEOcloud founder Dennis Gatens told GeekWire.

Gatens has been working with partners including Ramon.Space on a line of radiation-hardened compute and data storage hardware that’s well-suited for the space environment. His plan calls for LEOcloud’s infrastructure to host Azure Space’s cloud computing platform on the orbital modules currently being developed by Axiom Space.

Steve Kitay, senior director of Microsoft Azure Space, is fully on board.

“Our collaboration combines the possibilities of space with the power of Microsoft Azure extending its capabilities anywhere in the universe through new space infrastructure, making cloud connectivity and compute increasingly attainable for all at the ultimate edge — on orbit in space,” Kitay said today in a news release.

LEOcloud’s Space Edge infrastructure includes support for Red Hat OpenShift, a leading Kubernetes platform for enterprise cloud services. “Red Hat is excited to be working with LEOcloud in this latest collaboration to deliver open hybrid cloud computing to the next frontier with edge computing,” said Francis Chow, Red Hat’s vice president and general manager for in-vehicle operating system and edge

Why put the cloud in space? Gatens cites three potential advantages: lower latency for space-based applications; increased data security due to the 250-mile “air gap” between the planet’s surface and low Earth orbit; and less need to transmit expensive streams of unprocessed data from orbit to the ground.

“Raw data is generally high-volume data that needs to be refined at a data center, basically,” he explained. “So you move those resources into space, and you reduce the latency, which will be very important for certain use cases, particularly in government.”

Gatens said putting cloud computing hardware on a commercial space station, like the one that Axiom Space is building, makes more sense than putting it on a constellation of satellites. “The commercial space stations provide relatively significant volume versus, for example, the SWAP [size, weight and power] constraints on a satellite to provide significant resources for compute and data storage,” he said.

Axiom Space is currently planning to deliver its first commercial space module to the International Space Station in 2025, and add more modules over the course of several years. When the International Space Station is retired, perhaps in the 2030-2031 time frame, Axiom intends to detach its modules to serve as a standalone orbital outpost.

Space-based cloud services could theoretically be extended beyond low Earth orbit to cislunar space — that is, the expanse stretching from Earth to the moon. “There’s clearly going to be a market in LEO,” Gatens said. “That’s where we start with Axiom Space, and then cislunar is already under discussion.”

Gatens declined to discuss the financial details behind the deal with Axiom Space, but he characterized Axiom as a customer — which implies that some of the anticipated revenue from space-based cloud services would flow from Axiom to LEOcloud and its partners.

Rob Meyerson, who’s an operating partner at C5 Capital USA and a member of Axiom Space’s board of directors, told GeekWire last year that compute and data storage could be an attractive new market for the space industry. “We have a lot of data that’s created in space, but how valuable would it be to actually do compute and storage in space?” he asked.

Once the poster child for China's technological success, growing from the country's dominant e-commerce player into a major provider of cloud computing and other services, Alibaba has faced a crisis of confidence from investors since its fintech affiliate Ant Group was forced to scrap what would have been the world's largest IPO in 2020. A month later, authorities opened an antitrust probe against Alibaba.

Since then, Alibaba's stock price in Hong Kong has fallen to about HK$80 (US$10.20), down more than 70 per cent from its peak of HK$307 in October 2020.

But there are signs that external headwinds for Alibaba may have come to an end: China has started to relax certain Covid-19 controls, which could boost domestic consumer spending; Beijing relaxed its campaign cracking down on Big Tech firms; audits by US regulators, an uncertainty hanging over US-listed Chinese firms, have been conducted; and Ant Group has completed capital base expansion for consumer credit.

The days of 30 per cent annualised revenue growth are likely over for Alibaba, but a report reflecting solid business performance expected on Thursday could assure investors that the company remains a safe bet for tapping into China's consumer market and the future of its technology sector, analysts said.

Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.

""A positive revenue growth in the September quarter should not be a hard thing for Alibaba. Even though the actual results may not go beyond expectations, it is likely to return to a growth track,"" said Carmen Zhu, a senior analyst at research firm Leadleo.

Story continues

Alibaba's revenue for the quarter ended September is estimated to have reached 209.2 billion yuan (US$29.6 billion), a 4.3 per cent increase from the same period last year, according to a Bloomberg survey. Adjusted net income may fall 4 per cent.

Alibaba shares in Hong Kong have gained nearly 30 per cent from a low earlier this month. But its previous decline is in line with the bearish sentiment that has hit other Big Tech stocks in China.

Shares of Tencent Holdings, the Shenzhen-based social media and video gaming giant, are also down nearly 37 per cent year to date. Like Alibaba, Tencent shares recovered slightly this month, seeing a nearly 30 per cent rise since October 28 to HK$282, well below its peak of HK$744 in January 2021.

Sentiment is low in the tech sector globally, as well, as industry giants brace for an expected recession.

Facebook owner Meta Platforms announced the largest ever cut to its workforce, laying off 13 per cent of its staff, or nearly 11,000 employees. Amazon also plans to lay off approximately 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week.

As the US Federal Reserve fights inflation, rate increases have also contributed to fears of a recession. Cheng Yu, a researcher at the Beijing-based research institute Kandong, suggested this might help some aspects of Alibaba's business.

""The contractionary effect of the Fed has not yet manifested,"" he said. ""This is also good for Alibaba's cross-border business.""

Improved domestic consumption in the third quarter could also help Alibaba's results, Cheng noted.

""While macro headwinds and subdued consumer sentiment weighed on Alibaba China's commerce retail GMV [gross merchandise value] growth in the first half year of 2022, we expect to see a gradual recovery in 2023, which will also provide additional support for earnings recovery,"" analysts at CMB International wrote in a research note in late October.

""Despite short-term headwinds, Alibaba's international expansion and long-term cloud business are on track,"" they noted.

Cloud computing remains an important segment for Alibaba, which has bet on it as a driver of future growth. Cloud service revenue, excluding sales to other Alibaba businesses, rose 10 per cent to 17.69 billion yuan in the June quarter, the fastest growth among all of the company's business segments, contributing 9 per cent of total revenue. Still, the increase marked a slowdown from the 20 per cent growth seen in the December quarter and the 12 per cent growth in the March quarter.

LeadLeo's Zhu suggested that Alibaba still faces multiple risks even though the company has stable fundamentals. ""Risks lie in the uncertainty brought by the pandemic, and the slowing growth of [the retail] industry, as well as fierce competition,"" Zhu said.

""The US review and the valuation of Ant Group, as well as its strategic investments, are all uncertain factors,"" she added.

Founder of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, has shared his vision of its future, and he hopes it could be even better than current Web3 speculations.

Initially created as an online collaboration, communication, and data sharing platform tool for scientists, the first website was created for researchers at CERN, and established the standards still used today, like URLs, HTTP and HTML.

The Internet hit the public as it entered the Web2 stage, which paved the way for apps and mobile platforms. It also saw the introduction of the cloud which underpins many of today's computing activities.

Web3 and Solid

Berners-Lee is now working on a new data sharing standard, called Solid, which is set to gain support for identity management tools such as global single sign-on (SSO), global access control, and people-centric universal APIs.

Solid (opens in new tab) is set to challenge the idea that revenue for the web should primarily come from advertising, instead placing an emphasis on privacy. The idea is that users can share their data in interoperable, decentralized data stores called ‘Pods’.

To commercialize the project, Berners-Lee is working on a company called Inrupt, which is made up of investors, entrepreneurs, developers and academics. The company says (opens in new tab) that it aims to “[put] individuals in control of their data, [give] organizations new opportunities to create value for customers, and [allow] developers to thrive in an open marketplace of innovation.”

According to VentureBeat (opens in new tab), Berners-Lee has already been using Solid to store his own data, including bank statements, documents, photos, music, IoT data, and exercise data. In this instance, he is said to be accessing his data through a Mac Mini.

A report by Gartner shows that cloud technology has transformed modern business in previously unimaginable ways. The report indicated that 75% of organizations using the cloud have a “cloud first” policy, which is a much higher figure than previous versions of the report indicated.

However, many businesses are still hesitant about taking their organization to the cloud. There are a plethora of benefits, but companies have to make sure that they store their data on the cloud properly.

What Are the Reasons Smart Businesses Are Shifting to the Cloud?

The cloud has become an increasingly popular option for businesses of all sizes to store data.

There are many reasons for this, which we will explore in this article. From increased security to lower costs, there are many benefits to storing data in the cloud.

You can’t ignore the benefits of moving to the cloud. Here are the reasons why your organization should consider storing data in the cloud:

1. Lower Costs

One of the biggest benefits of storing data in the cloud is that it can save your organization money. One study by Perle showed that 95% of respondents said that moving to the cloud would lower their operational and hardware installation costs.

With on-premises storage, you have to pay for the initial purchase and installation of hardware and software, as well as ongoing maintenance costs.

With cloud storage, you only pay for what you use, which can save your organization a significant amount of money over time.

2. Increased Security

Another benefit of storing data in the cloud is that it can actually be more secure than on-premises storage.

With on-premises storage, your data is only as secure as your physical location. If there is a fire or natural disaster, your data could be lost forever.

With cloud storage, your data is stored remotely and is backed up regularly, so you don’t have to worry about losing it if something happens to your physical location.

3. Access from Anywhere

One of the best things about storing data in the cloud is that you can access it from anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

So no matter if you’re at work, at home, or on vacation, you can always get to your data when you need it. This is a great convenience for businesses that have employees who work remotely or travel often.

4. Scalability

Another advantage of using cloud storage is that it’s very scalable. As your business grows and needs more storage space, you can easily add more storage to your account without having to invest in new hardware or software.

This scalability is one of the main reasons why businesses choose to store data in the cloud instead of on-premises storage solutions.

5. Disaster Recovery

One final benefit of storing data in the cloud is that it allows for easy disaster recovery.

If something happens to your physical location such as a fire, you can rest assured knowing that your data is safe and sound in the cloud and can be quickly restored if necessary.

How Does Cloud Storage Work?

Whenever you upload a file to the cloud, it is stored on a remote server. This server can be located anywhere in the world and is usually owned by a large company, such as Google or Microsoft.

When you want to access your file, you simply log in to your cloud storage account and download it to your computer. Alternatively, you can view it directly in your browser if it’s a document or an image.

The main advantage of using cloud storage is that you can access your files from anywhere. All you need is an internet connection and you can log in to your account and download or view whatever file you need.

This is perfect for business users who need to be able to work from anywhere or for students who need to be able to access their coursework from any computer.

Another advantage of cloud storage is that it makes sharing files with others very easy. Most cloud storage providers offer some kind of sharing feature that allows you to send a link to a file or folder to another person with just a few clicks.

This is much easier than emailing attachments back and forth or trying to keep track of who has which version of a shared document.

Where is Your Cloud Data Stored?

The answer to this question is not as simple as you might think. The thing about cloud managed services is that they are often spread out across multiple servers in multiple locations.

That’s because most cloud providers want to be able to offer their customers high availability, which means that if one server goes down, there are others that can pick up the slack.

So, does it matter where your cloud data is physically located? For the most part, no. However, there are some instances where it can make a difference.

For example, if you’re subject to certain regulations like HIPAA in the United States or GDPR in Europe you may need to store your data in a location that adheres to those regulations.

Additionally, if you’re concerned about data privacy, you may want to choose a provider that stores your data in a country with strong privacy laws.

Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing services can be divided into three broad categories:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS refers to cloud managed services that provide users with access to a virtualized environment.

This environment can be used to deploy and run applications, store data, and more. IaaS providers typically offer pay-as-you-go pricing models, which means that users only pay for the resources that they consume.

Some examples of IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS refers to cloud-based services that provide users with access to a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications.

PaaS providers typically offer pre-configured development environments that include everything needed to build and deploy an application.

Some examples of PaaS providers include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, and Microsoft Azure App Service.

Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS refers to cloud-based software that is offered on a subscription basis. SaaS products are typically delivered over the internet and can be accessed by users from anywhere in the world.

Some examples of SaaS products include Google G Suite, Microsoft Office 365, and Salesforce.

Take Advantage of the Many Benefits of Cloud Computing

There are many reasons why businesses choose to store data in the cloud instead of on-premises storage solutions such as lower costs, increased security, scalability, and disaster recovery but these are just a few of the most popular ones.

In today’s digital world, storing data in the cloud has become essential for businesses of all sizes and industries.

",Global Edge AI Hardware Market Report 2022: Ever-Increasing Enterprise Workloads on the Cloud Driving Growth,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-edge-ai-hardware-market-112800630.html
333,The struggling economy can only slow down these companies for so long.,cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/709039/person-shopping-using-a-smaprtphone.jpg,motley fool,"The most recent inflation data wasn't as bad as what we have seen in the past year. The news lifted the broader market, and many major companies benefited. Among them were Amazon (AMZN 1.00%) and PayPal (PYPL 1.05%). Both companies saw their shares jump by double-digit percentages on Nov. 10 on the heels of the latest inflation news.

Still, Amazon and PayPal remain down massively in the past year. And at current levels, investors should strongly consider buying and forgetting shares of both tech giants. Let me explain.

1. Amazon will rebound from 2022 slump

It is no surprise that cooling inflation provided a significant boost to Amazon as higher prices are affecting the company's business. Inflation-driven slowing consumer spending and higher costs have meaningfully impacted the company's results. And that's before we add the effect of the rising U.S. dollar.

In the third quarter, the company's revenue of $127.1 billion increased by 15% year over year, or 19% in constant currency terms. Amazon's top-line growth rate in the third quarter was lower than what it has gotten investors accustomed to over the years, but it increased compared to what we saw earlier this year.

However, the company's fourth-quarter guidance wasn't great. Amazon is predicting revenue growth of 5% year over year at the midpoint. In short, Amazon will remain vulnerable in the near term. But it is still an excellent stock to buy and hold. Amazon boasts a solid competitive edge from multiple sources, including its strong brand name -- one of the most valuable in the world -- and the network effect its e-commerce platform displays.

The more people use the platform, the more it becomes attractive to merchants, and vice versa. Further, Amazon generates plenty of cash, allowing it to pursue new expansion opportunities. The tech company ended the third quarter with about $35.2 billion in cash and equivalents, compared to $30.2 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2021.

One of Amazon's most significant opportunities is cloud computing, an industry in which it is one of the leaders thanks to its Amazon Web Services (AWS). This segment remains Amazon's biggest profit driver. In the third quarter, AWS reported an operating income of $5.4 billion, up 10.6% year over year, while the company's other two segments recorded operating losses.

It's not like AWS is navigating the economic challenges entirely unscathed. With businesses reining in spending, they are less likely to purchase cloud solutions. But aside from this slowdown related to the economy, the industry is projected to continue rapidly growing. Amazon has a hand in other businesses, from music streaming to video streaming.

The company's Prime program is still going strong, with over 200 million users who benefit from perks such as free one-day shipping on thousands of items. Amazon's entire ecosystem is robust, and the company will rebound and continue generating solid returns for investors after the economy recovers. Investors should stay the course with this top tech stock.

2. PayPal has plenty of room for growth left

PayPal is also vulnerable to economic problems. Lower consumer spending can impact the company's total payment volume (TPV, the total dollar value of transactions it facilitates) and revenue. Also, the fintech giant's user growth has been unimpressive lately. It ended the third quarter with 432 million total active accounts, a meager (by its standards) 4% year over year increase.

The company's TPV came in at $337 billion, up 9% year over year, while its revenue of $6.85 billion increased by 11% compared to the year-ago period. PayPal's earnings per share jumped from $0.92 reported in the prior-year quarter to $1.15 this time around. Overall, it was a pretty solid quarter for the company, even amid these troubles. True, like many other major tech companies, revenue growth has slowed for PayPal, but that's par for the course in this economy.

The good news for PayPal is that it continues to expand its payment platform, helping it remain competitive in the tough fintech industry. Earlier this year, the company's peer-to-peer payment app Venmo became available for checkout on Amazon for some of its users in the U.S. PayPal recently said that this feature will be available to all Venmo users in the U.S. by the holiday season.

Also, PayPal recently announced a partnership with Apple Pay that will allow the former's merchants to use their iPhones as point-of-sale systems, among other things. These initiatives are important as they enable PayPal to grow its already massive ecosystem. As one of the most recognized digital wallets in the world, it benefits from a strong brand name and the network effect, with more merchants and consumers attracting each other on the platform.

With increasing internet and mobile penetration worldwide, the continued rise of e-commerce, and greater reliance on digital modes of payment, PayPal has powerful tailwinds behind it that won't subside anytime soon. The company's penetration remains below 50%, even in its most advanced markets. That's why PayPal can continue growing by leaps and bounds for years to come.",2 Growth Stocks Down 42% or More to Buy and Hold Forever,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/2-growth-stocks-down-47-or-more-to-buy-and-hold-fo/
334,AMD and Apple have recently defied market declines and could provide significant gains in 2023.,cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/709062/teen-shows-friend-something-on-their-smart-phone.jpg,motley fool,"The end of the year is swiftly approaching, and now is a great time to think about your investment goals for 2023. While a recession could potentially dampen your optimism for portfolio growth next year, a few companies have recently beaten market expectations despite a stock market sell-off, and could continue to win next year.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.53%) and Apple (AAPL 0.59%) defied market declines in the last month and could provide investors with significant gains in 2023.

1. Advanced Micro Devices

The PC market was hit particularly hard in 2022, with worldwide shipments declining by 19.5% in the third quarter, according to Gartner. As a leader in PC components, AMD has seen its stock fall 49% year to date because of market declines. However, investors have grown bullish in the last month, pumping up the stock by 24% since Oct. 13.

The rally came as AMD announced its latest data center chip, code-named Genoa, and said that cloud computing titans such as Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud would be some of its customers. AMD's data center business has seen substantial growth in the last year, with revenue rising 45% year over year to $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2022.

And the data center market is expected to see compound annual growth of 18.9% from 2022 to 2028, according to Grand View Research. AMD's market share in the industry has rapidly grown in the last few years, more than doubling from 10% to 22% between 2020 and 2022 by stealing share from Intel. As a result, AMD is well positioned to continue seeing gains from its data center segment in 2023.

And its gaming segment saw a year-over-year revenue rise of 13.7% in the third quarter to $1.63 billion. Despite declines in the tech market this year, AMD's gaming business was primarily boosted by being the exclusive supplier of Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S and Sony's PlayStation 5's system on a chip. Stock for the popular game consoles has stabilized in recent months, with 2023 looking likely to see substantial sales.

AMD shares suffered steep declines in 2022, but investors have gradually regained confidence in the company as growth in its non-PC segments has continued. The company's stock has seen a double-digit rise in the last month, which will likely continue through 2023, thanks to its promising gaming and data center businesses.

2. Apple

Few companies have defied market trends in 2022 like Apple. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has fallen 27% year to date, while Apple has dipped a more modest 16% in the same period as its products and services remain in demand. Apple has essentially propped up the market this year, which would appear in far more severe shape without it.

The company's fiscal 2022 proved the potency of its business in a year when hikes in inflation led to significantly decreased consumer demand for multiple companies. Apple enjoyed year-over-year growth in several segments, with iPhone sales increasing by 7% to $205 billion, Mac revenue by 14% to $40 billion, and Services by 14% to $78 billion.

Apple's continued growth this year bodes well for 2023, when the company is likely to complete its transition from Intel processors to its custom Apple Silicon chips within its Mac lineup. The iPhone manufacturer has spent the last couple of years moving each of its Macs to its custom chips, including the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini. But consumers are still awaiting an Apple Silicon Mac Pro and a beefier Mac Mini.

Since the third quarter of 2020, when Apple Silicon was first announced, the company's Mac revenue has risen 62% from $7 billion to $11.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result, completing the transition in 2023 could provide the company with a notable boost.

Furthermore, numerous reports suggest Apple is gearing up to launch an augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) headset in 2023. Considering the immense success it has had with first entering markets such as smartphones, tablets, Bluetooth headphones, and smartwatches, I wouldn't bet against Apple soon dominating the $25 billion AR industry that is expected to have compound annual growth of 40.9% until 2030.

This year, Apple's robust business has proved its resilience and its ability to grow despite economic declines. As a result, the company is an excellent investment for 2023.",2 Monster Stocks to Buy for 2023 That Are Practically Minting Money,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/2-monster-stocks-to-buy-for-2023-that-are-practica/
335,This will help you begin your investing journey.,cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/708375/happy-investor-rising-stock-graph.jpg,motley fool,"Over half of Millennials own stocks, according to recent research by The Motley Fool. It might not seem like it today, but the stock market has historically proven resilient, enduring recessions and wars to deliver annual returns averaging 10% over decades. In other words, owning stocks is one of the most proven ways to build wealth.

Don't panic if you're one of those who haven't gotten started yet; it's never too late. You can build a diversified portfolio of stocks that produces compound returns and helps brighten your financial future. Remember that Millennials and Gen Z are the upcoming generations of consumers. Below are three companies younger consumers love that have the robust financials to make them superb investments for kick-starting a diversified portfolio.

1. Alphabet

Technology conglomerate Alphabet (GOOG 1.53%) (GOOGL 1.45%) owns the internet search engine Google and the video platform YouTube, the two most-trafficked websites in the world. Google conducts 84% of the world's internet searches, while YouTube dominates video content. According to a study by Morning Consult, Google and YouTube rank among Gen Z's most-beloved brands, which probably shouldn't surprise anyone considering Alphabet's internet presence.

Alphabet monetizes all of the attention it gets by selling ads to the billions of eyeballs on its websites. The company did $282 billion in revenue over the past four quarters, making $62 billion in cash profits (22% free cash flow conversion rate). Alphabet also has deep pockets, including $116 billion in cash on its balance sheet, which can act as a safety net to help the company during hard times and fund new growth ideas during good times.

The stock has fallen 36% from its high in this bear market, but business is still doing well. Analysts believe that Alphabet's earnings per share (EPS) will grow by an average of 11% annually over the next three to five years. Ad dollars typically flow toward the largest audiences, so until someone challenges Google and YouTube for internet supremacy, the stock seems poised for long-term success.

2. Apple

Electronic device maker Apple (AAPL 0.59%) dominates the smartphone market with the iPhone, which owns roughly 55% of the market in the United States. Phones have become the technology hub for everyday life, which resonates with young consumers. According to a survey by Business Insider, Apple is the top brand among Millennials. Apple's a massive company; it did $394 billion in revenue over the past year, and is also a cash cow, generating $111 billion in cash profits, or 28% of its revenue.

Motley Fool's internal research uncovered that the technology and financial sectors are popular among young investors, and Apple hits the mark there. Think of the nearly 2 billion active iOS devices worldwide as a distribution network. Apple makes about a quarter of its revenue by selling subscription services to device users. The company's various services include Apple Pay, which is steadily growing its share of digital wallets worldwide, with 507 million users. It's a potential growth opportunity that could become an even bigger deal.

Apple has held up better than most stocks in the bear market, down just 19% from its high. You can't predict the share price in the short term, but analysts believe Apple's EPS will grow by 12% annually over the next three to five years. A stock's share price eventually tends to follow the business performance over time, so Apple could still have a lot to give investors over the coming years.

3. Amazon

Young consumers have grown up in the age of e-commerce, and Amazon (AMZN 1.00%) is the undisputed king in the United States with a roughly 50% share of e-commerce business. Jeff Bezos spent the past 28 years building the company that now virtually everyone knows, whether they watch football on Amazon Prime or see the company's famous logo on its many trucks on the roads. That could play a key role in why Gen Z and Millennials love the brand; both generations lean heavily on investing in companies they know.

Amazon's one of the world's largest companies, and made $502 billion in revenue over the past year. You can see below that cash profits were negative $26 billion over the past year due to inflation, which raised the company's costs. However, Amazon has $58 billion in cash on its balance sheet, so investors shouldn't panic about its inflation-driven hiccup.

Amazon has also built the world's leading public cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This business segment is very profitable -- Amazon's operating income in the third quarter of 2022 all came from AWS. It's still just 15% of Amazon's revenue, which could make it even more critical as AWS grows moving forward.

Inflation headaches have caused Wall Street to sour on Amazon, which has fallen 47% from its peak. However, Amazon's dominance in high-growth industries like e-commerce and cloud computing should continue driving growth over time. Analysts are looking for EPS growth averaging 20% annually over the next three to five years. In hindsight, the company's short-term fall could look like a massive opportunity if Amazon can live up to expectations.",Over Half of Millennials Own Stocks.

336,"Edge computing can make your cloud snappier and more efficient, but it requires attention to keep your data and connections secure. Read More at Enable Sysadmin
The post Edge security for sysadmins: 6 issues to watch appeared first on Linux.com.",cloud computing,15/11/2022,,redhat.com,"Edge computing places nodes, often in the form of embedded systems, locally on the site where data is being gathered and processed. These nodes exist on the ""edge"" of your cloud's coverage and broadcast data (often preprocessed) back to your application service or data storage facility.

[ Improve your skills managing and using SELinux with this helpful guide. ]

Edge has many advantages, but by definition, it means deploying several computers (depending on your needs, it could be in the hundreds) to remote locations. Each of those systems represents a potential attack vector, so it's important to think about how to restrict access to your edge devices.

1. Services

Don't let the terminology fool you. An edge device is a hyper-specific server that runs some service or collection of services. It receives input and produces output.

As with functional programming, you must ensure that the services running on the device accept (and validate) only the required inputs and provide verifiable output. The classic example of SQL statements that drop tables or add users is still relevant. While it may or may not apply to your device, the idea is the same: Restrict input to only what's expected, and provide output that's strictly scrutinized.

2. Operating system

This one is straightforward:

What operating system is the device running?

What support does it have for updates?

What security policies does it make available to you?

Luckily, many edge devices run open source, such as Linux, BSD, or RTOS, so there's a lot of potential for optimizing settings with features like SELinux. However, through neglect or mismanagement, there's always the possibility that you're not taking advantage of your operating system's built-in features. Get to know your devices' operating system, read the documentation, and implement safeguards.

[ Boost security, flexibility, and scale at the edge with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. ]

3. Firewall

The edge is not synonymous with DMZ. Just because your devices are remote doesn't mean they don't need coverage. Whether you set up a site-specific firewall server or use a device's built-in firewall features, your edge network needs a firewall.

4. Encryption

Some commodity devices have easy modes for quick connectivity. These may be great features for quick setup and testing. However, they are no substitute for establishing dedicated encrypted connections with encryption keys that you oversee and can revoke when necessary.

5. Zero-trust security

Use the zero-trust model:

Authenticate all connections.

Verify all devices, users, and applications.

Route all traffic at the application level.

6. Monitoring

An unmonitored device is an invitation for failure. There are many great monitoring tools out there, like Tripwire, Prometheus, and more. Watch the edge the same as you monitor your local network (if not more).

Welcome to the edge

Edge computing can make your cloud snappier and more efficient, but it requires attention. It's a big and widespread responsibility to compute on the edge, so treat it carefully. Give it the attention it deserves, and treat your edge network with the same care you have for your local users.

read more",cloud computing,15/11/2022,,securityweek.com,"Backstage, an open platform for building developer portals, is affected by a critical vulnerability whose exploitation could have a serious impact on a targeted enterprise, according to cloud-native application security firm Oxeye.

Backstage was developed by Spotify and donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It provides a catalog for managing all of the user’s software, software templates to make it easier to create projects, and open source plugins that can be used to expand its customizability and functionality.

The platform is used by many major organizations, including Netflix, American Airlines, Doordash, Palo Alto Networks, HP, Siemens, LinkedIn, and Booz Allen Hamilton.

Backstage is affected by a critical vulnerability related to a security hole found earlier this year by Oxeye in the popular sandbox library VM2. The VM2 flaw, dubbed SandBreak and tracked as CVE-2022-36067, can allow a remote attacker to escape the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host.

Backstage has been using VM2 and Oxeye researchers discovered that CVE-2022-36067 can be exploited for unauthenticated remote code execution in Backstage by abusing its software templates. An attacker who can successfully exploit the vulnerability could carry out various actions in the compromised organization’s network.

“Backstage can hold integration details to many organization systems, such as Prometheus, Jira, ElasticSearch, and others. Thus, successful exploitation has critical implications for any affected organization and can compromise those services and the data they hold,” Oxeye said in a technical blog post describing the vulnerability.

Oxeye reported its findings to Backstage developers through Spotify’s bug bounty program in mid-August and the flaw was fixed roughly 10 days later with the release of version 1.5.1, which includes a patched version of VM2.

“If you’re using a template engine in your application, make sure you choose the right one in relation to security. Robust template engines are extremely useful but might pose a risk to your organization,” the security firm recommended.

That’s among …",cloud computing,15/11/2022,"https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2022/09/30/20/istock-896973016-100932970-large.jpg?auto=webp&quality=85,70",network world,"Networking teams have been challenged to provide hybrid workers with secure access to cloud-based applications, and they’re looking for greater automation and additional visibility tools to help them manage today’s diverse enterprise workloads.

That’s among the key findings of Cisco’s new Global Hybrid Cloud Trends report, which surveyed 2,500 IT decision makers in 13 countries to discern the trends and priorities of organizations that are managing workloads across multiple private, public cloud and edge computing environments. Cisco said its report is aimed at looking at how these multicloud environments impact network operations.

“We found that as businesses adapt to the changing environment, IT priorities are shifting,” wrote Thomas Scheibe, vice president of product management for Cisco cloud networking, in the report.

“For the first time, agility and business performance have overtaken cost and network management as the key concerns for IT teams, with 42% of respondents citing a more agile development environment as their top reason for moving to multiple clouds,” Scheibe stated.

At the same time, organizations are grappling with unprecedented levels of complexity and uncertainty, which is fueling a search for simplicity and security, according to Scheibe.

As endpoints and applications become more dispersed and distributed, network complexity multiplies. While adoption of public cloud is growing, 50% of workloads are still deployed on premise. As a result, most environments will continue to be a mix of public cloud, hosted, private cloud, edge, and on-premises environments, Cisco stated.

That mix brings with it some challenges. When it comes to networking cloud-native deployments, the most challenging issue according to survey respondents is securing microservices traffic (cited by 34%).

The other top difficulties of deploying networks that support cloud-native environments include:

Self-service provisioning and change management (32%)

Automating network workflows (32%)

Visibility and control (31%)

Manage migrations (31%)

Integrating DevOps processes (29%)

Integrating microservices (28%)

APIs for network automation (28%)

Remote interconnect for microservices (28%)

Because complexity in these environments has become such a challenge, IT teams are looking for assistance. Orchestration, automation and visibility technologies have become some of the most-wanted tools for handling multicloud environments, according to Cisco.

Software defined networking (SDN) technology emerged as one of the top options (cited by 48%) to helps companies manage distributed workloads. Survey respondents also turned to orchestration and automation (46%), direct-to-cloud networking services (43%), full stack observability (43%), and service mesh (28%) to manage their distributed workloads.

“SDN is a means of accessing network automation and insights; it is a way to scale and secure networking environments and to simplify the process of making changes,” said Daryl Coon, product marketing manager with Cisco Networking. “At a basic level, it is moving away from a box-by-box approach to a more systemic management process. Many of the same principals and methods apply to both the campus/enterprise and multicloud environments. The added complexity comes from obtaining visibility across environments an organization doesn’t own in order to manage, automate and gain insights.”

For multicloud environments, SDN is important: Organizations need to abstract the network in order to simplify IT. SDN is foundational for capabilities such as letting automation software push the business intent/policy out and enforce it; or dynamically moving traffic to an optimal path; or proactively alerting IT when there are issues impacting users or applications, Coon said.

“When viewed alongside the other key findings of the report – specifically the increased role of IT in delivering business agility and resiliency – it is no wonder that SDN is one of the most-wanted technologies in multicloud environments. It comes down to simplifying IT,” Coon said.

‘Dream Come True’: IGEL Exits Hardware Business

Steven Burke

‘A lot of people didn’t see or believe this could happen,’ says IGEL CEO Jed Ayres. ‘That is why I made the tagline of IGEL Believe.

IGEL, a maker of well-engineered thin client hardware devices for two decades, is exiting that business as part of an all-out drive to make its popular Linux secure edge operating system the standard for Windows workspace computing across any device or cloud.

The decision to stop production of hardware thin clients for the No. 3 provider of thin clients in North America and Europe with an installed base of three million devices - opens the door for lGEL to provide its next gen edge OS exclusively through heavyweight hardware partners LG, Lenovo and HP.

For IGEL CEO Jed Ayres – who has spearheaded the company’s transformation into a secure Linux workspace operating system powerhouse- getting out of the hardware business is the culmination of a “dream come true” that he envisioned when he joined the company as CEO of North America six years ago.

“It took a little longer than I thought,” said an emotional Ayres of the final pieces that have been put in place to make IGEL a software only company. “We had this vision when I joined the company. Now we are executing on the final piece of it.”

IGEL is now in the process of running through all of the IGEL-branded hardware inventory. By the end of the first quarter next year, IGEL-branded thin clients – the No. 1 thin client hardware in Germany for 16 years- will be a thing of the past, said Ayres. IGEL will continue to support its five year warranty for new and previous IGEL thin client systems.

“IGEL has had that No. 1 position in Germany right up to this minute,” said Ayres. “It’s a pretty big move to walk away from that. It’s a profitable business, but we are a software company. We have 150 software developers and are investing heavily in building out our two software development centers in Germany and we are opening a new five story world class building in Augsburg in December.”

The hardware exit is set to unleash a new round of software research and development aimed at unlocking the value of the next gen edge IGEL OS working with AWS, Azure, VMware and Citrix in a (SaaS) software as a service and desktop as a service dominated market, said Ayres. “This is about choice: choice on the hardware, choice on the protocol and where it is being delivered,” Ayres said. “The underlying principle is the richest Windows experience with the best security and the easiest and most cost effective management. We take millions and millions of dollars out of operating Windows. We’re providing a Chromebook like experience with our software with a very light operating system and powerful management console in a Windows world.”

The hardware exit has been a long time coming for Ayres, who over the last six years has taken IGEL from a $50 million hardware company competing in a single digit growth market to a $100 million next gen OS software maker playing in a hyper-growth Windows workspace market. “Our addressable market is now an installed base of 500 million PCs and the 150 to 200 million PCs sold each year,” boasts Ayres.

Ayres knew immediately when he joined the company that its crown jewel was the lightweight, finely-engineered Linux operating system. “I knew the real value of IGEL was the operating system hidden inside the well constructed plastic box,” he said. “The IGEL OS is extensible to all kinds of hardware form factors. IGEL is software that can deliver the richest, most secure, easiest to manage and most cost-effective Windows experience.

The move to focus exclusively on the software market puts IGEL into a position to accelerate its next gen secure edge OS march, said Ayres. “To me this feels like we are at the starting line in a lot of ways,” he said. “There is nobody else in the market that has an operating system and management plane at the edge that can unlock the value we can with the IGEL OS.”

Unlocking that value means aggressively moving a big chunk of the 500 million PCs in the enterprise and the hundreds of thousands of new laptops being built each year to the IGEL secure edge OS.

To that end, Ayres says the hardware exit is the spark needed to move the company from $100 million in annual Linux revenue to a $1 billion software company in the next five years.

“We’re just getting started,” he said. “As the first Linux operating system greenlighted by Microsoft for use with Windows Virtual Desktop we see the lighter secure Linux running on millions and millions of devices. IGEL has estimated that 16 percent or 80 million of the 500 million PCs out there will move to Linux.”

A New IGEL OS Managed Services Era For Partners

For partners the IGEL decision to get out of hardware clears the path to develop a wide range of new managed services around the IGEL OS including edge device monitoring and management. “This is a huge opportunity for partners,” said Ayres. “This is going to help partners unlock all kinds of value around the OS. Anytime you have transformation of this magnitude with the Windows operating system moving into Azure there is always money to be made by partners. Microsoft is telling the world to consume Windows out of Azure. This is as big as the move to consume Office from Azure. How many people have Exchange servers anymore? Everyone is on M365. That is the journey we are on with Windows right now. Microsoft is going to make it very attractive and cost effective to have Windows and your Windows applications delivered from Azure. If you are going to do that then you want a light, secure, easy to manage, high performance operating system that is integrated with the leading device manufacturers. That is IGEL!”

CPC, one of only several IGEL elite Velocity partners with a consulting services specialization, expects its IGEL secure edge OS business to double next year in the wake of the hardware business exit, said Bruce Poor, president of business development for the Cincinnati solution provider.

“This turns the IGEL OS into a strategic platform,” said Poor. “Before I was selling a piece of hardware. By decoupling the specialized IGEL OS to run on any hardware device it is now a strategic secure platform that is simple to manage. It enhances and increases security for that end user customer. Now customers are investing in a true strategic platform that you carry with you no matter what hardware you may use in the future. You could be running this secure, easy to manage strategic operating system on a laptop this year or a ruggedized tablet next year.”

Ayres has opened up the explosive cloud desktop market opportunity for partners as more and more customers move to Windows delivered in Azure, said Poor. “Jed has always had a great vision for where to take IGEL,” he said. “Thin clients tied to IGEL was a very limited market. With the IGEL OS software being separate it opens up every Microsoft Windows desktop as an opportunity for partners. Microsoft wants customers to move Windows desktops into the cloud and the best way to do that is to have the secure Linux IGEL OS at the end point. There is going to be a huge wave of people looking to get their Windows desktops from Microsoft in the future like they do with Office 365 today. We are going to be there to help them by providing a secure endpoint that is easy to manage and reduces the risk to ransomware and other cyber attacks. I wanted to be in that market early and ride that wave.”

Poor has seen first hand the value of the secure IGEL edge OS when a ransomware attack took down Windows clients at one of his customers even as the IGEL OS based devices remained secure and up and running. That led the customer to invest more heavily in IGEL OS based devices. “A virtual desktop is a lot more secure, the individual PCs are always more vulnerable to attackers,” he said. “IGEL provides a secure platform that is easy to manage. You can have thousands of devices with a management platform that just works!”

CPC, in fact, has deployed one of the largest-ever IGEL OS deployments for a healthcare organization with 20,000 seats.

The innovation that is going to come from hardware makers teaming with IGEL is going to power the IGEL OS opportunity going forward, said Poor. “You are going to see more and more opportunities for IGEL to work on any hardware. This has opened up the market for IGEL one hundred fold compared to what it was. It was a great strategic plan that Jed put into motion to drive growth. We are going to ride the wave. Jed has been good at building partnerships. I have learned so much from him over the years. Whereever Jed goes he ends up being successful so I like to follow along and learn a thing or two along the way.”

Mike Strohl, CEO of e360, Concord, Calif., an IGEL Velocity Elite partner, said he expects to double his IGEL recurring revenue managed services revenue in wake of the stepped up IGEL software push. “I didn’t even know IGEL was ever in the hardware business,” joked Strohl. “So how can I comment on them getting out of it.”

Strohl said he has always viewed IGEL as a secure edge OS provider rather than a thin client hardware provider. That secure edge OS opportunity has become more pronounced in the post pandemic world where workers are remote, in the office and hybrid. “With the hybrid work environment, you need technology to manage and secure what employees get access to,” he said. “You need technology to do it. That technology is IGEL. It is secure and allows people to access applications natively through VDI or SaaS. It is an endpoint that just works. That is all software.”

The move to get out of the hardware business eliminates a potential conflict with hardware providers like HP, Lenovo and LG, said Strohl.

The IGEL move is also causing partners to double down on building a robust IGEL managed services business, said Strohl. “We are pivoting to IGEL as a service-based business,” he said. “With the evolution of cloud-based desktops like Azure Virtual Desktop or Amazon WorkSpaces IGEL has the potential to touch the majority of desktops not the minority of desktops. That is where the market opportunity is.Cloud based service offerings are the whole enchilada.”

IGEL is ushering in a new era of cloud desktop workspaces with the secure IGEL edge OS, said Christian Korner, vice president of sales for Connection Enterprise Solutions West for solution provider behemoth Connection, No. 26 on the 2022 CRN SP500. “This is a whole new way of looking at compute with the PC in the cloud,” said Korner. “Everything is moving into the cloud with Azure. There is no need for many of our customers to have fat PCs particularly with the security challenges that are out there today. IGEL opens up all kinds of conversations on how to secure devices with a lot of managed services opportunities for us with a full lifecycle support of those devices. There is a huge opportunity for us to move our customers in that direction. I think over the next couple of years the IGEL vision to become the de facto cloud OS standard is going to happen.”

Korner sees millions and millions of dollars in services opportunities with the IGEL edge OS. “We start with small pilots and it expands pretty quickly,” he said.

With an economic downturn potentially impacting IT budgets, Korner also sees IGEL’s next gen edge OS helping customers extending the life of PCs with a more secure and cost effective solution. “With the economic situation we are facing IGEL allows us to have a conversation with customers on a more secure, better managed and more cost effective IT environment,” he said. “IGEL allows customers to leverage existing PC inventory and create a security envelope around them with Linux that is much, much more manageable than anything they can possibly do with these old PCs. Putting an IGEL OS layer on those devices is pretty simple. It is not a heavy lift and support is more cost effective because of the IGEL management console.”

The Road To Exiting Hardware

The road to exiting the hardware business started with a breakthrough partnership with value added distributor Arrow Electronics that took hold in 2021. Ayres credits Arrow Global Enterprise Computing Solutions President Kristin Russell as the “hero” in the IGEL hardware exit story.

It was, in fact, Russell who paved the way for IGEL to exit the hardware business with Arrows’ Intelligent Solutions Group which specializes in helping companies get out of the hardware business. “Kristin cut through the intricacies of doing this,” said Ayres. “It was truly the power of Yes! We fell in love with Arrow’s approach to partnering.”

In March 2021, Arrow became the finance and logistics arm for IGEL’s thin client hardware business. That opened the door for IGEL to close its thin client warehouse in Germany. It also freed up $25 to $30 million in working capital that was tied up in manufacturing hardware and put it back into the software business. “That was the first step in exiting the hardware business,” said Ayres. “They effectively became the bank and owned all that IGEL inventory. I can’t say enough about Arrow. They never flinched in their ability to help us make this transition to a software company. They are an amazing company.”

Russell, for her part, said Arrow’s IT appliance program is powering a transformation for a number of OEMs from hardware providers to ISV (independent Software Vendors). “One of the fastest growing parts of that business is helping customers that are going from that OEM to ISV model,” she said. “We have been doing it for several years. It is definitely a sweet spot for us…It’s a very healthy part of the business and probably the fastest growing part of the business.”

Arrow’s strength comes from its ability to customize its logistics business to each customer’s operations and supply chain as a result of its Intelligent Solutions business expertise and its distribution capabilities through its Enterprise Computing Solutions business, said Russell.

“More and more customers of ours are looking for a partner to help them in this journey,” she said. “It allows our customer to not only scale and grow at a different level than they could do internally. The other thing is it allows them to focus their key resources on what is core and strategic to their mission which is the software side.”

In September, Ayres put the finishing touches on the plan to completely exit the hardware business by eliminating all IGEL-branded hardware. That allows IGEL to develop stronger and more strategic relationships with its hardware partners: LG, HP and Lenovo, said Ayres.

“All three of our hardware partners are aggressively selling and positioning IGEL around the world,” said Ayres. “They are loading our operating system on at their factories and all of them have put IGEL SKUs in their global price books. That happened this summer. It’s not trivial to load an operating system at the factory, certify and support that hardware. It was a very big process to get those three companies to do that. As we saw those relationships flourish and the sales volume increased, we realized IGEL selling against them is not in line with our core value of partnering. How can you be a great partner to Lenovo, LG and HP and also compete with them with your own hardware? You can’t!”

The hardware exodus comes with IGEL’s IGEL Ready ecosystem program of hardware, peripheral and software providers working with the IGEL OS now at 130 providers including HP, Lenovo and LG.

The hardware exit means more R&D muscle sharply focused on Lenovo, LG and HP hardware, says Ayres. “We are innovating with LG, Lenovo and HP about how to deliver experiences the world has never seen around cloud delivered workspaces,” Ayres said. “Any time, money and energy spent on our thin client business was time, money and energy not spent innovating on software. Why would we do that when we have partnerships with the leading device manfacturers in the world?”

Ayres sees LG, Lenovo and HP helping to drive a new era of hybrid devices with innovative form factors help users be more productive in a work anywhere world. “With people moving to this frictionless work anywhere world they want screens and they don’t want devices tethered to a table or a desk,” he said. “IGEL never built devices that had screens. Laptops and all in one are form factors that are increasingly important in this new style of work. If we are going to be the leading OS for the future architecture we can’t be building hardware.”

Hardware Makers See Big Opportunity Ahead

HP sees a “great opportunity” to grow its thin client business in Germany in the wake of IGEL’s decision to exit the hardware business, said Alex Thatcher, director of cloud clients at HP.

“One of the areas we have really wanted to grow geographically is Europe and in Germany in particular,” said Thatcher. “With IGEL focusing and becoming a software company it opens up an opportunity for players like HP to come in and grow our hardware footprint.”

The IGEL decision to exit the hardware business is also a “great opportunity” for partners to team with HP on mobile thin clients, said Thatcher. “We see a huge opportunity for growth with mobile thin clients,” he said. “We have seen a lot of pilots and kicking the tires. Over the last year that has started to change. We have seen an inflection point with customers.”

A number of large HP customers in Asia Pacific who have gone 100 percent to mobile thin clients and have “told us they are not coming back,” said Thatcher. “In healthcare and financial services we are seeing an increasing amount of mobile thin clients.”

That growth is being driven cloud hosted desktops by Azure Virtual Desktop, Windows 365 and Amazon Workspaces, said Thatcher. “Now you can get a subscription and deliver all the benefits of security and remote computing,” he said. “That opens the door for IT managers to save money by moving to solutions like IGEL and Linux on the end point for manageability. For us that is super exciting. We think it’s a huge growth opportunity.”

Thatcher urged partners to step up to the secure thin client virtualization cloud workspace opportunity. “With IGEL making this transition to a software company it is a good time for all channel partners to have a conversation with their customers on what is their mobile thin client strategy and hosted desktop strategy,” he said. “There is goodness up and down the stack in terms of revenue opportunities for partners to talk about selling cloud hosted desktop, IGEL licenses and new classes of hardware. Once you get that foot in the door that’s a relationship that will go for many, many years.”

Phillip Johnson, senior national sales manager IT Cloud for the business solutions division of LG Electronics USA, said he expects to see a “huge uptick” in LG thin client business over the next year as a result of the IGEL decision to exit the hardware business. “That’s huge upside for us across all verticals- healthcare, financial, higher education,”he said..

The LG IGEL partnership was forged by the opportunity to pair breakthrough hardware innovation from LG with the world class IGEL OS, said Johnson. “Our vision was to take the IGEL software and put it in our devices to truly change the game in the way that the enterprise approaches end user computing,” he said. “Securing the edge is a game changer. We are providing an innovative, secure, high performing endpoint computer experience.The IGEL partnership has allowed us to expand our enterprise business not just today but into the future as well. We look at the partnership with IGEL as family.”

LG is in the midst of a “Why Compromise” campaign with IGEL that offers the IGEL next gen edge OS on an LG gram mobile thin client weighing in at just 1,134 grams for a 15.6 inch full HD system powered by the 11th Gen Intel Core i3 with built in webcam and speakers. “We see this as a game changer,” said Johnson. “We hang our hat on innovation, providing the lightest mobile device. Coming out of Covid, customers are working from home and the office and they want a very lightweight device. The (LG) Gram is the product of choice for the hybrid work model.”

The Next Phase of The IGEL Journey- OS 12

Now that it is out of the hardware business, IGEL is ramping up its edge OS innovation offensive with a new wave of innovation coming in its next generation Linux edge OS- OS 12. With that major new release, Ayres said, the ‘on-boarding process’ for cloud workspaces is a major leap forward. “We can now launch people right into their virtual desktop,” he said. “It is not like this emulation that has been so clunky for so many years.”

With the new OS, users can unbox a new device, put in their email address, WiFi address and their language and literally within one minute and 30 seconds they are up and running in Microsoft, VMware or Citrix workspace, said Ayres. “You actually never even see IGEL,” he said. “It’s a much more elegant experience. These are the the types of innovations we are working on.”

The OS 12 product will also “revolutionize” the Linux distribution model, separating the OS from the certified apps that will be updated from an app portal. “This is a revolutionary piece of innovation in the Linux world,” said Ayres. “The OS gets even smaller and you can pull in only what you need for your worklow from the app portal. So if you are using Microsoft Teams or Citrix you can just pull those things on top of the base operating system.”

The new OS 12 innovations will be featured at IGEL’s Disrupt 23 conference in Munich on Feb 14-16 2023 and in Nashville on April 3-5, 2023.

The long journey from thin client hardware provider to secure edge OS software maker has not been easy, said Ayres.“There is a lot of inertia that comes your way when you try to do something as transformative as we did,” he says. “It sounds like fantasy when you say you are going to take a company that sells a plastic dumb terminal, bring it into the US and flip the script and position it as a software maker. It’s only possible if you believe it no matter what obstacles or resistance you run into and keep moving forward at all costs.”

One of the most satisfying parts of the journey for Ayres – who started his career working in the channel for multiple solution providers- has been transforming IGEL into a 100 percent partner sales company. “I spent 20 years in the reseller world,” he said. “It’s a gift to be able to sit here and tell you we are a 100 percent channel company, creating millions and millions of dollars in opportunities for our partners. My grandfather used to say we were just warming up for the dance. That is what it feels like with IGEL. It feels like a gigantic weight has been lifted from our shoulders. Now we can walk into a meeting with a customer and say we are software company with IGEL available from the leading hardware manufacturers. It’s very freeing.”

Ayres gets choked up when he talks about visiting cities around the United States with his kids as he proudly points out the many companies that are now using IGEL’s secure edge OS. “It’s crazy,” he says. “I walk around pointing at buildings, telling them ‘That’s an IGEL customer. That’s an IGEL customer! That’s an IGEL customer!”

For Ayres the transformation from little known German thin client hardware provider to a prominent next generation secure edge OS provider is a “Cinderella” story. “A lot of people didn’t see or believe this could happen,” he said. “That is why I made the tagline of IGEL Believe. Who would have thought a small German thin client company could suddenly be building a secure, edge operating system baked into the devices of leading hardware manufacturers? This is something no one would have predicted You’ve got to Believe!”",‘Dream Come True’: IGEL Exits Hardware Business - CRN,https://www.crn.com/news/computing/-dream-come-true-igel-exits-hardware-business

What is Backstage?

Having more than 19,000 stars on Github, Backstage is one of the most popular open-source platforms for building developer portals and is in widespread use by Spotify, American Airlines, Netflix, Splunk, Fidelity Investments, Epic Games, Palo Alto Networks and many others.

It unifies all infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation to create a streamlined development environment.

Backstage was accepted to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) on September 8, 2020 and is at the Incubating project maturity level.

About the vulnerability

“By exploiting a vm2 sandbox escape in the Scaffolder core plugin, which is used by default, unauthenticated threat actors have the ability to execute arbitrary system commands on a Backstage application,” said Yuval Ostrovsky, Software Architect for Oxeye. “Critical cloud-native application vulnerabilities like this one are becoming more pervasive and it is critical these issues are addressed without delay.”

Oxeye researchers reported the vulnerability through Spotify’s bug bounty program, and Spotify rapidly patched the vulnerability and released Backstage version 1.5.1, which fixes the issue.

“Every research project we spin up starts with mapping potential inputs to an application. What caught our attention in this case were Backstage software templates and the potential for template-based attacks,” said Daniel Abeles, Head of Research at Oxeye. “In reviewing how to confine this risk, we noticed that the templating engine could be manipulated to run shell commands by using user-controlled templates with Nunjucks outside of an isolated environment.”

Evaluating user-provided strings in a template engine can be dangerous since it exposes the application to such template-based attacks. The severity of an attack depends on the features the templating engine offers. In this case, the root of a template-based VM escape was able to gain JavaScript execution rights within the template. However, by using “logic-less” template engines such as Mustache, the introduction of server-side template injection vulnerabilities can be avoided. Separating the logic from the presentation as much as possible can greatly reduce exposure to the most dangerous template-based attacks.

“If using a template engine in an application, make sure to choose the right one in relation to security. Robust template engines are extremely useful but might pose a risk to the organization,” said Gal Goldshtein, Senior Security Researcher at Oxeye. “If using Backstage, we strongly recommend updating it to the latest version to defend against this vulnerability as soon as possible.”

Generation's investment in WEKA is part of its Sustainable Solutions Fund IV, which conducts deep research into innovative 'green data' companies that are helping to address the rapid increases in energy consumption associated with the exponential growth of data and modern data management environments. Today, the world's data centers are responsible for roughly two percent of its total energy consumption – equivalent to the energy use of the entire continent of Australia. By 2030, without intervention, they may account for eight percent or more, as next-generation workloads like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and high-performance computing (HPC) increase energy and resource demands.

""AI and machine learning applications fuel sustainable advancements like autonomous cars and intelligent manufacturing. However, these workloads demand massive volumes of data and computing power. Today, much of that power is wasted, sitting idle due to bottlenecks in the data pipeline,"" said Dave Easton, a Growth Equity Partner at Generation Investment Management. ""We believe WEKA is a leader in the growing green data movement, helping some of the world's best companies drastically improve their performance while providing the potential to avoid millions of tons of carbon. The WEKA Data Platform enables 10-100x performance gains for AI/ML workloads so customers can get the most out of their data, whether operating on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid and multicloud configurations.""

WEKA's Series D capital raise comes hot on the heels of an unprecedented time of growth, gains, and expansion for the company. Last month, WEKA was recognized as a Visionary for a second year in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Distributed Files Systems and Object Storage.

Flexible mounting options including rack, tower, wall or ceiling enable it to be placed out of the way to allow for more space for IT equipment

EcoStruxure™ Ready cloud-based monitoring optimises performance and enables anytime, anywhere UPS monitoring

LONDON, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Schneider Electric™, the leader in digital transformation of energy management and automation, today introduced in Europe APC™ Smart-UPS™ Ultra, the industry's first 3kW and 5kW 1U single-phase Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). Designed to deliver more power, flexibility, and intelligent monitoring in the smallest footprint, the APC Smart-UPS Ultra enables IT professionals and solution providers to address many of the challenges with deploying IT infrastructure in distributed edge computing environments and at the edge.

The global edge computing market is facing massive growth, growing at 12.5% annually to an estimated $250.6 billion in 2024, according to IDC. The proliferation of digital technologies and smart applications is driving the need for compute, network, and storage resources that are localised and in close proximity to enable business critical processes and experiences that rely on network connectivity to the cloud. Yet, configuring, deploying, and maintaining the supporting IT infrastructure for multiple, geographically dispersed sites comes with unique challenges.

With the APC Smart-UPS Ultra, Schneider Electric is bringing to market its smallest, most advanced single-phase UPS that provides the flexibility to install anywhere and save on total cost of ownership (TCO) without compromising businesses' power protection needs.

""To meet the digital demands of the future, local, regional and cloud data centres must be designed to be sustainable, resilient, efficient and adaptable. Schneider Electric continues to innovate and respond to customer needs with the introduction of the APC Smart-UPS Ultra,"" said Tarunjeet Sarao, Senior Vice President, Transactional & Edge Line of Business at Schneider Electric. ""The first of its kind, APC Smart-UPS Ultra is redefining the single-phase UPS, making it lighter and more powerful with the next generation semiconductor technology. In addition, it uses lithium-ion technology to power distributed IT and edge computing sites to ensure our digital life is on.""

APC Smart-UPS delivers more power in less space

In distributed IT and edge environments there are often significant physical space considerations, with a premium placed on maximising square footage and operating the space efficiently to optimise IT systems and improve the bottom line.

The APC Smart-UPS Ultra's compact design delivers more power while taking up less IT space, providing the installation flexibility and power density you need for today and into the future. The UPS's compact design is up to 50% smaller and lighter than comparable UPS solutions on the market today. The APC Smart-UPS Ultra offers flexible mounting options including rack, tower or wall/ceiling mounts, so it can be placed out of the way to allow for more space for IT in the rack.

Lithium-ion battery offers lower TCO over 10 years, reducing site visits

Effective power management is critical for any IT environment, but regular and effective maintenance of power protection equipment such as UPSs, especially across multiple distributed sites, can require costly ongoing OpEx investment.

The APC Smart-UPS Ultra's Lithium-ion battery lasts up to three times longer than a traditional valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) powered UPS and will not need to be replaced under normal operating conditions. This helps to eliminate costly battery replacement, labor and service fees and visits over the life of the UPS. The APC Smart-UPS Ultra saves on TCO over 10 years and comes with a 5-year warranty.

EcoStruxure Ready APC Smart-UPS Ultra ensures better visibility anytime, anywhere

Being understaffed or lacking onsite staff makes management, maintenance and service activities such as inspecting equipment, replacing batteries, swapping out failed equipment very burdensome, particularly if assets are highly distributed and geographically dispersed. APC Smart-UPS Ultra is EcoStruxure™ Ready which allows cloud-based monitoring, delivers data-driven recommendations to optimise performance, and enables wherever-you-go visibility across multiple UPS devices. Connectivity is available via Ethernet Port or embedded network port, and the EcoStruxure Ready APC Smart-UPS web portal provides automated, customisable alerts regarding the health of the UPS to make preventative maintenance simpler in order to reduce downtime and lower mean time to repair.

The APC Smart-UPS Ultra is available in Europe. To learn more about the APC Smart-UPS Ultra, visit this web page.

In a difficult year for the crypto space that has been full of hacks, failing funds, and decentralized stablecoins going to zero, nothing has compared to FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) rapid implosion.

After an astronomical rise in the crypto space over the past three years, crypto exchange FTX and its founder and CEO SBF have come crashing back down to earth, largely unraveled by their misuse of customer funds and illicit relationship with trading firm Alameda Research.

This graphic visualizes FTX’s leaked balance sheet dated to November 10th, and published by the Financial Times on November 12th. The spreadsheet shows nearly $9 billion in liabilities and not nearly enough illiquid cryptocurrency assets to cover the hole.

How did FTX wind up in this position?

How FTX’s Bankruptcy Unfolded

FTX’s eventual bankruptcy was sparked by a report on November 2nd by CoinDesk citing Alameda Research’s balance sheet. The article reported Alameda’s assets to be $14.6 billion, including $3.66 billion worth of unlocked FTT and $2.16 billion of FTT collateral.

With more than one-third of Alameda’s assets tied up in FTX’s exchange token FTT (including loans backed by the token), eyebrows were raised among the crypto community.

Four days later on November 6th, Alameda Research’s CEO, Caroline Ellison, and Sam Bankman-Fried addressed the CoinDesk story as unfounded rumors. However, on the same day, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) announced that Binance had decided to liquidate all remaining FTT on their books, kicking off a -7.6% decline in the FTT token on the day.

Back and Forth with Binance’s CZ

While Ellison publicly offered to buy CZ’s FTT directly “over the counter” to avoid further price declines and SBF claimed in a now-deleted tweet that “FTX is fine. Assets are fine.”, FTX users were withdrawing their funds from the exchange.

Less than 24 hours later on November 7th, both SBF and CZ tweeted that Binance had signed a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of FTX, pending due diligence.

The next day, the acquisition fell apart as Binance cited corporate due diligence, leaving SBF to face a multi-directional liquidity crunch of users withdrawing funds and rapidly declining token prices that made up large amounts of FTX and Alameda’s assets and collateral for loans.

FTX’s Liabilities and Largely Illiquid Assets

In the final days before declaring bankruptcy, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried attempted a final fundraising in order restore stability while billions in user funds were being withdrawn from his exchange.

The balance sheet he sent around to prospective investors was leaked by the Financial Times, and reveals the exchange had nearly $9 billion in liabilities while only having just over $1 billion in liquid assets. Alongside the liquid assets were $5.4 billion in assets labeled as “less liquid” and $3.2 billion labeled as “illiquid”.

When examining the assets listed, FTX’s accounting appears to be poorly done at best, and fraudulently deceptive at worst.

Of those “less liquid” assets, many of the largest sums were in assets like FTX’s own exchange token and cryptocurrencies of the Solana ecosystem, which were heavily supported by FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried. On top of this, for many of these coins the liquidity simply wouldn’t have been there if FTX had attempted to redeem these cryptocurrencies for U.S. dollars or stablecoin equivalents.

While the liquid and less liquid assets on the balance sheet amounted to $6.3 billion (still not enough to equal the $8.9 billion in liabilities), many of these “less liquid” assets may as well have been completely illiquid.

Relationship with Alameda Research

When looking at FTX’s financials in isolation, it’s impossible to understand how one of crypto’s largest exchanges ended up with such a lopsided and illiquid balance sheet. Many of the still unfolding details lie in the exchange’s relationship with SBF’s previous venture that he founded, trading firm Alameda Research.

Founded by SBF in 2017, Alameda Research primarily operated as a delta-neutral (a term that describes trading strategies like market making and arbitrage that attempt to avoid taking directional risk) trading firm. In the summer of 2021, SBF stepped down from Alameda Research to focus on FTX, however his influence and connection with the firm was still deeply ingrained.

A report from the Wall Street Journal cites how Alameda was able to amass crypto tokens ahead of their announced public FTX listings, which were often catalysts in price surges. Alongside this, a Reuters story has revealed how SBF secretly moved $10 billion in funds to Alameda, using a bookkeeping “back door” to avoid internal scrutiny at FTX.

While SBF responded to the Reuters story by saying they “had confusing internal labeling and misread it,” there are few doubts that this murky relationship between Alameda Research and FTX was a fatal one for the former billionaire’s empire.",Visualized: FTX's Leaked Balance Sheet - Visual Capitalist,https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ftx-leaked-balance-sheet-visualized/

357,"Spotify ranked the vulnerability as critical, with a CVSS score of 9.8",cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://assets.infosecurity-magazine.com/webpage/og/7e9b4ff1-07f8-464c-ac30-9316e76c74c5.png,infosecurity magazine,"A vulnerability in Spotify’s open-source, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)-incubated project Backstage has been discovered that could lead to threat actors performing remote code execution (RCE).

The findings come from the Oxeye research team, who have managed to exploit a virtual machine (VM) sandbox escape via a third-party library named vm2.

“We reported this RCE vulnerability via Spotify’s bug bounty program, and the Backstage team responded rapidly by patching it in version 1.5.1,” Oxeye wrote in an advisory published earlier today.

Spotify ranked the vulnerability affecting the developer portal building platform as critical, with a CVSS score of 9.8.

“Backstage can hold integration details to many organization systems, such as Prometheus, Jira, ElasticSearch, and others,” the Oxeye advisory reads.

“Thus, successful exploitation has critical implications for any affected organization and can compromise those services and the data they hold.”

Once they had successfully executed the payload locally, Oxeye then attempted to assess the potential impact of such a vulnerability if exploited in the wild.

“We started by running a simple query for the Backstage favicon hash in Shodan; it resulted in more than 500 Backstage instances exposed to the internet. We then tried to assess how they could be exploited remotely without authenticating to the target Backstage instance.”

The security researchers discovered that Backstage was being deployed by default without an authentication mechanism or an authorization mechanism, which allowed guest access.

“Some of the public Backstage servers accessible to the internet did not require any authentication.”

Oxeye then tried to set up a local Backstage instance that requires authentication, following tutorial guidelines originally maintained by the platform.

“We ended up with authentication only enforced on the client side; requests flowing to the backend API were not verified for authentication or for authorization.”

In other words, when trying to send requests directly to the backend API server of some internet-exposed instances, the researchers found that a handful did not require any form of authentication or authorization.

“Thus, we concluded the vulnerability could be exploited without authentication on many instances.”

To mitigate the impact of this vulnerability, Oxeye and Spotify have urged companies and individuals to update to the latest version of Backstage.

“Moreover, if you’re using a template engine in your application, make sure you choose the right one in relation to security,” Oxeye added. “Robust template engines are extremely useful but might pose a risk to your organization.”",Remote Code Execution Discovered in Spotify's Backstage,https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/rce-found-in-spotifys-backstage/

DOWNERS GROVE, Ill., Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Buoyed by resilience developed during the uncertainty of the past two-plus years, the global technology industry and technology professionals are optimistic about business and employment prospects in 2023, new research from CompTIA, the nonprofit association for the IT industry and workforce, reveals.

""The tech industry remains a robust choice for business growth and career advancement.""

CompTIA's ""IT Industry Outlook 2023"" identifies 10 trends likely to impact technology companies and workers in the new year.

The annual forecast finds that technology companies have generally positive views about 2023. Among firms in six geographic regions, the average rating for tech industry prospects skews toward the top of the measurement scale (excellent) rather than the bottom (terrible).1 Similarly, the turmoil of recent years is not dampening spirits for IT professionals. Nearly 80% are optimistic about their job role, including 38% who feel very optimistic.

""Even with economic uncertainties and societal issues, the tech industry remains a robust choice for business growth and career advancement,"" said Seth Robinson, vice president, industry research, CompTIA. ""To be sure, there are some negative elements, especially as technology applications reach massive scale and trigger unintended consequences. But there are many positive outcomes and countless more opportunities as technology influences every business and industry.""

Trends to watch in 2023

1. Business As Usual Gets a Hard Reality Check.

""Business as usual is no more and doing things as we always have may no longer be the safe option, even for companies that are content with flat or minimal growth,"" said Carolyn April, senior director, industry analysis, CompTIA. ""Many technology businesses will have to leave their comfort zone to thrive. That means thoroughly examining and adjusting their current operations, sales and marketing, human resources and strategic innovation efforts.""

Story continues

The evolution of the customer is why these steps are necessary, according to April.

""Customers are as enthusiastic as ever about the role technology plays in their success, but they're also much more scrutinous and demanding in their tech journey,"" she explained. ""If you sell technology, the ability to convincingly make a specific business case for every product or service is not just a nice sales differentiator anymore, it is essential.""

2. Metaverse Initiatives Will Focus on Holistic Customer Experiences.

""Instead of viewing the metaverse as a new VR-based phase of the internet, it might be more accurate to view it as an extension of omnichannel customer experiences,"" Robinson said. ""As organizations build their own metaverse for their customers, there will be less focus on headsets and virtual real estate and more focus on building depth in customer relationships and creating connections between the many digital experiences a customer might choose.""

3. Worker-employer Relationship Gaps Expose New Challenges in Hiring and Retaining Tech Talent – Employers will be tested to fill positions with workers skilled in new and emerging tech disciplines and support roles, while balancing a newly empowered workforce and macroeconomic uncertainty.

4. Cloud Acceleration Drives Demand for Orchestration and FinOps – Acceleration in cloud computing adoption has led to most organizations taking on a cloud-first approach. The next stage of adoption will focus on handling the complexity of a multi-cloud environment.

5. New Players in Digital Ecosystem Put More Competitive Pressure on Established Practices – Today's era of choice explosion and decision fatigue in the tech marketplace will prod both new and established players to up their game to stand out among the rest.

6. Vendors and Partners Eye Greater Automation With Optimism – and Concern – Tech vendors and their partners will need to work together to find automation comfort zones that are efficient and connected rather than disconnected and cumbersome.

7. Cybersecurity Metrics Are Tied to Evolving Risk Analysis Approach – Risk analysis has grown in popularity as a way for organizations to measure progress in cybersecurity. But most firms are not yet performing analysis in a comprehensive way. That will change, driven heavily by ongoing digital transformation.

8. Inflation Uncertainty and Supply Chain Issues Continue to Complicate Sales Forecasting – A confluence of economic factors has found countries and companies grappling with high inflation rates not seen in decades. In 2023 companies will have a much-diminished ability to forecast sales accurately quarter to quarter.

9. Decentralized Identity Will Become the Heart of Web3 Efforts – The noise around Web3 will continue in 2023, but the key area to focus on is the evolution of digital identity.

10. Advances in AI Spur Debate Over the Future of Tech in Society – Simply understanding how to use a piece of technology is becoming inadequate. Responsible use now entails some knowledge on how the technology functions and what societal impact it might have.

CompTIA surveyed business and IT professionals in September and October for its ""IT Industry Outlook 2023"" – 500 in the U.S. and 125 in each of the international regions. The report is available at https://connect.comptia.org/content/research/it-industry-trends-analysis.

Officially named the Epyc 9004 but commonly referred to by its codename “Genoa,” the new chip is based on the fourth generation of AMD’s Zen microarchitecture and built on a 5nm manufacturing process by TSMC.

Thanks to its chiplet design, which breaks the monolithic CPU into smaller “chiplets” that are tied together with a high speed interconnect, Genoa has up to 96 cores (double Intel’s best at the moment). The chiplets, with 16 cores each, are easier to manufacture than a single 96-core CPU. Genoa includes the latest I/O technology, such as PCI Express 5.0, 12 channels of DDR5 memory, and CXL 1.1.

“In the enterprise, we see very strong adoption of Epyc,” said AMD CEO Lisa Su during the Epyc launch event. “This year we increased our on-prem enterprise deployments by more than 50 percent, and we’re significantly increasing the number of Epyc-based solutions across the ecosystem. We’re on track to double the number of solutions in 2023.”

OEMs show up for Epyc launch

AMD lined up a parade of OEMs that are either announcing new products or supporting AMD.

HP Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri announced six new platforms featuring Genoa processors, including recently-announced ProLiants and its Cray EX supercomputers.

Dell Technologies announced the next generation of Dell PowerEdge servers with the Epyc 9004 series in one- and two-socket configurations. The new models can support as much as 50% more processor cores compared to the previous generation.

The PowerEdge R7625 is a two-socket, 2U platform designed for in-memory databases and other enterprise applications, while the PowerEdge R7615 is a one-socket, 2U server with a faster memory bandwidth than previous generations. It is designed to complete multiple jobs faster with a smaller data center footprint.

The PowerEdge R6625 is a two-socket, 1U server designed for HPC workloads or running multiple virtual desktop infrastructure instances, while the PowerEdge R6615 is a one-socket, 1U server that offers more virtual machine density than previous generations.

Supermicro announced three new lines of Genoa-powered servers: GrandTwin, a multi-node architecture solution with front and rear I/O, designed for maximum density and purpose-built for single-processor performance; CloudDC, a single-processor system designed for cost-effective service delivery in cloud computing; and Hyper, enterprise-focused dual-processor servers covering a range of computing, networking, storage, and I/O expansion capabilities.

Lenovo’s server chief (who is ex-Intel) Kirk Skaugen was there to talk up Genoa as well. Lenovo already made its Genoa announcements in September when it launched a raft of new products.

New Azure instances

Su noted that every major cloud service provider had deployed Epyc instances, and two were on hand for the launch. Oracle was there to talk up its support for Genoa but made no announcement. Then there was Microsoft, where Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of cloud and AI, announced two new HPC virtual machines on Azure powered by the 9004 processor.

First is an all-new HX series of VMs featuring 1.5TB of ultra-low latency memory. These VMs are purpose-built to help accelerate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) operations. EDA refers to the process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns and spot anomalies, to check assumptions on statistics. Guthrie said the new VMs offer an 80% performance improvement over older instances.

Microsoft also introduced its fourth generation of Azure HPC series virtual machines, the HB series, that deliver up to two-and-a-half times the performance of third-generation HB series, and up to six times the performance of HPC servers that customers run in their on-premises environments. Both tje HX and HB series feature 400 gigabit InfiniBand.

The HX and HB instances are available for sign-up now.

More processors coming from AMD

Su closed out the event with a quick roundup of 2023 Epyc products, starting with Bergamo, a 128-core version of Genoa, and Genoa-X, which is the Genoa line with AMD’s V-Cache stacking technology for L3 cache. Essentially, V-Cache stacks up L3 memory similar to how NAND flash memory is stacked up, thus allowing for more memory in a smaller space.

In the second half of the year, AMD intends to release Siena, a 64-core version of Genoa optimized for low power use on the edge.

“In addition to our commitment to CPUs, we're also committed to being the partner of choice across the full spectrum of engines that you need in the data center. So that includes our Instinct GPUs, our FPGAs, our adaptive SoCs, our smartNICs and our DPU products. So you can really see that we have the full spectrum of what you need,” Su said in closing.",AMD gives new Epyc processors a big launch with help from partners,https://www.networkworld.com/article/3679949/amd-gives-new-epyc-processors-a-big-launch-with-help-from-partners.html
364,These stocks have what it takes to win over time.,cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/709263/gettyimages-1070239362.jpg,motley fool,"This year's been a tough one for stocks and investors. The three major indexes slipped into bear territory. And the Nasdaq still is down about 27% since the start of January. But these times won't last forever. Bull markets eventually follow bear markets.

We don't know when this transition will happen. But it's still a great idea to plan for it. Especially since so many companies with solid long-term stories have seen their valuations plummet. And some players have exciting catalysts ahead. So, as we approach the end of 2022, let's take a look at five top stocks to buy before ringing in the new year.

1. Amazon

Amazon (AMZN 1.00%) is a leader in two markets set to grow in the double-digits this decade: e-commerce and cloud computing. These businesses have helped Amazon grow earnings into the billions of dollars over time.

But today's higher inflation and other troubles like supply chain issues have been weighing on Amazon. As a result, Amazon's reported declines in operating income. And free cash flow has turned to an outflow. This is painful in the short term. The stock has slipped nearly 40% so far this year.

The good news is the long-term picture remains bright. Amazon has the market position and financial resources to weather these times. The company's revenue still is growing. And members of its Prime membership program are spending more and more on Amazon. Amazon also is strengthening its cost structure. This will be a plus down the road.

Today, Amazon shares are trading for around their cheapest in relation to sales in the past six years. So, the best deal this holiday season may be on Amazon shares.

2. Teladoc Health

Teladoc Health (TDOC 2.70%) sank 63% this year. The telemedicine leader disappointed investors with two billion-dollar non-cash goodwill impairment charges. This deepened investors' worries about the company's lack of profitability.

But the toughest times may be behind Teladoc. In the third quarter, Teladoc narrowed its net loss. The company's revenue and visits continued to climb in the double digits. And Teladoc said deal size today is about 50% bigger than the average deal a year ago.

Companies hurt by today's economic environment and coronavirus disruptions have taken longer than expected to finalize their Teladoc plans. These are temporary issues. And when the situation improves, Teladoc could see a clear rebound. As it stands, the company has managed to increase U.S. member numbers and revenue per member from quarter to quarter.

Right now, Teladoc shares are trading at 2.3 times sales. This is nearly their lowest ever by this measure. Considering growth prospects, now looks like a good time to get in on this recovery story.

3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -1.65%) is one of this year's stock market winners. The shares have advanced 38%. But Vertex may just be getting started. That's because the company is at an important transition point.

The biotech company already is a solid leader in the cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment market. The CF portfolio brings in billions of dollars in revenue and profit annually. But Vertex is about to expand into another significant treatment area.

This month, Vertex and partner CRISPR Therapeutics are submitting their candidate for blood disorders beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease to regulators in the U.S., Europe, and the U.K. If all goes smoothly, the product could launch in the near future. So, Vertex has a clear catalyst ahead.

Vertex's pipeline also includes other potentially big products such as candidates for pain management and type 1 diabetes. So, a few years down the road, Vertex still will be a CF leader -- but it may also carve out significant revenue opportunities in other markets too. That's why it's a good idea to get in early on this innovative biotech player.

4. Costco

Costco (COST 0.48%) shares have outperformed the market this year. But they've still lost about 9%. This means they're less expensive in relation to forward earnings estimates than they were earlier in the year.

What's another reason to buy Costco now? Today's economic woes actually work in Costco's favor. That's because the company sells items in bulk and at dirt cheap prices. As shoppers watch their budgets this holiday season, they may favor buying at a place like Costco -- and taking advantage of their membership.

You pay an annual fee to shop at Costco. So, it's to your advantage to do as much of your shopping there as possible. Beyond troubled economic times, this annual fee plays a key role in Costco's success. That's because membership fees are high margin for the company. They don't involve major costs linked to actual merchandise -- like transport and storage, for example.

Costco's highest price membership level -- Executive membership for $120 a year -- is growing. And it now makes up almost 72% of total sales. That's a very encouraging sign for Costco's future.

5. Carnival

Carnival (CCL 2.75%) (CUK 2.94%) probably is the riskiest bet on this list. But if you're comfortable with some risk, it's a good stock to consider. The pandemic crushed Carnival by halting its cruising operations. As a result, the company's earnings plunged, and debt ballooned.

CCL Net Total Long Term Debt (Annual) data by YCharts

Today, Carnival still is dealing with these problems. But some bright spots give us reason to believe in the long-term story.

In the most recent earnings report, Carnival's adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive for the first time since its ships resumed sailing. Revenue climbed 80% from the previous quarter. And booking volumes rose above the high 2019 levels.

Carnival also is taking steps to lower costs and boost revenue. One of those efforts is removing small ships from the fleet and replacing them with larger, more efficient ships.

Today, Carnival trades at 1.6 times sales. That's lower than the level of about 3 times sales prior to the pandemic. Carnival's earnings situation is a lot different than it was back then. But if Carnival makes progress on approaching profitability and reducing debt, the stock could climb from today's levels -- and that means a buy today could be a winning move.",5 Top Stocks to Buy Before 2023,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/5-top-stocks-to-buy-before-2023/

Increased cloud adoption and the expansion of 5G networks are expected to drive growth in IoT technologies over the next few years. Emergent IoT technologies are poised to transform businesses and the social fabric, including healthcare, smart homes and cities, and the government sector. Delaware-based startup, Qubitro , looks to capitalize on the potentially explosive growth in IoT technology by helping companies bring smart solutions to market faster. Qubitro, which is also a member of the MongoDB for Startups program, offers the fastest way of collecting and processing device data to activate it wherever it's needed. Product vision Qubitro founder and CEO, Beray Bentesen, estimates that there are now billions of devices producing massive amounts of data. The company's mission, he says, is to make device data accessible anywhere it's needed as fast as possible and at a lower cost than ever before. By collecting device data from multiple networks and providing various developer toolkits for activating data in applications, Qubitro enables data-driven decision making and modern application development. The company has two main products: the Qubitro Portal , a user interface where users can collaborate with other members or their internal team and create real-time actions such as rules and output integrations with their applications, and developer tools including APIs and SDKs that allow for custom solutions without having to develop data infrastructure from scratch. Bentesen wants Qubitro to become the fabric of a digital transformation powered by device data. ""We aim to make any data published from devices flow over our network and make any application that relies on device data to integrate with our services,"" Bentesen says. The ideal Qubitro customer is one that needs to put device data into their solutions. ""It could be startups, IoT-adopting enterprises, or custom solution providers,"" Bentesen says. The company has also been heavily investing in developer experience, he adds. A platform to build upon The secret to building a platform that can process data in milliseconds with privacy and user experience combined is, not surprisingly, another platform — specifically the MongoDB Atlas developer data platform. ""We offer managed connectivity solutions, user interface, and the APIs,"" Bentesen says. ""So we process tons of data. And MongoDB is in the middle of all those inputs and outputs."" The MongoDB for Startups program helps startups build faster and scale further with free MongoDB Atlas credits, one-on-one technical advice, co-marketing opportunities, and access to a vast partner network. Bentesen says the company has benefitted from being in the program a number of ways. ""In the early days when we joined the program, we were able to get answers to questions that would take probably weeks or maybe more if you search on the internet,"" he says. ""We were able to understand what to develop, which saved us a lot of time and of course expense."" The MongoDB Atlas platform also helps their developers during those crucial stages prior to launching a new feature and as the product grows in popularity. ""With MongoDB Atlas, we could test our development environment before going to production,"" Bentesen says. ""And as we scale, we're able to observe the traffic through MongoDB Atlas and optimize thanks to the tools MongoDB offers, like MongoDB Compass , without dealing with code or complex environments."" MongoDB's document model database made it an easy choice for the company's needs. ""We decided to use MongoDB because it's a flexible environment,"" Bentesen says. ""We knew we would have to build new features over time. So we needed to go with a flexible database. We're still adding more and more features without breaking the entire system. We wanted that flexibility, and in a managed cloud offering, which MongoDB gives us."" Bentesen also cites MongoDB's Time Series collections as one of the features he's most excited about, since the vast majority of IoT solutions rely on time series data. Looking forward Bentesen says Qubitro will likely add more enterprise features in the future. The more they grow, he says, the more insight they're getting about what customers want. The company also plans to invest heavily in growing its community of users and, of course, attracting more talent. Bentensen says the company fully embraces the remote-first culture and believes they can work faster working remotely.

Qualcomm's annual Snapdragon Summit is the chip maker's opportunity to showcase its latest silicon and the advancements its technologies are bringing to the next wave of devices and experiences across mobile, automative, audio, mixed reality and more.

As part of the proceedings, it's also the place where the company's next flagship mobile chip usually makes its debut too (the one likely to likely to power the next wave of the best Android phones coming up) and, sure enough, on November 15, the highlight of day one of the Summit was the unveiling of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.

Editor's note Flights and accommodation for this launch event were funded by Qualcomm, but the views reflect the writer's own independent opinion.

Those following Qualcomm's current mobile chipset naming convention might have already guessed that – after the departure from a triple-digit system the year prior – the successor to 2021's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 was going to be the 8 Gen 2, and now that's been galvanized.

For those familiar, the underlying CPU architecture (a 'prime' core, supported by four performance cores and three efficiency cores) may not seem like a notable departure from its predecessor, but Qualcomm has made a myriad of tweaks across its latest and greatest mobile SoC (system on chip) that bring significant improvements to key aspects of the mobile computing experience; like AI processing, gaming fidelity, image processing, connectivity and power efficiency.

Cut to the chase

What is it? Qualcomm's new flagship mobile chipset

Qualcomm's new flagship mobile chipset When does the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 launch? Consumers will likely get their hands on smartphones powered by the 8 Gen 2 as early as December 2022, but the majority of devices that use the chip will arrive in the first half of 2023.

Consumers will likely get their hands on smartphones powered by the 8 Gen 2 as early as December 2022, but the majority of devices that use the chip will arrive in the first half of 2023. How much does the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 cost? Qualcomm is selling the 8 Gen 2 direct to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) – like Motorola, OnePlus and Xiaomi – so end-consumers only pay for the silicon as part of the total cost of the smartphones using it. As the top of the latest generation of the company's Snapdragon line, it'll power devices that, at least at first, demand flagship prices; probably in the region of $800 / £700 / AU$1,200 and up.

So, what are the most noteworthy improvements that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 brings to the table, and why should you care enough to actually want to upgrade to a phone using it?

Cameras that understand what they're looking at

One of the most exciting improvements set to offer some of the most tangible benefits to users is the 8 Gen 2's 'Cognitive ISP'.

What Qualcomm is calling a 'world-first', this generation's Spectra ISP (image signal processor) takes the existing image segmentation of its predecessor but brings in the added benefit of real-time processing. This means your device's camera will be able to distinguish the sky from the ground, your cat from the freshly-made bed its decided to get comfy on or the flower amid the background foliage and, at a pixel-level, apply color, tone, sharpness and noise reduction algorithms to get the best final shot.

The real kicker is that it can apply this level of real-time processing to both stills and video, and even show a more accurate end-result image on the viewfinder during capture with minimal lag. So you know that what you see and what you'll get after you press the shutter or record, will more directly reflect one another.

A feature that'll undoubtedly help the next wave of the best camera phones stand out from the non-8 Gen 2-powered competition.

Better gaming visuals, including ray tracing

(Image credit: Qualcomm)

In 2021, one key area where Samsung's own Exynos 2200 chip stood apart from its like-minded rival – the 8 Gen 1 – was the inclusion of support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing (expect better visuals in gaming, punctuated by accurate reflections, soft shadows and ambient occlusion).

Naturally, Qualcomm was keen to address that with its next follow-up and sure enough, the 8 Gen 2, commits to delivering hardware-accelerated ray tracing on mobile; with confirmed partners, like maker of some of the best gaming phones around – Red Magic, and supported titles such as War Thunder.

The Adreno GPU at work on the 8 Gen 2 promises 25% faster performance, while also delivering up to 45% greater power efficiency, along with newfound support for Vulkan 1.3, the Chinese 'HDR Vivid' standard and a feature called OLED ageing compensation too.

More simultaneous AI tasks, while using less power

AI (yes, artificial intelligence) has been the rising star in mobile computing over the last few years and that trend continues upwards with the 8 Gen 2.

Although every major element of the SoC already leverages AI to some degree, this generation's dedicated Hexagon Processor offers a revised toolset (including a Tensor accelerator that's doubled in size) set to deliver some significant gains.

Qualcomm promises a 4.35x speed increase when performing AI-based tasks, thanks – in part – to the fact that the 8 Gen 2 is the first of its kind to leverage something called INT4 (integer 4) precision; allowing for 60% more AI-based tasks to be performed concurrently per watt.

Through what can only be arcane wizardry, Qualcomm is able to scale 32-bit processes down to 4-bit without compromising the quality of the data sets being processed, which the company's Ziad Asghar – VP of Product Management at Qualcomm – told TechRadar, amounts to a 64x power reduction.

Upgraded always-on Sensing Hub

Modern phones can already help us transpose the analogue world into digital; with features like semantic text recognition and object recognition, but the Sensing Hub inside the 8 Gen 2 has been purpose-built to help with such tasks; boasting two AI processing cores for up to double the AI performance compared to 8 Gen 1, along with 50% more memory than previously.

The Sensing Hub supports an 'always-sensing camera' (a rewording from last-generation's 'always-on camera'), that's great for everything from QR code scanning to face proximity detection, facial recognition and even eye-tracking – all without having to actively open your device's camera app.

Asghar confirmed to TechRadar that multiple OEM partners have been particularly interested in this aspect of the Sensing Hub, suggesting the next wave of phones powered by the 8 Gen 2 may well have the ability to scan and action QR codes and the like without even needing to be woken up or for particular apps to be opened to interact with them.

Despite its always-on nature, Qualcomm also states that the data processed by the Sensing Hub doesn't leave your device.

Even faster and more flexible 5G and WiFi

Packing the Snapdragon X70 5G modem, the 8 Gen 2 not only supports up to 10Gbps down and 3.5Gbps up over 5G, but it's the first on the scene to boast DSDA (Dual SIM Dual Active) for two 5G SIMs, simultaneously and also boasts its own AI processor to optimize cellular performance and power.

As before, mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G, along with standalone (SA) and non-standalone (NSA) modes ate all supported.

What's more – even though WiFi 6E feels like it's barely out the door – the FastConnect 7800 inside the 8 Gen 2 renders it one of the first pieces of consumer silicon to support WiFi 7 bandwidth and speeds; only losing out to MediaTek's new Dimensity 9200 chipset, which was announced just days earlier.

With the increasing popularity of video streaming at higher and higher fidelities and bit rates, along with growing interest in cloud gaming and competitive mobile gaming, these upgrades are essential to allow those experiences to continue evolving.

Everything else you need to know about the 8 Gen 2

Touched on at the top of this article, the TSMC-made 4nm 8 Gen 2 features a now-familiar Kryo CPU octa-core architecture; split across a prime Cortex-X3 core (clocked at up to 3.2GHz), four performance cores (clocked at up to 2.8GHz) and three efficiency cores (at up to 2.0GHz) – marking a shift that sees that fourth efficiency core now instead manifest as a fourth performance core.

Asghar mentioned that those big cores are closer in power consumption to smaller cores than ever before, reflected in the 8 Gen 2 Kryo CPU's promise of a 35% speed improvement, but at the same time promising a 40% power saving.

Another great upgrade for media lovers is the chipset's newfound dynamic spatial audio functionality; allowing the sound in spatialized content to shift relative to the listeners head position, which promises to deliver more immersive media consumption.

Which phones will use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2?

(Image credit: Qualcomm)

Although Oppo is the first company to confirm that its next Find X-branded flagship Android phone (assumed to the Oppo Find X6 series) will run on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, (despite no launch date having yet been confirmed). Qualcomm detailed a number of other partners at the chip's unveiling.

Asus, Honor, Motorola OnePlus, Oppo, Sony, Vivo, Xiaomi, ZTE and more have all committed to delivering 8 Gen 2-powered devices in the near future, however, who'll be first remains to be seen. We've expanded on the confirmed list, using our own expertise to discern which other phone makers will likely have 8 Gen 2 powered phones on the market soon enough.

Xiaomi and Motorola vied for the claim of offering the first phone in the world running on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, with the Motorola Edge X30 pipping the Xiaomi 12 to the post in December 2021.

Alex Henderson

My name is Alex Henderson. I'm the Needham’s Security and Networking Analyst. It's a pleasure to have Ita and Liz here. Ita Brennan is the CFO; Liz Stine is IR. And we're going to do a fireside chat. And if you want to ask a question, there's a dialogue box. You can type it in there, and I will report it on to management at any time, from the get go all the way through to the end. And you can also email me at ahenderson@needhamco.com. I can keep my email up and keep an eye on it for that. Having said that, welcome, guys.

Ita Brennan

Good to be here. Thanks, Alex.

Alex Henderson

So, wow. That's probably the best thing I could say. I thought your Analyst Day was probably the most interesting Analyst Day we've seen in a really long time. And I really appreciate all of that great content. But I thought maybe we'd just start off with a little bit of a history around where you are in terms of the last couple of years’ worth of outstanding performance and then what you said on the Analyst Day in terms of your expectations for not just the fourth quarter, I think you gave that on the prior guide, but out into 2023?

Ita Brennan

Yeah. No, I think, look, we've been benefiting from some very healthy demand, you know, across the business really. Right. I mean, we saw – you've seen kind of the benefit of some of the clouds, you know, cloud is definitely back. You've seen some reacceleration in cloud spending. We talked about cloud being, you know, as much as 45% of the business for this year coming off of kind of 30% in the prior year. Right.

So, that's one piece of the business where, you know, you've gone from some, you know, somewhat stable, lower investment levels and growth and investment to, kind of a recovery with the 400 gig product cycle heading into, kind of back-end of 2021, heading into 2022, and having that overlaid with a very constrained supply environment, giving us some good visibility to, kind of what's happening in their business, at least within those supply constraint windows, you know, we had 6 to 12 months. It's kind of the period of time that we can kind of, that we have that visibility.

I think across the rest of the business of the enterprise has continued to execute very, very nicely for us. You saw that 30% CAGR in the enterprise business. If that continues over time, we have been constrained from a supply perspective there, but certainly on a demand perspective, we've seen that business kind of outperformed that 30% that we had said, kind of coming into the year.

So, we're very pleased about that because there's a lot of effort that's gone into, kind of building that enterprise business to continue to build that enterprise business. And you can see that it's giving us, kind of the opportunity to, you know, to add products and add capabilities, you know, to satisfy, kind of that enterprise part of the business end-to-end. So, some of the, kind of exciting new announcements were around, honestly, serving those enterprise customers.

So, I think good strong demand across the business. Supply constrained, we're assuming we'll still be supply constrained, honestly, into 2023. We talked about, you know, a growth rate of 25% for 2023 and that is still a supply constrained number as we think about the business heading into next year.

Alex Henderson

So just to put that in some context, 2021, you grew 27%; and 2022, given the kind of the midpoint of the guide, you're around 45%, even more impressively your product growth 30% in 2021 over 50% in 2022. That's last quarter was 67% growth in product sales. [Indiscernible] Those are really impressive numbers. Can you talk a little bit about why you think 2023 you're able to do a 25% type growth rate again, which would imply product sales somewhat above that. I assume the services don't accelerate to that level?

Ita Brennan

Yes. I mean, the services probably continue to grow somewhere in the mid-to-high teens kind of rates. I think as our view. So, product does continue to grow healthily in our minds. And again, we're fortunate to have more visibility, kind of into the business at this point than we've had in a long time, right, just because of the supply and because of the supply constraints. Right.

So, it's not that 2023 is completely filled in, but we do have, you know, deployment schedules for a good chunk of the year. And that certainly helps you know, give you confidence around the growth rate. I think the underlying drivers for all of this is still kind of a cloud business that's recovering from some underinvestment and looking to, kind of deploy the new products and new technologies.

Remember, we have we have new 100 gig products and 200 gig products and 400 gig products that are being deployed into that. And I think on the enterprise side, you know, you really have much more reliance on the network across enterprise customers, and, you know, the solution is really resonating with those enterprise customers.

All of the, you know, the simplicity of what we were doing for the cloud with CloudVision as a management tool on top of that is resonating really well with enterprise customers that are now more reliant on their networks than they've been in the past, right, whether you're a healthcare customer or your retail customer or your commercial manufacturing, everybody has more reliance on their tech right, especially coming out of COVID, and they're really looking for ways to kind of manage that better.

And I think we're bringing some really interesting kind of solutions with CloudVision and with some of the capabilities that the team talked about at the Analyst Day to make that easier, to make that more manageable, to make that more efficient.

Alex Henderson

So, looking at the longer-term viewpoint of the company, you guys [espoused] [ph] a view of artificial intelligence adoption within the cloud that I think was a very powerful and accurate read on things. So, I think the way you described it was that if you think about AI, it's 10x to 30x more asset intensive than traditional applications. The world is aggressively moving to it. I think about just one company I follow, like CrowdStrike adding trillions of events from their enterprise customers to their cloud petabytes a day of volume going to their cloud data like as a good example of what you're talking about, but at the end of the day, if that's accurate, I think the depiction was in a comparison to AWS.

When AWS launched with compute in 2006, then in 2010, you launched – the AWS launched the storage piece, and that was a massive inflection point in growth for public cloud, resulting in now a $60 billion company here today with a $105 billion backlog according to their queues. But you're describing 2023 as that similar type of inflection point as we move to AI technologies.

I know you're the CFO, but this is a big deal. If that's accurate, you know, that strikes me as probably one of the most profound changes in the environment that we've seen in a long time and could set you up for a series of very good years as they build out that infrastructure.

Ita Brennan

Yeah. So, you're going to get the CFO's view [of what you] [ph] just described. I mean, to me, like, this is obviously a fundamental trend. Right. I mean, AI is going to drive, you know, demands and for compute and connectivity well into the future. And it has underpinned, you know, we've always had these conversations with these customers about the fact that over time, their investment in the network is going to continue to grow. And one of the reasons why it's going continue to grow is obviously AI and the used cases that you can – that they can solution in all different areas of activity, you know, around that. Right.

You know, some of what we're shipping today is, kind of is a building block in that, you know, in that AI evolution and there'll be more for sure, and, you know, we're doing everything we can to participate in that. Right. There's a technology element to that, which is you know, can you solution more of what they need with Ethernet and with capabilities, and that's very much fits in our pattern of, kind of looking for new used cases and with these customers where we can expand, you know, what we can do for them and benefit from that over time. Right.

So, I think, you know, it's not that there's a light switch that you're going to turn on and everything is going to change overnight, but this is, you know, something that will underpin their investment and then if we do a good job from a technology perspective, etcetera, can increase, you know, where we can participate. And that's, you know, one more used case, for us to drive with these customers.

Alex Henderson

Well, it's more than just a uses case. It's a major used case. It's a huge change in the world environment if that proves to be accurate. And it, you know, the intensity of the infrastructure. So, is it fair to say that that theoretically could really drive a very rich period of growth in the [cloud, Brennan] [ph]?

Ita Brennan

Yeah. And I think, look, there's a bit of a chicken and an egg to this thing. Right. We saw this kind of with the convergence of switch routing as well. Right? The more you, you know, the more economical you can make the deployment of the capacity and then the more capacity gets deployed. Right. So, that's for sure the demand for, you know, for connectivity and compute is going to is astronomically higher, but then obviously, there'll be compression and pricing and everything else.

There'll be technology compression in that as well. But it definitely underpins, you know, over time, you know, a good, kind of future investment cycle. You know, how it plays out quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year we'll have to see, but it does underpin, kind of continued investment in the network.

Alex Henderson

How important is the software element of your trust into enterprise? Obviously, we're talking about AI. You guys are bringing AI in the optimization of the user experience combined with sharply lowering the cost associated with operating the infrastructure that enterprises use with the AI as a driver of it with CloudVision and the like. How important is that as a leading edge tool to win additional market share from the, you know, the incumbents in that world?

Ita Brennan

Yeah. I mean, I think it's hugely important as a differentiator, but also as an enabler for enterprises to, you know, to really you think about a cloud company and the resources they have, kind of to run a cloud like architecture, you know, what we're trying to do is give tools to the enterprise so they can run their own clouds in a similar way. Liz, I don't know if you want to contribute to that from a technology perspective etcetera?

Liz Stine

Yeah. I think that, especially when you're talking to the enterprises about EOS and CloudVision. EOS was built upon kind of that state database. It holds the state of the entire network device. Moving forward, we built, kind of CloudVision, which was on an aggregate of all the state. So that had the network state. And then last year you heard that we announced our NetDL, which is expanding this to, kind of third party applications and centralizing all that data within the enterprise network.

And if you have all that data, you can do some really interesting things. And I think that you kind of alluded to, you know, the AI that we're running on top of, kind of these enterprise networks. If you look at AVA, which was part of our Awake acquisition, that's running on top of that data set in order to detect network anomaly, so that we can alert you when something is happening across your enterprise network that is not normal. Right. This is the way that we can do detection, network detection and response.

So, there's some really cool things that you can do once you have that aggregate set of data. And I think that you'll see used cases come out as the enterprise realize as how valuable that data set really is?

Alex Henderson

So, sounds like that architecture, which is driven off of your [uniform of] [ph] [indiscernible] which is not the case with your large competitor, gives you a competitive advantage that is sustainable for the long-term in delivering better performance, less downtime, less – all of the values that you get in the cloud, you know, when you think about a cloud-operating environment where you've got a mile and a half long building being run by 10 people that is certainly widely different from what most enterprises look like. So, that's the primary driver of it, and it's highly sustainable. It's not a speeds and feeds world anymore right?

Ita Brennan

Yeah. Certainly – sorry, Liz, you want to…

Liz Stine

I mean U.S. certainly has that base architecture, that's hard to replicate, right And that's taken a long time to kind of through multiple evolutions to get it to where it is today, where you can really, you know, start to use that data set to, you know, provide visibility, provide monitoring capabilities that you can have in-line sensors, you know, security sensors, monitoring traffic in the network in a unique way. Right.

So there's, you know, can it be replicated? I mean, sure, but it's going to take time and it's and it's not for want of trying, you know, on the part of, you know, other solutions, but there's still something very unique about how EOS and that's particularly the collection of that state was architected that's pretty differentiated.

Alex Henderson

So, when I think about the company's structure today, you've got a couple of years of spectacular growth. You've had some pressure on gross margin simply as a result of supply chain issues, but you still managed to deliver operating margins up in the 40% range, and not too long ago you were talking about a 30 to 35, kind of [reset operating margin] [ph] and now you've kind of reset that a little bit. Can you talk about the degree to which if you continue to grow at the 15% to 30% range that you would be able to produce leverage on that or would you be able just sustain it or would you see margin compression as you [hire] [ph] to catch up with the investments you're making?

Liz Stine

Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, we're benefiting right now from accelerated top line growth with somewhat constrained OpEx growth and hiring growth, right. So, you kind of have you know, the world of where the top line was outperforming and, you know, the market for talent, etcetera, was pretty constrained. Right. And so that's what's getting you, kind of this fall through to the bottom line on an accelerated cloud number, honestly, in spite of the gross margin pressure.

I think as you think about going forward, I mean, we do want to continue to invest in the business both on the R&D side and on the sales and marketing. We believe there's lots of organic opportunities you saw in the kind of expanded TAM and some of the – what's in front of us from a business perspective. So, we do want to invest and kind of grow resources. We will, you know, seek to hire in the software, kind of on the software side as much as we can, and if there's an opportunity, kind of in this market going forward, we will be there. We will we will execute against that, right.

Same on the sales marketing side we are, you know, continuing to kind of grow the sales and marketing team in a pretty disciplined structured manner, but we do want to continue to do that as well, right. We talked about 40%, plus or minus for 2023 and reserving the right that over time, right, if there are investments that we can make that help to support and continue to grow into the future that we would do that with kind of a 38%, plus or minus operating margin as a longer-term target.

Alex Henderson

So, the company has a lot of cash on the balance sheet. You've done a number of acquisitions. Is it reasonable to think that you're still active on the acquisition front and have prices gotten more reasonable so that you can do them at a more reasonable price in this environment or you've done a number of acquisitions? Do you need to integrate those and enroll some of that together before you bring in more complexity?

Ita Brennan

Yeah, I mean, I think what we've done to date has been very, I would say, adjacent, and, you know, it's been somewhat tuck in, somewhat technology based. Right. So, we've, you know, we've acquired kind of some technology capabilities around wireless, around visibility, around the security and monitoring piece with Awake, all things that are very adjacent and focused on the network.

We've acquired some really good talent that's come with that and expanded, kind of our security, kind of knowledge and understanding with that team. Right. So, I think that's – those are things that, you know, there's a lot of cultural alignments in terms of the folks that have come on board and the products are still very adjacent. We have to integrate them. We have to integrate them into CloudVision.

So, there's work that has to be done there. But it's very kind of aligned with, you know, our core product set and what we're trying to do. So, I think we'll continue to – you could – you should expect us to continue to look for opportunities like that? We get the question all the time. Are there larger acquisitions that you could do?

I mean, we'll look at that too, but it's been – today, it's been hard to see opportunities that we can get high confidence around that truly fit, but kind of what we're driving the business and the opportunity that's there just organically with some, maybe with some tuck-ins is significance and executing against that is lower risk than a higher outcomes. So, I think that's where the focus has been.

Alex Henderson

So from a perspective of, you know, cash position, you're building a pretty nice cash of cash, it's a lot of cash on the balance sheet. We're approaching $10 a share. How do you see that if you're not doing larger acquisitions? It's – you're generating a lot per quarter.

Ita Brennan

Yeah, I think, look, we have been returning cash and we'll continue to do that. We, obviously, we've used the cash and this is one of the reasons why I think we will carry a larger cash position is, we have had the opportunity to use it competitively, you know, over time, right. You know, historically, we've used it kind of in some of the litigation and other stuff. Right now, we're using it kind of as help us drive purchase commitments and be able to, kind of be aggressive in terms of supply.

So, we will probably always carry a larger cash balance, but we are also returning cash to shareholders and we'll continue to look at that as we unravel some of the supplies up here that can be completed. We can set maybe some more structure around that, but we will definitely continue to return cash.

Alex Henderson

So, I’m pretty sure your inventory on your balance sheet has gone up quite significantly. I don't remember the exact numbers, but I want to say it was in the vicinity of 100% over the last year and almost 200% over the last two years. You've also extended significant purchasing commitments, which when I take the inventory together with the purchasing commitments, it strikes me that it's larger than your cost of goods sold out into the [2025, 2023] [ph] time frame. So, how do I reconcile the scale of those purchasing commitments and inventory build with that, kind of long-term outlook? Is there any risk that you have to back-off any of that or have any liability on some of that inventory getting long [indiscernible]?

Ita Brennan

Yeah. I mean, look, I think we – the inventory piece itself, yeah, it's grown, but it's grown. I think the turns are up – are down a little bit, but it's not significant and then it's just been growing with the business, right. And that's largely components that are, kind of stuck if you like until we solve for some of the decommits and constraints that we're seeing on the decommit side.

I mean, I think if you think about inventory, it will grow with the business. There's no doubt. I think the turns probably don't – hopefully we can manage to the kind of the current turns into next year. You know, even in a constrained environment, right. You know the purchase commitments, I mean, this is something that we obviously consciously have decided to do its multi-year in nature.

We've taken some strategic positions on some key components within that. We will continue to manage that number and to manage that view. You should expect that number to start to come down as lead times start to come in, right, and we'll look to, kind of resize that, you know, to whatever the constraint is going to be, right. So that will move around. It's not intended to be, kind of a predictor of revenue, a static predictor of revenue. It's something that we're going to continue to manage. And like I said, I would hope to start to see that come down.

In terms of risk, we've tried to target products that have, you know, a reasonable life ahead of them so that, you know, stuff does move around. You'll still have the opportunity to sell at kind of into the future. That's been an important part of, kind of thinking through that. It's not going to be risk free, but obviously we've tried to try to make it a risk adjusted approach.

Alex Henderson

So, one of the areas that people have been a little nervous about lately is the service provider category. It's not a huge category for you, but have you seen any volatility in that business that might be notable that we should be aware of? There was at least one company that sharply lowered their expectations for the fourth quarter after having held an Analyst Day on September 14 came back and promptly lowered their guidance a big time because of a curtailment of telco demand, which it sounds like it was more a U.S. service provider. So, what are you seeing on the service provider about the visibility into that business?

Ita Brennan

Yeah. I mean, obviously, it's a much smaller part of our business, right. It has, I mean, the demand there has been growing. It's kind of caught up on the whole supply constraint world as well, right, and that it is kind of limiting deployments to that business. There are, again, we have some more extended visibility because of that, right? I don't think we've seen anything different there. But again, we're not – we're exposed to very particular used cases with kind of a constrained supply environment. So, I don't know that we've seen anything different or that we would see anything different because of those factors.

Alex Henderson

Alright. And then I got a question here from the audience. Let me read this to you. Are any customer segments susceptible to excess inventory accumulation and digestion? I'm assuming he means of your product. And is there a cyclical element to demand or do the secular tailwinds offset this?

Ita Brennan

I mean, I think on the inventory side, I don't think we've been able to get customers to a point where they could start to build inventory yet. Right. It's still been very supply constrained. Anshul talked on the conference call about escalations when there's, you know, decommits, etcetera. I think that's very much the case still, right. So, we're still, you know, in a world where we're chasing supply and we're trying to meet commitments to customers. And if you're unfortunate to have to decommit because we've had to decommit and that's a very difficult situation. So that doesn't feel like an inventory type, you know, situation, right.

You know, in terms of cyclicality, I mean, we've talked previously, we talked to get at the Analyst Day a little bit, but you know, we have to look at the cloud business and think that maybe there's some cyclicality to that spend, right. You know, we saw some pullback back in end of 2019 into 2020. So, when we think about, like a 5-year CAGR, we're obviously building in some cyclicality there for cloud.

How exactly that plays out, honestly, we'll have to see, but we think we have to at least run the business on the basis that that that can be the case, right. And then, you know, enterprise and some of the other pieces where we're share gainers etcetera can be more consistent growers and cloud is, maybe a little bit more cyclical.

On the other hand, I think we've proven through multiple cycles now that we get to go back to the cloud and get our fair share of that cyclical upside as well, right. But it may be that cloud is more cyclical and not just a straight line up into the [right] [ph]

Alex Henderson

So, the other side of that coin though, could be that the AI adoption and the higher intensity of networking infrastructure builds around it proved to be early innings of a major acceleration in [demand per year] [ph], that offsets that cyclical decline that you might see if it was just conventional applications being deployed?

Ita Brennan

Yeah, I mean, I think certainly over a time period, it is absolutely positive for growth, but there'll be technology cycles and other things, kind of embedded in that. And, you know, we'll just have to see exactly how that plays out. I mean, again, you saw the Analyst Day, like, how consistently the business performs over time with that 20% plus, kind of CAGR. But, you know, there may be some volatility there.

Alex Henderson

Yeah. No doubt about it. No doubt about it. Going back into the cloud side of it, from the majors to the specialty cloud companies. Can you talk about what kind of growth you're getting there? Some of that newer penetration. And a lot of that – some of that's moving towards edge compute. How important is edge compute as part of that demand cycle?

Ita Brennan

Yeah. I'm going to let Liz chime in here as well. You know, I think that's demand from the specialty cloud piece of the business has also been very healthy, right. I mean, they're driving to the same technology trends, etcetera, as the cloud tightens, right. You know, we talked a little bit about how the large cloud companies were first, kind of to drive to worry about supply and therefore, kind of we’re earlier in terms of giving us some extended visibility, but we would expect, kind of as we head into next year that we'll see, you know, we will see more supply going to those specialty cloud customers as well because they have, I mean, they have placed, you know, demand, and they have given us that extended visibility as well. I don't know, Liz, if you want to take the [edge computing] [ph] piece of that question?

Liz Stine

Yeah. I mean, I think that, you look at kind of specialty clouds service providers. They're all looking at getting their services closer to their customers, and that would, you know, possibly comprise of building out these, kind of micro data centers. In the end, you know, it's still networking traffic that needs to be connected back. And so, you think about connecting all of these things and data center mesh is much like we do for some of the loud cloud – larger cloud providers, even enterprises that run, kind of DCI networks. So, I think it's all positive for, you know, networking. It's all about just getting services closer to customers.

Alex Henderson

And so with Kubernetes and other edge applications becoming more and more prevalent, does that change the resiliency and the real time nature of the traffic in a way that increases the demand for your high performance capabilities?

Liz Stine

I mean, I think that as you're expanding out these applications, they still – there's still requirements to have those connected back to kind of your data center, and they have to have those connected over high speed links. They have to have non-blocking. There's going to be the same network requirements as you're building out in local data centers. To get more in specifics, I'd probably call on Anshul to kind of talk a little bit more about some of the more fine features in tuning some of those traffic patterns?

Alex Henderson

Going back to the enterprise or the company as a whole, what's going on with wage rates, and you know, attrition rates and staffing levels and things of that sort, is there any improvement in the, you know, the hiring environment?

Ita Brennan

Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, last year is – earlier this year was probably, kind of at a peak from a, you know, pressure on salary increases, your retention, etcetera. I think we've definitely seen things start to cool off a little bit in that and things, kind of start to return to something more normal and that probably continues just given some of the changes in the environment. So, I think if anything we've seen that get slightly better and hopefully that continues.

Alex Henderson

So, within your existing employee base, current present, current people not included. What kind of wage inflation are we looking at Arista that needs to be absorbed?

Ita Brennan

I don't know that we've talked about specifics, but we did see, kind of merit increases, etcetera, kind of earlier in the year that were higher than normal. I think everybody did, right. And there was a lot pressure on hiring and on retention in that environment, but I think that is certainly starting to, kind of return to something more normal now.

Alex Henderson

Okay. So, just to just to remind us, which quarters do you actually do the performance, you know [risers] [ph], is that generally in the beginning of the year or is it and you approved for bonuses at the end of the year or how does that work?

Ita Brennan

Yeah, it moves around a little bit, but the bonuses tend to be annual, fiscal year, I think, pretty typical. And then the, you know, the salary increases and such a kind of moves around a little bit, sometimes usually middle of the year, plus or minus.

Alex Henderson

I see. Okay. In terms of the pricing environment, there was a lot of discussion about prices going up considerably for networking gear. Less so in the cloud, I think, than in the enterprise. Where are we on pricing increases in among your competitors and at Arista’s per se?

Ita Brennan

Yeah. I mean, so we talked about, kind of we had two price increases that we did, one back in November of last year that was pretty broad based, 5% to 10% showing customers, kind of some of the escalation and in costs and component costs, etcetera, and getting agreement that they would help fund those, right. And then we did something smaller scale in April and May of this year, roughly 5% for a subset of parts, and we'll see that, kind of kick in here sometime middle of 2023, right.

So, that's the extent of what we did. It was – we've tried to be pretty transparent with customers where we had significant cost increases. We've exposed those to customers and they've agreed to, kind of price increases to cover those. And that's been our approach. It's been very much a negotiated, kind of approach with customers with large enterprise customers and with the cloud. The competition, it's hard for me to comment exactly on what they've done. I mean I think it depends on the …

Alex Henderson

I think you would see some idea that is, do you think the competitors have raised price more than you have? And that's actually they've raised the umbrella or do you think it's comparable?

Ita Brennan

I think it depends on which parts of the business and where that the actions were probably not uniform across the entire businesses and they've been different actions and different pieces of business.

Alex Henderson

Well, my presumption has been that, you know, your big competitor has taken price actions in enterprise and commercial and used it to subsidize trying to compete against you in cloud. Do you think that's an [accurate read] [ph]?

Ita Brennan

Yeah, it’s hard for me to get too much into what they have been doing, too be [honest on that] [ph].

Alex Henderson

I can't blame the guy for trying. Alright. So, are those price increases sticking?

I think for, I mean, it's going to be linked to the cost structure and the supply chain, honestly, right. I think they'll stick for as long as the cost escalations are in place. And then if we start to get improvements, which hopefully we will, you know, we'll go drive the cost structure, and I would expect customers to come back and look for relief on some of those. Right. Exactly the timing of that. Everybody's going to kind of make sure that, you know, you've secured kind of cost improvements and stuff before you start to unravel those. But I think over time, there will be some pressure to do this?

Alex Henderson

So, there's been a lot of discussion around 400 gig as a cycle, I've never argued that people should be looking at speeds and feeds. That's so 2,000 time frame. It's such a legacy viewpoint, but 400 gig has gotten a lot of play. I think you've answered it quite clearly that it's not 400, it's 100, 200, 400. And in the future, probably 600, and 800. But has that changed the competitive landscape at all in terms of the ability of the competitors to be more in tune with what's going on as opposed to late to the party and that have any impact on your business?

Ita Brennan

Look, I think, you know, what's been great to see is, kind of the consistency with which the team has executed through these product cycles. Right. And the, you know, the ability to partner with these customers, and you know, ensure that you get your fair share of spend. I think we've seen that now multiple cycles. Right. I think 400 really, 400, 100, 200, 400 hasn't really been any different. Right. We've brought good products to market on time, and, yeah, they've been well received by customers. Yeah. There's new used cases. Pardon?

Alex Henderson

And much better software.

Ita Brennan

And much better software. I mean, it's the whole package. Right. You're not selling pieces. You're selling a system. Right. And you're selling a [system kit business] [ph]?

Alex Henderson

So, in the environment where enterprises are going into hiring phrases that put them into real challenges to try to cope with all of the technology that they want to deploy and the challenges of keeping that that running, does that accelerate the adoption of your technology and provide a tailwind, which might be counterintuitive?

Ita Brennan

Yeah. Look, I think for these enterprises, you know, if they're thinking about their businesses and, you know, in a near term basis and they have plans to, kind of execute on new technologies that drives efficiencies, right, because I think most enterprises have found themselves more reliant on technology and on the network post-COVID than they were before, right.

So, as they make investments, as they choose to make investments, focus is absolutely on operational efficiency. And how do you maintain, you know, uptime quality, all the things that the cloud has historically cared about, right? And how do you manage those footprints, you know, in the most efficient way? And by the way, have time and resources to do time to service and to do other things as well, right? I think that's the focus for the enterprise customers for us.

I think, you know, enterprises that are on that path and have decided to make those investments, I don't know if that changes unless we see a really big disruption from a macro perspective, etcetera. Then obviously, if you see that, then, you know, all bets are off, but if, you know, if you're continuing maybe in a somewhat constrained, you know, challenged environment, but this is positive, net positive for their business. I think you can see them continue to make those investments.

Alex Henderson

Got a question come in from the field, are R&D investments focused on evolutionary change or is there something more disruptive?

Ita Brennan

Again, I go back to the TAM that we kind of talked about at the Analyst Day. There's major opportunities there. I don't know if you could say to them to be, you know, revolutionary change or evolution? I think it's revolutionary from, you know, when you think about some of the, let’s take for how networks are deployed, right? If you take the, you know, the CI Pipeline and just what that can do for a customer, that's pretty revolutionary to be able to actually, you know, set up your network in advance, right, and test it in advance before you ever deploy it into your actual infrastructure.

I mean, that's pretty revolutionary from a customer perspective versus, you know, world where the best you could hope for was maybe roll back if you had a problem. Right? So, I think we are doing things that, you know, make significance, have significant impact on enterprise deployments and enterprise network management.

It's still within, you know, the scope of networking, which I think is a major positive, right, that you can have that kind of TAM expansion. Within your area of expertise. Yeah. Exactly. Within your area of expertise, that's a much easier TAM to go address in some ways than if you were trying to do things that were maybe revolutionary outside of your core business, right. But we don't need we don't need to do that yet. There's a lot for us to earn our fair share of within the networking realm.

Alex Henderson

And I think, differentially advantaged in executing against them as well.

Ita Brennan

That's right. Where you really have a right to win, right? You have you have some technology and some capabilities that, you know, that give you a big head start in terms of solution in some of those things.

Alex Henderson

Well, we've run out of time. Unfortunately, I could have gone on for hours with you guys [indiscernible] to get more into it. I certainly appreciate you guys joining us at the conference. You've always been very generous with your time, and we appreciate that. And to the large audience that dialed in, thanks so much for tuning in and listening to this fireside, and thanks for the questions as well.

With that…

Ita Brennan

Thank you for having us.

Alex Henderson

Ita Brennan

Alright. Thanks.

373,Security threats have already begun to outpace cloud firewalls. It’s a fact. But organizations exploring new cloud-native solution find themselves more prepared to stay resilient. Find out how cloud-native network security’s features and benefits are making t…,cloud computing,16/11/2022,https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/devops/thumbnails/22/cloud-native-network-security-cloud-firewalls.jpg,trendmicro.com,"Digital transformation is worth the pain.

Aside from expediency and security improvements, digital transformation has brought cutting-edge tools and new approaches to developing, deploying, and managing applications on the cloud.

One product of this digital evolution that’s been gaining popularity is cloud-native. This approach empowers organizations to build, deploy, and run applications with the full capabilities of cloud computing, including unlimited on-demand power and availability.

Cloud-native applications adopt a microservices architecture composed of several small integrated services that can be independently operated. This has led to cloud application security regularly being an essential concern to organizations and cybersecurity experts looking to minimize or completely insulate their products from security breaches and cyberattacks.

In addition, Cloud-native network security ensures that applications running in cloud-native environments are protected from adverse security events. It offers modern protection features and services like compliance management, network security, advanced threat detection, security key management, and encryption functionalities.

What exactly is a cloud firewall?

Having been around as long as networks, a firewall is a software tool that allows you to verify and control your application’s network traffic. A cloud firewall is just like its traditional on-premises replicate but hosted on the cloud and remotely available. Cloud firewalls effectively protect applications against generic malicious network traffic and attacks.

Because cloud firewalls have empowered organizations to manage their network nodes and enforce security protocols and corporate policies, they’ve become a major player in cloud computing security.

Cloud-native network security

The world is gradually transitioning away from traditional virtualizations to the cloud. Although there are countless advantages to digital transformation, the sophistication and frequency of security breaches and attacks on cloud infrastructures present one important question… how can we stay ahead of threat actors looking to compromise cloud-native networks and applications? According to a report from IDC more organizations using cloud infrastructures experiencing ar experiencing security-related failures.

Cloud services providers are responsible for several security requirements, such as infrastructure and computing resource protection. Still, security must be handled separately for native applications running on the cloud environment. Cloud-native network security is gradually gaining adoption in cloud application security because it can accommodate the many facets of cloud security. This includes application, file storage, workflow, and container security.

Cloud-native security providers now offer cutting-edge protection tools—like the Trend Micro Cloud One™ cloud security platform—which meets the high standards required of today’s advanced cloud security landscape.

Implications of cloud-native network security

There are typically numerous questions as to what the new security situation will look like when migrating to the cloud.

It’s important to know that many cloud-native users opt out of cloud firewalls in favor of more cost-effective security tools offered by providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

When these tools are combined with the increasingly popular Trend Micro Cloud One™ – Network Security, they boast significant capabilities and protections that far outweigh the usefulness of a cloud firewall. These may include central discovery, visibility and reporting across cloud environments, robust authentication through extra layers of credentials, and multiple approaches to threat detection.

Since cloud-native applications are extremely dynamic, cybersecurity teams often find it challenging to establish a firewall around a cloud-native application that meets the security requirements of applications running on the cloud.

Cloud-native applications typically have a microservice and distributed architecture model with many moving parts rather than the traditional monolithic application model. This creates difficulties for traditional firewalls with limited scopes.

It’s beneficial to examine the features and capabilities of Cloud One - Network Security and cloud-native network security in general.

Network Security capabilities

Over time, you should see that surrounding your cloud-native application with a cloud firewall by itself is ineffective, considering the advancement of cloud security vulnerabilities, attacks, and breaches. These often include advanced persistent threats and cloud hypervisor attacks which can bypass some cloud firewall rules.

Network Security offers modern, advanced protection tools that are significantly more effective against cloud-native security threats that would ordinarily bypass a cloud firewall.

Leveraging advanced threat intelligence and protocol analysis, anomaly detection, indicators of compromise (IoC) blocking, and classic signature-based methods, Network Security detects and protects against entire classes and techniques of attacks in addition to specific attacks.",Will Cloud-Native Network Security Oust Firewalls?,https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/devops/22/k/cloud-native-network-security-cloud-firewalls.html

Tl;dr: “Supercloud” has turned into a super battle royale

Reader relevance: “super” niche

Despite the term itself being unhelpful, inexplicably, a battle has broken out for the ownership and definition of “supercloud”. (And it isn’t just me that finds the term unhelpful, though even I haven’t suggested we should “nuke it from orbit”).

The “supercloud” squad has flailed around for nearly a year, trying to define the term. We’ve followed those convolutions, I am embarrassed to say, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.

Meanwhile, perhaps seeing this weakness and a void that could be filled, two new players have laid claim to the term.

CloudFlare, a company that needed to reframe and broaden its positioning beyond just a Content Distribution Network, used supercloud this week to describe their architecture and array of services. And with nary a mention of the previous “supercloud” definitions or debates. I’ve described (see comments) CloudFlare as an edge network, but that apparently wasn’t superlative enough.

Notably, CloudFlare’s offering is totally disjoint to all the (many) proffered definitions from the “supercloud” sultans, who have pigeon-holed CloudFlare as a mere “enabler of supercloud”, but not “supercloud” (and it is rare indeed for them to exclude anything from sitting under their supersized “supercloud” umbrella). So the battle for the soul of supercloud is on.

Our other new entrant is MIT, with their (sporadically PascalCased) SuperCloud. The MIT effort focuses on high performance computing (similar to a dormant “supercloud” project out of Cornell we previously noted)

And it is probably worth mentioning there is a Japanese cloud computing company that operates in China called SuperCloud.

The Supercloud Tournament

How will we resolve the battle over this disputed term? With a “supercloud” tournament! Here are the seeds:

#1 – CloudFlare supercloud (mascot: The Otter) – as a publicly traded company worth over $18 billion approaching a $900 million run rate, they are our top seed.

#2 – MIT SuperCloud (mascot: Tim the Beaver, not SBF as some might assume). Never count out MIT.

#3 – China Supercloud (mascot: Nazo No Sakana, a mysterious fish). A bit of a dark horse, but they probably get up every morning and say “If TikTok can do it, why not us too?”

#4 – SiliconAngle “supercloud” (mascot: The Waffles). Despite having squandered their early “supercloud” lead, they still make the tournament because we need four seeds.

Here is the bracket. Stay tuned for the results in this epic contest!

What is the importance of AI, cloud computing and IoT in the KPO industry?

KPO – a knowledge industry – continues to grow aggressively year after year. Deriving and sharing insights and analytics from data are increasingly becoming integral to our work. These tasks have become calculation-intensive more than ever, building a robust case for KPOs leveraging the benefits and opportunities cloud computing and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) offer. Cloud computing has allowed businesses in our industry to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, most significantly by enabling business continuity using end-user computing solutions such as digital workspace in the cloud. AI and IoT, among others, offer immense potential to identify new, unexplored sources of data (such as internet or social media mining) and present opportunities to do more with all the data to deliver even greater business values to customers. Cloud as well as AI and IoT also offer potential to improve efficiency and productivity, both operationally and financially. This is particularly important for financial services KPOs like us as we take steps towards digital transformation using modern technology and help customers transform their businesses. At Acuity Knowledge Partners, we leverage cloud computing to deliver end-user computing infrastructure so that our people can work in a hybrid work environment. We offer our customers a secure, highly available and resilient set-up on the cloud for our technology platforms. Most of our proprietary technologies implement AI and machine learning to improve data identification and acquisition as well as deliver predictive analytics in candidate applications and use cases. We continue to explore more applications for these modern technologies.

How can humans and technology come together as KPO sector accelerates business transformation?

Historically, KPO has been a human-centric industry where specialists have worked as an extension of customer teams and delivered the scope of work mostly manually. Over the last several years, the dynamics have changed. The advent of technology has brought opportunities and augmented the willingness of KPOs and customers alike to explore and leverage the same. Humans and technology are already working cohesively to deliver high-value outputs to customers. This will only grow with time as AI and IoT start to become more industry-oriented instead of being of academic interest only. There is a growing trend where business processes are being automated to an extent, and the human expert is validating and checking the quality before the output is pushed out to the requestor or the next stage of the process. This is a great example of how technology is improving efficiencies and allowing people to focus on more analytical and differentiated work, which is not possible for technology or machines to deliver today.

Importance of security maintenance over the company’s data

Data are the new oil, but I can go to the extent of saying that they are the life blood of a business, industry and eventually economy. Access to right, accurate data can help businesses scale, build value and give back to society, but if data are not protected appropriately and get into the wrong hands, the outcome can be catastrophic. Data are the competitive edge and critical input that decide the business outcomes and fate of businesses. When customers decide to engage with us, they must share the data on which most of the services are performed. Ensuring that the data shared remain secure and are always protected from unauthorized access, theft or corruption is the number 1 responsibility of KPO businesses. We have taken measures to offer a secure environment, both technologically and operationally, to our customers to build confidence that their data will be safe under all circumstances and that Acuity Knowledge Partners will always maintain customer confidentiality. Furthermore, we have procedures in place to mitigate the impact or loss should the data be compromised or get exposed. As we mark our 20 years in business, we cannot be prouder as have never had to face such an event where we endangered a customer’s data. This consideration reflects not just in our operational business but also across the digital product development process and functions where we implement secure software development life cycle, which benefits from ‘shift-left’ principles, which form the core strategies to pre-empt issues and fix them before the software gets to the production stage.

How to fuel technological infrastructure, analyze target markets, and create business models

This is a great question, but there is no one correct answer. Each business entity is different and would like to carry out these activities differently. In our case we have established an innovation programme at Acuity Knowledge Partners, where we constantly evaluate new ideas around business transformation, digital acceleration, process and service optimisation, etc. We source ideas both internally and externally. We have a well-laid-out process, which considers idea evaluation; feasibility validations surrounding technology, infrastructure, financial and operational fitment, etc.; market analysis; demand and acceptance modelling; cost-benefit analysis and business modelling before a decision is arrived at. We reach out to our existing customers as well and undertake market research to help us with the data required to arrive at the decision parameters. All this is done while keeping our core engineering and business principles in perspective.

Acuity’s proprietary technology that enables financial services and solutions for the clients

We are building a suite of proprietary digital platforms and services – BEAT (business excellence and automation tools). It covers technologies to support most of our lines of businesses. We currently have more than 100 customers and thousands of users on our platform, who are either using the technology themselves in a self-service mode to get things done or leveraging one or more digital services via a digital customer interface supported by our world class subject matter experts. All our technologies are web-based, delivered either as RESTful microservices/APIs or via modern single-page, responsive applications. Few products from our stable are:

BEATFlow – Acuity Knowledge Partners’ de facto engagement and workflow management platform that serves as a digital interface to help our customers interact with us and get work done,

Tech innovations that offer customizable and scalable products​ with a focus on generating immediate ROI​ in the financial servicing industry

Some innovations that have already shown potential are Lowcode/No-Code platforms, which are being leveraged by the industry to accelerate TTM for important business process optimisation, robotic process automation, which has helped optimise and improve things such as reporting and several other critical business processes and, most notably, cloud computing including edge computing, which I believe has had the largest impact in helping companies, especially those in the financial services industry, accelerate digital adoption and transformation, with highly visible return on investment realisation in the short to medium term. Artificial intelligence and associated disciplines including natural language processing and natural language generation, machine learning with image processing, deep learning, etc. also have tremendous potential, which can be exploited to build highly bespoke, scalable digital products for both enterprises and the masses not just within the financial services industry but almost every other industry.",AI and IoT in the financial services KPO industry - CXOToday.com,https://www.cxotoday.com/interviews/ai-and-iot-in-the-financial-services-kpo-industry/

Thus, data architecture, a subset of enterprise architecture, involves the operating rules governing data-related activities like data capture, data storage, data integration, and data usage. In other words, this collection of models, standards, policies, and rules regulates what data is collected and how it is stored, organized, integrated, and used within enterprise data systems.

What Is Data Architecture?

According to the Data Management Body of Knowledge (DMBoK 2), the data architecture is akin to a “master plan” to manage data assets. Internal organizational policies and business policies often guide the data architecture design. Data architecture deliverables include multilayer infrastructures for data platforms and Data Governance tools, and specifications and standards for data collection, integration, transformation, and storage.

The data architect develops the architectural blueprint, which is aligned with the organizational goals, culture, and contextual requirements. Typically, during multi-party data projects, the data architect acts as the central figure who is responsible for coordinating the many departments and stakeholders around the organizational objectives.

What Are the Components of Data Architecture?

The most basic components of an enterprise data architecture include the following:

Data pipelines comprise the entire process of data collection: storage, cleaning, analysis, and flow of data from one point to another.

Cloud storage indicates the presence of a hosted service with data residing on one or more remote cloud servers accessed via the internet.

Cloud computing refers to the process of storing, managing, and analyzing data on cloud hosts. The biggest benefits of cloud computing are low cost, data security, and zero on-premise infrastructure requirements.

APIs facilitate communication between the host system and a service requester.

AI and ML models provide automated capabilities to the data architecture. These models automate many of the core functions of the data architecture.

Data streaming supports continuous data-flow capability, where data may need to be processed closed to the source, in real time.

Real-time analytics define data analysis in real-time for instant actionable insights.

Kubernetes, the one-stop platform for handling computing, networking, and storage workloads.

What Are the Core Principles of Data Architecture?

Here are some of the core principles around which a data architecture is built:

Automation: Automation has removed all the handicaps of legacy data systems. A modern data architecture enables building processes in hours, provides quick access to any type of data through data pipelines, facilitates agile data integration, and allows continuous data flow.

What Are the Latest Trends and Challenges?

New technologies and architectures to capture, process, manage, and analyze a wide range of data throughout the organization are constantly emerging. In addition to innovations in storage and processing on the cloud, enterprises are moving to new approaches for data architectures that enable them to manage the diversity, veracity, and volumes that come with big data.

From a long list of Data Architecture trends shaping 2021, ones worth noting were democratization of data access, an AI-ready architecture, the rise of data architects, data fabrics, data catalogs, DevOps, and, of course, the cloud. Beyond 2021, here are some trends to watch:

Many data architecture leaders are moving away from the enterprise-wide central data lake to a design based on the domain, which can be customized and fit for purpose, in order to increase the time-to-market for new products and services built on top of the data.

The move toward highly modular data architectures is here to stay. The modular concept uses best-of-breed, open-source components that can be replaced by new technologies when needed, without impacting the rest of the data architecture.

More recently, the data architecture concept has emerged out of increasing adoption of cloud computing in enterprises, followed by a dramatic move toward cloud-based platforms for all or most Data Management tasks.

Big data architecture is the conceptual or physical system to ingest, process, store, manage, access, and analyze massive amounts, velocities, and diverse data that are challenging to deal with in traditional databases. Big data technologies are very specialized, using frameworks and languages not commonly found in more general-purpose application architectures.

AI-driven cloud services capable of processing a variety of data types is on the rise. With greater data access demands comes the need for supporting AI and ML within a complex, multi-cloud, hybrid environment.

As the data fabric enables faster data analytics in a variety of cloud setups, growth of the data fabric also means growth in hybrid and multi-cloud.

High-performance data architecture models, though still in a nascent stage, are developing rapidly. Advanced Data Science applications, such as predictive analytics and applied AI and ML, need data environments that are both high volume and high speed, and at the moment, that condition is achievable with only hybrids and multi-clouds.

A well-designed big data architecture makes it easier for the business to crunch data and forecast future trends so that it can make smart decisions. Enterprises are using big data analytics technologies to optimize their business intelligence and analytics initiatives, moving beyond slower report tools dependent on data warehousing technologies and toward smarter, more reactive applications that provide greater insight into customer behaviors, business processes, and overall operations.

This trend is related to the previous trend. Cloud infrastructure providers like AWS, Microsoft, Google, and IBM can handle nearly unlimited amounts of new data and provide on-demand storage and computing capabilities.

One big challenge is that while new technologies to process and store data are coming, the amount of data is doubling in size roughly every two years. Gartner analysts estimate that more than 50% of business-critical data will be created and processed outside the data center or the cloud by 2025. The three main drivers for the future of data infrastructure can be described as moving toward the public cloud, SaaS services, and enhanced data engineering.

The second challenge comes with hybrid and multi-cloud. While these environments are becoming increasingly popular, ongoing data security and management challenges will cause enterprises to look more at hybrid and less at multi-cloud options. Only cloud platforms, with their diverse solutions, can provide the speed, scale, and ease of use of an enterprise-level Data Management platform, though Data Quality will continue to be a lingering issue.

The modern data platform is built around a business-centric value chain, not IT-centric coding processes, in which the complexities of the traditional architecture are abstracted to a single, self-service platform, which converts streams of events into analytic-ready data.

The third challenge is that the new data technologies dramatically add to the complexity of data architecture, frequently hindering the organization’s continued ability to deploy new capabilities, maintain existing infrastructure, and guarantee integrity of AI models.

What’s the Difference Between Data Architecture and Data Modeling?

While both data architecture and data modeling strive to align data technologies with business goals, data architecture is solely focused on maintaining relationships between business functions, technologies, and data. In short, data architecture sets standards across data systems, acting as a vision or a pattern for how data systems interact. Data architects develop a vision and blueprint of an organization’s data infrastructure, and the data engineers are in charge of creating this vision.

On the other hand, data modelers work with application developers to understand the business processes implemented by the developed applications, and to identify the best representation for data supporting that application. Data modeling is built around data and their relationships, with a model providing the information that is intended to be stored, and is of main value in cases where the end product is to generate the computer software code for an application, or prepare a functional specification that helps guide decisions about the computer software.

Entity-relationship models use diagrams to depict data and its relationships. A data model may translate directly to an entity-relationship model, a relational database, a business-oriented language, or an object-modeling language.

During the enterprise architect data modeling process, data models must be made logical and easily understood by the people who extract insights about data objects. The enterprise architecture data modeling process requires appropriate planning and involves three phases: a conceptual model, a logical model, and a physical model.

The global software defined networking market size reached US$ 15.7 Billion in 2021. Looking forward, the publisher expects the market to reach US$ 55.7 Billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 23.5% during 2021-2027.

Keeping in mind the uncertainties of COVID-19, we are continuously tracking and evaluating the direct as well as the indirect influence of the pandemic on different end use industries. These insights are included in the report as a major market contributor.



Software-defined networking (SDN) refers to a network architecture solution used for workflow automation through software-based applications. It is designed to enhance the efficiency and agility of networks for enabling the user to control large volumes of data and the network traffic.

The SDN architecture consists of various elements, such as a controller to centralize physical and virtual environments, southbound application program interface (API) to transmit information between the controller and the individual switches, access points and firewalls, and northbound API to transfer data between the controller and the application and policy engines. In comparison to traditionally used networking systems, SDN is more cost-effective and offers enhanced flexibility and security over the entire network.



The rising trend of network infrastructure automation and the widespread adoption of cloud-computing services and big data analytics across various industries, are the key factors driving the growth of the market. There is an increasing demand for efficient networking solutions, such as SDN, for data center consolidation, server virtualization and enhancing enterprise mobility. In line with this, with the increasing adoption of Bring-Your-Own-Devices (BYOD), organizations are extensively using SDN solutions to customize and manage the data accessed by employees and optimize the mobile workforce.

Story continues

Furthermore, various technological advancements, such as the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with connected devices, are acting as other growth-inducing factors. SDN service providers are also developing architectures to support the 5G infrastructure, thereby creating a positive outlook for the market. Other factors, including increasing investments in the development of open-source SDNs, along with digitization of the existing 3G and 4G networks, are anticipated to drive the market further.

The big tech companies which were once the disrupters of the stock market now possess a dim outlook for the first time in their history.

Companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Twitter have all announced massive staff layoffs. Smaller tech firms such as Shopify (SHOP), Lyft (LYFT), Salesforce (CRM) have also followed suit.

These once untouchable companies are now facing weaker growth prospects, sending stock prices plummeting. The last time this occurred was during the dot-com crash of 2000.

Amazon (AMZN) Price Chart

Meta stock price is trading 70% lower than it was a year ago. Amazon stock has lowered 45%. Microsoft and Google are down almost 30%.

The tech heavy index Nasdaq 100 (US100) has fallen 30% in the past year, twice as much as broad market S&P 500 (US500)

Many of these companies have also released a slower growth guidance for upcoming sessions, causing market watchers to believe that dot-com crash 2.0 is already upon us.

Why is big tech growth slowing down?

Global job cuts at big tech come during a period of high employment rates globally, highlighting the fact that this is an industry specific issue.

Cost cutting is occurring in other manners too, for companies like Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL), many staff perks have been slashed

Reasons behind these are multiple, firstly to some extent there are individual company issues affecting profits. Meta (META), has not been able to successfully gain investor attention for its Metaverse project, Amazon (AMZN) is dealing with slowing online shopping demand, and Twitter has the uncertainty of a new - and often capricious - owner in Elon Musk.

Secondly there are more broader issues affecting the firms, much of them stemming from inflationary pressures.

Apple (AAPL) Price Chart

The high cost of living has meant that overheads have risen for most firms, eating into profit margins. Customers are also less willing to purchase the expensive products and services many of the tech firms provide.

Online ad revenues have also lowered due to clients reducing their own costs, which has further reduced income for the tech firms, especially for Meta and Google.

Dan Ridsdale, Head of Technology at Edison Group adds that market sentiment has also shifted: “Investor sentiment has shifted from growth to value, meaning that companies need to reduce costs to look after their earnings. There's clearly also an element of herd mentality – whereas previously companies were engaged in an arms race to generate growth, now, nobody wants to be called out for not looking after the bottom line.""

Google (GOOG) Price Chart

What’s next for Big Tech?

Dan Ridsdale is hopeful that high growth periods will return once again for tech companies “but it will be a while before factors align again to drive a cycle as strong as this one.""

""We have been living through a period in which we saw easy access to capital supporting very significant structural transition cycles – such as Cloud computing, SaaS, Social Networks, AI etc. The rate of structural change in technology is unlikely to decelerate but growth will be hampered by fiscal tightening and a poor economic outlook in the short term.”

He says that this will occur by “companies [focusing on] their core businesses and a smaller number of key structural growth initiatives. M&A is also likely to pick up again before long, with tech majors looking to fill gaps in their offering or strengthen their position in markets/technologies with significant growth potential.”

Steven Perkins, National Leader at Grant Thornton comments in an analyst note: “Technology companies need to streamline operations to drive efficiency and effectiveness. Tax changes around the globe and mounting regulatory oversight will also drive restructuring.”

Raja Lahiri, Equity Partner at Grant Thornton says: “Tech companies need to enhance their global risk and compliance management framework as they expand across the world.”

He adds: “In my view, talent retention, upskilling of digital talent and focus on culture should be a key strategic priority going forward.""

Mostly Edge computing is integrated with technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and machine learning (ML). Edge AI simulates the machine operator's behavior, while artificial intelligence or machine learning helps in decision-making by analyzing the data. Edge computing solutions, along with AI, can do data processing of semi-structured and unstructured data. Edge AI integrates each system, machine, and resource in the whole process, so real-time data is readily available at any time from any place. As the whole system is integrated, the machine operator can easily send commands to the machines or instructions to another machine operator.

SMEs to register higher CAGR during the forecast period

Based on organization size, the edge AI software market has been segmented into SMEs and large enterprises. SMEs are enterprises with employee strength of 1–1,000, while large enterprises have an employee strength of more than 1,000. SMEs have a low marketing budget and often lack the resources and capabilities for effective marketing orchestration. With limited budgets, SMEs try to scale up their business through cost-effective techniques to generate maximum RoI from their spending. The intense competitive market has encouraged SMEs to invest in edge AI solutions and services, grow their productivity, and reduce costs. These enterprises are aggressively opting for edge AI due to flexibility, cost-effectiveness, lower technology risks, resource utilization scalability, and improved organizational productivity. Increasing awareness about the advantages of using AI within SMEs can help boost the market growth.

Oxeye CTO Ron Vider said Oxeye worked with Spotify to responsibly disclose the issue and enabled a patch to be created prior to the disclosure of the vulnerability, which Spotify gave a 9.8 out of 10 severity rating.

Backstage is now being advanced under the auspices of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), but is already widely used by organizations such as American Airlines, Netflix, Splunk, Fidelity Investments, Epic Games and Palo Alto Networks, as well as by Spotify.

The vulnerability is another example of a potential template-based attack through which run shell commands can be manipulated to inject malware into an application development environment.

In general, separating the logic from the presentation layer as much as possible can greatly reduce exposure to the most dangerous template-based attacks.

Vider said Oxyeye is focusing its vulnerability research on cloud-native platforms such as Backstage that are generally being used to build modern applications based on a microservices architecture. It’s not clear to what degree organizations have transitioned away from more monolithic approaches to building applications, but it’s clear that a much larger percentage of applications are now being constructed using microservices.

Cybercriminals, of course, are targeting these platforms as part of a sustained effort to compromise software supply chains in the hope that the malware they inject will find its way into multiple downstream applications. Those attacks, in turn, are convincing more organizations to embrace DevSecOps best practices to better ensure the integrity of their software supply chains. The challenge is many of those attacks are being aimed at open source software projects that don’t always have enough resources to quickly develop a patch in the event a zero-day vulnerability is disclosed.

While it’s impossible to know the extent to which cybercriminals are already exploiting vulnerabilities in DevOps platforms, the level of cybersecurity scrutiny being applied has dramatically increased in the wake of a series of high-profile breaches. The Biden administration has even gone so far as to issue an executive order requiring federal agencies to better secure their software supply chains. As a result, DevOps teams should expect there to be a lot more DevOps platform vulnerability disclosures in the months ahead, and that those vulnerabilities will require immediate patching.

Like it or not, software supply chains are going to become more secure. The only thing left to be determined is the level of pain that will be experienced as more vulnerabilities are discovered in the DevOps platforms that were used to construct them.",Critical Vulnerability Discovered in Open Source Backstage Platform,https://devops.com/critical-vulnerability-discovered-in-open-source-backstage-platform/

395,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)---- $III #ADM--Enterprises in the U.K. are boosting investment in application development to support products, services and business results, ISG says.",cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20221115005544/en/1016900/23/ISG_%28R%29_Logo.jpg,business wire,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enterprises in the U.K. are boosting their investments in application development as they recognize its importance to their products, services and business results, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm.

The 2022 ISG Provider Lens™ Next-Gen ADM Services report for the U.K. finds that the country’s application development and management (ADM) market is growing faster than its overall technology sector. Major companies, including automakers, have begun to reorganize product development around applications. Because talent is scarce and building large application development systems requires advanced expertise and tools, many enterprises are partnering with service providers in this area.

“Companies in the U.K. are realizing that applications will play a significant role in the future of their business,” said Anna Medkouri, partner and Technology Modernization Solutions lead for ISG EMEA. “They are turning to providers for consulting and outsourcing services that deliver business value.”

The tumultuous events of the past few years have added to the application development burden on enterprises in Britain, the report says. Companies are still adapting their systems to new regulations, increased bureaucracy and barriers to worker mobility caused by Brexit, while also adjusting to the rise of distributed teamwork after the COVID-19 pandemic. Supply chain disruptions that began during the pandemic have continued, while the war in Ukraine has created other shortages and raised energy prices. The war has also intensified concerns over increasing cyberattacks.

The U.K.’s continuing labor shortage, made worse by a wave of career changes during the pandemic, makes IT recruitment and retention difficult, ISG says. The scarcity of skills remains a major issue in the IT industry, especially in high-demand sectors such as AI and cybersecurity, ISG says.

“IT departments are overwhelmed with new challenges from outside and want to focus on their core business,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “ADM services are helping them evolve their applications and development methods.”

Several technology trends have put additional pressure on enterprises to transform application development, the report says. The growth of cloud computing, the long-awaited ability to combine data from across an organization and the emergence of AI-based automation tools all are driving rapid changes in this area.

The 2022 ISG Provider Lens™ Next-Gen ADM Services report for the U.K. evaluates the capabilities of 48 providers across five quadrants: Agile Application Development Outsourcing, Agile Application Development Projects, Application Managed Services, Application Quality Assurance and Continuous Testing Specialists.

The report names Accenture, Capgemini, Cognizant, HCL, Hexaware, Infosys and Wipro as Leaders in three quadrants each. It names Coforge, DXC Technology and TCS as Leaders in two quadrants each. Atos, Birlasoft, BJSS, EPAM, Tech Mahindra, UST and Zensar are named as Leaders in one quadrant each.

In addition, Cigniti, DXC Technology, ITC Infotech and Mindtree are named as Rising Stars — companies with a “promising portfolio” and “high future potential” by ISG’s definition — in one quadrant each.

A customized version of the report is available from Hexaware.

396,"A conversation between guest Forrester Consulting and Elastic explores how applying search-powered technology to unify, visualize, and scale data can enable organizations to be more insights-driven.",cloud computing,16/11/2022,https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltbe143844dbad9e62/6375252e5797f6109ea9155b/blog-elastic-unstructured-data.jpg,elastic.co,"We asked a veteran CIO and a leading analyst whether organizations today are getting results that matter from all their data, and the conversation was illuminating.

Less than 20% of enterprise data is finding its way into applications that provide actionable insights for businesses, estimates guest Boris Evelson, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. There are “a lot of opportunities for all of us,” he said.

A recent study of technology leaders conducted by Forrester Consulting and commissioned by Elastic found that managing unstructured data was respondents’ top challenge that they are trying to address with search-powered technology today.

Evelson and Matthew Minetola, a CIO for 20+ years, now at Elastic, recommended three strategies to make progress in addressing this challenge. By applying search-powered technology to unify, visualize, and scale data, organizations can start to tap into that data opportunity.

Unify data

For 77% of survey respondents, information silos prevent using data to accelerate business growth. Organizations with structured data in data warehouses and unstructured data in data lakes may require different tools for analyzing and managing data. Search-powered technology can offer a unifying layer that brings structured and unstructured data together.

“As the CIO, your job is to be able to provide the information a business needs in order to make decisions,” Minetola said. “The ability to now see into that 80% of the data and now make decisions based off that…is significant.”

Unifying data can help accelerate digital transformation — an objective for which 84% of organizations say they rely on search-powered technology. When thinking about all the data sources an organization needs to grapple with as part of transformation, it makes sense. For instance, consider a bank with thousands of computer systems in over a hundred countries. “You need technologies that close silos,” Evelson said. “Whenever we talk about digital transformation, data and analytics platforms that unify everything that I just talked about, like search powered-technologies, are at the top of everyone's minds.”

Visualize and take action

Search-powered technology should bring two critical capabilities to the table: a visualization layer and machine learning. Visualization improves the ability to extract insights from large volumes of data. “It’s one thing to be able to have data,” Minetola said. “It’s another thing to understand it.” Furthermore, machine learning such as natural language processing or vector search can help join data sources to create more relevance and context.

Together, these capabilities can help organizations be more adaptive and responsive in real-time, as opposed to pre-defining database queries up front and relying on historical views. Minetola describes the change as progressing from looking at data “in the rear view mirror to looking at it through the front windshield.”

“Without the ability to be able to link that data, to see that data, and understand it in real time and action it and be able to make insights and create relevance, I don’t know how in today’s world, let alone tomorrow’s world, a company is going to be able to survive,” Minetola said.

Scale with cloud

Cloud, as Minetola said, enables “the ability to scale up…and not worry about where a limit is” when it comes to storing and managing data. When asked which features are most important to the success of their next search-powered solution, 85% of respondents named high storage capacity and a cloud-based platform.

McKinsey identifies the potential value of innovation driven by cloud computing at $770 billion, including faster product development and hyper-scalability. Imagine being able to see telemetry data on what people are doing on a website, and then tying that to product data, and then being able to see product utilization over time. By massively scaling with search-powered technology on cloud, there are ways to better understand patterns of behavior and apply those insights to product innovation.

Aspiring to insights-driven business

Using search-powered technology to grasp the 80% of data just beyond our fingertips can help organizations be more insights-driven. Evelson explained that being an insights-driven business goes even further than being data-driven.

A data-driven business transforms data into metrics and indicators. An insights-driven business makes decisions based on those indicators. For 83% of organizations, search-powered technology delivers important insights that improve the speed of decision making. From those decisions stem actions.

“And then, hopefully,” Evelson said, “those actions are affecting tangible business outcomes.”

BFSI industry vertical to hold largest market share in 2022

Cloud computing is a critical element of digital transformation. The BFSI vertical, which was initially hesitant to opt for digital transformation, is now embracing the benefits of cloud services. It offers benefits such as customer relationship management, regulatory compliance, omnichannel banking, and open banking operations. These benefits drive BFSI firms to incorporate cloud migration into their digital transformation strategies. Banks specializing in cards, wealth management, and investment services are introducing features like digital identity, behavioral biometrics, push notifications, e-wallets, and QR payments using the IaaS and PaaS models on the private cloud. For instance, a leading Norwegian bank adopted the PaaS model on the public cloud to transform its peer-to-peer mobile payment application. Thus, the growing technological revolution will create several opportunities for cloud-managed service providers to offer customized services to the BFSI vertical.

North America to hold largest market share of cloud managed services market in 2022

North America comprises the US and Canada. The region has a well-developed and advanced infrastructure that supports the adoption of cloud-managed services.

398,Cloud computing has evolved significantly from its origins to become an essential service that many modern organizations rely on today.,cloud computing,15/11/2022,https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/disasater_recovery_g486296390.jpg,techtarget.com,"Cloud computing has become indispensable for most households and businesses, and it was instrumental in minimizing the social disruption and economic destruction of lockdowns and restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cloud computing breaks down into information, application and computing utilities, and takes form in IaaS, PaaS and SaaS.

The pandemic accelerated business adoption of cloud services as organizations turned to online services and infrastructure to accommodate remote employees and customer demand for online meetings, events and commerce. Gartner estimates worldwide spending on public cloud services to grow from $410.9 billion in 2021 to $494.7 billion in 2022 -- an increase of 20.4% -- with end-user spending to reach about $600 billion in 2023.

What was there before cloud computing? As businesses migrate workloads online and build new cloud-native applications, the cloud displaces enterprise data centers. However, the concept of computing as a utility or service is certainly not new, and businesses didn't always own and operate private data centers. Until the introduction of minicomputers -- such as the Digital Equipment PDP and VAX series that proliferated across business and academia in the 1970s -- only the largest enterprises and government agencies could afford to buy and operate a mainframe. Time-sharing solved this problem, according to inventor John McCarthy, via an operating system that allowed many users to have simultaneous access to a large and powerful mainframe computer that was shared through remote terminals. The data processing needs of smaller companies fueled the rise of time-sharing as a business, with hundreds of companies providing services by the mid-1960s. While most of these companies are lost to history, some like IBM Global Services, DXC Technology (successor of Electronic Data Systems and Computer Sciences Corporation) and NTT Data (which acquired Perot System) survive as part of full-service IT services providers.

The rise of minicomputers was followed by PCs and Unix workstations along with Windows and Unix servers destroyed what was left of the time-sharing market and paved the way for modern data centers and subsequently cloud computing. Though virtualization had long been part of IBM's mainframe operating system, the final piece of technology was the reinvention of virtual machines for x86 systems by the founders of VMware in 1999. VM technology provided the foundation for cloud compute instances and soon led to the virtualization of other infrastructure resources that constituted the early cloud services, including the following: storage (block volumes, network file shares and object buckets);

networks (VPNs and virtual LANs);

application containers (Docker runtime); and

network control plane and service (software-defined network and network functions virtualization).

Who invented cloud computing? Cloud computing is a complex platform involving myriad different technologies. Cloud services rely on several core components, which makes ascribing authorship to a single individual or entity impossible. See the various technologies and their originators in the following table: Cloud component Inventor x86 servers and operating systems (Windows, Linux) Intel, Microsoft and the Linux project x86 virtualization VMware, and later Cambridge University with the Xen hypervisor Internet and widespread high-speed internet access Early packet-switched networking (Arpanet): Bob Kahn, Vint Cerf, et al. TCP/IP ecosystem (routing protocols, DNS, etc.): various Telcos and broadband providers: various World Wide Web: Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee Application service providers (ASPs) and multi-tenant SaaS providers ASPs: Jostein Eikeland, founder of TeleComputing SaaS: Marc Benioff, Larry Ellison and Evan Goldberg of Oracle IaaS Amazon Web Services Tracing the etymology of the term cloud is difficult since the cloud metaphor was widely used by early internet designers to denote the wide-area routing and switching infrastructure between network nodes. Perhaps the first use of cloud to describe a collection of remotely executing applications and services came from Andy Hertzfeld, one of the creators of the original Apple Mac computer, who later co-founded General Magic in 1993. In a 1994 Wired article, Hertzfeld described the startup's new Telescript system as follows: The beauty of Telescript is that now, instead of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create sort of a virtual service. The term cloud came into widespread use in 2006 when Amazon launched AWS with the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service.

1990s: Precursors to cloud computing The precursors to cloud computing include time-sharing, ASPs and consumer information services, such as CompuServe and AOL. They show that the impetus for remote services, whether delivered over the internet or a dial-up line, was the need for applications and data that couldn't easily -- if at all -- be provided locally. Although virtual machines were long part of mainframe systems, early time-sharing uses centered on application processing. By the late 1990s, ASPs were common, and the Oracle brain trust extended the idea to multi-tenant SaaS applications, leading Benioff to leave and found Salesforce while Goldberg stayed on at Oracle and started NetSuite. Complicated enterprise software -- such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) and financial systems -- are ideal candidates for SaaS due to the cost of the required infrastructure and expertise needed to operate them. It wasn't until enterprises installed larger internet circuits and executives warmed up to the concept of remotely executing applications that companies such as Salesforce took off, with revenue exploding in the 2000s. The popularity of consumer online applications and social networks -- such as Evernote, Facebook, Webex and Dropbox -- paved the way for business SaaS by demonstrating the convenience, simplicity and reliability of online applications to enterprise executives.

2000s: The modern cloud Cloud services as broadly understood today -- virtual infrastructure resources, development platforms and complete applications -- emerged in the 2000s. While Benioff was evangelizing the benefits of SaaS business applications, internet businesses such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft were building vast data centers to accommodate the rapid growth of online commerce and applications. AWS birthed the IaaS industry as an outgrowth of previous efforts to create its Amazon marketplace for third-party retailers. After building the necessary infrastructure and APIs, some at the company realized that they had unused capacity -- particularly outside peak shopping periods -- that could be rented on demand. AWS was born when S3 and EC2 were released in 2006. Microsoft and Google soon followed with cloud services in 2008, with Azure and Google App Engine, respectively. The same year, NASA released the Nebula platform that evolved into OpenStack. Google simultaneously pioneered SaaS productivity applications by releasing the Google Apps suite in 2007. In 2009, Apple introduced limited online document sharing and editing in iWork, while Microsoft joined the SaaS market by launching Office 365 in 2011. Consumers were first to embrace the cloud via services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud and other file storage products that replaced email and USB sticks for file sharing and local hard drives for backup. These same use cases attracted businesses to both packaged SaaS backup products and low-cost IaaS storage services such as S3 and Azure Storage for off-site archival. As virtualization overtook enterprise data centers, organizations augmented these storage services with compute instances to create remote disaster recovery environments at a fraction of the cost of dedicated secondary facilities.

2010s: Cloud computing evolves The nexus of cost-conscious businesses recovering from the 2008 financial crisis and rapidly maturing cloud technology led many organizations to explore cloud services as an alternative to capital-intensive private infrastructure. The pay-as-you-go convenience of cloud services fueled organic bottom-up adoption within large enterprises. It enabled teams to begin creating cloud environments from department budgets without needing to go through long capital approval processes for new equipment or supporting complex deployment and maintenance demands that accompany local data centers. The decade saw an explosion of new business and consumer cloud services along with construction of the hyperscale data centers required to operate them, with Apple iCloud, IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud all launching. The decade's latter half saw the rise of container infrastructure -- namely, Docker container runtime and image format, and the Kubernetes cluster manager -- as a replacement for VMs. Every cloud service soon introduced container management services and hybrid products, such as Docker Enterprise, Red Hat OpenShift and VMware Tanzu, offering workload portability between private and public cloud environments. Companies can choose among public, private or hybrid for cloud storage options, depending on their needs.",The history of cloud computing explained,https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/The-history-of-cloud-computing-explained

Consumer Reports has published annual reliability survey data indicating that hybrids are generally more reliable than their gas-only equivalents. Hybrid cars were the most reliable among vehicle types, with their SUV siblings ranking third. Certain models were stand-outs, including the Ford Maverick pickup, Lexus NX luxury SUV and Toyota Corolla sedan — they all had above-average reliability on top of major fuel savings.

That trustworthiness doesn't always extend to other electrified cars. The publication found that plug-in hybrids aren't as reliable. Toyota's Prius Prime and RAV4 Prime are less reliable than their conventional hybrid versions, and the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid was one of the most unreliable vehicles in the survey. EVs continue to struggle, too. While there are some exceptions, such as the ""outstanding"" reliability of the Kia EV6, the category is still plagued with glitches — and not just Tesla's build quality issues. Ford's Mustang-Mach-E dipped to below average due to its electronics flaws. Only four out of 11 models with enough survey data had average or better reliability.

A straightforward hybrid isn't always the best choice, either. Consumer Reports warns that BMW, Mercedes, Ram and others offer ""mild"" hybrids that don't offer much in the way of fuel savings, and are sometimes focused more on adding power. These vehicles weren't included in the hybrid reliability rankings.

The greater reliability of hybrids isn't a total surprise. While they offer improved fuel economy, they're ultimately based on familiar model lines using well-established combustion engine technology. EVs are more likely to be brand new models based on young electric motor systems and don't have years of refinement.

Automakers will have to improve their safety tech if they want to stay in Consumer Reports' good graces, whatever powertrain they're using. As of November, the outlet will penalize models that don't include pedestrian-aware automatic emergency braking as a standard feature. CR will also stop handing out bonus points to vehicles that only have blind spot warnings (they'll need rear cross traffic warnings as well) and forward collision alerts. This will theoretically push car creators to strengthen their default safety packages and potentially save lives.",Consumer Reports finds hybrid cars are more reliable than gas-only models,https://www.engadget.com/consumer-reports-hybrid-reliability-ev-phev-170003341.html

Why EVs are more popular

Concerns about the climate certainly play a role in motiving people to go electric. But the cost is also a major factor.

In a New York Times survey, 3,000 respondents reported that they drive battery-powered cars because they're much cheaper than cars that use gas. They also said they were utilizing the energy they generated from solar panels to charge their vehicles, lowering the expense even further.

""I don't have the disposable income to throw $50,000 or $60,000 at a car just to help the environment,"" Russell Grooms, a librarian from Virginia, told the Times. ""It really came down to numbers.""

New low-cost electric models, like the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt, retail for under $30,000, appealing to budget shoppers.

Still a way to go

But while electric cars are more mainstream than ever, they still have a few laps to go before they pass gasoline-powered cars.

For one, there are not enough of them on the market. Production has been limited thanks to shortages in parts, including computer chips and minerals such as lithium.

Second, there are not enough inexpensive options. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average price for a new EV is declining, but the average cost for a new one is still more than $64,000. That's well above the auto industry average of $47,148.

Then, there's the overall lack of charging stations across the country. In states like California, there are 34,185 ports available for charging, but in Wyoming, there are only 707, according to EVadoption.

This leads consumers to have what has been called ""range anxiety,"" or the fear that they could be stuck in the middle of nowhere with a dead battery.

""Range anxiety is real,"" Caroline Gambell, a Vermont resident, told the New York Times.

The big idea of shifting from fossil fuels to battery-power that has guided the transportation industry for the last decade is starting to become a reality – and that's triggering shakeups everywhere from electric vehicles to flying taxis.

On the roads, the car industry has moved on from the early days of EV integration to tackle bigger challenges like mass production of vehicles and the batteries that power them. In the sky, electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft startups are proliferating as they chase a market potentially worth $1 trillion.

""We can come up with a solution in a lab and it can look absolutely amazing,"" Rachad Youssef, chief product officer for General Motors' commercial electric vehicle subsidiary, BrightDrop, told Insider. ""But we're dealing with logistics that move trillions of dollars.""

All of this change from imagined idea to real life has brought up some common challenges across the transportation industry. Perhaps the most daunting is the economics of building a new supply chain for mass production of the lithium-ion batteries that are powering everything from electric cars to commercial vans and electric aircraft.

Building Batteries

More electric vehicles hitting the road in 2022 spurred a reckoning in the manufacturing world this year. With critical materials running low, leaders in the transportation industry were forced to focus efforts on finding new ways to source and manufacture these critical parts.

Battery recycling startup Redwood Industries provides one option: turning parts from old batteries into new ones. Redwood's senior director of business development Jackson Switzer is helping the company, founded in 2017 by longtime Tesla Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel, to get the materials it recycles back into production.

""Within the next year, materials that we recycled will be back on the road in an electric vehicle,"" Switzer said. ""Now it's just a matter of how fast can we go, and how fast can we scale.""

At Lyten, Chief Battery Technology Officer Celina Mikolajczak is helping the battery startup develop a lithium-ion battery that harnesses the benefits of sulfur. While this material hasn't been commercialized at scale yet, Mikolajczak — formerly of Tesla, Panasonic, and QuantumScape — thinks it can solve this challenge with 3D graphene, and in the process produce cells with boosted range, recharge time, and safety.

Amazon is aiming to electrify its last-mile fleet by 2040, which means swapping out tens of thousands of fossil fuel-powered trucks and vans for battery-powered ones over the next two decades. Amazon

More than passenger cars

It's likely that the first mass-produced and -purchased electric vehicles won't end up in regular people's driveways, but will instead land in the logistics space, especially as charging infrastructure starts to get built out.

At big retail companies like Walmart, executives are already looking for the advantages of changing their fleets over from internal combustion to electric vehicles. Amazon, for example, is aiming to electrify its last-mile fleet by 2040, which means swapping out tens of thousands of fossil fuel-powered trucks and vans for battery-powered ones over the next two decades.

Meanwhile, at Ford, the automaker has created a commercial customer business that will offer customers electric F-150s, Transits, and other electrified commercial vehicles for their businesses. Ford Pro CEO Ted Cannis told Insider commercial fleets are uniquely suited for transitioning to electric vehicles because their usage patterns are more predictable.

""You can fit the battery size to what the customer is doing because they know about how far they're going in the vehicle every day,"" Cannis said.","As the switch to electric vehicles shifts from dream to reality, the transportation industry is being shaken to its core",https://www.businessinsider.com/the-transportation-industry-is-being-shaken-to-its-core-2022-11

Nov 16 (Reuters) - Electric vehicles (EVs) and full-size pickup trucks were the two most problematic categories in terms of reliability, Consumer Reports magazine's annual reliability survey showed on Tuesday, as Asian brands once again dominated overall rankings.

Hybrid vehicles and mid-sized or large sedans were among the most reliable, according to the survey.

The magazine's annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.

Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) EVs, on which Consumer Reports received the most data from owners, continue to face issues with body hardware, steering/suspension, paint and trim, and climate system, but their electric powertrains have very few problems, according to the survey.

However, Tesla improved its ranking by four places to No.19 this year, with Mercedes-Benz slipping five slots to rank the least reliable among all brands, the survey showed.

EV owners from other manufacturers reported charging and battery problems, as well as electric drive motor issues. Of the 11 EV models on which Consumer Reports has sufficient data, only four have average or ""better predicted reliability"".

The top-ranked brands in the survey were Toyota and Lexus, and seven of the ten best-scoring brands were from Japan and South Korea.

Among brands owned by Detroit automakers, Ford Motor Co's (F.N) Lincoln was the only one in the top ten, securing 10th place.

All of General Motors Co's (GM.N) brands dropped in Consumer Reports' rankings, with Buick ranked highest at 11th. Among Stellantis' (STLA.MI) brands, Ram ranked highest at 16th.

Amid rising vehicle prices, 94% of prospective automobile buyers consider reliability to be ""extremely"" or ""very"" important, the survey showed.

DETROIT, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) Chief Executive Jim Farley said on Tuesday the automaker will need to build more components for electric vehicles in its own factories so ""everyone has a role"" in the future.

Electric vehicles will require 40% less labor to build than current combustion vehicles, Farley told a conference in Detroit sponsored by the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, a civil rights group.

Farley told reporters on the sidelines of the conference that Ford was ""going back..to our Model A,"" when the company built many of the components for vehicles itself at the Rouge manufacturing complex in Dearborn, Michigan.

Bringing production of electric vehicle motors, batteries and other components in-house was necessary to preserve jobs and to be competitive, Farley said.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), the No. 1 U.S. electric vehicle maker, builds much of the hardware for its electric vehicles, including batteries. Tesla's profit margins are now superior to Ford's and many other established automakers.

""We want to be No. 1,"" Farley told the Rainbow PUSH conference in Detroit.

Ford has begun building an electric vehicle manufacturing complex in Western Tennessee called Blue Oval City. Farley said he ""would be thrilled"" if workers hired there decide to join a union. But that decision is up to the workers.

Ford and Detroit rivals General Motors Co (GM.N) and Stellantis NV begin contract talks with the United Auto Workers next year. The changes driven by the shift to electrification will be central to those negotiations. The UAW's President, Ray Curry, has said he wants workers at new U.S. EV operations, including joint venture battery plants, to be organized without the process of secret ballot votes.

""Next year's negotiations will be hugely important for all stakeholders,"" Farley said.

Farley has brought in a number of executives from outside the auto industry to lead electrification and software development efforts. But he said Ford must do a better job of developing managers from within its ranks.

""We can't keep hiring from outside,"" he said.

PARIS, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Paris is considering banning its 15,000 rental electric scooters due to concerns about public safety on the city's sidewalks, but operators are proposing a series of improvements in the hope of getting their licences renewed.

The Paris town council is considering not renewing the licences of the three operators - Lime, Dott and Tier - which expire in February 2023. Its vote is only consultative and the decision, expected in coming weeks, rests with Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo.

Deputy mayor David Belliard, a green party politician in charge of transport in Paris, told Le Parisien newspaper last week that the nuisances caused by scooters now outweigh the advantages to the city.

""In terms of security, environment and the sharing of public space, it would be complicated to continue,"" he said.

In 2021, 24 people died in scooter-related accidents in France, including one in Paris. This year, Paris registered 337 accidents with e-scooters and similar vehicles in the first eight months of the year, from 247 over the same period in 2021.

Cities worldwide are tightening regulations on e-scooters, limiting the number of operators and limiting their speed and the number of areas where they can park.

Electric scooters accessed through smartphone apps have operated in Paris since 2018, but following complaints about their anarchic deployment, Paris in 2020 cut the number of operators to three. It gave them a three-year contract, required that scooters' speed be capped at 20 km/hour and imposed designated scooter parking areas.

Operators have offered further regulations, including ID checks to make sure users are over 18, fixing licence plates to scooters so police can identify traffic offenders, and preventing the carrying of more than one passenger.

""If Paris accepts our proposals, it would become the city with the strictest scooter regulation in the world,"" Lime public affairs director Garance Lefevre said.

The three firms say scooters provide a low-carbon alternative to crowded metros and polluting cars.

DETROIT, Nov 14 (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) plans to add more links to its North American battery supply chain, adding to roughly 20 deals so far, in a key strategy to help the Detroit automaker narrow the gap with Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) in electric vehicle profitability.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and other executives are scheduled to brief investors Thursday on the automaker's progress toward scaling up production capacity to deliver 1 million electric vehicles a year in North America by 2025.

Work is underway on new agreements to support higher levels of North American battery production, Sham Kunjur, GM's executive director for EV Raw Materials' Center of Excellence.

""Watch this space,"" Kunjur said. ""You'll start seeing more announcements.""

Securing more domestic capacity for cathode active materials is one priority, he said.

Kunjur said his organization is new within GM, and combines legal teams, merger and acquisition experts and treasury staff to work on joint ventures, equity investments and alliances to secure access to battery and magnet materials or production capacity.

Tesla took an early lead in developing in-house battery production in the United States with its first Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada.

Among established North American automakers, GM has moved the fastest to emulate Tesla's strategy of building a battery manufacturing network from lithium extraction to assembly of battery packs and cells. GM's Ultium LLC joint venture with LG Energy Solutions has announced plans for four North American battery plants.

New federal subsidy policies signed into law in August as part of the Inflation Reduction Act could turn that domestic battery supply chain into a federally funded boost for GM's bottom line.

The IRA's EV tax credits and subsidies are designed to support domestic EV manufacturing. They could move GM closer to making money on affordably priced electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox SUV, which will have a starting price of about $30,000, roughly half the price of a Tesla Model Y.

The Inflation Reduction Act ties up to $3,750 per vehicle of federal tax credits to requirements that EV batteries be manufactured in North America using materials sourced in North America or from allied nations.

How much GM will reap in federal subsidies will depend on how technical rules are written by federal agencies. Analysts expect Tesla will harvest more overall than any rival through 2030.

""We'll ramp toward full qualification across the broad portfolio in 2 to 3 years as some of the different supply comes online in North America or in the United States,"" Barra said during a conference call on Oct. 25.

GM has announced 14 deals related to North American battery production since May 2021.

GM officials told Reuters the company has about 20 battery supply chain agreements in place, with more to come.

Federal subsidies will help GM and its rivals narrow the cost disadvantage new North American battery production operations will face in competition with Chinese battery producers, said Prabhakar Patil, a former executive at battery maker LG Chem.

""People who have a head start will have an advantage,"" Patil said. ""The question is how fast you can catch up.""

Lately, workers have added another to the list – their electric bikes bursting into flames.

The powerful lithium ion batteries used in small electric vehicles are responsible for a growing epidemic of fires. This year, there have been about 200 fires and six deaths, according to the New York City fire department. This month, an e-bike fire inside a Manhattan high-rise apartment became an inferno that injured nearly 40 people and forced firefighters to evacuate residents using ropes.

These fires can spread quickly and suddenly: “We have a fully formed fire within a matter of seconds,” the chief fire marshal said at a news conference.

That’s become a daily concern for delivery workers such as Delores Solomon, a 64-year-old Brooklyn resident who has been working for Uber Eats for about two years to supplement her social security benefits. Solomon said she “lives in fear” that her vehicle might catch fire while it’s charging or even while she’s riding it. Last year, while delivering food on her mobility scooter, Solomon hit a pothole, causing the battery to fly out and hit the pavement, where it burst into flames. “It was like a big popping sound,” she told the Guardian. “It scared me – like, ‘Damn, if that would’ve happened on the bike, I would’ve been blown up.’”

As the densest city in America, New York is a micro-mobility haven. Here, small electric vehicles aren’t toys for weekend jaunts but vital tools for the estimated 65,000 delivery workers trying to scrape a living through low-paying apps.

There are thousands of choices today if you want an e-bike, e-scooter or e-moped. Some of the high-end, name-brand machines are sold in beautiful downtown showrooms for well over $5,000. But many of the vehicles used by New York City’s workers come from unknown manufacturers and are sold online or through small shops for between $1,000 and $2,000.

Nearly all of these vehicles are powered by lithium ion battery packs, which contain tightly bundled cells that store energy as flammable chemicals. In some higher-end batteries, the cells are kept in sync by a piece of electronic circuitry called a battery management system, or BMS, which makes sure that the cells don’t overcharge or release too much energy at once. But – especially in cheaper batteries – that careful balance can get disrupted due to damage, wear or faulty manufacturing, sometimes with dangerous results.

In August, a lithium ion battery fire that erupted after 2am killed a child and her mother in their Harlem apartment. A big reason the fires keep happening is that workers have few options to charge their vehicles. Many charge their batteries in their own apartments and hope for the best. Others rent a spot from one of Manhattan’s e-bike stores, where shops charge dozens of batteries next to each other on makeshift racks. Some people strike up deals with their neighborhood bodegas.

Solomon, who lives on the third floor of a brownstone, is afraid to charge her battery indoors. So she uses two extension cords plugged into one another, dangling nearly 50ft to her bike parked in the building’s front yard – which she knows is still a risk. “Sometimes you might fall asleep and then it’s the next day, and thank God the battery didn’t explode or anything.”

Gustavo Ajche, the founder of Los Deliveristas Unidos, a prominent delivery worker labor group, told the Guardian he uses a parking space inside a private garage that the garage has set up as a charging station. Ajche splits the space with about 20 other workers and has to pay $150 a month for his share. “We try to do our best to keep our batteries in good shape because everybody is scared,” he said.

Lawmakers are worried too. The authority that manages New York’s public housing proposed an e-bike ban on its property this year but backed down after an outcry from low-income residents. On Monday, the city council held a hearing where legislators touted bills to combat the battery fires, including a proposal to outlaw the sale of secondhand electric vehicle batteries, and another to ban all batteries that haven’t been approved by a nationally recognized testing lab.

If passed, that measure would force riders to use batteries such as those certified by the Illinois-based Underwriters Laboratory (UL), which subjects e-bikes and their batteries to rigorous testing on issues ranging from their performance under extreme temperatures to how easily fire spreads between cells. Manufacturers have to pay a “nominal” cost to undergo testing, said Robert Slone, UL’s chief scientist, but “we see a lot of manufacturers showing interest in certifying the batteries”. UL sent a statement to the city council supporting the proposed measures, though it said a total ban on used batteries could be overkill: “When done correctly, batteries can be safely repurposed.”

Some of the most highly regarded e-bike batteries are the UL-certified batteries and motors made by Bosch, which a spokesperson said “are designed for daily use” and “will meet the daily demands of delivery workers”. But Bosch batteries are only found in higher-end bike brands that are out of reach for many delivery workers.

That’s why workers say what’s needed from the city isn’t just new restrictions but more assistance.

For more than a year, Los Deliveristas Unidos has been pushing for the creation of new bike-charging hubs in New York’s high-traffic areas. The workers scored a major victory in October, when Senator Chuck Schumer pledged $1m in federal infrastructure funding to launch the project in New York City, starting with the conversion of an unused downtown newsstand. The Deliveristas have also proposed creating compact solar-powered charging stations in parking spaces outside popular restaurants. But Ajche said the organization doesn’t expect to see the first hub up and running until next summer. “Working with the city’s not easy,” he said. “Everything takes a lot of time.”

Solomon, the delivery worker, has joined an informal group called Safer Charging, which advocates creating a “battery swap” network modeled after similar systems in countries such as Taiwan. That would allow workers to put their spent battery packs into shared outdoor charging cabinets and grab new ones, leaving the maintenance of the batteries to a professional team.

Something else that would make a big difference for workers is better intel. “Each fire happened, they say it’s an e-bike, but we don’t know which one it is,” Ajche said. “There’s a lot of missing information.” What would be more useful, he said, would be if the fire department committed resources to testing and sharing details about which batteries were safe to use, so that workers could make more informed decisions.

Ajche added that the city should pass laws requiring that gig companies pay delivery workers a “living wage”. According to Los Deliveristas, that would be $30 an hour, an amount that would help offset delivery workers’ substantial equipment and maintenance costs, especially if they’re required to upgrade their batteries down the line. “You already have to invest almost $4,000 to be a delivery worker,” he said. “And if they’re regulating the types of batteries, the price of everything is gonna get so high.”

Uber and Doordash did not respond to questions about whether they would increase payments to workers hoping to buy certified e-bike batteries. But an Uber spokesperson provided a statement that it sent to the city council in support of the new proposals. “Nobody one should have to choose between their safety and their livelihood,” the statement said.",E-bike batteries have caused 200 fires in New York: ‘Everyone’s scared’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/14/new-york-e-bike-batteries-fires-delivery-workers

Construction workers who helped build Tesla's sprawling gigafactory in Austin, Texas filed multiple complaints to the US Department of Labor on Tuesday, alleging multiple labor violations they said they faced on the job.

The construction workers accused their subcontractors — those who employed and paid the workers — of withholding wages from some workers, according to a complaint sent by an attorney at the Workers Defense Project, the nonprofit that's representing the construction workers.

The letter redacted the names of the subcontractors for confidentially purposes in light of a potential investigation.

Some workers claimed that they were not paid a time-and-a-half overtime rate for working more than 40 hours a week. They also alleged that they were not compensated the double pay bonus they said they were promised for the extra days they spent working over Thanksgiving weekend in 2021.

Victor, a construction worker who performed carpentry work at the plant and whose name was redacted in his complaint, filed a separate complaint on Tuesday claiming that an undisclosed subcontractor sent him fabricated OSHA certificates without providing any workplace safety trainings. The Department of Labor requires construction industry employers to comply with OSHA standards to prevent their employees from potential injury.

—Workers Defense Project (@workersdefense) November 15, 2022

Discussing the complaint, Victor told The Guardian that he and his team didn't have basic safety information, and feared for his safety every day.

Victor said he and his team experienced working conditions including working on a roof with no light to laboring on top of a turbine without face masks to deter the blowing smoke.

He said they were even expected to continue production on a floor filled loose wires and cords in the water after the factory flooded.

Following these incidents, he told The Guardian he remembered telling his wife that ""I'm going to die in this factory.""

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.

Tesla opened the gigafactory in Texas in April, the manufacturer's fourth factory in the US, to ramp up production of its electric vehicles, including its long-delayed Cybertruck.

Even so, this isn't the first time that Tesla has faced complaints about its working conditions.

An investigation published earlier this year by Insider's Grace Kay and Áine Cain revealed that Tesla faced 46 lawsuits over the last 5 years from current and former Tesla workers alleging they were targeted over their race and gender. In the vast majority of the lawsuits, the carmaker has fought back and pushed for private arbitration.

Last year, Tesla paid $137 million in damages to a Black former Tesla employee after reporting that he was faced with racially-charged slurs such as the N-word on a daily basis.

In 2020, Insider reported that Tesla failed to disclose dozens of factory injuries to regulators in its safety reports to the state.

And in 2018, Tesla factory employees reportedly expressed concerns over worker safety, injury recording, and medical care at a factory in Fremont, California, according to an investigation led by Reveal.

The construction workers are seeking to recover their lost wages, according to the complaints.",Construction workers who helped build Tesla's gigafactory in Austin file complaints claiming unpaid wages and fake workplace safety certifications,https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-austin-gigafactory-construction-workers-file-complaints-wages-safety-conditions-2022-11

Speaking at an event on Tuesday, Renault SA chairman Jean-Dominique Senard touted the Franco-Japanese alliance, which has been discussing ways to revamp the relationship.

The companies had initially set Tuesday as a deadline to hammer out a deal. However, the discussions have taken longer than originally expected due to Nissan's concerns about how its intellectual property rights can be protected as Renault forges new ties with China's Geely, sources have told Reuters.

Renault last week unveiled a sweeping overhaul of its businesses, saying it would set up a joint venture with Geely for gasoline engines and hybrid technology and spin off its electric vehicles unit next year. It wants Nissan to invest in the new electric unit.

The companies are also renegotiating their equity ties, which currently see Renault owning a controlling 43% of Nissan and the Japanese company holding only a 15% non-voting stake in Renault.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and other executives are scheduled to brief investors Thursday on the automaker's progress toward scaling up production capacity to deliver 1 million electric vehicles a year in North America by 2025.

Work is underway on new agreements to support higher levels of North American battery production, Sham Kunjur, GM's executive director for EV Raw Materials' Center of Excellence.

""Watch this space,"" Kunjur said. ""You'll start seeing more announcements.""

Securing more domestic capacity for cathode active materials is one priority, he said.

Kunjur said his organization is new within GM, and combines legal teams, merger and acquisition experts and treasury staff to work on joint ventures, equity investments and alliances to secure access to battery and magnet materials or production capacity.

Tesla took an early lead in developing in-house battery production in the United States with its first Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada.

Among established North American automakers, GM has moved the fastest to emulate Tesla's strategy of building a battery manufacturing network from lithium extraction to assembly of battery packs and cells. GM's Ultium LLC joint venture with LG Energy Solutions has announced plans for four North American battery plants.

New federal subsidy policies signed into law in August as part of the Inflation Reduction Act could turn that domestic battery supply chain into a federally funded boost for GM's bottom line.

The IRA's EV tax credits and subsidies are designed to support domestic EV manufacturing.

A global energy crisis, rising inequality, and natural disasters intensified by climate change are shaping the sustainability agenda among C-suite executives and government officials alike.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine helped send oil and gas prices skyrocketing and triggered a global food supply shortage. This has led to windfall profits for major oil companies and exacerbated inflation, which disproportionately hits poorer households.

The crisis forced a debate, particularly in Europe, over how to become more energy secure at a time when countries have pledged to build out clean power, combat the climate crisis, and support the most vulnerable. Some governments are expanding fossil fuels, but investment in renewables has reached record levels as solar and wind are now the cheapest sources of new energy, according to the International Energy Agency. A new climate law in the US is expected to help further drive down the cost of renewable energy sources.

Yet the move away from oil and gas won't be easy or, most likely, fast enough. That's led activists to target the fossil fuel industry and the institutions that bankroll it. Nonetheless, the shift is creating opportunities for newer companies like BlocPower, Shopify, and Actual HQ that are seeking to solve some of the most complex sustainability problems.

Climate justice paves the way for new leaders

The unequal fallout from the climate crisis has been on stark display this year after deadly floods leveled a third of Pakistan. The country, compared with more industrialized nations, is responsible for only a small fraction of the world's greenhouse emissions. And millions of people in the Horn of Africa, who likewise share little responsibility for the global carbon debt, remain on the brink of famine. For others in developed countries, soaring electricity bills are eating into their income.These realities have led to the rise of business leaders, investors, and activists working at the intersection of climate, public health, and racial inequality.

The advocacy of Nalleli Cobo, a 21-year-old community organizer in South Los Angeles, shut a drilling site that exposed mostly Black and Latino residents to pollution and made them sick. Cobo's work has paved the way for new restrictions on drilling at every level of government in California.

Donnel Baird founded BlocPower to finance greening existing buildings for low-income residents. The idea was based on his own childhood in New York City, where outdated or broken heating and cooling systems powered by fossil fuels wasted energy and leaked emissions.

""What makes sense to me is pursuing solutions to the climate crisis that also create jobs for low-income people and improve health by reducing pollution,"" Baird, whose company has raised more than $100 million from investors like Goldman Sachs and Microsoft, told Insider.

A push for new solutions

Now that sustainability goals are widespread among major companies, executives are searching for new technologies to deliver on those promises. The push is spurring innovation in the auto sector, data analytics to make sense of all the environmental and social data companies want to track, carbon removal, and procuring renewable energy for supply chains.

Even legacy automakers like Ford — with its new F-150 pickup — are making it cool to own electric vehicles that were once associated with the liberal environmentalists. Actual HQ created a SimCity-live platform that helps organizations evaluate the cost and impact of various sustainability strategies, such as reducing emissions on farms or getting internet access to those who lack it.

Derek Lyons, Actual's co-founder and chief technology officer, told Insider that businesses are struggling to know where to start and how to make decisions.

""This is about helping imperfect humans with imperfect data navigate through this really complicated set of gates to go from a net-zero goal to actually making progress,"" he told Insider.

The net-zero race is also fueling demand for carbon offsets, which allow polluters to compensate for their own emissions by paying to avoid or reduce them elsewhere. The global commerce platform Shopify is trying to fan the nascent carbon-removal sector by investing $32 million to date. Companies are likely to continue relying on offsets and climate scientists say carbon removal will be necessary if the world is to stay below catastrophic levels of temperature increases.

Even though countries and companies are making some headway on sustainability goals, the pace isn't nearly fast enough. MSCI, the global ratings agency, reported this month that publicly listed companies have about four years to drastically curb emissions before it's too late to achieve the Paris Agreement goals.",The climate crisis ushered in a new generation of leaders and innovation.

It's taken a little longer than anticipated, but the Malibu-based e-mobility company has announced that deliveries have now started for customers across the US.

There have been a few notable changes to the Metacycle package since it first launched back in January 2021, including a pricing adjustment. Though folks who reserved the eye-catching e-moto early on benefit from the original US$5,000 price tag, that window closed at the beginning of this year and it'll now cost you $6,500 with delivery pegged for the first half of 2023.

But for those lucky early adopters locked into the cheaper tier, shipping began in California recently and has now been extended to the rest of the US to the tune of between 50 and 100 deliveries per day. Sondors expects that the majority of customers who paid in full should get their bikes by the close of 2022.

The Metacycle's rear wheel is home to am 8-kW (11-hp) PMAC (Permanent Magnet, Alternating Current) hub motor that peaks at 14.5 kW (20 hp) for 80 lb.ft (108.5 Nm) of nominal torque or up to 120 lb.ft 176 Nm) of peak torque.

The Metacycle's rear-hub motor offers a top speed of 60 mph in Drive mode, or 80 mph in Sport mode Sondors

The top speed has been slightly revised to 60 mph (100 km/h) in Drive mode or up to 80 mph (130 km/h) for quick bursts in Sport mode. The sprint to 60 mph has changed to 9.6 seconds, and the per-charge range figures for the 4-kWh Li-ion battery have also been tweaked to 60 miles (100 km) of real-world riding or as much as 80 miles (130 km) ""in ideal conditions."" Where Sondors offered a ""quick release"" method for battery removal last year, now it's reckoned to take up to two minutes using the supplied tool kit.

Elsewhere, riders are treated to the same cast aluminum frame that's now available in original naked silver, Arctic (white) and Supermassive (black) color options, it rolls on grippy CST CM-NK 01 tires and can tackle inclines up to 15%, features hand-operated hydraulic brakes, and benefits from wireless key fob operation and a built-in alarm. Seat height is reported to be 31.5 in (80 cm), and curb weight comes in at around 300 lb (136 kg).

Described by its makers as being ""the perfect commuter, errand runner, and a super fun way to cruise through the weekend,"" the Metacycle is available to order now for $6,500. Current delivery windows for US buyers are Q1/Q2 2023. There's no shipping update as yet for European customers.

The EV market is growing fast and 2022 has more EVs for sale than ever. Technology developments over the past two decades have finally made way for electric cars to be made by multiple manufacturers offering consumers a broad variety of vehicles to choose from. The market once dominated by the pricey Tesla is now filled with a range of options from economy to luxury, and the models on offer represent healthy competition among manufacturers, a good thing for consumers.

For 2022, buyers can pick whatever fancies them from an oversized truck to a sensible yet attractive mid-size wagon. The technology in the drivetrains is highly advanced, but the interiors are also full of digital comforts, conveniences, and safety controls throughout.

You're part of a growing network of systems so poorly secured they could one day be used to destabilize entire electrical grids, and which contain enough security issues to be problematic today.

That's what scientists at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico have concluded after four years of looking at demonstrated exploits and publicly-disclosed vulnerabilities in electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), as well as doing their own tests on 10 types of EV chargers with colleagues from Idaho National Lab.

""Can the grid be affected by electric vehicle charging equipment? Absolutely,"" said Sandia's Brian Wright, a cybersecurity expert who worked on the project. ""It is within the realm of what bad guys could and would do in the next 10 to 15 years. That's why we need to get ahead of the curve in solving these issues,"" Wright said.

Hey, I recognize that vulnerability!

In the meantime, however, there are plenty of attacks that criminals could be using right now, and researchers already are. Sadly it's a grab-bag of the same old problems we've been seeing for years in other tech sectors.

""There have been multiple demonstrations of stealing credentials or influencing charging sessions via the EV-to-EVSE connection,"" the researchers said in their paper. In one case, researchers managed to sniff out and interrupt charging using a software defined radio with less than 1W of power from 47 meters away ""on all seven vehicles and 18 EVSEs that they investigated.""

RFID cloning is currently possible in early generation EVSE infrastructure, which can lead to thieves getting charged up using someone else's debit or credit card. Some iOS and Android apps used to manage charging sessions ""could also easily be reverse-engineered to reveal weaknesses in the EVSE management and vendor cloud interfaces,"" the researchers said.

EVSE internet interfaces have problems that are easy to guess: They often use insecure web services that can be accessed from a local smartphone or computer, while chargers from several manufacturers can be found on the public internet. Vulnerabilities in web services used by chargers could allow an attacker to change configuration data or push malicious firmware updates, the report found.

Communications between chargers and cloud services also contained a host of problems, like lacking appropriate authentication methods, not sanitizing input fields and even being open to supply chain attacks due to manufacturers' maintaining remote backdoor access.

As for hardware vulnerabilities, they included a host of outdated Linux kernels running superfluous services accessible via exposed USB ports that would let an attacker upload malicious firmware. Some chargers were even found to be operating off of Raspberry Pis without secure bootloaders.

Oh, and since we're going for the full run of security fails, of course the team found numerous hard-coded credentials, passwords hashed without a salt, and other cryptographic no-nos.

This is not great

What have we learned? That the EV charging industry seems to have treated cybersecurity the same way as the companies behind the Internet of Things: As an afterthought.

Jay Johnson, the Sandia electrical engineer behind the project, said that he hopes his team's findings will serve as a baseline in understanding the current state of the industry, which is vital to getting it fixed.

""By conducting this survey of electric vehicle charger vulnerabilities, we can prioritize recommendations to policymakers and notify them of what security improvements are needed by the industry,"" he explained.

""The government can say 'produce secure electric vehicle chargers,' but budget-oriented companies don't always choose the most cybersecure implementations. Instead, the government can directly support the industry by providing fixes, advisories, standards and best practices,"" Wright added.

No surprise here, but Sandia is recommending some basic cyber hygiene, like removing unneeded services, keeping software up to date, locking physical ports, and using proper encryption.

The team also suggested implementing better methods of EV owner authentication, like plug-and-charge public key infrastructure, as well as network intrusion detection systems, code-signed firmware updates and other habits it covers in its charging industry best-practices [PDF] suggstions.

Johnson's team isn't done yet, and has received follow-on funding to address some of the gaps it found alongside Idaho and Pacific Northwest National laboratories. Together, the three are working to develop a system for EV chargers that uses new methods to protect public infrastructure from ne'er-do-wells.

But until the government steps in with some regulations, Johnson said things won't improve.

Many EVSE manufacturers, Johnson told The Register, ""are desperately trying to keep up with demand."" While regulations have been discussed, Johnson said it's unlikely they'll appear for at least a year. Note that this applies in the US; the UK has already proposed regulations on EV chargers that will take effect next year.

While some vendors have improved their security, Johnson said those companies have found themselves at a market disadvantage against those in favor of rushing products to market. ""Until there's regulation to level that playing field, market trends favor insecure systems,"" Johnson said. ®",Shocker: EV charging infrastructure is seriously insecure,https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/15/ev_charging_infrastructure_sandia/
420,"After announcing plans to invest $1.7 billion in its US operations to build at least six electric vehicles by 2030, BMW is inaugurating its latest facility in South Carolina. The new Vehicle Accessories Center in...",electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/New_VAC_lead.jpg,bmwblog,"After announcing plans to invest $1.7 billion in its US operations to build at least six electric vehicles by 2030, BMW is inaugurating its latest facility in South Carolina. The new Vehicle Accessories Center in Greer is now up and running, catering to all 350 dealers nationwide. Almost $25 million have been spent to open the 60,000-square-foot (5,574-square-meter) facility, which has led to the creation of approximately 60 jobs.

As its name implies, the Vehicle Accessories Center will provide OEM accessories varying from body parts and wheels to M Performance Parts and decals. It’ll also supply a host of interior trim pieces and floormats, along with roof accessories and other miscellaneous items. Needless to say, the facility is primarily intended for models built at the nearby Plant Spartanburg where BMW assembles the X3 through X7, with the XM to join the assembly line before the end of the year.

Vehicles ordered with optional accessories will be shipped to dealers with all the extras installed. That means dealer employees won’t have to install the parts anymore. It should translate to quicker delivery times after optimizing the process as BMW will also handle modifying the cars with the upgrades. At the factory in South Carolina, the automaker assembles about 60% of the vehicles it sells in the US.

Since 1992, BMW USA has spent a total of $12 billion in local manufacturing. It produces more than 1,500 vehicles on a daily basis and currently employs approximately 11,000 people. At the end of September, it celebrated an important milestone by assembling the six millionth vehicle in SC, an X6 M finished in Java Green Metallic. 60% of all SUVs built in South Carolina are exported to 120 markets from all over the world. The factory has a maximum annual capacity of 450,000 units.

Later in 2023, the XM Label Red will enter production as BMW’s most powerful production vehicle ever, courtesy of a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 and an electric motor making a combined 738 hp and 737 lb-ft (1,000 Nm).

421,Which EV maker is a better turnaround play?,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/709009/2022-rivian-r1t-14.jpg,motley fool,"Rivian Automotive (RIVN 2.66%) and Lucid Group (LCID 1.19%) attracted a stampede of bulls in 2021 amid the buying frenzy in electric vehicle (EV) stocks. However, shares of both companies fizzled out over the past year as rising interest rates and other macro headwinds drove investors away from speculative growth stocks.

As a result, Rivian and Lucid both now trade about 80% below their all-time highs. Should you buy either of these out-of-favor EV stocks?

The differences between Rivian and Lucid

Rivian produces three vehicles: the R1T pickup truck, the R1S SUV, and an EDV (electric delivery van) for Amazon (AMZN 1.00%). Its R1 vehicles start at less than $70,000 and can travel over 300 miles on a single charge, while its EDVs have a range of about 150 miles.

Rivian has churned out 15,000 vehicles since it kicked off production last September. It originally planned to produce 50,000 vehicles this year, but it halved that target to 25,000 back in March as it struggled with supply chain constraints. It reaffirmed that full-year target in its third-quarter report. There's still plenty of pent-up demand for its vehicles. In addition to Amazon's initial order of 100,000 EDVs, Rivian has received 114,000 pre-orders for its R1-series pickups and SUVs so far.

Lucid's luxury sedan is called the Lucid Air, which comes in Pure, Touring, Grand Touring, and Dream editions. The Pure edition, which starts at about $90,000, has a range of just over 400 miles. The top-tier Dream edition, which starts at about $150,000, can reach 520 miles on a single charge.

Lucid has delivered 2,562 vehicles since it started production last September. It initially planned to ship 20,000 vehicles in 2022, but it reduced that target to 12,000-14,000 vehicles this February. It then halved that estimate to 6,000-7,000 vehicles in August as it struggled with supply chain issues. During its recent third-quarter earnings report, Lucid reaffirmed that full-year guidance and noted that it was still on track to fulfill more than 34,000 reservations.

Which company is growing faster?

Rivian's near-term goal is to ramp up its production of its R1 vehicles and EDVs. It currently has an annual production capacity of 150,000 vehicles at its main plant in Illinois, and it expects its capacity to reach 200,000 vehicles after it completes an expansion of the plant next year. By 2024, Rivian intends to open a second plant in Georgia, which could boost its annual production capacity to about 600,000 vehicles.

Rivian intends to ramp up the production of its second-generation ""R2"" vehicles in 2025. It hasn't revealed a clearer road map regarding those plans yet, but they might expand its reach beyond pickups, SUVs, and vans.

Lucid's AMP-1 manufacturing plant in Arizona can produce up to 34,000 vehicles annually. It expects AMP-1's phase 2 expansion, which started last July, to increase its annual capacity to 90,000 vehicles by 2023. It also recently signed a deal with Saudi Arabian investors to open a new plant in the country, which will expand its annual capacity by 155,000 vehicles.

Lucid plans to launch its next vehicle, the Project Gravity SUV, in 2024. But more importantly, it believes the Saudi Arabian deal puts it on track to deliver 500,000 vehicles by 2025 -- a full five years ahead of its original target.

Which company is more financially stable?

Rivian and Lucid will both likely remain unprofitable for the foreseeable future as they aggressively scale up their operations. Here's what Wall Street expects to happen to both companies over the next two years.

Metric (Estimated) 2022 2023 2024 Rivian revenue $1.75 billion $5.77 billion $11.56 billion Rivian net income ($7.02 billion) ($6.21 billion) ($4.49 billion) Lucid revenue $723 million $2.56 billion $4.79 billion Lucid net income ($1.90 billion) ($2.27 billion) ($1.69 billion)

We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but those losses imply that the automaker with the stronger balance sheet is the safer investment. Rivian ended the third quarter of 2022 with $13.3 billion in cash and equivalents, and it was shouldering $3.7 billion in total liabilities, which gives it a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.2. That manageable leverage should give Rivian more room to raise fresh cash with new loans or secondary offerings.

Lucid ended the third quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents, as well as $2.1 billion in short-term investments. But it had $3.7 billion in total liabilities, which gives it a much higher debt-to-equity ratio of 1.1.

The winner: Rivian

Rivian's enterprise value of $20.4 billion values the company at less than 2 times its potential sales in 2024. Lucid, which has an enterprise value of $21.6 billion, is still valued at 4.5 times its projected sales for 2024.

In addition to its lower valuation, Rivian is already producing more vehicles than Lucid, has a healthier balance sheet, and focuses on the more practical markets for mid-range pickups and delivery vans. It's also still backed by Amazon and Ford. Rivian is still a speculative EV stock, but I believe it's a much more promising investment than Lucid.",Better EV Stock: Rivian Automotive vs. Lucid Group,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/better-ev-stock-rivian-automotive-vs-lucid-group/

The results for electric vehicles was much worse.

Interestingly, the issues with EVs do not generally involve the drivetrains themselves; rather, the electronic aids on board.

The top two spots in the CR Brand Reliability Rankings haven’t changed from last year—in fact, they have widened their lead.

National market share for electric cars climbed to 4.9 percent from January to September this year, up from 2.4 percent in the same 2021 period, Edmunds said. And 36 percent of respondents told a Consumer Reports (CR) survey earlier this year that they will buy or lease a battery-only car, or at least seriously consider one.

So the EV momentum is continuing, but are the people buying them having a good experience? A new CR survey November 15 identifies hybrid cars as the top-rated reliability category, and says that EVs (one from the bottom in the vehicle-type ratings) have had some “growing pains”—though not from the drivetrains themselves. The cutting-edge electronic aids on board are a big part of the problem. Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at CR, told Autoweek, “EVs in general are not very reliable. Right now, there are two EV markets—Tesla and everyone else.”

The survey says that Tesla, by far the EV market leader, “continues to have issues with body hardware, steering/suspension, paint and trim, and climate systems on its models, but the electric powertrains have very few problems.” Tesla went up four places in the brand rankings, but the Model 3 has only average reliability, and the S, Y and X are below average. Beyond Tesla, of 11 EVs tested, only four had average or better predicted reliability. A standout was the Kia EV6, with “outstanding” reliability.

Fisher noted that by now Tesla has a lot of experience putting electric motors and batteries into cars, which helped that aspect of reliability. “EVs are selling to early adopters, who want all the new technology on the cars,” he said. “Hybrids are being bought by the more practical people, and they’re proving to be a sweet spot in the market. For instance, the Ford Maverick hybrid was more reliable than the non-hybrid version. That’s in part because its drivetrain was worked out in the Ford Escape hybrid. But the Ford F-150 hybrid has had more problems.”

Kia’s EV6 was rated with “outstanding” reliability. Kia

Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for e-mobility at Guidehouse Insights, said that in his opinion battery cars and plug-in hybrids have had a variety of issues, with no clear pattern. “The Chevy Bolt and Chrysler Pacifica have both had issues with battery fires that led to extended recalls,” he said. “The Toyota RAV4 plug-in hybrid, on the other hand, has something totally unrelated with fuel-fill issues.”

But the CR survey results are in line with recent findings from Which? in the UK. Which? surveyed nearly 50,000 drivers and found that 31 percent had at least one issue (worse than gas cars, with 20 percent having at least one issue). And, again, hybrid cars shone brightly, with only 17 percent showing such problems. Plug-in hybrids were at 28 percent.

“Electronics and software has long been a challenge for the auto industry.”

—Sam Abuelsamid

According to Abuelsamid, “Electronics and software has long been a challenge for the auto industry, going back to voice-recognition systems and slow touchscreens. It’s not surprising that it continues to be an issue and it will likely get worse before it gets better as the industry shifts to the so-called software-defined vehicle. These vehicles will have new electrical/electronic architectures with entirely new software stacks that combine many previously discrete functions into fewer compute platforms with higher performance. Integrating all of these systems will be a big challenge.”



Abuelsamid says automakers compound the problem when they ship software that “may not be fully ready for prime time.” Moving to over-the-air software updates “will probably both hurt and help,” he said. “Because they have the ability to ship updates, automakers may be more inclined to ship vehicles with software that may not be fully baked, but hopefully problems will be fixed sooner.”

Toyota and Lexus ranked number one and two, respectively. Toyota

The big winner in CR’s Brand Reliability Rankings was Toyota and Lexus, ranked number one and two respectively, with a growing lead. Fisher said that Toyota has benefited from being cautious, including being late to introduce Apple CarPlay and an EV. “The conservative approach pays off,” he said. In the 10 top spots, seven are Asian. Mazda was in fourth place, Honda fifth, Subaru seventh, Acura eight and Kia ninth.

Lincoln was the only domestic brand to make the top 10 (it was 10th). Dragging down that rating was the Aviator’s multiple problems with its in-car electronics display. GM was out of the running, with all brands dropping. Ford was in 18th place. Jeep was way down, 23rd overall. Only the Cherokee managed to have average reliability. Stellantis’ highest-ranking brand was Ram, in 16th place.

The big loser in CR’s results was Mercedes-Benz, in last place for reliability at 24th overall. Again, a key problem was in-car electronics, with lots of reports of screens freezing or going dark, some requiring hardware replacement. But fellow German automaker BMW seems to have less trouble with these things, and was up 10 to third place. Audi, up five places, was not far behind in sixth. Other European results were Volvo (14) and Volkswagen (22).",Electric Vehicles Experience Reliability “Growing Pains”,https://www.autoweek.com/news/a41968318/electric-vehicles-reliability-survey-results/

Hybrids generally are tried-and-true designs with few frills, while automakers are cramming glitchy electronic features into expensive new pickups and EVs, the nonprofit group says.

Hybrid technology has been around for more than two decades, and even though the vehicles switch between electric and gasoline power, they don't have a lot of the technology or complex multi-speed transmissions that have caused problems with other vehicles, said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing.

“Hybrids are very conventionally built vehicles,” Fisher said. “They're catering to practical buyers who are looking for reliable, efficient, safe vehicles, not the latest technology.”

With high gas prices and skyrocketing new vehicle costs, people are keeping their vehicles longer, so reliability and fuel economy are becoming more important to buyers, the group's annual survey found. “A hybrid can provide years of trouble-free miles, and they are a good defense against rising fuel prices,” Fisher said.

Reliabilty was extremely or very important to 94% of prospective auto buyers, the survey found, and 80% said the same about fuel economy, Consumer Reports said.

Plug-in hybrids, which can go a relatively short distance on battery power before switching to both gas and electricity, don't have the same level of reliability as hybrids, Fisher said.

It helps that most hybrids are sold by Toyota and its Lexus luxury brand, the top two brands in Consumer Reports' rankings, released Tuesday at a meeting of the Automotive Press Association in Detroit.

Germany's BMW leaped 10 places to take the No. 3 spot, while Mazda and Honda rounded out the top five.

Mercedes-Benz was the least reliable of 24 brands in the survey, followed by Jeep, Volkswagen, GMC and Chevrolet.

Story continues

Tesla, which makes the top selling electric vehicles sold in the U.S., rose four spots to rank No. 19, although it still has quality problems, Fisher said.

Owners reported few problems with Tesla's batteries and motors, but the company did have trouble with paint, fit-and-finish, heating and cooling, and suspension systems, Fisher said. Tesla's Model 3 had average reliability, but the S, Y and X were all below average.

Ford's Lincoln luxury brand had the most improvement in reliability, rising 14 spots to rank 10th and become the only U.S.-based brand in the top 10. The brand's SUVs are older models that have been on sale for more years, allowing Ford to work out the bugs, Fisher said.

Full-size pickup trucks, Fisher said, have become luxury vehicles with large touch screens and multi-speed transmissions. They're popular, so the market is competitive, with buyers seeking the latest in infotainment and other technology, he said. The survey found problems with Ford's F-150 trailer controller and power liftgates, while Chevrolet's Silverado had some engine issues, Fisher said.

Only seven of the 17 pickup models in this year's survey had average or better reliability.

In theory, electric vehicles should be more reliable than internal combustion vehicles, Fisher said. But in addition to Tesla's problems, EVs from other automakers had charging and battery trouble and electric drive motor issues. Of 11 EVs for which Consumer Reports had adequate survey data, only four had average or better reliability.

Consumer Reports based its rankings on a survey of owners representing more than 300,000 vehicles from the 2000 through 2022 model years, with a few new 2023 models included.

429,An incorrectly-assembled sealing ring could lead to all sorts of problems for 392 2023 VW ID.4s.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2023-VW-ID.4-1.jpg,carscoops,"Volkswagen has initiated a recall campaign for the all-electric ID.4 as a result of an incorrectly assembled coolant sealing ring at the electric motor. Although the recall only affects a very small number of vehicles, it can have surprisingly wide-ranging impacts on them.

Just 392 vehicles are included in this recall campaign, with VW estimating that around five percent of those vehicles will actually experience any issues. All were built between September 2 and October 3, 2022. Production of the all-electric crossover started at the automaker’s Chattanooga, Tennessee plant in July of this year.

The automaker only became aware of this potential problem on September 23, 2022, as a result of an internal quality check at the factory. After an investigation, the automaker figured out that the problem stems from an incorrectly assembled sealing ring.

Due to that production error, it may be possible for coolant to enter the high-voltage system. That could result in ground bouncing in the low-voltage system, which could interfere with the CAN communication and voltage supply to safety-critical control modules.

If that happens, the performance of the systems could be diminished, which may affect vehicle performance, and this could, in turn, lead to a crash. It’s possible that the problem may even result in the unintended deployment of the airbags, which increases the risk of injury.

Volkswagen will reach out to the owners of affected vehicles starting on January 6, and will ask them to come into the dealership for inspection. It will replace the motors in vehicles that have a bad seal and potential leak.

Since discovering this issue, Volkswagen has improved the assembly procedure for coolant seals on the ID.4, meaning that this issue is less likely to occur. That is the sealant process that will be used on vehicles whose motors are being replaced.",A Leaky Motor On Certain 2023 VW ID.4s Could Result In The Airbags Going Off,https://www.carscoops.com/2022/11/a-leaky-motor-on-certain-2023-vw-id-4s-could-result-in-the-airbags-going-off/
430,Study by National Grid suggests infrastructure won’t be ready to meet demand from new generation of electric semis unless action is taken now.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2023-Tesla-Semi-main.jpg,carscoops,"Electric power has already transformed the passenger car market, and big trucks are next. Tesla will officially unveil its Semi EV on December 1 and hopes to pump out up to 50,000 electric trucks per year as early as 2024. And it’s far from the only company electrifying commercial vehicles.

Come 2030 or 2035, buying an electric truck won’t be a problem, but charging it might be, according to a report by National Grid. The study says that the electric truck market could find itself limited by an inadequate charging infrastructure in the next decade if major investment doesn’t happen now. Why? Because it estimates that a truck stop in 2035 might need as much electricity as a small town.

It’s not the amount of electricity that we’re going to need that’s the problem, but how quickly we’re going to want to deploy it in one place, like a truck stop full of vehicles that are effectively gargantuan 18-wheeled batteries.

Bloomberg’s smart analogy likens electricity to water flowing through a hose, pointing out that you could use that hose to fill a swimming pool if you had a few months to spare, but filling that pool in a a few hours is a different story. To do that you’re going to need the electric cable equivalent of a riot-police water canon.

So let’s get building, you’re thinking. The problem is we should have been building years ago. A connection to the grid capable of dealing with more than 5 megawatts of power might take eight years to plan and build, and cost tens of millions of dollars. And recent incentives from the U.S. government designed to promote a switch to electric power has fast tracked a move to commercial EVs that might take place before the charging network has been upgraded to accommodate them. That’s despite President Biden’s 2021 infrastructure package earmarking $7.5 billion to pay for a national charging network and upgrades to the grid.

“We need to start making these investments now,” Bart Franey, vice president of clean energy development at National Grid, told Bloomberg in an interview. “We can’t just wait for it to happen, because the market is going to outpace the infrastructure.”

Some fleet operators are already experiencing problems, Rakesh Aneja, head of electric trucks at Daimler North America, admitted. The company currently offers electric trucks in the U.S. but some customers were dismayed to discover that it would take a year longer to connect their chargers than it would to receive their Freightliner eCascadia trucks.

“The number one concern for fleets wanting to electrify all of their vehicles is the infrastructure required,” Brian Wilkie, director of transport electrification at National Grid, told Bloomberg. “They know they can’t sell trucks without the power to charge. If they can solve that piece, they can scale the market much more quickly.”","Electric Truck Stops In 2035 Will Need As Much Juice As A Small Town, Report Claims",https://www.carscoops.com/2022/11/electric-truck-stops-in-2035-will-need-as-much-juice-as-a-small-town-report-claims/

WILMINGTON, Del. — The head of Tesla's board of directors testified Tuesday in a shareholder lawsuit challenging a 2018 compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk potentially worth more than $55 billion that she was less concerned about how much time Musk would commit to the company than in the results he could bring.

“We didn’t talk about time,” Robyn Denholm said when asked about her discussions with Musk about the compensation plan, which didn’t include any requirement on how much time he would devote to the company, as opposed to his other business ventures.

“He was focused on achieving results, not on any quantum of time he would need to spend,” Denholm said. She added that she doesn’t know how many hours Musk — who last month took over Twitter after paying $44 billion for the social media platform — devotes to Tesla.

“I’m not concerned about time,” added Denholm, who was a member of the compensation committee at the electric car and solar panel maker that developed the plan. “I know periods of time where he is sleeping on the factory floor.”

The lawsuit alleges that the performance-based stock option grant was negotiated by the compensation committee and approved by Tesla board members who had conflicts interest due to personal and professional ties to Musk, including investments in his companies. It also alleges the shareholder vote approving the compensation plan was based on a misleading proxy statement.

The lawsuit alleges that the proxy wrongly described members of the compensation committee as “independent,” and characterized all of the milestones that triggered vesting in the stock options as “stretch” goals meant to be difficult to achieve, even though internal projections indicated that three operational milestones were likely to be achieved within 18 months of the stockholder vote.

Attorneys for the defendants have noted that two institutional proxy advising firms that urged shareholders to reject the plan nevertheless noted that it would require “significant and perhaps historic achievements” and require growth that “appear stretching by any benchmark.”

“I thought they, at the time, were quite audacious,” Denholm said of the milestones.

The plan called for Musk to reap billions if Tesla hit certain market capitalization and operational milestones. For each incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap milestone and an operational milestone, Musk, who owned about 22% of Tesla when the plan was approved, would get stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant. His interest in the company would grow to about 28% if the company’s market capitalization grew by $600 billion.

Each milestone in the plan includes growing Tesla’s market capitalization by $50 billion and meeting aggressive revenue and pretax profit growth targets. Musk would receive the full benefit of the pay plan, $55.8 billion, only if Tesla hit a market capitalization of $650 billion and unprecedented revenue and earnings within a decade.

To date, Tesla has achieved all 12 of the market capitalization milestones and 11 operational milestones, resulting in the vesting of 11 of the grant’s 12 tranches and providing Musk over $52.4 billion in stock option gains, according to the lawsuit. Since the grant was awarded, Tesla’s market capitalization has increased from $59 billion to more than $613 billion now, having briefly hit $1 trillion early this year. Musk has sold Tesla stock to finance the Twitter purchase, adding downward pressure on the shares.

Shares of Tesla and other automakers have been battered this year, but the Austin, Texas, company earned $5.5 billion in 2021, blowing away the previous year’s profit of $721 million. It also produced a record 936,000 vehicles, nearly double vehicle production in 2020.

Attorneys for the plaintiff have suggested that incentivizing Musk to remain at Tesla’s helm by offering a huge compensation package was unnecessary, because he’s never suggested that he might leave. They’ve also suggested that Musk’s true motive in negotiating the package was to fund his dream to colonize Mars.

Denholm said the primary issue was not how Musk might spend the proceeds of his option grants, but ensuring that he was motivated and committed to Tesla’s success.

“Quite honestly, I don’t know how much it costs to do any interplanetary travel,” she said.

In a November 2017 email to former Tesla General Counsel Todd Maron, Musk expressed optimism that the compensation package would be seen in a favorable light.

“Given that this will all go to causes that at least aspirationally maximize the probability of a good future for humanity, plus all Tesla shareholders will be super happy, I think this will be received well,” he wrote, adding that “it should come across as an ultra bullish view of the future.”",Tesla board chair testifies in Musk compensation lawsuit,https://www.autoblog.com/2022/11/15/tesla-elon-musk-compensation-shareholder-lawsuit-robyn-denholm/

And with fewer moving parts that require less periodic lubrication, it's easy to assume that EV maintenance costs are more economical than servicing a gas-powered vehicle. However, the battery that makes everything possible is the most expensive component in any EV. The BMW i3 leaves the Leipzig factory with an 8-year battery warranty. But if the guarantee expires, you'll be left with a hefty repair bill when it's time to replace the battery.

In a 2016 Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) report, early variants of the BMW i3 (manufactured from 2013 to 2016) would cost $16,000 to replace their 22-kWh battery pack. Come to think of it, the Chevy Volt's battery is a whopping $27,000 before tax and labor. Furthermore, replacing the battery pack in a Volkswagen e-Golf is around $24,000, so the BMW i3's sixteen-grand battery replacement cost is not too bad.

However, things change if you consider the i3's higher base price. Whereas a Chevy Volt and VW e-Golf started at under $35,000 and $33,000, the BMW i3 starts at about $45,000 before tax credits. Additionally, the i3 Range Extender could reach over $50,000 after options, and you'll need to spend more to replace its larger-capacity 33-kWh battery. Considering it offers a 50% greater capacity than the smaller 22-kWh battery, it's safe to assume you'll spend about $25,000 or more to get your BMW i3 back on the road.",Replacing The Battery Pack On A BMW I3 Costs More Than You Think,https://www.slashgear.com/1102505/replacing-the-battery-pack-on-a-bmw-i3-costs-more-than-you-think/

I’ve talked about this before, but nothing has changed and they’re pulling even further ahead.

Electric bus manufacturer Solaris recently sold another 18 articulated electric vehicles to public transport operator Miejskie Przedsiębiorstwo Komunikacyjne (MPK) in Cracow. The contract was worth over PLN 98 million and the delivery of the buses will be completed next fall.

MPK has chosen e-buses in Cracow that can be charged using a plug-in connector or pantograph charging. The energy storage system will consist of Solaris High Energy batteries with over 400 kWh capacity. To reduce the buses’ energy consumption, the propulsion system will use SiC technology with silicon carbide-based circuits.

The buses will have 2-2-2-2 doors and be able to carry 141 passengers, including 43 seated. The buses will have an efficient air conditioning system, a comprehensive passenger information system, a video surveillance system and USB ports for charging smartphones. Importantly, all systems and devices in the bus, including heating, will be powered solely by electricity.

This Isn’t The First Deal Solaris & Cracow Have Made

Recently, in July of this year, the carrier placed an order for 20 electric buses called Solaris e-buses. 7 of these were Urbino 18 electric units and 13 were Urbino 12 electric units. This group will now be joined by 18 more Urbino 18 Electric vehicles, which means that next year a total of 38 articulated Solaris e-buses will make their way to Cracow. Currently, the city’s fleet contains 76 Solaris e-buses manufactured by Solaris industries. When all is said and done soon enough, Cracow will have an impressive fleet of 114 Urbino electric vehicles in service!

The new hydrogen-fueled model, the Urbino 18 hydrogen, was also launched in September in Cracow. Moreover, MPK Kraków has been testing the 12-meter hydrogen-powered Solaris bus within its network since June.

Prior to that, Cracow has also been involved in testing new electric bus technologies. Going back to 2015, they tested an innovative multi-segment vehicle called the Tramino. The Cracow Tramino was approximately 32 meters long and fully low-floor, built in five sections. The passenger compartment was air-conditioned, step-free, and had modern LED lighting –making it friendly for all passengers, including those with disabilities.

The most unique attribute of the Tramino is that it operates off energy recovered during braking, which is stored in supercapacitors. When compared to other trams on the market, this design reduces power consumption by 20%-30%. It’s also Poland’s first vehicle with this technology. With proper adjustment, supercapacitor systems could make the tram autonomous.

“We follow all the new solutions available on the tram market with great attention. Hence our interest in the Solaris tram, equipped with the innovative energy storage system. It is worth mentioning that above all else, Nowa Huta residents will benefit from the test. The low-floor Tramino will run on route 1, leading from Wzgórza Krzesławickie to Salwator in the city centre,” said Rafał Świerczyński, CEO of Cracow City Transport at the time.

Since then, Cracow’s transport officials have made good on what was said in 2015, with the adoption of a relatively big fleet of electric buses.

Why We Cover “Small” News Like This From Solaris

We at CleanTechnica have been keeping a close eye on Solaris for the last few years. As a European bus manufacturer which is driving electric public transit in many countries, they’re right up our alley.

Earlier this year, the company reached an important milestone with the sale of its 2000th electric bus. Over 140 carriers from over 140 cities in 21 European countries have placed orders for these amazing zero-emission Urbino electric vehicles. Over 1300 of them have already arrived and are being put to use. Another 700 electric buses will be manufactured this year or next, according to the manufacturer. Urbino electric vehicles are not only modern, but also promote eco-friendly transportation in many influential cities such as Berlin, Madrid, Paris, Warsaw, and Venice (among many others now).

It was a long road getting to that milestone. Solaris’ electric bus adventure started back in 2011 with the launch of its first 8.9-meter Urbino electric bus. Since then, the company has introduced a variety of different models and sizes, including the Urbino 12 (produced since 2012), followed by the unveiling of the Urbino 18 bi-articulated electric bus in 2013. In 2019, a platform was created for what would become Solaris’ largest model yet: The Urbino 24 LE Electric debuted early 2020 as an intercity e-bus. The latest Solaris debut came just this year with another addition to their regular sized buses — the Urbino 9 LE Electric.

Last year, Solaris’ Urbino 15 LE Electric Bus won the 2022 Sustainable Bus Award. The award is an international competition that tries to bring awareness to developing eco-friendly public transport while also working to create a positive image for buses and coaches as crucial methods of transportation in climate change prevention.

In addition, Solaris designed an electric bus charging park equipped with the newest technologies. The new EV Charging Park will be a surface area of 5,000 square meters and have four vehicle stands in its covered portion. These stands contain the main charger as well as a technological center. Solaris’s Charging Park will not only be the first bidirectional charging park in Poland, but also one of the few sites utilizing this technology in Europe. The V2G (vehicle-to-grid) deployment makes it possible to not only charge buses for testing, but utilize vehicles as mobile energy storage devices as well.

Solaris’ environmental performance in 2021 was impressive. The company is not only making clean buses, but is working to make its own operations cleaner as well. Instead of rehashing that, you can read all about that here.

While the news of transit electrification is interesting on its own, I think I speak for everyone at CleanTechnica when I say I hope US transit authorities see the news and start catching up. This is especially important when you consider that buses often spend time idling or driving around with only a few passengers during off-peak times. The more we can spread the word about electric buses, the more we can put the pressure on!

434,Another data point on inflation looks to be good news for early-stage EV makers that continue to need growth capital.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/709520/rivian_off-white_r1s.png,motley fool,"What happened

While early gains have been pared back, the stocks of several electric vehicle (EV) makers jumped today. Shares of Rivian Automotive (RIVN 2.66%), Lucid Group (LCID 1.19%), and Polestar (PSNY 0.64%) were higher by 4%, 5%, and 11.4%, respectively, at their highs earlier today. As overall markets turned lower, so did these stocks. But as of 2:56 p.m. ET, Rivian shares were still up 2%, Lucid was still higher by 2.3%, and Polestar remained up by 4.6%.

So what

Markets jumped this morning when the latest inflation data showed wholesale prices rose less than expected. The Producer Price Index (PPI) climbed 8% in October year over year. That was less than the 8.4% annual rate in September and well below the peak rise of 11.7% in March compared to last year.

That data boosted investor optimism that inflation may have peaked. It comes on the heels of the better-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data the Labor Department released last week.

That helped contribute to the gains seen in the electric vehicle sector, as investors believe cooling inflation could help spur the Federal Reserve to pause, or even reverse, interest rate hikes.

Each of these start-up companies will need to continue raising money to grow their businesses, so lower interest rates could help them borrow more cheaply. Additionally, lower inflation should mean a drop in raw material costs, helping to boost margins. But there were other reasons for the outperformance of these names today, too.

Now what

In its third-quarter report released last week, Rivian said it ended the quarter with $13.8 billion in cash and equivalents, but it has delayed some capital spending to preserve more of its cash. That cash balance was down from $15.5 billion as recently as June 30. The company believes its cash on hand will carry it through 2025.

In its third-quarter report, Lucid said its cash balance would only bring it into the fourth quarter of 2023. Lucid followed that up with an announcement that it already had plans in place to raise another $1.5 billion.

But Lucid also announced news today that likely helped investors boost the stock. The luxury EV maker has a limited market with its current lineup. While Rivian's average vehicle cost to customers was $81,000, Lucid vehicles delivered in the third quarter had an average cost of nearly $140,000. Today, it announced a rear-wheel drive version of its Air Pure sedan will be offered beginning next year, helping it reach a larger customer base. That lower-cost version will cost approximately $70,000, according to a Barron's report.

While Polestar may have less name recognition than both Rivian and Lucid, the brand jointly owned by Volvo and that automaker's Chinese parent company, Geely, already has about 70,000 vehicles on the road. It expects to produce 50,000 in 2022, which would be double what Rivian plans to manufacture. Like Rivian and Lucid, Polestar is still working to raise capital needed to grow.

Today's inflation data may have been good news for the longer-term prospects of these early-stage EV makers, and investors are showing it by bidding up the stocks.","Why Rivian, Lucid, and Polestar Jumped Today",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/why-rivian-lucid-and-polestar-jumped-today/

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Jim Farley said on Tuesday the automaker will need to build more components for electric vehicles in its own factories so ""everyone has a role"" in the future.

Electric vehicles will require 40% less labor to build than current combustion vehicles, Farley told a conference in Detroit sponsored by the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, a civil rights group.

Farley told reporters on the sidelines of the conference that Ford was ""going back..to our Model A,"" when the company built many of the components for vehicles itself at the Rouge manufacturing complex in Dearborn, Michigan.

Bringing production of electric vehicle motors, batteries and other components in-house was necessary to preserve jobs and to be competitive, Farley said.

Tesla Inc, the No. 1 U.S. electric vehicle maker, builds much of the hardware for its electric vehicles, including batteries. Tesla's profit margins are now superior to Ford's and many other established automakers.

""We want to be No. 1,"" Farley told the Rainbow PUSH conference in Detroit.

Ford has begun building an electric vehicle manufacturing complex in Western Tennessee called Blue Oval City. Farley said he ""would be thrilled"" if workers hired there decide to join a union. But that decision is up to the workers.

Ford and Detroit rivals General Motors Co and Stellantis NV begin contract talks with the United Auto Workers next year. The changes driven by the shift to electrification will be central to those negotiations. The UAW's President, Ray Curry, has said he wants workers at new U.S. EV operations, including joint venture battery plants, to be organized without the process of secret ballot votes.

""Next year's negotiations will be hugely important for all stakeholders,"" Farley said.

Farley has brought in a number of executives from outside the auto industry to lead electrification and software development efforts. But he said Ford must do a better job of developing managers from within its ranks.

Research and Markets Logo



In this report the countries of Germany, UK, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Italy, and Spain are studied, which in total accounted for a market of USD 81 Billion in the year 2021. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 13% between 2022 and 2027.



The top three countries in the region are Germany, the UK, and Norway, which together account for a market share of approximately 45% in terms of value and volume over the period. Volkswagen Group and Renault are investing strongly in electric vehicles. The Volkswagen Group plans to invest approximately USD 72 Billion in its development, including areas of hybridization, electric mobility, and digitalization, between 2021 and 2027. A French company will invest 128.5 Million euros for a 50% stake in a venture with Jiangling Motors Corp to develop electric vehicles in China, part of a push by a French company to make further inroads into the world market.



The governments support the wide deployment of electric vehicles in the region by extending the grant scheme with a substantial grant for boosting the adoption of ultra-low emission vehicles. In March 2014, Norway became the first country in the world where one in every 100 passenger cars was an electric plug-in.

In addition, in 2019, almost 60% of the cars sold were electric-powered. Customer demand for electric cars has been constrained by concerns about the limited operating range of these vehicles. In Germany, electric cars made up only 1.8% of new passenger car registrations last year, with diesel and petrol cars accounting for 32% and 59.2%, respectively.

As more businesses in the region adopt electric vans and commercial vehicles, major manufacturers are working hard to keep up with demand, rolling out an impressive selection of dedicated commercial electric vans. Some countries in the region charge higher road tolls for diesel cars than for petrol-driven vehicles.



The major contributing segment of PHEV is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% through the forecast period. The market scenario is expected to change by the forecasted period, with the BEV segment ruling the market with a market value of over USD 80 Billion. Europe represents the largest share of around 0.6 Million of the charging points, corresponding to a connectivity penetration rate of 46%. There are 271337 public EV charging points in Europe.

Story continues

To guarantee a seamless charging infrastructure in the region, the geographic distribution of charging stations certainly needs to catch up. In 2019, super fast charging points accounted for less than 10% of the total market. The resulting lack of fast charging stations makes consumers concerned about the lack of charging options, thus forestalling the development of a functioning market.



Several companies are focusing on the development of innovative solutions for electric mobility and charging infrastructure. In 2020, Groupe Renault (U.K.) launched its INCIT-EV project, specifically for electro-mobility. The company offered innovative wireless charging solutions for EVs across Europe under this 48-month initiative. The project will focus on low-power bidirectional charging and static wireless charging in taxi lanes located at airports and central stations in Zaragoza, Spain.



Government supportive incentives in the form of tax reductions and grants for residential and commercial infrastructure encourage the adoption of electric mobility. For instance, in the Netherlands and Greece, the government offers incentives for purchasing and installing residential charging stations. It provides a deduction of up to 36% and a tax return of up to 75% on costs associated with purchasing and installing charging stations. The Finnish government announced an investment of approximately USD 6.57 Million to expand charging infrastructure in 2020 and 2021. These developments are expected to support the growth of EVs in Europe in the coming years.



Renault's Zoe and Tesla's Model 3 are among Europe's best-selling electric vehicle models, both in terms of vehicles in operation and new car registrations. In the latter category, Volkswagen's new ID.3 model climbed through the ranks and topped the charts in December.

A growing number of local governments are announcing plans to regulate or restrict access to combustion engine vehicles in urban centers, cities, or metropolitan regions, often ahead of national targets to end new combustion vehicle sales or registrations. London has implemented small, street-based near-zero-emission zones in three areas, and Amsterdam and Paris have announced plans for citywide ZEZs in 2030. Cities are also leveraging their unique authority over public and private fleets to accelerate EV uptake in high-visibility segments. Paris has set the goal of having a 90% electric municipal fleet in 2021 and 100% zero-emission public transportation in 2025.

Every year the consumer advocacy non-profit asks its members about problems they’ve had with their vehicles in the past 12 months in 17 trouble areas, including issues with a car's engine, transmission, electronics, plus fit and finish issues, among others. Consumer Reports then uses that information to predict reliability ratings for new cars from every major automaker for every model sold in the U.S.

Consumer Reports gathered data on more than 300,000 vehicles from the 2000 to 2022 model years, with a few newly-introduced 2023 models. In order to predict reliability for new models, those redesigned for 2023, and models with insufficient data, Consumer Reports “analyzes the brand’s reliability history, the previous generations, and, if applicable, the reliability of models with shared components.”

Of the models surveyed, EVs and hybrids are some of the most desirable and in-demand, but their reliability ratings are at the opposite ends of the spectrum.

“EVs are gaining in market share, and CR has more data than ever before from its owner surveys to gauge their reliability,” Consumer Reports said. “But with the introduction of so many new models, the results are, not surprisingly, subpar.”

A visitor views the Tesla Model 3 electric vehicle at the Canadian International Auto Show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada February 18, 2020. REUTERS/Chris Helgren

The study found that Tesla models continue to have issues with “body hardware, steering/suspension, paint and trim, and climate system on its models,” but the electric powertrains haven’t had many issues. While the Model 3 has average reliability, and the Model S,Y, and X have below average reliability, Tesla still rose four spots this year to 19th place in the overall brand rankings.

Looking at EVs from other manufacturers, owners reported charging problems, battery issues, and electric motor problems from those cars. Of the 11 EV models that Consumer Reports has data on, only 4 of them (the Kia EV6, Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Ioniq 5) have average or better than average predicted reliability.

Story continues

On the flipside, hybrid and mid-size and full-size sedans scored highest in terms of reliability. Among all vehicle types, non plug-in hybrid cars and hybrid SUVs rank first and third, respectively, for predicted reliability, according to Consumer Reports data.

“With today’s inflated car prices, people are keeping their vehicles longer than ever. A hybrid can provide years of trouble-free miles, and they are a good defense against rising fuel prices,” said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports senior director of automotive testing, said in a statement. “With a top-rated hybrid you get solid reliability, better fuel economy, and lower maintenance costs without sacrificing acceleration, ride comfort, or cabin quietness.”

Among the top-performing hybrids in Consumer Reports ratings were the Lexus NX, Ford Maverick, and Toyota Corolla. Consumer Reports found that 36% of prospective buyers are considering a hybrid car or truck purchase, up from 29% in 2019.

Looking across brands at overall standings, Toyota and Lexus continued to dominate in terms of reliability. Consumer Reports placed Toyota and Lexus (owned by Toyota) in the top two spots, which continues the brand's long run of delivering strong reliability across its product portfolio.

Other notable brands in the top ten were BMW in third, climbing ten spots, with Mazda coming in fourth this year, down two spots; Honda was unchanged in fifth. Subaru ranked seventh and Acura ranked eighth overall; with Kia ranked ninth, up six spots from 2021. Ford’s Lincoln brand rounded out the top ten.

Race to reduce overall vehicle weight to increase driving range, reduce emissions in hybrid vehicles, and increase demand for superior quality vehicle interiors driving the plastics market in electric vehicles.

Polyurethanes and Polypropylene would hold significant market share in EV Plastics.

Car manufacturers widely use polyurethane materials for benefits in terms of comfort, safety, lightweight, and longevity with design freedom. By 2027, the polyurethane demand in the Asia Pacific is projected to be significantly higher than in Europe and North America, respectively, mainly due to increased demand for better seat comfort in vehicles. Polyurethanes are durable, lightweight, and have excellent strength, offering comfort and flexibility in design. These properties allow manufacturers to make higher-quality ergonomic seats.

Polyurethanes are ideal not only for cushioning purposes but also within the bodies of cars, where their insulation properties protect against the engines heat and noise. As polyurethanes provide equal strength as metals or conventional heavy materials and are also lightweight, their use reduces the overall vehicle weight, resulting in greater fuel efficiency and improved environmental performance. Polypropylene is considered the lightest thermoplastic because of its low density. Also, polypropylene costs are comparatively less than ABS, making it popular in cost-conscious markets such as the Asia Pacific. Hence, polypropylene would be one of EVs most preferred lightweight materials.

Interior and Powertrain would be the leading plastic applications in EVs

To achieve a longer range, an electric car must be equipped with high-capacity batteries, which adds to the cars weight. The high-capacity batteries generate heat while charging and discharging. Hence they need heat management systems. Polymer manufacturing companies are focusing on providing new polymers for next-generation battery technologies that dissipate heat effectively and quickly, thus improving battery performance. For instance, Ultramid (polyamide), a polymer offered by BASF, is used in battery casings and cell frames to reduce about 30% of vehicle weight compared to metals. Customers demand more aesthetically pleasing interiors for their vehicles. To provide this, OEMs have shifted focus to high-performance thermoplastics that provide better flowability and higher dimensional stability for easy and economical production of interior components. Plastics have proven to be the ideal material for interior components of premium cars as they are durable and aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, they help reduce NVH levels of electric vehicles.

With the increasing number of on-road EV vehicles, reaching 16.2 million units worldwide in 2021, the demand for plastic applications in battery powertrains and interior components is likely to drive the market.

Asia Pacific region to establish dominance in the global Electric Vehicle Plastics Market

The Asia Pacific is expected to hold a market share of ~55% in 2022 for the electric vehicles plastics market, mainly owing to Chinas booming electric vehicles market. According to IEA, EV sales were highest in China, which tripled relative to 2020 to 3.3 million units after several years of relative stagnation. In Europe, EV sales increased by two-thirds yearly to 2.3 million units. The demand for plastic from the BEV segment in the country is anticipated to remain the most attractive throughout the forecast period owing to their popularity and zero emission characteristics compared to PHEVs. Additionally, investments from companies like Tesla in the country are further anticipated to boost the demand for electric vehicles, thus the plastic components. The government in India is pushing the deployment of EV charging stations by providing capital subsidies through Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India, (FAME) India Scheme Phase II, and state-level initiatives.

Further, the government has delicensed the activity of setting up EV charging stations to increase private sector investments and facilitate market adoption. There is a higher demand for PHEVs than BEVs in Japan, as PHEVs and HEVs are exempted from ‘automobile acquisition tax,’ i.e., registration tax and tonnage tax which has shifted the consumer preference for PHEVs as opposed to BEVs. Due to this, the demand for plastics in PHEVs is anticipated to create lucrative growth opportunities for EV plastic component manufacturers in Japan.

Thus, the Electric Vehicle Plastics Market in the Asia Pacific is driven due to increasing concerns over the carbon footprint of the automobile industry, reduction in the overall weight of vehicles to improve fuel efficiency, and government mandates to promote the adoption of electric mobility.

Key Market Players

The Major players in Electric Vehicle Plastics Market includes BASF SE(Germany), Lyondellbasell Industries Holdings B.V. (Netherlands), Sabic (Saudi Arabia), Dow (US) & Dupont (US).

As the entire automotive industry moves towards electric vehicles, a fully electric McLaren is inevitable. But it won’t be a supercar. Instead, it’ll be something much more practical.

AutoExpress recently shared portions of an interview that McLaren CEO Michael Leiters gave to its sister publication Evo. In the interview, Leiters said he doesn’t think McLaren is ready to build an electric hypercar just yet. He then went on to not-so-subtly hint at an electric sedan.

“The technology is much more mature [and allows us to] customise it to have a more lifestyle, a more utility purpose,” Leiters told Evo. “Words like ‘utility’ or ‘lifestyle’, you’ll obviously leap to certain conclusions. I think the key measure for McLaren is potentially something with the ability to share with more occupants in the car. Not necessarily higher-riding, but it could be.”

It’s possible you could read that quote as Leiters saying McLaren will go after the Ferrari Purosangue with a crossover, but it sounds to us like he has a sedan in mind to take on the Porsche Taycan. Although it won’t be cheap. He reportedly said it will cost at least $US200,000 ($277,640), which he considers the pricing floor for any new McLaren, adding, “We need to focus on profitability, not volume.”

Leiters also said he’s focused on build quality going forward and making sure any vehicle it sells is fully “mature” before they’re delivered to customers. “What I heard from my team is that in the past, we accepted a non-mature product and would launch it and deliver it to customers,” he said. “The Artura was the first project where we didn’t do that. We saw that the car wasn’t mature, so we stopped deliveries. Doing this risked the financial position of the company, but I think this was important.”

Considering he used to work at Porsche, he’s probably got high standards for what he considers a “mature” car, which can only a good thing for future McLaren owners.",The First Fully-Electric McLaren Will Likely Be a Sedan,https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/11/the-first-fully-electric-mclaren-will-likely-be-a-sedan/

The global electrified road for electric vehicle charging market is anticipated to register growth at a robust rate in the forecast period, 2023-2027. The market growth can be attributed to the increased focus of government on building electrified roads to reduce the requirement of installing new electric vehicle charging infrastructure to boost the adoption of electric cars.

New York, Nov. 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Electrified Road for Electric Vehicle Charging Market – Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2017-2027"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06362594/?utm_source=GNW





As carbon emissions levels are rising at a substantial rate, government agencies across the world are enforcing regulations to cut the greenhouse gas emissions by promoting electrification in their countries.With the growing adoption of electric vehicles, the carbon emissions can be lowered significantly.



Hence, government incentives on the purchase of electric vehicles, decreased vehicle prices, enhanced vehicle range and capabilities, and growing awareness among consumers regarding vehicular pollution are contributing to the rapid adoption of electric vehicles across the world.However, electric vehicle charging remains a key concern for the users.



Therefore, now electrified roads are being built to solve the problem of lack of public electric vehicle charging infrastructure, one of the major reasons restricting electric vehicle adoption. Electrified road for electric vehicle charging is an innovative method aimed at recharging the batteries of cars and trucks when they are on the move. The electric highways can make charging faster and travel longer for electric vehicle drivers. Electric road system (ERS) is a system that facilitates power exchange between an electric vehicle and the road that it is travelling on. On the basis of how charging takes place, the electrified roads are majorly divided into three categories such as overhead conductive, conductive power transfer from the road, and inductive power transfer from road.

Growing Need to Expand Electric Vehicle Infrastructure to Boost Market Growth

Electric vehicles are considered the best option to replace traditional ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles.In near future, the electric vehicle adoption is expected to grow significantly, with the introduction of electric vehicles equipped with batteries with high capacity and addition of more Electric Vehicle charging stations.



However, vehicles with big sizes such as electric trucks required to be recharged more frequently.Hence, electrified roads serve as the perfect solution for electric vehicle drivers who need to cover long range as they would no longer have to recharge batteries from time-to-time.



The “dynamic charging” with electrified roads is anticipated to replace the existing charging methods that relatively take more time and require a power source to plug in the vehicle.With inductive charging technology, the cost of constructing 1 km of electrified road would require approx.



USD1 million, 50 times less than constructing an urban tram line.

Technological Innovations Fuel the Expansion of Electrified Roads

The dynamic (in-motion) wireless power transfer (DWPT) is a novel technology.Hence, a number of research institutions are currently analyzing and developing the technology, in areas such as electromagnetic design optimization techniques, magnetic materials, power electronic topologies, etc.



Innovation in areas such as batteries, electromagnetic emissions, alignment techniques are also required to make electrified roads mainstream in coming years. Hence, private players, government are research institutes are collaborating to pioneer wireless charging infrastructure technology and enhance roadway electrification.

However, the deployment of DWPT infrastructure would require significant investments by market players and increased collaboration for the government.

Market Segmentation

The global electrified road for electric vehicle charging market is segmented by regional distribution.Based on regional analysis, the market is divided into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and South America.



The Europe region is expected to register the fastest growth in the electrified road for Electric Vehicle charging market during the forecast period, owing to increased government initiatives by the government for the construction of electrified roads in the region. The United States is anticipated to hold a significant market share in the coming years due to greater adoption of electrified road technologies in the region.

The deal was inked in July, and per the agreement, the football and basketball players from the first-division teams have now received their shiny new cars. In addition, all the players of the first women’s football team, along with all the respective coaches, have taken delivery of their vehicles.

As seen in the adjacent large photo gallery, all players have received electric cars, either an i4 in the M Performance guise (M50) or an iX as either an xDrive40 or the xDrive50. Florentino Pérez, Real Madrid’s president, will take delivery of the i7 in December and BMW says the fullsize electric sedan will serve as the team’s official car.

Further down the line, Real Madrid players will also be given the opportunity to hop behind the wheel of other BMWs, all of which are going to be EVs. These include not only the aforementioned i7, but also the iX1 and iX3 crossovers. In the meantime, coach Carlo Ancelotti drove home in an i4 M50 painted in Tanzanite Blue while Benzema opted for the same car, but in Sapphire Black.

Over in Italy, BMW has signed a long-term deal with AC Milan. In Germany, the automaker had negotiations with FC Bayern Munich to become its main sponsor from 2025, but the team chose to extend its deal with Audi until 2029. In case you’re curious what each player got, a full list is attached below.

This is because everything is so close that range anxiety will not be a major concern given the good range one gets these days from modern EVs. Unlike in the early days first generation Nissan Leaf, most modern EVs have ranges well above 200 km per charge.

Mauritius, the island nation which is a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), is a good example. The country is about 60 km long and 45 km wide and has an area of about 2000 km2. Mauritius has a population of about 1.37 million. Modern EVs will be perfect for most if not all of the peoples’ daily commutes on the island.

The 10 Year Electric Vehicle Integration Roadmap for Mauritius commissioned by the Ministry of Energy and Public Utilities in 2020, states that there were 562,202 vehicles in Mauritius at the time. 312,000 of these were cars (registered cars, dual purpose vehicle double cab pickups and vans). The report also says that new car sales per year in the country average about 11,000 along with 9,000 used car imports. So, we can say there are probably around 600,000 vehicles now in the country. A (2022-2023) budget summary report from KPMG says 0.11% of the country’s fleet is electric. Mauritius needs to increase the penetration of EVs ASAP!

To catalyze the adoption of electric vehicles, the government of Mauritius has made EVs duty free! As of the 1st of July 2022, all hybrid and electric vehicles are now duty-free in Mauritius. This was announced earlier this year by Finance Minister Renganaden Padayachy in his 2022-23 Budget Speech. These incentives were introduced under the “Accelerating The Land Transport Electric Vehicles Transition” program where the government wants to further reduce our dependence on import of petroleum products, decarbonize the land transport system, and accelerate the EV transition.

Brand new and used EVs have been on sale for a while now in Mauritius. So, which cars can one get in Mauritius? The LEAL Group is a major automotive dealership in Mauritius and is the supplier and importer of BMW, MINI, Rolls Royce, Renault, KIA, Mitsubishi, GWM, and Haval in Mauritius. The LEAL Group offers the BMW i range, including the iX, iX3, and i4. They will also offer the new i7 and iX1. The Kia range includes the eNiro and the EV6. The LEAL Group also offers the electric Mini Cooper SE. The Renault Zoe is another EV that is available in the Mauritian market. The LEAL Group also has a partnership with BYD and the critically acclaimed Atto 3 should find its way to Mauritius soon. Other dealers also offer the MG ZS EV. The Hyundai Kona EV is also available in Mauritius. Dealers such EV-Cars have been selling preowned Teslas in Mauritius for a while now.

In a great post on LinkedIn in 2020 before the duty free policy, Olaf Boulle said that “the lower spread between ICE and EV Duty rates on cars destined to the broader market doesn’t allow EVs’ prices to be competitive enough. A Rs 1,37M Zoë will never compete with a Rs 900k Clio (i.e. 50% more expensive), and neither will an i3 priced above Rs 2M. Same goes for the Ioniq (Rs 1,56M) against a Rs 1M Hyundai Accent and for the Kona and eNiro (between Rs 1,7m and 2M) against a Kia Sportage (Rs 1,2M).”

The price difference between premium/luxury EVs and their equivalent ICE vehicles was not that big and hence wealthier customers looking for a Jaguar I Pace, for example, would not really be put off by the price compared to an F Pace in terms of upfront purchase price. We know that to really make a difference in the EV market, closing the price gap in the more mass market vehicle segments is critical. The new duty-free policy for EVs in Mauritius should go a long way in addressing this.

Another $700 million will be spent to build a new battery manufacturing plant in Woodruff, South Carolina. The company is also planning a major investment in China through its local BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd joint venture.

The announcement comes only one week after BMW chairman Oliver Zipse visited China as a member of the delegation of German companies, along with the country’s chancellor Olaf Scholz. The plan is to invest 10 billion yuan or $1.4 billion (€1.37 billion) at current exchange rates to boost battery production in the People’s Republic. The money will go into the expansion of the Lydia plant, which makes the batteries for the i3 Sedan and iX3 crossover built exclusively in China.

BMW’s production facilities in the Shenyang region are the Group’s largest in the world and have a maximum annual output of 830,000 vehicles. Plant Lydia was opened earlier this year as the place of birth for the 2023 i3, an electric sedan based on the locally produced long-wheelbase 3 Series LCI. The iX3 is assembled in Dadong, Shenyang from where it’s shipped to export markets.

It’s worth mentioning BMW has had a controlling stake in the joint venture since mid-February when it increased its shareholding in BMW Brilliance Automotive from 50% to 75%. This new major investment is a clear sign of the automaker’s long-term commitment to China and it also highlights its global EV expansion plans.

Approximately 53,000 electric cars have been sold by the BMW Group so far this year in the world’s most populous country, representing an increase of 65% compared to the same period of 2021. Production of the next-generation MINI Cooper SE electric hatchback will be relocated to China as part of a tie-up with Great Wall Motors, which will also assemble the Aceman electric crossover.

452,Silicon Valley startup Tenet is looking to unlock better electric car financing options based on its proprietary data.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/11/Tenet-app.jpeg,cleantechnica,"Electric car sales are trending up nicely in most of America, but the rising cost of battery materials is causing the sale price of many EVs to rise. Couple that with the recent increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and buyers in the market for an electric car are being hit with a double whammy — higher sticker prices and higher borrowing costs.

A Better Deal On Electric Car Financing

Tenet is a Silicon Valley based startup that is using data to create more affordable financing options for electric car shoppers. It says traditional lending models don’t take into account many of the factors that make Evs unique. “Software upgrades, lower maintenance costs, and tax credits mean EVs should be treated differently than gas cars. Other auto lenders may not take this into account when they price your loan, but we do,” it says on its website.

Tenet co-founder and CEO Alex Liegl tells Canary Media most US car buyers aren’t getting a fair deal on the loans they take out to buy EVs and he says he has the data to back that up. For instance, the federal tax credits plus state and utility incentives might not reach the buyer until a year or more after the purchase but they make it more likely buyers will keep up with their monthly payments

​“Our job is to pull that forward to the point of purchase or shortly after,” Leigl says. ​“When they’re buying their vehicle, they can apply that as a deferred down payment” through a structure that Tenet has crafted with its lending partners.

EVs also cost less to fuel and maintain than gasoline vehicles, which lowers the monthly financial burden on their owners. Finally, if an owner defaults on the loan, used EVs tend to be worth more than conventional cars. That higher value should be factored in to the loan calculation as well, Leigl says. It’s all there in the data Tenet assembles. ​“The more data we’re able to collect, the more efficiently we’re able to price our consumer loans, and the more savings we’re able to pass on.” The upshot, he says, is that electric car buyers are better credit risks and that should be a factor in the lending process.

Tenet doesn’t carry loans on its own balance sheet, Liegl explains. Instead, it earns money from banks, credit unions, automakers, dealers, and other financing partners that use its underlying data analysis to ​“connect the dots and align those incentives.”

The company has enabled several thousand loans so far, is active across 33 states, and is aiming to get at least 10,000 EVs financed by the end of 2023, he said. On average, these loans offer monthly payments that are about $150 less than payments on loans for EVs that are made in more conventional ways, Tenet said.

Nick Christian, head of specialty financing for Silicon Valley Bank, says the financing units of most major automakers have been offering special deals for EV loans for years now, as have certain banks and credit unions, but ​“they don’t underwrite any differently for EVs than they do for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

In other words, these offers aren’t necessarily backed by underlying analysis of the data that might justify them, he said. Tenet, in contrast, has pulled together the relevant data on EV buyers’ ability to repay their loans and the long term value of the asset they’re borrowing against in a way that Christian hasn’t seen other auto lenders do yet. “I suspect that if someone is successful, there will be copycats,” he said. ​“But they’re first.”

Treehouse Streamlines Electric Car Charger Installations

Treehouse is another Silicon Valley startup that has built a data driven approach to bundling the cost of buying and installing EV chargers at home. Lots of automakers and car dealers offer EV buyers discounts on home chargers but few offer help in determining how much it will cost to install those chargers. Treehouse CEO Eric Owski tells Canary Media none of them are bundling the cost of charger installation into the loan for buying an EV. Treehouse and Tenet plan to start doing precisely that in the first quarter of 2023.

“Most EV owners are receiving fairly poor guidance at the point of sale” about how to ready their homes for charging their new EV, Owski says. That can be a problem for homes with inadequate electrical service to support heavier charging loads or wiring that doesn’t extend to where they park their cars. “Anecdotally, probably 10 to 20 percent of EV buyers have run into a problem they wish they’d known about beforehand. ​For a small percentage of those, it becomes a real deal breaker.”

Treehouse collects data from prospective customers via an online form that asks a relatively simple set of questions — home address, what type of building it is, preferred charger location, and the location and amperage of the electrical panel. It combines that information with a growing store of its own data to provide a cost estimate for the installation.

The company has hired its own electricians to do installations and also contracts to third parties, which can save ​“hundreds if not thousands of dollars” on both upfront and ongoing charging costs. Cutting the costs and complexities of owning an EV will be important to help EV adoption move beyond ​“a lot of early adopters who were willing to break through barriers on their own,” he said. ​“I think we’re seeing that consumer perspective shifting as EVs hit that tipping point. Everything has to work smoothly.”

A recent survey by EV-charging company Volta found that nearly 60% of people who plan to buy an EV in the next 12 months have household incomes below $75,000 a year, while less than a third of current EV owners have incomes below that threshold. That means this new class of buyers will be particularly cost conscious.

A Foot In The ESG Door

Both Treehouse and Tenet see the electric car as a point of entry into a general rethinking of how electricity is used in the home. “Consumers are much more open to broader electrification options once they have an EV in their home,” Owski says. Liegl adds that EVs are a ​“natural entry point” for broader electrification of home heating and cooking and other home decarbonization and efficiency measures. ​“We want to be that financial network for the climate economy.”

Silicon Valley Bank has its eye on ESG values as well. Nick Christian says that like many banks, it has experience bundling individual loans into asset backed securities, including loans for installing residential solar systems. Securitization has helped drive down the cost of capital for rooftop solar systems and could play a similar role for EVs and broader home efficiency investments as well, he noted. “If we can help [Tenet] like we would a normal consumer lender, but also do something that’s good for the broader environment, that’s a plus for us.”

Bundles of EV loans could be more valuable than bundles of loans for gas powered cars. While the ESG value of EV loan backed securities has yet to be established, the fact that EV purchases displace purchases of polluting fossil fueled vehicles is likely to have value in the market, Liegl says.

In fact, data about how EVs are driven could make these loans even more valuable as ESG investments, he noted, since that can provide a record of just how much pollution and carbon emissions they’re preventing compared to gasoline-fueled vehicles. That gives investors ​“insights into how much CO2 they’re helping to avoid. They can start tracking their climate impact and begin to think about how that slots into their overall ESG goals.”

The Takeaway

For years, we at CleanTechnica have been touting the benefits of an electric car. Primarily, we tend to focus on the reduction in carbon emissions associated with driving on electrons but maybe we can’t see the forest for the trees.

Electric cars are an entré into a whole new way of looking at the world. If you drive an EV, you are much more likely to be interested in rooftop solar, a residential battery, heat pumps, and ways to use your vehicle to get you and your family through a power outage.

What we are seeing is the beginning of an attitude shift. Let me explain. At one time in America, everyone smoked. Today? Not so much. Attitudes change, and both Tenet and Treehouse are tapping into those changes. What even they have not yet anticipated is the impending decline in the value of used conventional cars. That is when the difference between financing gas powered cars and electric cars will become fully apparent.

453,These stocks have crushed the market in 2022 and look likely to continue.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/708779/great-best-top-stock-to-buy-2022.jpg,motley fool,"These three stocks crushed the market in 2022. All are in positive territory compared to the S&P 500's 21% decline, and I think they have room to run. Here's why agricultural science company Corteva (CTVA -0.44%), advanced materials specialist Hexcel (HXL -0.13%), and electrical products producer nVent Electric (NVT 0.17%) are suitable investments today.

1. The best stock in the agriculture sector

Seed and crop protection company Corteva is finally realizing its potential. Created out of the DowDuPont merger in 2017 and then separated as a stand-alone company in 2019, the company combined DuPont's (DD 0.94%) expertise in seeds with Dow's (DOW -0.04%) crop science business in one entity. Unfortunately, it's taken a few years and the involvement of an activist hedge fund, Starboard Value, for the benefits of the merger to come to fruition.

But Corteva is now firmly on the path of expanding its sales and profit margin. It's using a combination of cost synergies, focusing on its core end-market geographies, cutting royalty payments by selling relatively more products using its technology (led by plans to gain 60% market share of U.S. soybean acres with its Enlist soybeans), and its new higher-margin products.

As such, management believes it will expand the margin on earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) from 17.4% in 2022 to a 21% to 23% range by 2025. The recent third-quarter results showed the company making good progress with year-to-date organic sales up 16% and operating EBITDA up 23%. Management believes its EBITDA margin will hit 20.9% in 2022, and Corteva looks well on its way to substantial margin expansion in the coming years.

2. An aerospace stock to buy

Hexcel makes advanced composites used in commercial aerospace, defense & space, and the industrial sector in general. Commercial aerospace is its most important end market, including such customers as Boeing and Airbus.

Advanced composites offer weight and strength advantages over traditional metals. They are increasingly being used on newer airplanes to reduce costs; lighter planes use less fuel, and stronger and tougher planes require less maintenance.

As such, the case for buying the stock relies on a combination of Boeing and Airbus ramping up production, Hexcel increasing its content on newer airplanes, and increased production of wide-body planes with significantly more advanced-composite content.

With Boeing and Airbus desperately trying to ramp up production and reduce their mult-year backlogs, Hexcel has excellent prospects. Furthermore, increasing content per plane on newer airplanes means the company can grow revenue even if unit airplane production is flat. Lastly, as the commercial aerospace recovery expands from domestic markets to international, demand for wide-body aircraft will likely pick up.

3. A stock to play the electrification theme

The connection and protection electrical-products manufacturer nVent Electric is a play on a very powerful megatrend in the economy, namely electrification. Electric vehicles and charging networks, data centers, smart buildings and smart infrastructure, industrial automation, renewable energy, and good old-fashioned spending on upgrading electrical transmission and distribution networks are all economic growth areas.

In addition, the drive toward electrification will continue even if the economy slows, not least because many of the above trends involve increasing productivity or sustainability.

The power of these trends can be seen in nVent's earnings in 2022. In a challenging year for the markets and the economy, it has raised sales and earnings guidance on all three quarterly reports in its financial 2022. Having started the year forecasting organic sales growth of 6% to 9% and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.10 to $2.20, management is now forecasting organic sales growth of 15% to 17% and adjusted EPS of $2.17 to $2.23.

Earnings would have been even more substantial had it not been for soaring supply chain costs and foreign exchange headwinds in 2022. Still, both those factors can turn into tailwinds in 2023 as the supply chain pressures ease and comparisons with 2022 get easier. So all told, nVent's near- and long-term prospects look excellent.",3 Top Industrial Stocks to Buy in November,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/3-top-industrial-stocks-to-buy-in-november/

Hybrid vehicles and mid-sized or large sedans were among the most reliable, according to the survey.

The magazine's annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.

Tesla Inc's EVs, on which Consumer Reports received the most data from owners, continue to face issues with body hardware, steering/suspension, paint and trim, and climate system, but their electric powertrains have very few problems, according to the survey.

However, Tesla improved its ranking by four places to No.19 this year, with Mercedes-Benz slipping five slots to rank the least reliable among all brands, the survey showed.

EV owners from other manufacturers reported charging and battery problems, as well as electric drive motor issues. Of the 11 EV models on which Consumer Reports has sufficient data, only four have average or ""better predicted reliability"".

The top-ranked brands in the survey were Toyota and Lexus, and seven of the ten best-scoring brands were from Japan and South Korea.

Among brands owned by Detroit automakers, Ford Motor Co's Lincoln was the only one in the top ten, securing 10th place.

All of General Motors Co's brands dropped in Consumer Reports' rankings, with Buick ranked highest at 11th. Among Stellantis' brands, Ram ranked highest at 16th.

Amid rising vehicle prices, 94% of prospective automobile buyers consider reliability to be ""extremely"" or ""very"" important, the survey showed.

Quite the opposite as the brand is teasing the return of the 500e.



Set to debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show on November 17th, the redesigned hatch should be virtually identical to the European variant that was introduced in 2020.

Little is known about the car at this point, but Fiat said fans will “feel the electricity” as they will have an “electric and exciting reveal of one of the most iconic and classic Fiat brand vehicles of all-time.” If that didn’t make things obvious enough, the teaser image is titled “500e” and it shows the distinctive front lighting units of the 500 EV sold overseas.

There’s no word on US specifications at this point, but the European model offers electric motors with outputs of 94 hp (70 kW / 95 PS) and 117 hp (87 kW / 118 PS). Customers can also choose between 24 and 42 kWh battery packs. The more powerful of the two offers up to 199 miles (320 km) of range in the UK, although EPA estimates will likely be lower.

We’ll find out more shortly, but the return of the 500e can’t come soon enough as Fiat’s lineup has been reduced to a single model in the United States. Following the deaths of the 500, 500L, and 124 Spider, Fiat only offers the 500X in America and sales have been predictably lackluster as the company has only sold 757 units through the first nine months of the year.

The problem isn’t the amount of electricity required, Randall notes. “The real challenge is how quickly high-speed chargers will need to deliver electricity at a single place and time.” According to Dave Mulaney of the RMI research institute, “Utilities need to be starting half a decade ahead of the trucks in order to not be bottlenecking the transition to electric trucks.”

Randall cites a study by utility company National Grid Plc. “Researchers found that by 2030, electrifying a typical highway gas station will require as much power as a professional sports stadium—and that’s mostly just for electrified passenger vehicles. As more electric trucks hit the road, the projected power needs for a big truck stop by 2035 will equal that of a small town.”

Brian Wilkie, director of transport electrification at National Grid, says that “Building connected electricity highways will be a competitive advantage for states that move the fastest, and every utility should be conducting similar studies to evaluate future demand.”",How Utilities Can Prepare for Vehicle Electrification,https://www.planetizen.com/news/2022/11/119682-how-utilities-can-prepare-vehicle-electrification

Honda is no stranger to introducing hybrid powertrains in its vehicles on sale in Malaysia, and the just-launched 2022 Civic e:HEV RS Hybrid is the latest in the brand’s growing line of electrified models in the country.

The latest electrified offering from Honda Malaysia joins the presently available range of hybrids, comprised of the HR-V, City and City Hatchback. The City – with its e:HEV variant – was launched in October 2020, the City Hatchback e:HEV in February this year and the HR-V e:HEV in July.

Of these, the City e:HEV RS contributed 5% of sales to the overall sales volume of the Honda City, while the City Hatchback e:HEV RS comprised of 8% of that model’s overall sales. Meanwhile, the HR-V e:HEV RS made up 11% of the crossover’s total sales; these percentage figures are for their respective variants’ sales in the first 10 months of this year.

All four e:HEV models from Honda Malaysia employ the manufacturer’s i-MMD powertrain where propulsion comes from an electric motor fed by a lithium-ion battery, and this electricity is supplied by an Atkinson-cycle petrol engine that serves as a generator. In the City and City Hatchback, the electric drive motor makes 108 PS and 253 Nm, supplied by the 1.5 litre petrol mill that produces 98 PS and 127 Nm.

The system in the HR-V e:HEV RS is 22 PS more powerful at 131 PS with the same torque output, and the Atkinson-cycle combustion engine is also marginally more powerful at 107 PS and 131 Nm.

The just-launched Civic e:HEV RS hybrid packs the most powerful system of the quartet, with an electric drive motor rated at 184 PS and 315 Nm fed by a 2.0 litre Atkinson-cycle petrol engine that produces 143 PS and 189 Nm of torque. All Honda e:HEV models employ the same i-MMD configuration, where the combustion engine can assist the electric motor for propulsion at higher speeds.

Launched today in Malaysia, the 2022 Honda Civic e:HEV RS hybrid is priced at RM166,500, and is offered in a selection of four colours – Ignite Red Metallic, Crystal Black Pearl, Meteoroid Gray Metallic and Platinum White Pearl.

Hybrids generally are tried-and-true designs with few frills, while automakers are cramming glitchy electronic features into expensive new pickups and EVs, the nonprofit group says.

DETROIT — Gas-electric hybrids were the most dependable vehicles sold in the United States in the past year, while big pickup trucks and fully electric automobiles performed the worst in Consumer Reports’ annual reliability survey.

“Hybrids are very conventionally built vehicles,” Fisher said. “They’re catering to practical buyers who are looking for reliable, efficient, safe vehicles, not the latest technology.”

With high gas prices and skyrocketing new vehicle costs, people are keeping their vehicles longer, so reliability and fuel economy are becoming more important to buyers, the group’s annual survey found. “A hybrid can provide years of trouble-free miles, and they are a good defense against rising fuel prices,” Fisher said.

Reliability was extremely or very important to 94 percent of prospective auto buyers, the survey found, and 80 percent said the same about fuel economy, Consumer Reports said.

Plug-in hybrids, which can go a relatively short distance on battery power before switching to both gas and electricity, don’t have the same level of reliability as hybrids, Fisher said.

It helps that most hybrids are sold by Toyota and its Lexus luxury brand, the top two brands in Consumer Reports’s rankings, released Tuesday at a meeting of the Automotive Press Association in Detroit.

Germany’s BMW leaped 10 places to take the No. 3 spot, while Mazda and Honda rounded out the top five.

Mercedes-Benz was the least reliable of 24 brands in the survey, followed by Jeep, Volkswagen, GMC, and Chevrolet.

Tesla, which makes the top-selling electric vehicles sold in the United States, rose four spots to rank No. 19, although it still has quality problems, Fisher said.

Owners reported few problems with Tesla’s batteries and motors, but the company did have trouble with paint, fit-and-finish, heating and cooling, and suspension systems, Fisher said. Tesla’s Model 3 had average reliability, but the S, Y, and X were all below average.

Ford’s Lincoln luxury brand had the most improvement in reliability, rising 14 spots to rank 10th and become the only US-based brand in the top 10. The brand’s SUVs are older models that have been on sale for more years, allowing Ford to work out the bugs, Fisher said.

Full-size pickup trucks, Fisher said, have become luxury vehicles with large touch screens and multi-speed transmissions. They’re popular, so the market is competitive, with buyers seeking the latest in infotainment and other technology, he said. The survey found problems with Ford’s F-150 trailer controller and power liftgates, while Chevrolet’s Silverado had some engine issues, Fisher said.

Only seven of the 17 pickup models in this year’s survey had average or better reliability.

In theory, electric vehicles should be more reliable than internal combustion vehicles, Fisher said. But in addition to Tesla’s problems, EVs from other automakers had charging and battery trouble and electric drive motor issues. Of 11 EVs for which Consumer Reports had adequate survey data, only four had average or better reliability.

Consumer Reports based its rankings on a survey of owners representing more than 300,000 vehicles from the 2000 through 2022 model years, with a few new 2023 models included. The rankings are based on problems with vehicles in the past year.","Hybrids are most reliable vehicles, Consumer Reports survey finds",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/11/15/business/hybrids-are-most-reliable-vehicles-consumer-reports-survey-finds/

PARIS (Reuters) - Paris is considering banning its 15,000 rental electric scooters due to concerns about public safety on the city's sidewalks, but operators are proposing a series of improvements in the hope of getting their licences renewed.

The Paris town council is considering not renewing the licences of the three operators - Lime, Dott and Tier - which expire in February 2023. Its vote is only consultative and the decision, expected in coming weeks, rests with Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo.

Deputy mayor David Belliard, a green party politician in charge of transport in Paris, told Le Parisien newspaper last week that the nuisances caused by scooters now outweigh the advantages to the city.

""In terms of security, environment and the sharing of public space, it would be complicated to continue,"" he said.

In 2021, 24 people died in scooter-related accidents in France, including one in Paris. This year, Paris registered 337 accidents with e-scooters and similar vehicles in the first eight months of the year, from 247 over the same period in 2021.

Cities worldwide are tightening regulations on e-scooters, limiting the number of operators and limiting their speed and the number of areas where they can park.

Electric scooters accessed through smartphone apps have operated in Paris since 2018, but following complaints about their anarchic deployment, Paris in 2020 cut the number of operators to three. It gave them a three-year contract, required that scooters' speed be capped at 20 km/hour and imposed designated scooter parking areas.

Operators have offered further regulations, including ID checks to make sure users are over 18, fixing licence plates to scooters so police can identify traffic offenders, and preventing the carrying of more than one passenger.

""If Paris accepts our proposals, it would become the city with the strictest scooter regulation in the world,"" Lime public affairs director Garance Lefevre said.

The three firms say scooters provide a low-carbon alternative to crowded metros and polluting cars.

The new shots show the undisguised exterior and interior of the vehicle, the latter of which sports tech borrowed from newer vehicles like the all-electric Lyriq.

The photos, posted to social media and found on numerous sites including Sohu, show a model still under construction, whose interior is missing a steering wheel, in one shot. That only serves to better show off the wide, Cadillac Escalade-like multimedia dual-screen setup.

Designed to look like a single monitor when off, the unit combines two screens, one behind the steering wheel that serves as a digital instrument cluster, and another to the right, which is the infotainment screen.

Lower down, on the center console, a multimedia control system that incorporates a control knob, touchpad, and scroll wheel has been added. This, too, is reminiscent of other recent Cadillacs, such as the Lyriq.

The photos also show a variety of fine materials, such as wood grain and leather dyed in a variety of colors. This suggests that Cadillac is working to ensure that the second-generation CT6 lives up to its clientele’s luxurious expectations.

Outside, meanwhile, previous spy photographs show that the luxury sedan will feature evolutionary updates for the 2024 model year, which these new uncamouflaged shots only serve to confirm. A wider grille, thinner headlights, and a variety of other updates will make the sedan look more refined and bring its design more in line with recently unveiled vehicles.

We anticipate that the model will be shifted onto a new VSS-R architecture, and it is expected to be offered only in China, since the line was discontinued in 2020 in America. Local reports suggest that it will be offered with an updated 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four and 3.0-liter turbocharged V6.

466,Better-than-expected inflation data gave these stocks a lift.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/709530/gettyimages-1284782728.jpg,motley fool,"What happened

Shares of electric vehicle (EV) stocks were rising today as investors processed the latest inflation data, which was better than expected.

Investors are hoping slowing inflation could spur the Federal Reserve to slow the pace and intensity of its interest rate hikes. As a result, market indexes were inching higher today with the S&P 500 up by 0.25% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.8% by midafternoon.

EV investors were enthusiastic as well, with Nio's (NIO 5.50%) share price climbing 2.8%, EV charging company ChargePoint Holdings (CHPT 4.18%) rising 3.6%, and EV battery company QuantumScape (QS 3.81%) jumping 6.1% as of 1:50 p.m. ET.

So what

Today, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Producer Price Index (PPI) index data for October, which is a measure of wholesale inflation, showing that the index rose 0.2% for the month, lower than the 0.4% increase that economists were estimating.

The PPI data comes on the heels of better-than-expected consumer price data reported last week, both of which are causing investors to be encouraged that inflation's rapid rise is finally slowing.

EV investors may be particularly interested in slowing inflation because rising prices for vehicles and materials have weighed down on the industry lately.

QuantumScape and ChargePoint are both U.S.-based companies, so any indication that inflation could be easing is welcomed news. If inflation slows down enough the Federal Reserve could pull back on the rate and intensity of its interest rate hikes.

Investors have been very worried that rising rates could spur a potential recession.

Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard gave investors some hope yesterday when she said in an interview with Bloomberg News, ""I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of rate increases.""

The next Fed meeting is scheduled for mid-December. Some investors are anticipating a 50-basis-point hike at the meeting, down from the Fed's 75-basis-point hikes at its last four meetings.

Additionally, shares of China-based Nio may be getting an extra boost today after U.S. President Joe Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday, their first in-person meeting since Biden became president.

China and the U.S. have experienced rising tensions lately so any indication that the two countries are more open to diplomatic talks may be encouraging Nio investors. Nio said recently that it wants to enter the U.S. automotive market in late 2025.

Now what

While inflation data may appear to be moving in the right direction, investors should also be cautious about getting too optimistic too quickly.

It's likely that the Federal Reserve will continue its path of interest rate hikes for a while. Inflation is still at a near 40-year high and the latest data likely isn't yet good enough to cause the Fed to completely reverse course, though the intensity of hikes could slow.

In the meantime, there could be more short-term volatility from Nio, QuantumScape, and ChargePoint as investors try to determine where inflation is going and how the Fed will respond to it.","Why Nio, ChargePoint, and QuantumScape Stocks Rocketed Higher Today",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/why-nio-chargepoint-and-quantumscape-stocks-rocket/
467,(Most) lithium stocks have had a good year so far -- but all good things come to an end.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/709504/1-big-red-arrow-going-down-over-a-stock-chart.jpg,motley fool,"What happened

Tuesday is turning into a miserable day to own lithium stocks, as shares of Lithium Americas (LAC 2.52%), Livent (LTHM 1.93%), and Albemarle (ALB 0.29%) tumble in response to a negative report on lithium prospects from mining stock analysts at Goldman Sachs.

As of 11:15 a.m. ET, Lithium Americas shares are down 3.5%, Livent is off 6.2%, and Albemarle is leading the whole sector lower with an 8.4% loss.

So what

Let's start with the good news: According to Goldman Sachs, demand growth for lithium over the past few years has been ""massive."" Problem is, the ""supply response"" to this increased demand has been even more massive.

Goldman's report shows that demand for lithium to build the batteries to power electric vehicles (and to a lesser extent, other battery-powered devices) began to exceed available supplies of the metal around mid-2020. Currently, analysts estimate that there's about a 100,000 ton annual gap between the lithium carbonate the world needs to build its batteries and the amount that lithium miners like Lithium Americas, Livent, and Albemarle are able to produce in a given year.

This has been good news for lithium producers so far, enabling miners to both sell more unit volume of lithium and charge higher prices for the lithium they produce -- turbocharging sales numbers. Livent, for example, grew its revenue more than 120% in the most recent quarter, and Albemarle's sales were up more than 150%. (So far at least, Lithium Americas has been the odd man out in this bull run, as the lithium start-up isn't yet producing appreciable levels of lithium from its operations.)

Now what

So that's the good news. Now here's the bad: As lithium miners ramp up production to capitalize on strong demand, the gap between supply and demand is narrowing, and quickly. As soon as early next year, Goldman Sachs predicts that lithium supply and demand will be back in balance. And as 2023 progresses, analysts see production of lithium rocketing past levels that even growing demand can support. Indeed, by 2025, Goldman sees a completely different sort of gap arriving -- one in which lithium miners are producing approximately 400,000 tons more lithium than demand can support.

What are the implications of this analysis? If the analysis is right, then by 2025, the supply-demand shift is going to dramatically erode the profitability of lithium mining companies, driving down profits -- and potentially even causing losses -- at companies like Albemarle and Livent that are currently profitable. At unprofitable Lithium Americas, meanwhile, the situation could be even worse. There it's a race simply to get operations up and running and earn any profit at all before lithium prices begin a slow collapse sometime in the next few months.

Admittedly, as the saying goes, ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."" Goldman Sachs could very well be wrong about its prediction for the lithium market over the next three years -- but it could also be right. Caveat investor.","Why Lithium Americas, Livent, and Albemarle Stocks Fell Sharply on Tuesday",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/why-lithium-americas-livent-and-albemarle-stocks-f/

Henkel has been recognized with an...,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://media.zenfs.com/en/accesswire.ca/1f8bc38efd5ff437d013001b45ebeea2,yahoo entertainment,"MADISON HEIGHTS, MI / ACCESSWIRE / November 15, 2022 / More than 4 million vehicles are pretreated annually with Henkel's portfolio of thin-film metal pretreatment processes. Henkel has been recognized with an award from the Suppliers Partnership for the Environment for demonstrating outstanding innovation in an advanced manufacturing process leading to significant environmental and economic impact. The award recognizes the use of the PALLUMINA™ thin-film process on the 2021 Toyota Tacoma and Tundra.

Metal pretreatment is an essential part of vehicle production, as it enables paint adhesion to the vehicle body, while preventing corrosion. Henkel's innovative thin-film process reduces the manufacturing steps of a conventional metal pretreatment process from seven down to just four. Key environmental advancements include the elimination of heavy metal phosphates, such as zinc phosphate, nickel phosphate and manganese phosphate, the reduction of up to a 90 percent in sludge generation and a significant reduction in water usage.

The process uses a metal-oxide conversion coating versus a zinc phosphate-based conversion coating, significantly decreasing sludge generation by reducing the need for metal etching and the use of fluoride additives. In turn, the need for regular tank clean outs is reduced and annual chemical clean outs are completely eliminated - reducing sludge disposal costs and labor costs.

""Today's automotive OEMs are looking for solutions that enhance sustainability, while reducing costs, simplifying processes and delivering high performance,"" said Cris Naida, Vice President Automotive OEM Americas, Henkel. ""Henkel's thin-film processes deliver on all of these - offering an exceptional solution for paint shop processes.""

The PALLUMINA thin-film process is effective across all major metals and can process up to 100 percent aluminum, further enabling the use of this lightweight metal. Use of aluminum is expected to double from approximately 13 percent on passenger cars and trucks today to 26 percent by 2040, according to the Center for Automotive Research. Aluminum plays an essential role in improving fuel economy standards of internal combustion engine vehicles and off-setting added weight of Battery Electric Vehicles.

It grew 20% in October, to almost 29,000 units. That could mean that the easing of the chip crisis is making itself noticed in the overall market. In fact, it even grew faster than the Dutch plugin vehicle (PEV) market, which was up by only 17% year over year (YoY) last month. Still, pure electrics, which grew 12% YoY, represented 22% of all new vehicle sales. Plugin hybrids (PHEVs) were up 28% in October. Although, many of the 3,350 PHEVs registered in October are just one model — the Lynk & Co 01 PHEV represented 21% of all PHEV sales last month. Regardless, PHEVs represented 12% of the country’s auto market in October.

Overall, the year-to-date (YTD) market share for plugin vehicles was stable at 32% (21% BEV). Highlighting an ongoing shift in the market toward BEVs, they had 66% of plugin sales in September, up from the 64% average of 2022.

Lynk & Co’s 01 PHEV crossover is becoming something of a case study in the Netherlands. It won October’s best seller race, its third consecutive Best Seller title in Dutch lands. The model achieved 707 registrations last month, allowing it to end September in 7th place in the overall auto market. Paradoxically, the Lynk & Co model was one of only two PHEV models in the top 20, with the other being the BMW 3 Series PHEV, which ended the month in … #20. Now, imagine if Lynk & Co had a truly competitive (as in, BEV) model!

(Speaking of this, it is rumored that the successful Zeekr 001 fastback-ish could land in Europe next year … as a Lynk & Co? To be continued.)

Next, we have a few surprises, with the Lynk & Co Swedish cousin Volvo XC40 EV jumping into the runner-up spot. It got a year-best 521 registrations. The BEV version represented 67% of all XC40 registrations in this market last month, which added to the 163 units of the PHEV version (21% of all deliveries). We find that 88% of all Volvo XC40 registered in the Netherlands in October had a plug, with these two versions contributing to the Swedish SUV’s decisive 3rd place finish in the overall Dutch market.

Another surprise landed in #3 in the plugin ranking, with the stylish Opel Mokka EV scoring a record 300 registrations last month. The EV version represented 60% of all units sold in the overall market, thus helping the small crossover to end the month in #13.

In 4th, we have the BMW i4, which finally seems to have found its mojo (or maybe BMW got enough components to make more units?). The German make placed three models in the top 20, as the iX3 ended the month in #13, thanks to a year best score of 231 registrations, and the BMW 3 Series PHEV was #20, with 171 registrations, its best result in almost 6 years! It seems BMW is back on track. Although, we are still waiting for the iX SUV to post some convincing scores.

The #5 VW ID.4 also impressed, with 292 registrations, a new year best. That allowed the German crossover to end the month as the best selling MEB-platform model, beating the #7 Skoda Enyaq, #15 VW ID.3, and #16 Audi Q4 e-tron.

Other models were shining in the top 10 as well, like the Polestar 2 ending the month in 9th thanks to 254 registrations, a new year best. Its parent company, Volvo, is looking to make up for lost time when it comes to BEVs. In fact, besides the #2 spot of the Volvo XC40 EV, its other BEV model, the sportier C40 crossover, also scored a year-best performance in October, 172 registrations. It seems the Volvo vessel is now going full speed ahead towards full electrics. The #12 Renault Megane EV had a record month, with 236 registrations, benefiting from the production ramp up of the French hatchback-that-thinks-is-a-crossover.

Outside the top 20, a few models deserve mention, like the Opel Corsa EV scoring 148 registrations, underlining Opel’s great month. Besides the Mokka EV’s record score and the consistent performance of the Corsa EV, Opel even had the Zafira EV van-with-windows-turned-MPV score 56 registrations, and speaking of Stellantis vans turned into MPVs, the midsize people carrier Fiat Ulysse had a record 86 registrations last month, allowing the Italian make to become less dependent on the 500e’s fortunes.

In Volkswagen Group’s stable, two more MEB-platform models could join the table soon — the Cupra Born (145 registrations) and Volkswagen ID.5 (110 registrations). Volvo also saw some of its PHEV model deliveries surge. The midsize S/V60 PHEV twins reached 144 registrations, their best result in 21 months, and even the veteran XC90 PHEV had its best score since last January (94 registrations), which could mean that the component shortage is easing at Volvo as well.

A final reference goes out to the Nissan LEAF, which had 97 deliveries, its best score in 8 months. It seems the veteran model is not being affected by the arrival of the Nissan ARIYA (98 registrations).

Looking at the 2022 ranking, the Skoda Enyaq lost the leadership position to the Lynk & Co 01 PHEV, and despite being only 47 units behind the Chinese crossover, the truth is that the Czech model has lost momentum recently, while the Lynk & Co model now seems unbeatable.

The Climber of the Month was the Volvo XC40 EV. It surged five spots, into 8th, and could reach 7th next month — the Audi Q4 e-Tron is just 2 units away! By the way, if we were to add the BEV and PHEV versions of the Volvo XC40, the Swedish model would be the runner-up model in this table, with 4,459 registrations.

But it is in the second half of the table that most of the action is.

The BMW i4 jumped four positions, to #13. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 was up to #14. And the Polestar 2 climbed one position, to #17. What do all three of these models have in common? All are midsize cars*. And who isn’t on this table? The Tesla Model 3…. (*Although Hyundai markets its Ioniq 5 as a crossover, it clearly is not — it’s an XXL-hatchback, and a beautiful one at that. But the truth is that the Korean make only does this because crossovers are trending. And they are not the only ones doing this — remember when Chevrolet tried to sell the regular Bolt as a crossover?)

Finally, we have two “new” models on the table. The VW ID.3 returned to the top 20, in #19, and its sportier, spicier (and better looking) Spanish sibling, the Cupra Born, joined the best seller table in #20. As a result, there are now five MEB-platform models in this top 20.

Interestingly, these last entries in the table were at the expense of two PHEVs (the Ford Kuga PHEV and Volvo XC60 PHEV). So, now we have a year-to-date top 20 with only two plugin hybrid models!

In the manufacturer ranking, Volvo (9.6%, up from 9.1%) returned to the leadership position — which had been briefly occupied by Kia (8.8%, down from 9.1%). The Korean brand must now be more worried about keeping 3rd placed BMW behind it, now that only 49 units separate the two brands.

Meanwhile, #4 Peugeot (6.9%, down from 7.3%) keeps on losing share and Mercedes (5.9%) is the new #5 after surpassing Skoda (5.8%, down from 6.2%). Mercedes has benefited from its looong lineup to reach the top 5.

Below Škoda, we have two other brands from Volkswagen Group. A rising Volkswagen (5.4%, up from 4.9%) has reached the 7th position … at the expense of Audi (5.3%, down 0.2%).

As for OEMs, Volkswagen Group (20%, down 0.3%) is comfortable in the leadership position, something that runner-up Stellantis (17.4%) cannot say, as #3 Geely–Volvo has seen its share grow closer (16.8% now vs. 16.1% a month ago) thanks to brilliant performances from all of its brands. If this trend continues, we might even get a crossover before the end of the year.

4th placed Hyundai–Kia saw its share drop in October from 13.5% to 13.0%. 5th placed BMW Group (10.9%) seems to have bottomed out after falling sales. BMW Group’s transition into a more BEV-heavy lineup is now starting to bear fruit, and the company must be hoping the upcoming iX1 crossover becomes a sales success.

471,"Last year GM sold 25,000 EVs at a loss but intends to overtake Tesla by 2025.",electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GM-Plants-1.jpg,carscoops,"While electric vehicles are now a fundamental part of our future, the all-important question of profitability has often been asked by critics and probed by industry analysts alike. It’s no secret that, generally speaking, eking out profit margins is a harder ask with a battery electric vehicle than with one powered by internal combustion.

But GM’s CEO Mary Bara is apparently unfazed, as she plans to tell investors that the company’s EV program is expected to turn a profit from 2025 — that’s according to Bloomberg, who cites unnamed sources close to the company.

General Motors has shown a certain bullishness with its electric vehicle strategy, with the company previously predicting that it would overtake Tesla as the top EV manufacturer by 2025. That alone is a Herculean task, considering that GM didn’t manage to crack 10 percent of Tesla’s EV numbers last year, with just 25,000 sales compared to Tesla’s 350,000.

Read: Hope Combusts Eternal: Renault And Geely Believe Gasoline Car Sales Will Keep Growing

This year’s EV sales are not much better, at around 44,000 units. To add insult to injury, each of these has been at a loss. The transition to EVs for legacy automakers is by no means inexpensive, with investments in technology, production, and raw materials meaning that ICE models will continue to fund the development of EVs for now.

However, in favor of GM is scale and affordability, with a host of new models planned for the following years. Things will kick off in earnest with the launch of the 2024 Silverado EV pickup, 2024 Blazer EV SUV, and 2024 Equinox crossover — the latter coming in at around $35,000. GM is also leveraging its extensive network of plants and existing suppliers to increase production and lower costs when it comes to EVs.

While profit per unit may end up being less than Tesla, Bank of America analyst John Murphy forecasts GM could pass Tesla in EV sales in 2025 simply because GM will offer more models and have more production by then. This could also be impacted by the fact that the long-mooted, more affordable Tesla Model 2 is nowhere to be seen either.

Battery costs have been slashed too. GM’s product development chief Doug Parks is expected to elaborate on how the General’s new battery tech will help keep money in investors’ pockets. GM’s Ultium battery tech is said to be 60 percent cheaper to build than what was fitted to the Chevy Bolt, while a second-generation battery will reduce costs by a further 40 percent.

Other potential avenues for increasing profitability lie in GM’s ongoing software development, which includes the semi-autonomous Super Cruise hands-free driver-assist program and Ultra Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel over more miles and in more driving conditions.

474,Elon Musk's first few weeks of Twitter ownership have been far from smooth sailing.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Elon-Musk_2.jpg,carscoops,"Elon Musk’s troubles with Twitter continued late last week when a verified Tesla account began posting about the electric automaker.



Under Musk’s leadership, Twitter recently altered its Blue verification check mark service, now requiring users to pay a monthly fee of $8 to create an account with a check mark. While Musk appears very proud of this idea to generate revenue, it has led to countless accounts being established which mimic the official accounts of some of the world’s largest corporations.

Read: Elon Musk Wants Carmakers To Resume Twitter Advertising

On Friday, an account by the name of @TeslaReal received a Blue check mark and began posting as if it was the carmaker. It’s posts received tens of thousands of likes in a matter of hours. One post proved particularly popular, Bloomberg reports.

“We will be offering 10 thousand vehicles to support the Ukrainian military,” it said. “Our cars are the most advanced explosive devices on the market. Everyone’s talking about Twitter going up in flames but our cars did that before it was cool.”

Notably, the account was marked as a parody but it certainly could have confused some unsuspecting users. At the time of writing, the account had been suspended for violating Twitter’s rules.

Tesla is far from the only company that a Twitter user has mimicked. An account posing as pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly & Co. recently made a tweet proclaiming that insulin was now going to be offered for free. This tweet received 10,000 likes before being removed and promoted the company’s share price to drop from $368 to $346, erasing billions from its market cap.

In an email sent to Twitter staff last Wednesday, Musk said suspending accounts like these was a priority.

“Over the next few days, the absolute top priority is finding and suspending any verified bots/trolls/spam,” he wrote.",Trolls Create Verified Tesla Account On Twitter As Musk’s Troubles Grow,https://www.carscoops.com/2022/11/trolls-create-verified-tesla-account-on-twitter-as-musks-troubles-grow/

The high-speed run, which was captured on surveillance cameras, shows the vehicle pulling to the side of the road before suddenly gaining speed and weaving through a road in Chaozhou, Guangdong province, barely missing some pedestrians on Nov. 5.

The 55-year-old driver, identified as a former truck driver named Zhan, reaches a top speed of 123 mph as the car knocks a cyclist from their bike and drives into a delivery vehicle before crashing into a building.

Zhan told local media that he tried to slow down in front of his family’s store. However, the vehicle allegedly kept accelerating even after he stepped on the brake pedal.

“I felt the car was malfunctioning, so I pressed the park button, but it began to accelerate,” Zhan reportedly told Dahe Daily. “Suddenly, I was racing ahead, and I tried the brakes repeatedly. There were others on the road. A motorcycle was ahead of me, so I swerved the steering wheel.”

“Because I was a truck driver, I knew what to do if ever my brakes failed on a slope, so after I lost control of the car, I immediately began searching for an obstacle to crash into,” he added. “I continued to try the brakes to see whether they would start working and stop the car. I was thinking about where to crash, but my reactions couldn’t keep up with the speed.”

According to reports, a motorcyclist and a high school student were killed in the incident, while three others were severely injured. The driver has reportedly survived.

However, the Elon Musk-owned car manufacturer has denied the claims. Tesla provided data indicating that the brake pedal was not applied during the high-speed run, adding that the car’s brake lights remained off in the video.

“The vehicle’s electronic throttle was depressed deeply for long periods and held at 100 percent for a time,” Tesla wrote in a statement. “There was no braking action during the whole process. Please also do not listen to rumors, and do not spread unconfirmed information.”

Safety experts reportedly believe that the driver could have mistaken the brake pedal for the accelerator.

The incident remains under investigation. Traffic police have ruled out driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol after conducting a toxicology test on Zhan. However, authorities are still awaiting an independent assessment.

The car manufacturer will be actively providing “any necessary aid” to the local police, which may reportedly involve a third-party investigator.

The G20 is a global forum that includes 19 countries and the European Union, together representing the world’s 20 largest economies.

The main goals of the G20 Summit are to address issues with the global economy, including financial stability, climate change, and overall sustainability.

This year the G20 Summit is being held in Bali, Indonesia, where President Joko Widodo called for 100% of the government’s transportation used during the event to be electric vehicles.

In addition to electric cars, several high profile electric two-wheeler companies have been called on to supply electric motorcycles and mopeds for use at the Summit. Companies including Zero Motorcycles, Energica, Gogoro and NIU have all provided fleets for official use.

Indonesian Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi (center) on a Gogoro electric scooter

A representative from Taiwanese battery swapping giant and electric scooter manufacturer Gogoro explained to Electrek that the company jointly deployed 30 Gogoro SmartScooters and a GoStation battery swap center along with Indonesian Partner Electrum.

The scooters each use a pair of Gogoro’s famous green and black swappable batteries, allowing officials to ride the scooters until the batteries are nearly empty, then swap in freshly charged batteries in seconds.

That allows the scooters to stay on the road continuously instead of needing to stop for a multi-hour charge.

The move was likely facilitated by Gogoro’s presence in the country via a Jakarta pilot with Gojek, with electrum being created as a Gojek joint venture.

Electric scooters are growing in popularity in Indonesia, a country that has wholly embraced the benefits of two-wheeled vehicles over larger four-wheeled cars and trucks.

In fact, Indonesia has set a goal of putting 2 million electric motorcycles and scooters on the country’s roads by 2025.

They are now 300 e-scooters closer thanks to NIU’s electric scooters are also being used by officials at the event. The company provided 300 GOVA series electric scooters to the Indonesian National Police for use at the summit.

NIU electric scooters ready for the G20 Summit

Ahead of the event, California-based Zero Motorcycles announced that it has provided a fleet of nearly 300 electric motorcycles to the Indonesian National Police and National Armed Forces.

According to CEO Harun Sjech of PT, Elektrick Motoriz Global, the Indonesian Zero importer:

Meeting the ambitious zero-emissions goals set by President Joko Widodo was made possible thanks to the excellent partnership with both Zero motorcycles and the Indonesian Government, both organizations that are highly motivated to be leaders in transitioning away from fossil fuels. We are extremely proud to have delivered all of these motorcycles and we look forward to building on our relationships with both Zero and the Indonesian government.

The fleet of nearly 300 motorcycles provided by Zero is mostly comprised of the Zero DSRP (Police) model, which is available exclusively to global fleet operators and authority forces.

Zero’s large delivery also includes SR/S and SR/F models that had been modified for tactical use by the Indonesian security apparatus.

As CEO of Zero Motorcycles Sam Paschel added:

We applaud President Widodo and the entire Indonesian Government for their clear vision, admirable climate leadership goals, and for the speed with which they sought to equip and train their staff for the G20 Summit. The G20 is an extremely important platform and being able to deliver a large fleet of reliable electric motorcycles for the event is a credit to our amazing team, and a benefit for the entire world.

Italian electric motorcycle manufacturer Energica also announced recently that it received an order of 88 Energica EsseEsse9+ electric motorcycles from the Indonesian National Police ahead of the G20 Summit.

Energica CEO Livia Cevolini underscored the importance of electric motorcycles leading the charge, saying:

When G20 delegates arrive in Bali, they will be welcomed and escorted by a security detail riding Energica bikes. That means their first experience will be seeing zero-emission, high-performance vehicles in action. My hope is that this experience sticks with each delegate throughout the summit and in all discussions around climate change and transportation.

Electric motorcycles outfitted for police use at global summits is a growing trend. The COP26 summit used a fleet of Harley-Davidson LiveWire electric motorcycles for official police patrol use.

Outside of flashy summits, electric motorcycles are finding homes in an increasing number of police departments and military units.

US police departments have turned to Zero Motorcycles for years, though low-cost electric motorcycles are now getting their turn in the police spotlights as well.

In some cases, US police departments have turned to high-power electric bicycles that border on electric motorbike performance.

Even conventional, low-power electric bicycles have proven popular with an increasing number of police departments looking to supplement their patrol cars with lighter electric two-wheelers that can penetrate deeper into city alleyways, community parks, and other areas normally off limits to larger police vehicles.","More electric motorcycles take charge at G20 in Bali, escorting electric motorcades",https://electrek.co/2022/11/15/electric-motorcycles-zero-g20-summit-bali-indonesia/

In-Vehicle AI Robot Market COVID-19 Analysis

In-vehicle AI robot market growth has been hampered by widespread lockdowns amid an alarming public health emergency brought on by the spread of a novel coronavirus, as the automotive industry experienced a sharp decline in sales during the period. Significant supply-chain disruptions in a number of important nations caused the market to become unstable for a while. Although the market has been seen to recover since the middle of 2021, the outlook for the automotive manufacturing industry in several important regions, including Europe, has not been favorable. Global market growth for in-vehicle AI robots has slowed as a result of this. There were additional unanticipated events, such as a global shortage of semiconductor chips, in addition to the lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic's surge and its detrimental effects on the global supply chain. Due to the fact that modern vehicles are outfitted with numerous electronics systems for optimum performance, semiconductor chip shortages have had a significant effect on the auto industry. Semiconductor chips are the foundation of all electronics devices. Despite the rise in vehicle demand, a lack of semiconductor chips has forced OEMs to stop production lines or drop some well-liked features, like heated seats, from their vehicles. Automakers are removing some AI features from vehicles in order to avoid delays in vehicle delivery to customers, which has adverse effects on the market for in-vehicle AI robots. The price of semiconductor chips is also skyrocketing amid an unbalanced supply-demand ratio, which is pushing up the overall cost of vehicles with in-vehicle AI robots. The global market for in-vehicle AI robots is thus severely constrained by a lack of raw materials.

483,The Rimac Nevera proved to be faster than the original Bugatti Veyron!.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Rimac-Nevera-Top-Speed-Record-main.jpg,carscoops,"The Rimac Nevera is the fastest production EV in the world after hitting 256 mph (412 km/h) on the track with test driver Miro Zrnčević behind the wheel. This is an incredible achievement for a road legal vehicle with a fully electric powertrain, showing that Rimac is ahead of its rivals in terms of performance.

The record attempt took place in the Automotive Testing Papenburg oval track located in Germany, which is famous for its two 2.5-mile (4 km) long straights. The hypercar was set to the top speed mode which reduces drag while keeping downforce at appropriate levels to ensure stability.

Read: SSC Tuatara Hits 295 Mph In 2.3 Miles, Breaks Its Own Record

The Nevera came out of the banking at an impressive 155 mph (250 km/h), reaching the targeted 256 mph (412 km/h) before the end of the straight. According to Rimac, the top speed – now confirmed by a Racelogic V-Box high-precision GPS measurement device – was simulated during the development of the C-Two prototype.

Notably, this was the highest recorded top speed at the Automotive Testing Papenburg. To put it in perspective, the new EV top speed record is higher than the 253 mph (407 km/h) set by the ICE-powered Bugatti Veyron in 2005, although much lower than the mind-blowing 304.77 mph (490.48 km/h) set by the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ in 2019. Currently, the official record for the fastest production vehicle belongs to the SSC Tuatara with an average speed of 295 mph (474.8 km/h) in opposite directions.

Miro Zrnčević, Rimac’s Chief Test and Development Driver, probably knows the Nevera better than anyone else in the world. Following the successful attempt, he said: “To travel at 412 km/h, or 256 mph, means traveling at a third of the speed of sound…I’ve driven Nevera since it first turned a wheel and to see the perfectly honed car that is today is a really emotional moment. The most important thing I have learned during the top-speed attempt is how composed and stable the car was – confirming that our aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics teams have done an amazing job”.

The Nevera was fitted on Michelin Cup 2R tires that had been checked by a Michelin technician prior to the record run. There were no modifications compared to customer vehicles, other than removing the 219 mph (352 km/h) speed limiter that is set to protect the tires. Still, Rimac says that the full 256 mph (412 km/h) top speed can be achieved by all of the Neveras in “special customer events with the support from the Rimac team and under controlled conditions”.

As a refresher, the Rimac Nevera is fitted with quad electric motors producing a combined 1,887 hp (1,408 kW / 1,914 PS) and 1,740 lb-ft (2,360 Nm) of torque, connected to a 120 kWh battery. Besides being the record holder for the highest top speed amongst EVs, the Rimac Nevera is also the fastest accelerating production vehicle, running an 8.582-second quarter mile in 2021.",Rimac Nevera Breaks EV Top Speed Record With 256 MPH Run,https://www.carscoops.com/2022/11/rimac-nevera-breaks-ev-top-speed-record-with-256-mph-run/
484,The Porsche Macan EV is expected to debut in 2024 with enough power and torque to make it a spirited driving machine.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/11/Macan-EV.jpeg,cleantechnica,"The electric Macan is an important car for Porsche. Why? Because it is the best selling of all Porsche models, so getting the EV version right is a really big deal for the company. That process is well underway, and while the new car won’t be in showrooms quite as soon as the company hoped because of software issues, it is expected to go on sale in 2024.

This week, Antoon Janssen, Porsche powertrain manager for the Macan line, told Autocar that the Macan EV, which is based on the new Premium Platform Electric chassis, will be the sportiest car in its class. It will use a pair of permanently excited electric motors — one per axle — similar to those used in the Porsche Taycan, but heavily reworked to boost power density and efficiency.

The new motors feature a “double V” magnet arrangement and switch from using a silicon semiconductor to silicon carbide which reduces switching losses in the motors’ pulse inverters. The result is a combined power of 450 kW (603 hp) and 1000 Nm (738 lb ft) of torque delivered to all four wheels. Rear-wheel drive is also possible on the PPE platform, said Janssen, although this will initially only be used to decouple the front motor when cruising to reduce rolling resistance (and conserve energy).

Dynamics have also been a point of emphasis for the Macan EV. Model chassis manager Dominik Hartmann confirmed that it will have a ‘performance rear axle’, with the motor mounted as far back as possible. This gives a weight distribution of 48% at the front and 52% at the rear to maximize traction.

The Macan EV will be the first model to receive Porsche-designed two valve dampers which are said to enhance ride comfort because they enable independent adjustment via the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) system. This will also lower the suspension at certain speeds to improve the car’s aerodynamic profile and reduce energy consumption.

To improve maneuverability, the maximum steering angle of the front wheels has been increased by 15% compared to the current Macan and rear-wheel steering up to 5 degrees is available at speeds below 50 mph. The most expensive versions of the Macan EV will also get an electronic locking differential mounted at the rear axle, which is designed to improve torque vectoring capabilities.

Every Porsche Macan EV will be equipped with a 100 kWh battery, which Porsche says is the optimum size for minimizing journey times. Thanks to the software incorporated into the battery package, the battery can be split into two 400 volt halves to lower charging times.

Janssen also confirmed that the PPE platform can be extended to fit more than the Macan’s 12 prismatic battery modules. This suggests the Porsche Cayenne EV, which reportedly will also use the PPE platform, could have a larger battery to compete with the Mercedes EQS SUV.

Porsche expects 80% of its sales to be electric vehicles by 2030 with the Macan leading the way, and every one will be true to the Porsche tradition of spirited performance with exceptional comfort. The company has come a long way since the original Mission E prototype that became the Taycan.

Speaking at an event on Tuesday, Renault SA chairman Jean-Dominique Senard touted the Franco-Japanese alliance, which has been discussing ways to revamp the relationship.

The companies had initially set Tuesday as a deadline to hammer out a deal. However, the discussions have taken longer than originally expected due to Nissan's concerns about how its intellectual property rights can be protected as Renault forges new ties with China's Geely, sources have told Reuters.

Renault last week unveiled a sweeping overhaul of its businesses, saying it would set up a joint venture with Geely for gasoline engines and hybrid technology and spin off its electric vehicles unit next year. It wants Nissan to invest in the new electric unit.

The companies are also renegotiating their equity ties, which currently see Renault owning a controlling 43% of Nissan and the Japanese company holding only a 15% non-voting stake in Renault.

""Nothing is blocking"" the discussions, he told reporters after the event, declining to say when the alliance members would reach a deal and adding ""you will be informed on time.""

""As the chairman of this alliance, I've never lived such a warm atmosphere within the alliance and this bodes well for the future.""

The company uses the Man eTGE as a basis for its vans, converting each example from a battery-electric powertrain to hydrogen fuel-cell electric one using parts from Ballard Power Systems.

This boosts the eTGE’s range substantially; from the original 71.5 miles to First Hydrogen’s claimed 248-372 miles, this variance likely depending on conditions such as payload and speed.

First Hydrogen also cites reduced downtime as a key benefit of fuel cells, which take five minutes to fully refuel. In contrast, the battery-electric eTGE van takes 45 minutes to charge to 80% at its maximum rate of 40kW.

Such time savings are surely appealing to large fleets concerned with their logistics in a post-diesel world: sales of new petrol and diesel vans up to 3.5 tonnes will be banned from 2030, with those over 3.5 tonnes following five years later.

First Hydrogen’s converted vans were granted approval following a series of safety and performance tests at the Horiba Mira proving ground.

Nicholas Wrigley, chairman of First Hydrogen, said: “We're delighted with the initial performance of the First Hydrogen fuel-cell van. There's growing pressure on the transport sector to achieve zero-emission targets, which means operators, governments and investors are eager to see the power of hydrogen mobility in action. Using donor vehicles has enabled us to bring our first demonstrator vans to market quickly.”

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and other executives are scheduled to brief investors Thursday on the automaker's progress toward scaling up production capacity to deliver 1 million electric vehicles a year in North America by 2025.

Work is underway on new agreements to support higher levels of North American battery production, Sham Kunjur, GM's executive director for EV Raw Materials' Center of Excellence.

""Watch this space,"" Kunjur said. ""You'll start seeing more announcements.""

Securing more domestic capacity for cathode active materials is one priority, he said.

Kunjur said his organization is new within GM, and combines legal teams, merger and acquisition experts and treasury staff to work on joint ventures, equity investments and alliances to secure access to battery and magnet materials or production capacity.

Tesla took an early lead in developing in-house battery production in the United States with its first Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada.

Among established North American automakers, GM has moved the fastest to emulate Tesla's strategy of building a battery manufacturing network from lithium extraction to assembly of battery packs and cells. GM's Ultium LLC joint venture with LG Energy Solutions has announced plans for four North American battery plants.

New federal subsidy policies signed into law in August as part of the Inflation Reduction Act could turn that domestic battery supply chain into a federally funded boost for GM's bottom line.

The IRA's EV tax credits and subsidies are designed to support domestic EV manufacturing. They could move GM closer to making money on affordably priced electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox SUV, which will have a starting price of about $30,000, roughly half the price of a Tesla Model Y.

Story continues

The Inflation Reduction Act ties up to $3,750 per vehicle of federal tax credits to requirements that EV batteries be manufactured in North America using materials sourced in North America or from allied nations.

How much GM will reap in federal subsidies will depend on how technical rules are written by federal agencies. Analysts expect Tesla will harvest more overall than any rival through 2030.

""We'll ramp toward full qualification across the broad portfolio in 2 to 3 years as some of the different supply comes online in North America or in the United States,"" Barra said during a conference call on Oct. 25.

GM has announced 14 deals related to North American battery production since May 2021.

GM officials told Reuters the company has about 20 battery supply chain agreements in place, with more to come.

Federal subsidies will help GM and its rivals narrow the cost disadvantage new North American battery production operations will face in competition with Chinese battery producers, said Prabhakar Patil, a former executive at battery maker LG Chem.

""People who have a head start will have an advantage,"" Patil said. ""The question is how fast you can catch up.""

Planned for customer sales in 2026, the initial modern-day Scout is described on the website as possessing a “strong stance and upright posture reminiscent of classic Scout models”.

Depicted in a front-end view, it rides on large off-road tyres and appears to possess substantial ground clearance.

A high-set bonnet with distinctive contouring, square-shaped exterior mirrors, an upright glasshouse and roof rails – elements that typically distinguished the original line of Scout models produced between 1961 and 1980 – are also evident on the new SUV.

Volkswagen’s plans to resurrect the Scout brand were made official in May 2022. The Virginia-based car maker is headed by former CEO of Volkswagen USA, Scott Keogh, who says it plans to sell up to 250,000 cars annually by the end of the decade.

No details have been released on the technical aspects of the new line-up of Scout models.

In a previous statement, Volkswagen denied they would be based on the MEB platform used by other Volkswagen Group EVs, including the VW ID 4 and VW ID 5, saying they would receive their own dedicated EV platform.

Rumours have linked Scout with a possible technical tie-up with Ford. Volkswagen’s Commerical Vehicles division already co-operates with the company on the Amarok pick-up truck, which was designed, developed alongside the latest Ford Ranger. However, Volkswagen has so far denied any involvement between Scout and Ford. Together with the new website, Scout has also established a community forum and registry to “chronicle classic Scout vehicles, to connect owners and to share personal photos and stories”.",2026 Scout SUV teased on new company website,https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2026-scout-suv-teased-new-company-website

Every hour of the day and night, at this steel plant in Sweden’s far north, the metal pours out of a hole at the bottom of a massive, 90-metre-tall blast furnace. Equally relentless, a stream of carbon dioxide belches out of the top.

The CO 2 is a waste product of the coal that the blast furnace devours. For every tonne of iron that will go to make steel, this furnace produces 1.6 tonnes of CO 2 , says Martin Pei, chief technology officer at SSAB, the company that owns the plant here in Luleå. The world has hundreds of similar blast furnaces, most of them with larger emissions. Add other energy-intensive steps in the industry, and it becomes clear how steel-making causes 7% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions, comparable to the exhaust from all the world’s passenger vehicles combined, by some estimates.

But a few hundred metres away from the Luleå furnace is a smaller one that makes iron with much less carbon pollution. This pilot technology replaces coal with hydrogen, and releases only water vapour. “This is the new way to make steel, and with this, we can in principle eliminate all the carbon dioxide,” Pei says.

The hydrogen-to-steel route isn’t entirely pollution-free; other steps in converting iron to steel still emit some CO 2 , and the iron ore must be mined. Still, last year, this site produced the world’s first ‘green steel’, with the aid of hydrogen that was made using Sweden’s abundant low-carbon electricity, generated from hydropower, nuclear and wind. The pilot plant is owned by HYBRIT, a joint venture that SSAB formed in 2016 with Swedish utility company Vattenfall and LKAB, the national mining company.

Making steel green is just one of the ways that hydrogen is now expected to help decarbonize the world’s economy. Although some have touted hydrogen’s use as a transportation fuel, it’s unlikely to have much impact in that sector or in heating, for which batteries and electrical power already provide more efficient low-carbon solutions. Rather, hydrogen’s biggest contribution will be to clean up industrial processes, from producing plastics and fertilizers to refining hydrocarbons. These industries have conventionally been thought of as harder to decarbonize, and have received less attention from the media, investors and policymakers.

Hydrogen might find uses in energy production, too. Liquid fuels made from hydrogen might one day power air travel and shipping. And hydrogen could even help to decarbonize the electricity grid: excess solar or wind power could be diverted into making the gas, which could then be used in other industrial processes or simply to store energy. In this way, hydrogen is expected to act as a bridge between many different sectors of the economy.

Overhyping hydrogen as a fuel risks endangering net-zero goals

“Hydrogen is sort of unique because of its versatility in the ways you can produce it and in the ways in which you can use it,” says Dharik Mallapragada, a chemical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.

Policymakers anxious to reach net-zero emissions goals have begun a massive push for hydrogen, notably in the United States and the European Union. In some cases, they are subsidizing the price of low-carbon hydrogen; in others, handing out tax credits for hydrogen producers or for industries that use it.

Partly as a result, investment in hydrogen projects is experiencing a boom. The Hydrogen Council, an industry group in Brussels, estimates that the hundreds of large-scale hydrogen projects announced already amount to a possible investment of US$240 billion by 2030 — although so far, only one-tenth of these are fully completed deals. By 2050, the council thinks the market for hydrogen and hydrogen technologies will be worth $2.5 trillion per year.

Analysts now project that the world will see a five- to sevenfold increase in hydrogen production by mid-century (see ‘Hydrogen sources’). This should help to cut the world’s carbon footprint — but only if that hydrogen is itself obtained without adding to CO 2 emissions, as it is in the Luleå pilot.

Source: IEA World Energy Outlook 2022

Hype has surrounded hydrogen before. But the amount of money involved this time suggests to many experts that it really will take off. The transition needs no new technology, analysts say: it is already tried and tested, although scientific advances would help speed it up.

“The hydrogen revolution is happening — this time for real,” says Oleksiy Tatarenko, an economist at the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a sustainability think tank in Boulder, Colorado.

Where to begin?

Hydrogen production is already a sizeable — and polluting — industry. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that around 94 million tonnes (Mt) of the gas is made each year. Almost all of it comes from fossil fuels such as natural gas. Methane (CH 4 ) in natural gas reacts with oxygen to turn into hydrogen molecules and CO 2 . The latter is then vented into the atmosphere — 900 million tonnes of it each year, or more than 2% of world CO 2 emissions, comparable to the total annual emissions of Indonesia and the United Kingdom combined. Analysts refer to this polluting hydrogen as ‘grey’.

The hydrogen the world already makes is largely used for chemical processing steps in essential industries. It is mixed with nitrogen from the air to make ammonia (NH 3 ), for instance, an ingredient in fertilizer. Petrochemical refineries use hydrogen to remove sulfur from petroleum, or to break down some of petroleum’s larger hydrocarbons into smaller ones. And in the chemical industry, hydrogen goes into making massive amounts of products, such as methanol (CH 3 OH), which in turn is used in the synthesis of countless other chemical commodities.

Scientists welcome ‘enormous’ US climate bill — but call for stronger action

“Before we position hydrogen as the solution for climate change, we first have to deal with hydrogen as a problem in climate change,” said Michael Liebreich, an energy consultant and chief executive of Liebreich Associates in London, in a keynote speech at the World Hydrogen Congress in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in October.

Some of the CO 2 released by making hydrogen from fossil fuels could be captured and stored underground, in deep geological reservoirs. Hydrogen decarbonized in this way is dubbed ‘blue’. But critics of blue hydrogen point out that it doesn’t prevent all CO 2 emissions, and that making blue hydrogen means continuing to extract natural gas, which comes with its own environmental downsides.

Another way to make hydrogen can be almost completely carbon-free. This is the 200-year-old technique of water electrolysis: electrolysers extract the H from H 2 O by running an electric current between catalyst-plated electrodes. If the energy used to power this process is renewable, the resulting product is called green hydrogen. Green hydrogen has the potential to be zero-emission, or at least close to it.

A crucial factor in determining the speed of the switch to clean hydrogen will be the cost of electrolysers. The IEA, clean-energy analysts BloombergNEF and other organizations predict that this could fall rapidly — dropping by more than two-thirds by 2030 — as electrolysers are made in increasingly automated assembly lines, rather than built by hand.

This is why analysts predict that the cost of making green hydrogen will drop from around $5 per kilogram now, to $1 per kg in the future, even without subsidies such as tax breaks. That would make it competitive with grey hydrogen, which can be made for less than $1 per kg (when wars don’t raise the price of natural gas, as has occurred in Europe). Even so, multiple studies predict that as demand booms, a large proportion of hydrogen demand will need to be fulfilled by blue hydrogen for decades to come.

The transformation will require huge amounts of renewable energy. If electrolysers were 100% efficient, it would take more than 3,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity from renewable sources each year just to replace the grey hydrogen used today with green hydrogen; in reality, the electricity required is more likely to be above 4,500 TWh. That is comparable to what the United States generates in a year. What’s more, the IEA envisions a future in which clean hydrogen’s annual electricity requirements rise to 14,800 TWh, in its scenario of a net-zero-emissions world by mid-century.

Still, clean energy is growing at a remarkable pace. By 2024, for instance, BloombergNEF projects that the world is expected to have the capacity to produce almost 1 TW of photovoltaic panels each year: that alone could meet one-seventh of today’s annual electricity demand. Overall, the world’s low-emissions electricity supply is already set to more than triple by mid-century, says the IEA — although even more aggressive expansion is needed for a net-zero world in 2050 (see go.nature.com/3nxtvhj).

Steeling up

Of all of industry’s carbon spewers, steel is one of the largest — and it is the sector where hydrogen could have the biggest impact. People had tried to use hydrogen in the process for years, Pei says, but couldn’t get it to scale up. But in 2016, right around the time when most countries signed the Paris climate agreement pledging to keep global warming to less than 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, Pei began to spearhead hydrogen research at SSAB. It was clear that decarbonizing steel was crucial for Sweden to meet its Paris commitments. SSAB is not a major steel producer, yet it alone accounts for 10% of Sweden’s CO 2 . “Everyone knew that if SSAB wouldn’t succeed in taking away those emissions, Sweden would not succeed,” company spokesperson Mia Widell says.

The hardest problem with making steel is that it involves extracting iron from iron ore — which is essentially rust, containing iron in an oxidized form. In a blast furnace, oxygen atoms are stripped from this rust, leaving liquid iron behind. To do this, ore is melted together with coke (a derivative of coal) or with charcoal. The main function of this fuel is not actually to melt the ore, but to grab oxygen atoms from it, in a chemical reduction process that has a thermodynamic cost more than six times greater than that of melting the rock. This process leads to the release of vast amounts of CO 2 .

SSAB considered ideas such as capturing emitted CO 2 and storing it underground, but concluded that would be too expensive. Instead, it chose the hydrogen pathway. Hydrogen can diffuse inside pellets of solid iron ore and remove oxygen, in a process called direct reduction of iron (DRI), which takes place at 600 °C instead of the more than 1,500 °C of a blast furnace (see ‘Greener steel’).

Source: Adapted from HYBRIT/Boston Metal

DRI existed long before HYBRIT started using hydrogen for this process: some of today’s steel is made this way using natural gas, but that leads to carbon emissions that using clean hydrogen would avoid.

HYBRIT’s Luleå trials were so successful that SSAB decided to move forward the date to shut down its blast furnaces, from 2045 to 2030, says Pei. HYBRIT is building its first full-size plant in Gällivare, a town 200 kilometres north of Luleå, and has made the results of its research publicly available, hoping to create momentum for the whole industry, he says. Half an hour’s drive from Luleå, a Stockholm-based start-up company called H2GreenSteel has broken ground for an even larger plant, and says it has sold 1.5 million tonnes of its product in advance.

Because smelters last for decades, energy analysts say that if nations are to meet the goals of the Paris accord, the steel industry should immediately stop building new blast furnaces and instead begin replacing them with hydrogen-ready direct-reducers. Even if most initially use natural gas, they will be able to gradually wind down their carbon footprint while hydrogen supply ramps up over the next three decades.

“There’s no space in the carbon budget for new blast furnaces,” says Rebecca Dell, head of the industry programme at the ClimateWorks foundation, a grant-making organization in San Francisco, California.

Many steel-makers are taking the DRI route, although in China and India, new blast furnaces are being planned, according to the non-governmental organization Global Energy Monitor, also in San Francisco. The task is so immense, however, that some organizations, including BloombergNEF, forecast that some blast furnaces will still be active at mid-century, and that carbon capture will have to be deployed to help reduce their emissions.

In principle, steel production might even become completely electrified, avoiding the need to make hydrogen, which could improve efficiency further, says Dell. Electrolysis can split iron oxide, and several start-up firms, such as Boston Metal in Woburn, Massachusetts, are trying to put this to use in steel-making. For now, however, hydrogen is the front runner. “The major advantage of the hydrogen approach is that [it] has the smallest increment of new technology required to get truly clean steel-making,” says Dell.

A hydrogen bridge

In the long run, it’s possible that hydrogen’s biggest contribution to slowing global warming might be as a bridge across disparate activities — electricity, construction, manufacturing and transport — making it cheaper to fully decarbonize all of them together than it would be if each sector tried to decarbonize separately, says Christian Breyer, an energy-systems analyst at Lappeenranta–Lahti University of Technology in Finland.

The crucial node in this interconnected web will be electricity generation. Here, hydrogen could help to solve a well-known drawback of renewable energy: although plentiful, it is spread unevenly across the hours and seasons, and is often unpredictable. This makes it tricky for regions to plan for long periods without it.

Electric cars and batteries: how will the world produce enough?

Researchers who work on simulations that try to balance supply and demand in future electric grids have to plan, for instance, how to supply electricity if winds aren’t blowing for a week in a cold, dark winter in Europe. Scientists have a name for this phenomenon: Dunkelflaute, a German word that roughly translates as ‘dark doldrums’.

Batteries will help to balance supply and demand from one hour to the next, but once the share of wind and solar grows past 80% of a grid’s electricity mix, it becomes extremely expensive to make grids resilient to Dunkelflauten, according to some studies (see, for example, J. D. Jenkins et al. Joule 2, 2498–2510; 2018). One solution being considered is to build enough extra wind turbines to get a grid through even the stillest winters, and then to use them for most of the year to make hydrogen. This hydrogen could then be sold to industrial customers — to steel mills, or for liquid fuels for transportation, shipping and export.

In particularly dire times of the year, it could be used to generate electricity again by burning it in turbines similar to those that run on natural gas, although this would be very wasteful: the grid would get back only one-third or less of the electricity originally put into making the hydrogen.

It’s not clear whether this is the most cost-effective way to decarbonize the last 20% of electricity, compared with building nuclear-power stations or perhaps expanding geothermal energy. The optimal mix will probably vary between countries, suggest region-specific studies by organizations such as the United Nations International Renewable Energy Agency.

Myths and misconceptions

Although hydrogen has myriad possible applications, that doesn’t make it the best solution to all problems. For passenger cars, batteries have already largely won the race, because they are a more efficient and less costly solution than carrying around a tank of hydrogen and converting its energy back to electricity.

Another area where it probably doesn’t make sense to use hydrogen is as a fuel for heating homes. If the hydrogen is grey — made from natural gas — then it simply adds to global warming, says Rebecca Lunn, a civil engineer at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK. She and others flagged home heating as a problematic use for hydrogen in a UK National Engineering Policy Centre (NEPC) study, released in September (see go.nature.com/3ut5mj5).

But even if the hydrogen is green — made from renewables-generated electricity — it is up to six times more efficient to use that electricity to heat homes directly using, for instance, heat pumps, which reach efficiencies much higher than 100% by sucking heat in from the outside.

To cut emissions fastest, policies should prioritize improving home insulation, which will cut down the need for heating energy whatever its source, says Nilay Shah, a researcher in process-systems engineering at Imperial College London, who led the NEPC study.

Hydrogen forecasts

Investment in low-carbon hydrogen had been soaring for the past several years, but events this year have triggered what seems to be a veritable boom.

In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has introduced a tax break of $3 for every kg of green hydrogen, in addition to a number of other policies and pots of funding for the gas. In Europe, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has brought a new sense of urgency. In March, the European Commission set a target of producing 10 million tonnes of H 2 , and importing an additional 10 million tonnes, per year by 2030. Many other major economies have set national strategies to develop hydrogen capacity.

“Everything has changed — the whole equation,” says RMI economist Patrick Molloy. The US tax breaks, in particular, have brought the cost of green hydrogen there down to grey hydrogen’s roughly $1 per kg, or lower, depending on location (see ‘Costs of clean hydrogen’). This already makes hydrogen-based steel, ammonia and liquid fuels competitive with their fossil-fuel counterparts, the RMI calculates.

Sources: IEA Global Hydrogen Review 2022; BloombergNEF analysis

Without subsidies, clean-hydrogen products — such as green steel — could still be more expensive than their dirty equivalents. HYBRIT and H2GreenSteel do not disclose how much they expect their products will cost to make. Governments might also adopt policies to buy green steel, as the administration of US President Joe Biden has pledged to do under a Buy Clean provision in an executive order passed last December.

The IEA projects that by 2030, global hydrogen demand might rise by 20–30%. The low-carbon hydrogen projects that are in the pipeline so far will be enough to cover only about one-quarter of that. That suggests that hydrogen expansion plans are not yet ambitious enough: for the world to be on track for net-zero emissions by mid-century, some 180 Mt of hydrogen production is needed by 2030, with half of it low-emissions.

But Tatarenko says it is not out of the question that global green-hydrogen production could reach what’s necessary in 2030. “We should be super ambitious.”

Others warn that the push for hydrogen might end up boosting the non-green kind as well, and therefore perversely increasing CO 2 emissions. In particular, a controversial measure under consideration by the European Commission would water down the EU definition of green hydrogen, allowing it to be produced in part with electricity generated from fossil fuels.

Reorganizing the economy to accommodate hydrogen will bring social repercussions. Even with subsidies and massive investment, heavy industry in some regions will still be at a competitive disadvantage. Because hydrogen is more expensive and technically challenging to transport than coal, industries such as steel-making might end up having to move closer to sites where hydrogen can be produced cheaply, says Dell. “They may even be in different countries.”

Although this and other political issues could slow down the pace of the transition, there are no longer any unsolvable challenges, she adds. “Making this transition is entirely within both our technical and economic capacities, both in high-income countries and in emerging economies,” says Dell.",How the hydrogen revolution can help save the planet — and how it can’t,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03699-0

494,These disruptive stocks have almost unlimited growth potential.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/708321/light-bulb-taking-off.jpg,motley fool,"Owning disruptive companies is one of the best ways to beat the market long term. Market beaters in the last two decades have come from e-commerce, electric vehicles, streaming, and more. But what businesses are set to be disrupted today?

The three companies that I think have disruptive potential are Spotify (SPOT 4.00%) in audio, Coinbase (COIN 5.02%) in Web3, and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 2.39%) in space tourism and travel.

Spotify

Most people know Spotify as a place where they listen to music, but the company's true disruption comes from podcasts. Podcasts have the potential to disrupt radio, news, and even other video apps.

Spotify starts with the idea of ""owning your ears"" with music, podcasts, and, most recently, audio books. Its initial business model involves charging a monthly fee to listen to music and collecting revenue from ads for members using the free ad-supported tier. However, Spotify's future aim is to be a platform for creators to build podcasts and monetize what they create, while owning the user experience as well.

To execute this strategy, the company has built and acquired creator tools like Anchor for podcasting. Once both creators and listeners are on the platform, the challenge is monetizing the business somehow.

Where Spotify could be building a very durable competitive advantage is in advertising. In the most recent quarter, ad revenue was up 24% from a year ago to $273 million, which is a small but quickly growing base. If Spotify can both target ads more effectively and increase spending on its platform, the business could be extremely disruptive.

YouTube showed that creators will build a business on a company's platform if they're given a way to monetize. Spotify could do what YouTube did, but for the ear, which is a market that's still in major need of disruption.

Coinbase

The last week has been chaotic for the crypto industry, with major exchange FTX filing for bankruptcy on Friday. That's a major blow for the industry, though possibly good for Coinbase, which is going to absorb some of FTX's customers. If the world is ever going to use cryptocurrency or the blockchain in a meaningful way, I think Coinbase will be key to the industry.

It's easy to see Coinbase as a company reliant on a volatile exchange business, but in the third quarter it generated $210.5 million from subscriptions and services (up 45% year over year) and $365.9 million in trading revenue (down 66% year over year). Services need to grow significantly to drive profitability, but with more institutions getting involved, security needs rising, and cloud-services demand growing, the company has a chance to take an important place in the market.

The disruption Coinbase brings is in abstracting away a lot of what the blockchain and crypto are today. I think the future isn't about people having their own wallets or convoluted sign-in pages for non-fungible token (NFT) holders; it'll look more like ""Sign in with Coinbase"" to see your digital assets. This would allow the company to be an identity, financial, and cloud solution for the next generation of internet companies. If Coinbase succeeds, it'll be a massive win for investors.

Virgin Galactic

If any company can make a trip to space attainable for the average person, it will be incredibly disruptive. Virgin Galactic is closer than any company before it, and has already flown civilians into space.

After a number of delays, the company plans to launch commercial operations for its space tourism business in the second quarter of 2023. Tickets for a flight could be over $400,000, and the company hopes to ramp up both flight frequency and the number of spaceports it has in the coming years.

The challenge is that we don't know the upside of this business. The company has a $1.5 billion market cap, and if it can hit the goal of 1,565 passengers flown per year set forth in its special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) documents, this could be a business with over $600 million in annual revenue.

Space tourism and any disruption that comes after that (like mach speed travel) are highly risky, but that's part of investing in disruptive companies. Of the three, this is the one with the most potential and the highest probability of not getting off the ground.

Risk and reward from disruptive stocks

The audio space, cryptocurrencies, and space travel are in need of disruption, and these three companies are leaders in the disruptor space. That means they have big potential markets and could be huge winners for investors. But with big rewards come big risk, so be aware that not all disruptors come out on top in the end.",3 Disruptors I Love Right Now,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/15/3-disruptors-i-love-right-now/
495,These companies are pushing innovation through their artificial intelligence research.,electric vehicles,15/11/2022,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/708978/car-tech.jpg,motley fool,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the buzziest terms in technology at the moment. Given how complex AI is, it is hard to separate the pretenders from the real innovators.

The industry is expected to grow at 20% annually through 2029 and hit over $1 trillion in annual spending worldwide. Companies that are the leaders in AI and machine learning can capture a lot of this spending, helping their businesses grow and leading their stocks to put up great returns for shareholders.

Here are two AI stocks that look ready to make a bull run over the next decade.

1. Alphabet: Multiple AI machines working in tandem

Alphabet (GOOG 1.53%) (GOOGL 1.45%) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, and the Google Cloud platform. The technology giant is one of the premier AI companies worldwide, using it to help its search, mapping, and other functions.

CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted Google's research multiple times on Alphabet's recent earnings call, saying that the company is using AI to bring ""significant improvements to search,"" and that he thinks AI is the next big revolution after mobile phones.

Here are a few examples of how this can work in practice. With trillions upon trillions of pieces of information across Google Search, YouTube, and Google Maps, Alphabet is able to harness AI to greatly improve search results, no matter where customers start their inquiries.

This means that if, for example, you search Google for how to fix a particular device, it will bring up a YouTube tutorial that you can play to learn exactly what you need to do. As these AI models ingest more data, they will continue to improve search results, which will improve Google's customer experience.

Through Google Cloud, Alphabet's cloud infrastructure segment, the company is selling its AI capabilities to other businesses. Companies of all sizes that want to use AI but don't have the internal research capabilities (and there are very few that do) can buy Google's machine-learning products through the cloud. That's a big reason Google Cloud revenue grew 38% year over year last quarter.

With the stock down 34% this year, Alphabet has a market cap of $1.2 trillion. Over the last 12 months, it has generated $67 billion in net earnings, giving the stock a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.9, which is below the market average. For a company with such an advantage in AI and a huge opportunity to grow its business this decade, now looks like a great time to pick up shares of Alphabet.

2. Ansys: spurring innovation through simulation

Alphabet is a leader in AI for the internet, but there are multiple companies working on AI for more-physical applications like semiconductors, the space economy, and the automotive sector. Enter Ansys (ANSS 1.20%), the global leader in simulation software for research & development departments.

Ansys has dozens of software products that cover a variety of end markets, but all with a common goal: to simulate the real world in a multiphysics environment. ""Multiphysics"" is a broad term that means replicating real-world physical properties like electricity, heat, or stress loads on a product, but in a simulation.

Along with other engineering software companies, Ansys helps companies like Tesla and Rocket Lab perform simulations for their manufactured products all within a realistic software environment, saving time and money with their research budgets.

Engineering simulations require vast computing power, which Ansys is trying to improve through its AI and machine-learning research. The company claims AI can help with the speed and accuracy of these simulations, which makes sense since machine learning is generally just one big data problem.

These developments should not only help Ansys improve its products for customers but also distinguish it from any software challengers, insulating it from competition.

Today, Ansys has a market cap of $22 billion. Over the last 12 months, it has generated a net income of $469 million, giving the stock a P/E of 47. This is much more expensive than Alphabet, but with the huge growth opportunity Ansys has within fields like semiconductors, the space economy, and electric vehicles, I think the stock is still a great buy even at today's premium price.

The video, which has has been viewed more than 3.4 million times, highlights numerous issues with a newly purchased Tesla Model S Plaid.

Despite costing well over $120,000, the vehicle, according to TikTok user Dom Giovanni, looks like it was put together by “toddlers.”

“Alright, I’m a car guy and I get Teslas are a touchy subject for real car enthusiasts but this… I don’t understand,” Giovanni says. “Can someone please explain to me the build-quality of Teslas?”

Giovanni shows how the car’s trim and molding is loose on both the front and back doors. The TikToker also shows similar issues with the vehicle’s front trunk or “frunk.”

“Look at the frunk,” he says. “It’s open and I’m tapping it and the thing wobbles like it’s going to fall off the hinges.”

The video goes on to further highlight how several panels on the vehicle don’t align either.

“I understand Teslas are pretty much computers and they happen to manufacture vehicles but the bits and pieces don’t fit, nothing’s flush, it looks like toddlers put this together during recess.”

The video was quickly flooded with commenters who either agreed with Giovanni or sided with Tesla.

One user claiming to be a former Tesla employee claimed that such problems were commonplace.

“I worked for Tess bro and 100% poor quality control at Tesla,” they wrote. “After 3 years everything squeaks and makes noise.”

Such complaints are not new. Tesla CEO Elon Musk just last year called criticisms of his electric vehicles’ build-quality “accurate.”

Others TikTok users argued, however, that their own Teslas did not have any such issues.

“But mine is no where near like this,” another said. “You only see the bad ones on TikTok because that’s what people like to do.”

The Daily Dot reached out to Giovanni over TikTok comment to inquire about the vehicle but did not receive a reply.

Giovanni’s footage also went viral on Twitter, the social media platform that has been plunged into chaos after being purchased by Musk.

“Everything happening at Twitter made sense when I saw this video,” one Twitter user said.

The viral video comes after construction workers at the Tesla gigafactory in Texas blew the whistle over alleged labor violations.

The whistleblowers, according to the Guardian, accused Tesla of subjecting them to constant hazards, onsite accidents, and wage theft.

“Nobody deserves what happened in the gigafactory to happen to them, or their family members, or whomever,” one whistleblower said. “I don’t think it was humane.”

Tesla did not respond to an email from the Daily Dot questioning the company’s manufacturing process.","‘It looks like toddlers put this together’: Viral TikTok shows poor build quality of Teslas, sparking debate",https://www.dailydot.com/debug/teslas-poor-build-quality/

Originally due in 2022, development delays, which Bloomberg in July reported were due to software issues, have pushed back the release on more than one occasion. A related Audi Q6 E-Tron has also been delayed.

The compact crossovers are the first vehicles being developed on the Volkswagen Group's new PPE modular EV platform. Porsche and Audi were tasked with developing the platform, which is designed for high-volume premium models. For mainstream models, VW Group brands rely on the existing MEB platform.

PPE platform for VW Group, developed by Porsche/Audi

Unlike Porsche's J1 platform that underpins the Taycan, the PPE platform is flexible enough to spawn low- and high-riding models in multiple size categories. For the Macan, the platform will feature a 98-kwh battery pack and an electric motor driving each axle. Green Car Reports has learned that at least one grade will deliver a combined output of more than 603 hp and 740 lb-ft of torque.

The battery will run at 800-volts, enabling high-speed charging. Using a 350-kw charge point, Porsche has hinted that 60 miles can be added in four minutes and close to 250 miles in less than 20 minutes. The automaker has also demonstrated 450-kw charging, in which 60 miles can be added in just three minutes, but 450-kw charging is all but unknown in the U.S. As for range, a Porsche exec told Green Car Reports to expect “a lot more than the Taycan.” EPA-rated range in Porsche's electric sedan currently tops out at 242 miles.

Green Car Reports has also learned that top-end Macan EVs will have a fully variable rear differential and an electronically controlled rear differential lock, which Porsche is calling the Performance Rear Axle. The rear motor will be mounted slightly behind the rear axle to make space for gearing and a slight rear bias when it comes to weight distribution, which will be 48:52 front to rear. Porsche has also revealed that it will use silicon carbide for the inverter, which reduces electrical losses and offers power switching at higher frequencies.",2024 Porsche Macan EV coming with over more than hp,https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1137844_2024-porsche-macan-ev-coming-with-over-more-than-hp
