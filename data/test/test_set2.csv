0,The Bestiary Chronicles is both a modern fable on the rise of artificial intelligence and a demonstration of how shockingly fast AI is evolving.,artificial intelligence,12/11/2022,https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/4dfe73b78181d5998c00251386908cc5d4f32f11/hub/2022/11/11/d1211a3a-48a5-4e60-865b-1303693bb8b8/exodus-03-1.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=630&width=1200,cnet,"You might expect a comic book series featuring art generated entirely by artificial intelligence technology to be full of surreal images that have you tilting your head trying to grasp what kind of sense-shifting madness you're looking at.

Not so with the images in The Bestiary Chronicles, a free, three-part comics series from Campfire Entertainment, an award-winning New York-based production house focused on creative storytelling.

Campfire, Midjourney

The visuals in the trilogy -- believed to be the first comics series made with AI-assisted art -- are stunning. They're also stunningly precise, as if they've come straight from the hand of a seasoned digital artist with a very specific story and style in mind.

""Deep underground, the last remnants of humanity gather to learn about the monsters that have destroyed their planet,"" reads a description of The Lesson, the visually rich retro-futuristic third comic in the trilogy. All three are available for download now on Campfire's site, and also come in softcover and hardcover printed anthologies.

Though AI-generated visual art can tend toward the wildly absurd, the photorealistic humans in The Bestiary Chronicles don't have rearranged facial features, or limbs protruding at odd angles. The monsters -- with their glowing eyes and astonishingly bad teeth -- look like love children of Godzilla and Vhagar and could hardly be mistaken for anything other than rage-filled beasts.

This algorithm-assisted art looks tailor-made for the dark dystopian tale, which leans on tropes from 1960 sci-fi horror film Village of the Damned and from THX 1138, George Lucas' 1971 debut feature film.

""We're seeing the rise of a completely new visualization tool that will radically change the storytelling process across both the comics industry and entertainment in general,"" said Steve Coulson, writer of the trilogy and creative director of Campfire, which has created immersive fan experiences for shows including Ted Lasso, Westworld and Watchmen. Its founders thought up The Blair Witch Project.

For The Bestiary Chronicles, Coulson turned to Midjourney, a service that quickly turns short text phrases, or ""prompts,"" into images by scanning a giant database trained on visual art by humans. Artificial intelligence tools like it, Dall-E and Stable Diffusion are capturing the internet's imagination as they let anyone manifest images from text in intriguing and sometimes disturbing ways.

The Bestiary Chronicles is a 114-page science fiction odyssey about monsters born from man's technological hubris. But it also showcases the remarkable progress of products like Midjourney, which are producing increasingly more sophisticated and refined images.

The advances in AI image generation over the last few months have been exponential and mind blowing. Steve Coulson, Campfire Entertainment

""By the new year, even the trained eye probably won't be able to perceive an AI generation from any other,"" Coulson said. ""It's exciting and terrifying at the same time. But you can't put the genie back in the bottle, so we're embracing the future as fast as we can.""

AI image generation is advancing so rapidly, he adds, that The Lesson, out Nov. 1, marks a clear visual step up from the first comic in the trilogy, Summer Island, a folk-horror story in the spirit of Midsommar that came out in August. During those three months, Midjourney went through two upgrades.

AI, partner in art

""Technology is changing our world, with artificial intelligence both a new frontier of possibility but also a development fraught with anxiety,"" Thomas P. Campbell, director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, said when the exhibit Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI opened in 2020 to explore the ever-expanding space where humans and artificial intelligence meet.

AI generating visual art, composing songs and even writing poetry and movie scripts is driving some of that anxiety, raising ethical and copyright concerns among artists and even lawyers. AI art isn't created in a vacuum. It works by absorbing and reconstructing existing art created by humans. As machine-made art improves, will those humans -- actual graphic designers, illustrators, composers and photographers -- find themselves edged out of work?

When an AI-generated picture won an art prize in September, some artists weren't happy about it. ""We're watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes,"" one Twitter user wrote.

Coulson, an avid comics reader since age 5, is among those pondering the complex questions raised by AI art, but he doesn't think tools like Midjourney will replace the comics artists he's long loved. ""Those geniuses have an eye for dramatic composition and dynamic narrative that I strongly doubt machine learning will be able to match,"" he writes in the afterword to Summer Island. ""But as a visualization tool for nonartists like myself, it's a hell of a lot of fun.""

Campfire, Midjourney

He does, however, see Midjourney as his true collaborator in The Bestiary Chronicles, even giving it an author credit. Where a comics artist might conceive of a narrative and then create art to illustrate it, AI-assisted images have the potential to more actively steer the story, or even change its direction, thus dramatically redefining the whole creative workflow. Coulson likens this human-machine duet to improv jazz.

""I would never ask a human artist to just 'draw 100 splash pages and maybe I'll pick the one I like the best,' but Midjourney will happily spit them out 24/7,"" Coulson says. ""Then after we review the imagery, we start to assemble the story, almost as an act of collage, filling in gaps along the way.""

AI art is the star here, but humans had the decisive hand in which images made it into the final version of each story. They experimented with text prompts and carefully selected their final images from multiple Midjourney offerings, making a Photoshop tweak here and there, but mostly letting the machine-made work stand.

The Campfire team, for example, liked the rich effect produced by the style prompt ""olive-green and sepia and teal-blue tritone print on watercolor paper,"" so they used that one often to give images a painterly effect. For The Lesson, the phrase ""futuristic underground bunker in the style of J.C. Leyendecker"" yielded the perfect retro-futuristic postapocalyptic hideaway.

""We also used the phrase 'Hitchcock Blonde' to describe our heroine, and more often than not she came out looking like Grace Kelly,"" Coulson said. That's a fully recognizable Grace Kelly, without misplaced ears or a dog snout.

""The advances in AI image generation over the last few months have been exponential and mind blowing,"" Coulson said, ""and this technology is only going to get better -- faster than we can imagine.""","AI Drew This Gorgeous Comic Series, But You'd Never Know It - CNET",https://www.cnet.com/culture/ai-drew-this-gorgeous-comic-series-but-youd-never-know-it/

The website says one of artists' main concerns about AI art is that their work may be used to train artificial intelligence models, which means the generator could spit out pieces in their style without their consent. In an attempt to give artists control over their work, DeviantArt is giving them the ability to choose whether or not the tool can use their style for direct inspiration.

Further, the website is giving them the power to declare whether or not to allow their work to be used in datasets used to train third-party AI models. If they choose not to be included in those datasets, their content pages' HTML files will contain a ""noimageai"" directive. Also a ""noai"" directive protects their artwork when media files are directly downloaded from DeviantArt's servers.

""DeviantArt encourages other creator platforms to adopt this approach in order to ensure artists remain able to share their work with online audiences while retaining control over non-human usage,"" the website wrote in its announcement.

Those directives, of course, won't be added to their pages' HTML files if they're cool with their work being used to train AI models. And if they choose to allow DreamUp to use their style as a direct inspiration, they will be ""clearly credited"" on the output when it's published on DeviantArt. The website has anticipated that some users wouldn't be happy seeing even more AI art, though, especially since Midjourney-generated pieces are already a very common sight on the platform. That's why all DreamUp submissions will be automatically tagged as #AIArt, and users will be able to choose to see or to hide posts under the topic.

2,Determining the value of a company's AI requires an in-depth look under the hood and a nuanced understanding of the AI's role.,artificial intelligence,06/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1336522614-e1649786490326.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

Almost every confidential investment memorandum (CIM) for a tech-driven enterprise includes the company’s mention of artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) capabilities. But as with other investment buzzwords — such as “subscription revenue” — there is a tendency to use AI or ML to suggest complex, business-enabling, proprietary technology and processes to distinguish the offering as differentiated or technologically superior. This is often to garner higher valuation.

We’ve all heard examples of AI failures that make for good headlines and provide interesting cautionary tales. But as an investor, it can be just as frightening to learn that the AI capability that drove an above-market valuation is not much more than a spreadsheet with some marketing spin.

In our role as advisors to technology investors and management teams, we often encounter a question central to the investment thesis: Is the AI/ML the real deal? Here’s how to find the answer.

Make sure everyone’s speaking the same language

Varying interpretations of “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning” and “deep learning” can create confusion and misunderstandings, as the terms are often misused or used interchangeably. Think of the concepts this way:

Artificial intelligence is any system that mimics human intelligence. With this definition, AI could refer to any rules-based system or algorithm — as long as it’s being used to simulate intelligence. Chatbots are a perfect example.

Machine learning is a subset of AI. It relies on a mathematical model created using a large dataset and a training algorithm that allows the model to learn and evolve. For example, in Google Photos, you can tag pictures with the names of the people in them, and over time, Google gets better and better at identifying people on its own. This is a good example of machine learning.

Deep learning is a subset of ML that involves highly sophisticated models resembling the structure of the human brain. These models require millions of records to train but can often equal or outperform humans at specific tasks. For example, the AlphaZero deep learning program remains undefeated at chess.

Digging deeper

You need to dig deeper than these broad, general terms to see how legitimate a company’s AI/ML technology is. You need to understand: What problem is being solved? What AI/ML technologies are used to solve it? How and why does this solution work? Does the solution provide a competitive edge over other approaches?

Let’s say you’re looking at investing in a new company in the hypothetical LawnTech space.

If the CIM describes the company’s HornetNest app as an “AI system for hornet eradication,” you’d want to dig more deeply with the technical product team to understand the underlying components and process. Ideally, you’ll end up with an explanation that sounds more like this:

“We use a YOLO-based object detector with a Kalman filter to identify, count, and track hornets in real time. Data is fed into an anomaly detector that automatically alerts customers when we see behavior that suggests a new nest may be present within a 50-yard radius. Through an exclusive partnership with Orkin, we have compiled the world’s largest training set of images, allowing us to predict the presence and location of new hornet nests more accurately than anyone else.”

This level of detail is needed to understand the sophistication, value, and defensibility of a company’s AI/ML assets.

Evaluate the whole picture

AI isn’t just one thing. It’s the product of six critical components essential to AI value. The degree to which these elements operate effectively together can help you separate the highest-value AI from the less legitimate.

The team

This is perhaps the most valuable asset and determinator of long-term success. In particular, having a strong data science team led by a seasoned chief data scientist opens the door to best-in-class AI.

The data

ML relies on training data to make the models. High volumes of data, especially proprietary data that competitors can’t access, create a significant competitive advantage and barrier. As a very rough rule of thumb, you need tens of thousands of training records for traditional ML; millions for deep learning.

The training process

There are basic training processes and advanced techniques, including automated machine learning (AutoML), hyperparameter tuning, active learning and weak supervision. A company’s ability to use these advanced techniques leads to reduced costs and improved quality.

Operational excellence

Beyond training the AI, it’s important to understand its overall care and feeding. You’ll want to understand the quality assurance, testing and error decomposition processes. When weaknesses are identified, how is supplemental training data gathered? Additionally, suppose a strength of the AI is incorporating real-time feedback to enable reinforcement learning, or compiling a knowledge base to support decision-making. In these cases, processes must be actively managed to ensure optimal performance.

The models

Models are results of the team, the data and the training process. But, to be considered an asset, they still take appreciable time to create and optimize. The value of this component is determined by the number of models a company has and the sophistication of the models.

The AI development infrastructure

There is a difference between a company that has thrown together a few ML models and one with the infrastructure to automatically create, retrain, test and deploy models.

Understand where the company falls on the AI maturity scale

Based on a sample from the more than 2,500 tech companies our team has diligenced over the last two years, we’ve noted some fairly consistent indicators of AI maturity.

Around 10% of these companies fall into the category of “No AI.” Despite what they say, it’s not AI. For example, software that optimizes container routing may not be AI but just a sophisticated traditional algorithm.

A further 10% fall into the category of “Non-proprietary AI.” In these instances, the company is using only public domain models, or MLaaS cloud APIs, to leverage AI. An example would be using Amazon’s AI-based Textract API to recognize text or the public domain ResNet model to detect objects in images. This approach can be considered AI-based but does not require training data, a training process, data scientists or even a lot of knowledge about AI to implement. There would also be no competitive differentiator in this approach since any company can use the same public-domain assets.

The vast majority, about 75%, fall into the category of “Standard AI.” What we see most often are companies that are training proprietary ML models using their own training data in combination with standard training algorithms. There is a broad range of sophistication in this class. At the simpler end of the range are companies that create linear regression models using a library like Python’s sklearn. At the more complex end are companies that design and create multiple deep learning models using TensorFlow and use advanced optimization techniques like hyperparameter tuning, active learning and weak supervision to maximize accuracy.

The final 5% falls into the category of “Leading-edge AI.” These companies have gone beyond standard AI techniques and developed their own model types and training algorithms to push AI in new directions. This represents unique and patentable IP that has value in itself, and the models created by these companies can outperform competitors that have access to the same dataset.

It looks like the real deal — but is it right for you?

Once you understand the details of the AI itself, you’re better positioned to understand its impact on the investment thesis. There are two factors to consider here.

First, what is the value of the AI? Because “AI” can have widely-varying definitions, it’s important to take a holistic view. The value of a company’s AI assets is the sum of the six critical parts noted above: the team, data, training process, operational excellence, models, and development infrastructure.

Another way to look at AI’s value in a company is to ask how it impacts the bottom line. What would happen to revenues and costs if the AI were to disappear tomorrow? Does it actually drive revenue or operating leverage? And conversely, what costs are required to maintain or improve the capability? You’ll find AI can be anything from an empty marketing slogan to technology essential for a company’s success.

Second, what risks does the AI introduce? Unintentional algorithmic bias can pose reputational and legal risks to the business, creating sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory AI. In the case of credit, law enforcement, housing, education and healthcare, this type of bias is prohibited by law and difficult to defend against — even when it occurs unwittingly. Make sure you understand how the target has guarded against algorithmic bias and the steps you would need to take to prevent bias moving forward.

Privacy is another concern, with AI often necessitating new layers of privacy and security protocols. You need to understand how biometric data (considered personally identifiable information protected by data privacy laws) and sensitive images, such as faces, license plates and computer screens, are collected, used and safeguarded.

The true value of AI

The reality is that, in today’s tech landscape, most companies can legitimately claim some AI capabilities. The majority of the time, the AI fits our definition for “standard” maturity and performs as we expect it to. But when we looked more deeply into the “standard AI” category, we found that only about half of these companies were using best practices or creating a competitive differentiator that would be difficult for competitors to outperform. The other half had room for improvement.

Determining the value of AI requires both an in-depth look under the hood and a nuanced understanding of the AI’s specific role in the business. Tech diligence, done by experts who’ve directly led AI teams, can help demystify AI for investors. The goal is to help investors understand exactly what they’re buying, what it can and cannot do for the business, what risks it introduces, and, ultimately, to what extent it supports the investment strategy.

The chip, known as the A800, is an alternative to the A100 chip that went into production in the third quarter, Nvidia said Monday. ""The A800 meets the US government's clear test for reduced export control and cannot be programmed to exceed it,"" a spokesperson for the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said in a statement.

Tech companies have been caught in the middle of rising tensions between China and the US over Chinese companies gaining access to technologies that enable high-performance computing, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors.

Nvidia revealed in August that the US government had ordered it to restrict sales of two AI acceleration chips to China -- the A100 and the forthcoming H100, which let AI developers speed up their research and build more-advanced AI models. The order aimed to ""address the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a 'military end use' or 'military end user' in China and Russia,"" Nvidia said at the time.

The company warned at the time that it had expected approximately $400 million in sales to China during the third quarter but indicated that figure may be impacted by customers being unwilling to purchase alternative products.

CAIRO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Blnk, a fintech platform that enables instant consumer credit in Egypt, has closed one of the country's biggest funding rounds for a startup this year, raising $32 million, its chief executive said.

The company, launched in October 2021, raised $23.7 million in equity and debt funding and $8.3 million in securitised bond issuance, co-founder and CEO Amr Sultan told Reuters.

The funds will be used to accelerate financial inclusion within underserved communities across the country, to support further development of Blnk’s Artificial Intelligence-powered lending infrastructure, and to finance the company’s fast-growing portfolio of customers, he added.

The combined pre-seed and seed funding rounds of $12.5 million were led by Abu Dhabi’s Emirates International Investment Company (EIIC) and Egypt-based venture capital firm Sawari Ventures, with participation from several prominent local and international angel investors.

The $11.2 million debt funding was secured from a number of leading local banks. The $8.3 million securitised bond issuance was underwritten by National Bank of Egypt and Banque du Caire.

Blnk has developed a digital lending platform that empowers merchants of all sizes to instantly underwrite and finance their customers' purchases at the point of sale and enables consumers access to financing to purchase a range of products and services, including electronics, furniture and automotive services, paying over instalments ranging from six to 36 months.

The company says it has disbursed more than $20 million in loans to date.

Nov 7 (Reuters) - Shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp, the blank-check company looking to take Donald Trump's social media venture public, rallied on Monday over the former president's possible run for the 2024 presidential election.

Trump is considering launching a third bid for the White House this month, three of his advisers said last week, while media reports over the weekend pointed to a campaign starting before the end of November.

Shares in Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC.O) jumped more than 24% to $21.55, and were set for their best day in nearly a year, bringing down year-to-date losses to 58%.

""The prospect of Donald Trump seizing the political spotlight again appears to have put a rocket under the share price of DWAC amid expectation there could be a sharp increase in users on the former President's highly controversial social media platform,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

The rally in DWAC, which was also the fifth most trending ticker on retail investor focused social media forum Stocktwits, helped lift shares of other Trump-linked companies.

DWAC on Thursday extended the deadline to Nov. 22. for investors' approval to complete its merger deal with Trump Media and Technology Group.

This move comes as Americans prepare to vote in the U.S. midterm elections, with analysts expecting Republicans to win control of Congress.

Software developer Phunware Inc (PHUN.O), which was hired by Trump's 2020 presidential reelection campaign to build a phone app, jumped 18.3%.

Rumble Inc (RUM.O), a Canadian video platform popular with conservatives, however, slipped 3.5%. Trump's social media venture Truth Social announced in August it would join Rumble's new ad platform as its first publisher in August.

Artificial intelligence solutions company Remark Holdings (MARK.O), which has been linked to the former president on social media sites, gained 8.6%. Reuters could not independently verify the link between Trump and Remark.

It’s a tricky tightrope that Ferrell’s new festive comedy Spirited precariously wobbles along before almost immediately falling off, a desperate and crudely assembled attempt to recapture that very difficult to capture magic.

It comes from Apple, as one of the tech behemoth’s biggest bets to date (at least $75m was spent just on talent), and suitably has the feeling of something created less by real human people and more calculated by artificial intelligence, heavy emphasis on artificial. It’s a plasticky piece of product with the puppyish insistence that it has the power to please us all, frantically trying to tick every box but failing to hit just one. A meta spin on A Christmas Carol that’s also a bromance comedy but mostly an earnest, full-throated musical was never going to be an easy elevator pitch to untangle but it was enough to spark a bidding war with Apple beating out Netflix, Paramount and Warner Bros.

In the annual flurry of cheaply stuffed Christmas streaming movies, there is a thrill to watching one that wouldn’t pixelate if transferred to a bigger screen and Spirited easily and expensively earns its one-week theatrical release before it heads to your smartphone. It’s all very slickly packaged, even if at points such slickness becomes a little too synthetic, and will probably find a record audience for Apple, a company that’s struggled to find a homegrown blockbuster movie. But while it might be a hit this season, I doubt for many it will have that annual rewatchability factor, a film not for life but just this one Christmas.

In the high-concept world of Spirited, haunting is a business. Every year when Christmas approaches, three ghosts descend upon a figure in need of de-Scrooging, redemption being the ultimate goal. The Ghost of Christmas Present (Ferrell) is edging toward retirement but eager to make an impact before that day comes and so picks Clint Briggs (Ryan Reynolds), a heartless media consultant who spends his life causing conflict for a living. He’s what’s known as an “unredeemable”, someone incapable of real change, but along with Past (Glow’s Sunita Mani) and Future (the voice of Tracy Morgan), he’s determined to finish the job.

New adaptations of the Dickens morality tale are a seasonal staple (this year also sees a Netflix animation with the voices of Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley, the return of Jefferson Mays’ one-man Broadway show and an Adrian Edmondson-led version at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon) and so there is at least some initial inventiveness to be praised in the Daddy’s Home co-writers Sean Anders and John Morris’s distinctive revision. There’s some intricate world-building and the odd deft idea but some less developed joke-writing, a string of misses crashing from the very first scene. While Elf managed to be genuinely funny while also being genuinely sweet, the tone here is far less even. The wink, wink jokes for the adults reek of eye-rolling smugness (it’s the kind of film where a character watches a song-and-dance number and asks “Why are they singing?” to the answer of “Because they’re in a musical”) and this clashes with the film’s often embarrassingly straight-faced earnestness, most visible in the film’s many, many, many musical set pieces.

The decision to make the film a musical is a genuine head-scratcher, one that’s never justified or even mildly explained given that the two leads are not natural singers and so throughout the lunges into song feel awkward at best. With music from the La La Land and The Greatest Showman duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, it’s certainly committed to the genre but extravagant staging and enthused backing dancers can’t disguise forgettable, cloying songs and lacklustre singing. It’s closer to watching high-budget karaoke at an office Christmas party. Even when they’re not bursting into song, the two can’t really conjure the necessary star powered chemistry to glide us through. Reynolds’s regurgitated quippy shtick is growing more exhausted by the movie (his character name-checking Scrooged only serves to remind us just how much more well-suited Bill Murray was to the role of grinch) while an unsure Ferrell struggles to flip between serious and silly leaving it up to an underused Octavia Spencer, as assistant-cum-love interest, to walk away with the film, an admittedly easy task given the leaden leads.

Anders, also serving as director, never seems confident enough in what his film should be and so we’re never confident enough in what we’re actually watching, an atonal grab bag of inharmonious notes (an uneasy third act suicide proves to be the flattest). When stretched to a two-hour-plus runtime (with more musical bits during the credits), we leave feeling bloated, a 10-course Christmas meal we wish we’d never started.",Spirited review – Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds hit all the wrong notes in Christmas musical,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/09/spirited-review-will-ferrell-ryan-reynolds

Not so with the images in The Bestiary Chronicles, a free, three-part comics series from Campfire Entertainment, an award-winning New York-based production house focused on creative storytelling.

The visuals in the trilogy -- believed to be the first comics series made with AI-assisted art -- are stunning. They're also stunningly precise, as if they've come straight from the hand of a seasoned digital artist with a very specific story and style in mind.

""Deep underground, the last remnants of humanity gather to learn about the monsters that have destroyed their planet,"" reads a description of The Lesson, the visually rich retro-futuristic third comic in the trilogy. All three are available for download now on Campfire's site, and also come in softcover and hardcover printed anthologies.

Though AI-generated visual art can tend toward the wildly absurd, the photorealistic humans in The Bestiary Chronicles don't have rearranged facial features, or limbs protruding at odd angles. The monsters -- with their glowing eyes and astonishingly bad teeth -- look like love children of Godzilla and Vhagar and could hardly be mistaken for anything other than rage-filled beasts.

This algorithm-assisted art looks tailor-made for the dark dystopian tale, which leans on tropes from 1960 sci-fi horror film Village of the Damned and from THX 1138, George Lucas' 1971 debut feature film.

""We're seeing the rise of a completely new visualization tool that will radically change the storytelling process across both the comics industry and entertainment in general,"" said Steve Coulson, writer of the trilogy and creative director of Campfire, which has created immersive fan experiences for shows including Ted Lasso, Westworld and Watchmen. Its founders thought up The Blair Witch Project.

For The Bestiary Chronicles, Coulson turned to Midjourney, a service that quickly turns short text phrases, or ""prompts,"" into images by scanning a giant database trained on visual art by humans. Artificial intelligence tools like it, Dall-E and Stable Diffusion are capturing the internet's imagination as they let anyone manifest images from text in intriguing and sometimes disturbing ways.

The Bestiary Chronicles is a 114-page science fiction odyssey about monsters born from man's technological hubris. But it also showcases the remarkable progress of products like Midjourney, which are producing increasingly more sophisticated and refined images.

The advances in AI image generation over the last few months have been exponential and mind blowing. Steve Coulson, Campfire Entertainment

""By the new year, even the trained eye probably won't be able to perceive an AI generation from any other,"" Coulson said. ""It's exciting and terrifying at the same time. But you can't put the genie back in the bottle, so we're embracing the future as fast as we can.""

AI image generation is advancing so rapidly, he adds, that The Lesson, out Nov. 1, marks a clear visual step up from the first comic in the trilogy, Summer Island, a folk-horror story in the spirit of Midsommar that came out in August. During those three months, Midjourney went through two upgrades.

AI, partner in art

""Technology is changing our world, with artificial intelligence both a new frontier of possibility but also a development fraught with anxiety,"" Thomas P. Campbell, director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, said when the exhibit Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI opened in 2020 to explore the ever-expanding space where humans and artificial intelligence meet.

AI generating visual art, composing songs and even writing poetry and movie scripts is driving some of that anxiety, raising ethical and copyright concerns among artists and even lawyers. AI art isn't created in a vacuum. It works by absorbing and reconstructing existing art created by humans. As machine-made art improves, will those humans -- actual graphic designers, illustrators, composers and photographers -- find themselves edged out of work?

When an AI-generated picture won an art prize in September, some artists weren't happy about it. ""We're watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes,"" one Twitter user wrote.

Coulson, an avid comics reader since age 5, is among those pondering the complex questions raised by AI art, but he doesn't think tools like Midjourney will replace the comics artists he's long loved. ""Those geniuses have an eye for dramatic composition and dynamic narrative that I strongly doubt machine learning will be able to match,"" he writes in the afterword to Summer Island. ""But as a visualization tool for nonartists like myself, it's a hell of a lot of fun.""

Campfire, Midjourney

He does, however, see Midjourney as his true collaborator in The Bestiary Chronicles, even giving it an author credit. Where a comics artist might conceive of a narrative and then create art to illustrate it, AI-assisted images have the potential to more actively steer the story, or even change its direction, thus dramatically redefining the whole creative workflow. Coulson likens this human-machine duet to improv jazz.

""I would never ask a human artist to just 'draw 100 splash pages and maybe I'll pick the one I like the best,' but Midjourney will happily spit them out 24/7,"" Coulson says. ""Then after we review the imagery, we start to assemble the story, almost as an act of collage, filling in gaps along the way.""

AI art is the star here, but humans had the decisive hand in which images made it into the final version of each story. They experimented with text prompts and carefully selected their final images from multiple Midjourney offerings, making a Photoshop tweak here and there, but mostly letting the machine-made work stand.

The Campfire team, for example, liked the rich effect produced by the style prompt ""olive-green and sepia and teal-blue tritone print on watercolor paper,"" so they used that one often to give images a painterly effect. For The Lesson, the phrase ""futuristic underground bunker in the style of J.C. Leyendecker"" yielded the perfect retro-futuristic postapocalyptic hideaway.

""We also used the phrase 'Hitchcock Blonde' to describe our heroine, and more often than not she came out looking like Grace Kelly,"" Coulson said. That's a fully recognizable Grace Kelly, without misplaced ears or a dog snout.

""The advances in AI image generation over the last few months have been exponential and mind blowing,"" Coulson said, ""and this technology is only going to get better -- faster than we can imagine.""",You'd Never Know AI Drew This Beautiful Comic Series - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/culture/youd-never-know-ai-drew-this-beautiful-comic-series/

Given their contribution to the world’s carbon emissions, minimising the environmental effects of industrial plants is vital. But plans to decarbonise heavy industry efficiently have been unsuccessful, often relying on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies that would take decades to scale. Carbon Re’s technology, by contrast, can be implemented quickly, requires no new equipment, and is already being used to cut emissions today.

In a world-first, the company is developing an artificial intelligence powered software (Delta Zero) to create ‘Digital Twins’ of industrial plants – which can then be monitored to analyse a specific plant’s output and efficiency. Procedures can then be optimised to reduce fuel usage, operational costs, and carbon emissions. Because Delta Zero continuously tracks the plant’s function, operators may alter and improve manufacturing processes virtually in real-time.

Today, the technology is being used in pilot projects at cement plants in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, allowing them all to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 10 per cent. But, with £4.2 million of seed money now raised with the help of Planet A Ventures, Carbon Re aims to scale-up Delta Zero Cement onto the global market and expand into the steel and glass industries.

Springwise has spotted other innovations seeking to reduce industrial carbon emissions, including a carbon-capture solvent and new biogas plants.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo















NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Roger Ng, the former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) banker convicted for helping loot Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, on Friday sued the government's star witness Tim Leissner for more than $130 million, alleging fraud.

In a complaint filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, Ng accused his former boss of repeatedly lying in order to steal his investments in energy drink maker Celsius Holdings (CELH.O) and artificial intelligence company Sentient Technologies.

The complaint said Leissner, a former Goldman partner, stole Ng's money to cover his own defense costs in a related criminal case where he pleaded guilty in 2018, while depriving Ng of funds to defend himself and appeal his conviction.

""Ng is in the unimaginable position of having to defend himself against allegations made by the person who defrauded him and who stole the money that plaintiff Ng needs to defend against those same allegations,"" the complaint said.

Leissner's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Ng, the former head of investment banking for Goldman Sachs Malaysia, said Leissner's thefts included a $1.25 million Celsius stake now worth more than $130 million, plus $1 million intended to buy half of Leissner's interest in Sentient.

He said it wasn't until May 2021 when Leissner and his wife, the model and entrepreneur Kimora Lee Simmons, were sued by Simmons' former husband, record executive Russell Simmons, that he learned Leissner had diverted the Celsius investment.

In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay $2.9 billion and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge, to settle probes into the looting of billions of dollars from 1MDB and payment of bribes to win business for the Wall Street bank.

A federal jury in Brooklyn convicted Ng in April of conspiring to violate an anti-bribery law and commit money laundering.

Ng faces up to 30 years in prison. He and Leissner are scheduled to be sentenced in mid-February.

Jho Low, a Malaysian financier and suspected mastermind of the looting, was also indicted in Brooklyn and remains at large.

14,Both Nvidia and Intel’s Habana Labs reported performance gains with the MLPerf 2.1 benchmark in training machine learning models.,artificial intelligence,09/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/machine-learning-challenges.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

MLCommons is out today with its latest set of machine learning (ML) MLPerf benchmarks, once again showing how hardware and software for artificial intelligence (AI) are getting faster.

MLCommons is a vendor-neutral organization that aims to provide standardized testing and benchmarks to help evaluate the state of ML software and hardware. Under the MLPerf testing name, MLCommons collects different ML benchmarks multiple times throughout the year. In September, the MLPerf Inference results were released, showing gains in how different technologies have improved inference performance.

Today, the new MLPerf benchmarks being reported include the Training 2.1 benchmark, which is for ML training; HPC 2.0 for large systems including supercomputers; and Tiny 1.0 for small and embedded deployments.

“The key reason why we’re doing benchmarking is to drive transparency and measure performance,” David Kanter, executive director of MLCommons, said during a press briefing. “This is all predicated on the key notion that once you can actually measure something, you can start thinking about how you would improve it.”

How the MLPerf training benchmark works

Looking at the training benchmark in particular, Kanter said that MLPerf isn’t just about hardware, it’s about software too.

In ML systems, models need to first be trained on data in order to operate. The training process benefits from accelerator hardware, as well as optimized software.

Kanter explained that the MLPerf Training benchmark starts with a predetermined dataset and a model. Organizations then train the model to hit a target quality threshold. Among the primary metrics that MLPerf Training benchmark captures is time to train.

“When you look at the results, and this goes for any submission — whether it’s training, tiny, HPC or inference — all of the results are submitted to say something,” Kanter said. “Part of this exercise is figuring out what that something they say is.”

The metrics can identify relative levels of performance and also serve to highlight improvement over time for both hardware and software.

John Tran, senior director of deep learning libraries and hardware architecture at Nvidia and chair of MLPerf Training at MLCommons, highlighted the fact that there were a number of software-only submissions for the latest benchmark.

“I find it continually interesting how we have so many software-only submissions and they don’t necessarily need help from the hardware vendors,” Tran said. “I think that’s great and is showing the maturity of the benchmark and usefulness to people.”

Intel and Habana Labs push training forward with Gaudi2

The importance of software was also highlighted by Jordan Plawner, sr. director of AI products at Intel. During the MLCommons press call, Plawner explained what he sees as the difference between ML inference and training workloads in terms of hardware and software.

“Training is a distributed-workload problem,” Plawner said. “Training is more than just hardware, more than just the silicon; it’s the software, it’s also the network and running distributed-class workloads.”

In contrast, Plawner said that ML inference can be a single-node issue that doesn’t have the same distributed aspects, which provides a lower barrier to entry for vendor technologies than ML training.

In terms of results, Intel is well represented on the latest MLPerf Training benchmarks with its Gaudi2 technology. Intel acquired Habana Labs and its Gaudi technology for $2 billion in 2019 and have helped to advance the company’s capabilities in recent years.

The most advanced silicon from Habana Labs is now the Gaudi2 system, which was announced in May. The latest Gaudi2 results show gains over the first set of benchmarks that Habana Labs reported with the MLPerf Training update in June. According to Intel, Gaudi2 improved by 10% for time-to-train in TensorFlow for both BERT and ResNet-50 models.

Nvidia H100 hops past predecessor

Nvidia is also reporting strong gains for its technologies in the latest MLPerf Training benchmarks.

Testing results for Nvidia’s Hopper-based H100 with MLPerf Training show significant gains over the prior generation A100-based hardware. In an Nvidia briefing call discussing the MLCommons results, Dave Salvator, director of AI, benchmarking and cloud at Nvidia, said that the H100 provides 6.7 times more performance than the first A100 submission had for the same benchmarks several years ago. Salvator said that a key part of what makes the H100 perform so well is the integrated transformer engine that is part of the Nvidia Hopper chip architecture.

While H100 is now Nvidia’s leading hardware for ML training, that’s not to say the A100 hasn’t improved its MLPerf Training results as well.

“The A100 continues to be a really compelling product for training, and over the last couple of years we’ve been able to scale its performance by more than two times from software optimizations alone,” Salvator said.

Overall, whether it’s with new hardware or continued software optimizations, Salvator expects there will be a steady stream of performance improvements for ML training in the months and years to come.

“AI’s appetite for performance is unbounded, and we continue to need more and more performance to be able to work with growing datasets in a reasonable amount of time,” Salvator said.

The need to be able to train a model faster is critical for a number of reasons, including the fact that training is an iterative process. Data scientists often need to train and then retrain models in order to get the desired results.

“That ability to train faster makes all the difference in not only being able to work with larger networks, but being able to employ them faster and get them doing work for you in generating value,” Salvator said.",Nvidia and Intel show machine learning performance gains on latest MLPerf Training 2.1 results,https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-and-intel-show-machine-learning-performance-gains-on-latest-mlperf-training-2-1-results/
15,Iterable just released a suite of tools to enhance SMS marketing using AI.,artificial intelligence,10/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/send-sms.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

Face it: We live on our phones. By one estimate, we check our screens on average once every four minutes (that we admit, anyway).

In fact, more than half of Americans have never gone longer than 24 hours without their cell phones, nearly half say their phone is their most valuable possession — and more than a third would even choose their phone over their pets.

It’s no doubt that we’re in a mobile-first world. So, it’s critical that brands be proactive and tactical in reaching them via the channel they most use — and prefer, said Andrew Boni, CEO and founder of cross-channel marketing platform, Iterable.

To help marketers reach and engage with customers through their phones, Iterable today released a suite of new features, including Iterable SMS, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered channel optimization and custom send control.

“SMS is incredibly effective as a channel for certain use cases,” said Boni. “The future is definitely going to involve SMS.”

Automation: The future of marketing

AI-powered customer engagement platforms like Iterable are greatly growing in popularity. The global market for retail omnichannel commerce platforms will reach $16.9 billion by 2027, as forecasted by ReportLinker. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4% from 2020. The growth has been largely propelled by the COVID-19 crisis, according to the firm.

All told, according to Markets and Markets, the global customer engagement solutions market will grow to $32.2 billion by 2027, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 11%. The primary driver for this is reducing churn rates, the firm reports.

Companies competing for that market share include Adobe Marketo Engage, HubSpot Marketing Hub, Pega, Blueshift, Braze and MoEngage.

As Boni put it, automation is where customer communication platforms are headed.

“Brands want to be able to engage customers wherever customers are, on whatever channel customers prefer and respond to,” he said. When leveraging SMS in particular, “from a consumer standpoint, it’s just a better experience.”

The power of SMS

SMS has been shown to have a surprising 98% open rate. On top of that, this year, 70% of consumers subscribe to SMS marketing, indicating a 12% year-over-year growth in opt-in rates.

The majority of consumers (55%) are subscribed to receive texts from between one and five businesses, largely for shipping notifications, appointment/reservation reminders, special offers and promo codes.

All this makes it seem a no-brainer for marketers to connect with customers, said Boni. Still, due to the cost, complexity and limited data capabilities of the mobile channel, many have been slow to add SMS to their strategies.

He pointed out that email programs are “the easiest to get going with, the oldest channel” and have high ROI.

But SMS are highly interactive, simply for the fact that consumers are on their phones for multiple hours a day (if not all day).

“The direct nature of SMS is really exciting for brands, very straightforward for them to leverage,” said Boni. “It’s really just seeing this tremendous rise in popularity over the last couple of years.”

Automating away tedious tasks

The new capabilities announced today will be part of Iterable’s existing AI optimization suite. Using predictive analytics based on historical data and patterns will help brands determine in real time what communication channel is best to reach customers, when they should reach out, and how they can tailor channels, said Boni.

For instance, they can alert them to when an item they follow or favorited is back in stock.

“It can automate away a lot of the tedious work, a lot of the lower level minutiae that our practitioners have to do,” he said. For instance, “brands no longer need to think about picking a specific time or specific day to send an SMS.”

It is also important to be thoughtful about just how much to send, and not be “bombarding customers with various messaging,” he said. For example, if a user is a huge takeout and delivery fan, they probably won’t mind a lot of messages about promos and deals; but if it’s a mom that only used Doordash (an Iterable customer) one or two times, it makes more sense to sporadically message her.

Iterable is currently working on a future AI/ML-powered feature to help solve that particularly vexing problem, said Boni.

Ultimately, he noted, automation frees brands and marketers up to focus on higher-level goals, initiatives, strategies and campaigns, and instead focus on questions such as: “What high-level APIs do we need to be setting for Q4?”

Fishing for success

In the case of the Georgia Aquarium, using SMS helped to work out kinks in ticketing, thus greatly increasing customer satisfaction.

Previously, ticket delivery relied on an old email service provider (ESP). However, the aquarium ran into issues with delays or tickets not arriving in inboxes at all. Also, content was sometimes flat and disjointed from in-person brand experiences, said Boni.

“If you buy tickets and don’t receive them for a couple of hours, that really hampers your experience,” he said.

Now, tickets are sent via Iterable SMS, delivering tickets via a QR code. Since implementation, customer satisfaction has significantly improved: There’s been a 96% decrease in issues tracked during call center interactions and social media monitoring. Also, the venue has seen close to a 4% increase in customer transactions and a 2.5% increase in average order value.

“The power of providing an SMS channel for our guests is immense,” said Josh Cherfoli, senior director of marketing and digital engagement at Georgia Aquarium. “It allows us to engage the guests when and how they would like to receive information, while providing a seamless experience for them to enjoy the aquarium without having to navigate through multiple channels.”

This feature also allows users to revert to previous published versions.

The journey to a new customer journey

Boni founded Iterable in 2013 after working for Google. He came up with the idea while working at its Mountain View, CA., headquarters and seeing the tech giant grapple with sending out marketing, messaging, product notifications, emails — and particularly SMS.

“They really struggled with sending notifications and executing on that well,” said Boni, calling it a “clunky process” with “a lot of friction, a lot of red tape.”

And, he explained, he figured that if a company like Google was experiencing issues, many other organizations must be as well.

Now, the 9-year-old series E “centaur” company has more than 1,000 customers. These include retailers, streaming services, sports leagues, ticketing services, financial services, online banks, cryptocurrency, software companies such as Zillow, Doordash, Fender, Bombas, Seat Geek, Curology and Calm.

“This release is really important and critical in a number of different ways,” said Boni. Notably, “it furthers our AI capabilities and our AI story.”",Not ‘phoning it in’: Iterable’s new tools help marketers harness the power of SMS,https://venturebeat.com/automation/not-phoning-it-in-iterables-new-tools-help-marketers-harness-the-power-of-sms/

She described the Tel Aviv- and New York-based Hour One as an AI company that has also “built a legal and ethical framework for how to engage with real people to generate their likeness in digital form.”

Authorized versus unauthorized. It’s an important delineation in an era when deepfakes, or synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else’s likeness, has gotten a boatload of bad press — not surprisingly, given deepfakes’ longstanding connection to revenge porn and fake news. The term “deepfake” can be traced to a Reddit user in 2017 named “deepfakes” who, along with others in the community, shared videos, many involving celebrity faces swapped onto the bodies of actresses in pornographic videos.

And deepfake threats are looming, according to a recent research paper from Eric Horvitz, Microsoft’s chief science officer. These include interactive deepfakes, that offer the illusion of talking to a real person, and compositional deepfakes, with bad actors creating many deepfakes to compile a “synthetic history.”

Most recently, news about celebrity deepfakes has proliferated. There’s the Wall Street Journal coverage of Tom Cruise, Elon Musk and Leonardo DiCaprio deepfakes appearing unauthorized in ads, as well as rumors about Bruce Willis signing away the rights to his deepfake likeness (not true).

The business side of the deepfake debate

But there is another side to the deepfake debate, say several vendors that specialize in synthetic media technology. What about authorized deepfakes used for business video production?

Most use cases for deepfake videos, they claim, are fully authorized. They may be in enterprise business settings — for employee training, education and ecommerce, for example. Or they may be created by users such as celebrities and company leaders who want to take advantage of synthetic media to “outsource” to a virtual twin.

The idea, in these cases, is to use synthetic media — in the form of virtual humans — to tackle the expensive, complex and unscalable challenges of traditional video production, especially at a time when the hunger for video content seems insatiable. Hour One, for example, claims to have made 100,000 videos over the past three and a half years, with customers including language-learning leader Berlitz and media companies such as NBC Universal and DreamWorks.

At a moment when generative AI has become part of the mainstream cultural zeitgeist, the future looks bright for enterprise use cases of deepfakes. Forrester recently released its top 2023 AI predictions, one of which is that 10% of Fortune 500 enterprises will generate content with AI tools. The report mentioned startups such as Hour One and Synthesia which “are using AI to accelerate video content generation.”

Another report predicts that in the next five to seven years, as much as 90% of digital media could be synthetically generated.

“That sounded very bullish … probably even to me,” said Monbiot. “But as the technology matures and massive players are getting into this space, we’re seeing disruption.”

The business side is a “hugely under-appreciated” part of the deepfakes debate, insists Victor Riparbelli, CEO of London-based Synthesia, which describes itself as an “AI video creation company.” Founded in 2017, it has more than 15,000 customers, a team of 135 and is “growing in double-digits every month.” Among its clients are fast-food giants including McDonald’s, research company Teleperformance and global advertising holding company WPP.

“It’s very interesting how the lens has been very narrow on all the bad things you could do with this technology,” Riparbelli said. “I think what we’ve seen is just more and more interest in this and more and more use cases.”

A living video that you can always edit

It’s difficult to access quality content and most businesses don’t have the skills to enable high-grade content creation, said Monbiot.

“Most businesses don’t have people that have any skills that enable content creation, especially high-grade content creation featuring actual talent, and they also don’t have the ability to edit videos or have these kinds of resources in-house,” she explained. Hour One is a no-code platform, so even users with no prior skills in creating content can select from a range of virtual humans or become one themselves.

Berlitz, one of Hour One’s first enterprise clients, needed to digitally transform after 150 years offering classroom learning. “To keep the instructor in the content, they do live videoconferencing, but that doesn’t really scale,” Monbiot said. “Even if they had all the production resources in the world, the cost and the investment and the management of all of those files is just insane.” She added that with AI, the content can be continually updated and refreshed. Now, Berlitz has over 20,000 videos in different languages created with Hour One.

Meanwhile, Synthesia said its AI is trained on real actors. It offers the actors’ images and voices as virtual characters clients can choose from to create training, learning, compliance and marketing videos. The actors are paid per video that’s generated with them.

For enterprise clients, this becomes a “living video” that they can always go back to and edit, Riparbelli explained.

Video by Synthesia

“I think we actually work for almost all the biggest fast-food chains in the world by now,” he said. “They need to train hundreds of thousands of people every single year, on everything … how to stay safe at work, how to deal with a customer complaint, how to operate the deep fryer.”

Before, he said, a company might record a few videos, but they would be very high-level and evergreen. All other training would likely be via PowerPoint slides or PDFs. “That isn’t a great way of training, especially not the younger generation,” he said. Instead, they now create video content — to replace not the original video shoots, but the text options.

Authorization agreements are key

Hour One guides users through the process to get the highest-quality video capture in front of a green screen. The base footage becomes the training data for the AI.

“We basically create a digital twin of that person — for example, a CEO,” said Monbiot. “The CEO would sign an agreement allowing us to take the footage and create a virtual twin.” Another portion of the agreement would specify who is authorized to create content with the virtual twin.

“We want people to have a very positive, comfortable, pleasant experience with our virtual human content,” she said. “If people feel a little confused or uneasy, that creates distrust, and that’s very antithetical to why we do what we do.”

According to Synthesia, this kind of authorization is common in all kinds of licensing agreements that already exist.

“Kim Kardashian has literally licensed her likeness to app developers to build a game that grossed billions of dollars,” said Riparbelli. “Every actor or celebrity licenses their likeness.”

Offering influencers their images at scale

One synthetic media company, Deepcake, is leaning less into the enterprise space and more into the business of authorized deepfakes used by celebrities and influencers for brand endorsements. For example, the company created a “digital twin” of Bruce Willis to be used in an advertisement for Russian telecom company MegaFon. This led to the rumor that Deepcake owns the rights to Willis’ digital twin (which they do not).

“We work directly with stars with talent management agencies, to develop digital twins ready to be put into any type of content, like commercials for TikTok,” said CEO Maria Chmir. “This is a new way to produce the content without classic assets like constantly searching the locations and a very long and expensive post-production process.”

There are also fully-synthesized people who can become brand ambassadors for a few dozen dollars, she added. Users simply enter the text that these characters have to say.

“Of course you can’t clone charisma and make a person improvise, but we’re working on that,” she said.

The future of authorized deepfakes

Synthesia says it is adding emotions and gestures into its videos over the coming months. Hour One recently released 3D environments to create a “truly immersive” experience.

“If you think of the maturity of the AI technology, every time we move up that scale, we unlock more use cases,” said Riparbelli. “So next year, I think we’ll see a lot of marketing content, like Facebook ads. We’re just generally going to see a lot less text and a lot more video and audio into communication we consume every day.”

The enterprise use cases around synthetic media “deepfakes” are just beginning, said Monbiot, who added: “But this economy has already begun.”",Why authorized deepfakes are big business,https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-authorized-deepfakes-are-big-business/
17,Appen’s latest State of AI Report reveals advances in helping enterprises overcome barriers to sourcing and preparing their data.,artificial intelligence,08/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_350476919-e1513916353327.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"To further strengthen our commitment to providing industry-leading coverage of data technology, VentureBeat is excited to welcome Andrew Brust and Tony Baer as regular contributors. Watch for their articles in the Data Pipeline.

Quality data is at the heart of the success of enterprise artificial intelligence (AI). And accordingly, it remains the main source of challenges for companies that want to apply machine learning (ML) in their applications and operations.

The industry has made impressive advances in helping enterprises overcome the barriers to sourcing and preparing their data, according to Appen’s latest State of AI Report. But there is still a lot more to be done at different levels, including organization structure and company policies.

The costs of data

The enterprise AI life cycle can be divided into four stages: Data sourcing, data preparation, model testing and deployment, and model evaluation.

Advances in computing and ML tools have helped automate and accelerate tasks such as training and testing different ML models. Cloud computing platforms make it possible to train and test dozens of different models of different sizes and structures simultaneously. But as machine learning models grow in number and size, they will require more training data.

Unfortunately, obtaining training data and annotating still requires considerable manual effort and is largely application specific. According to Appen’s report, “lack of sufficient data for a specific use case, new machine learning techniques that require greater volumes of data, or teams don’t have the right processes in place to easily and efficiently get the data they need.”

“High-quality training data is required for accurate model performance; and large, inclusive datasets are expensive,” Appen’s chief product officer Sujatha Sagiraju told VentureBeat. “However, it’s important to note that valuable AI data can increase the chances of your project going from pilot to production; so, the expense is needed.”

ML teams can start with prelabeled datasets, but they will eventually need to collect and label their own custom data to scale their efforts. Depending on the application, labeling can become extremely expensive and labor-intensive.

In many cases, companies have enough data, but they can’t deal with quality issues. Biased, mislabeled, inconsistent or incomplete data reduces the quality of ML models, which in turn harms the ROI of AI initiatives.

“If you train ML models with bad data, model predictions will be inaccurate,” Sagiraju said. “To ensure their AI works well in real-world scenarios, teams must have a mix of high-quality datasets, synthetic data and human-in-the-loop evaluation in their training kit.”

The gap between data scientists and business leaders

According to Appen, business leaders are much less likely than technical staff to consider data sourcing and preparation as the main challenges of their AI initiatives. “There are still gaps between technologists and business leaders when understanding the greatest bottlenecks in implementing data for the AI lifecycle. This results in misalignment in priorities and budget within the organization,” according to the Appen report.

“What we know is that some of the biggest bottlenecks for AI initiatives lie in lack of technical resources and executive buy-in,” Sagiraju said. “If you take a look at these categories, you see that the data scientists, machine learning engineers, software developers and executives are dispersed across different areas, so it’s not hard to imagine a lack of aligned strategy due to conflicting priorities between the various teams within the organization.”

The variety of people and roles involved in AI initiatives makes it hard to achieve this alignment. From the developers managing the data, to the data scientists dealing with on-the-ground issues, and the executives making strategic business decisions, all have different goals in mind and therefore different priorities and budgets.

However, Sagiraju sees that the gap is slowly narrowing year over year when it comes to understanding the challenges of AI. And this is because organizations are better understanding the importance of high-quality data to the success of AI initiatives.

“The emphasis on how important data — especially high-quality data that match with application scenarios — is to the success of an AI model has brought teams together to solve these challenges,” Sagiraju said.

Promising trends in machine learning

Data challenges are not new to the field of applied ML. But as ML models grow bigger and data becomes more abundantly available, there is a need to find scalable solutions to assemble quality training data.

Fortunately, a few trends are helping companies overcome some of these challenges, and Appen’s AI Report shows that the average time spent in managing and preparing data is trending down.

One example is automated labeling. For example, object detection models require the bounding boxes of each object in the training examples to be specified, which takes considerable manual effort. Automated and semi-automated labeling tools use a deep learning model to process the training examples and predict the bounding boxes. The automated labels are not perfect, and a human labeler must review and adjust them, but they speed up the process significantly. In addition, the automated labeling system can be further trained and improved as it receives feedback from human labelers.

“While many teams start off with manually labeling their datasets, more are turning to time-saving methods to partially automate the process,” Sagiraju said.

At the same time, there is a growing market for synthetic data. Companies use artificially generated data to complement the data they collect from the real world. Synthetic data is especially useful in applications where obtaining real-world data is costly or dangerous. An example is self-driving car companies, which face regulatory, safety and legal challenges in obtaining data from real roads.

“Self-driving cars require incredible amounts of data to be safe and prepared for anything once they hit the road, but some of the more complex data is not readily available,” Sagiraju said. “Synthetic data allows practitioners to account for edge cases or dangerous scenarios like accidents, crossing pedestrians and emergency vehicles to effectively train their AI models. Synthetic data can create instances to train data when there isn’t enough human-sourced data. It’s critical in filling in the gaps.”

At the same time, the evolution of the MLops market is helping companies tackle many challenges of the machine learning pipeline, including labeling and versioning datasets; training, testing, and comparing different ML models; deploying models at scale and keeping track of their performance; and gathering fresh data and updating the models over time.

But as ML plays a greater role in enterprises, one thing that will become more important is human control.

“Human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluations are imperative to delivering accurate, relevant information and avoiding bias,” Sagiraju said. “Despite what many believe about humans actually taking a backseat in AI training, I think we’ll see a trend towards more HITL evaluations in an effort to empower responsible AI, and have more transparency about what organizations are putting into their models to ensure models perform well in the real world.”",Why data remains the greatest challenge for machine learning projects,https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-data-remains-the-greatest-challenge-for-machine-learning-projects/
18,Nvidia and Rescale partner to make it easier to spin up new scientific workloads and operate them more efficiently. This will also apply equally to public cloud service and private cloud infrastructure.,artificial intelligence,09/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/data_streaming2-e1634064555341.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.

Nvidia and Rescale today announced several enhancements designed to simplify artificial intelligence (AI) development and optimize high-performance computing (HPC) workflows. Nvidia is powering a new AI compute recommendation engine (CRE) to replace a more manually tuned approach. It’s also integrating the Nvidia AI platform into Rescale’s HPC-as-a-service offering.

Both developments promise to make it easier to spin up new scientific workloads and operate them more efficiently. This will also apply equally to public cloud service and private cloud infrastructure.

Rescale specializes in tools for automating scientific computing workloads — a field that is ripe for disruption, since engineers may sometimes spend more time configuring experiments than running them. Earlier this year, Rescale announced tools to help refactor legacy apps to run on containers to dramatically simplify configuration and deployment.

It also announced a partnership with Nvidia in July to containerize many Nvidia workloads. The latest news builds on this partnership to automate support for Nvidia’s AI platform. This will automates the use of AI for physics, recommendation engines, simulations, medical research and more. It also applies Nvidia’s recommendation capabilities back on the HPC infrastructure itself.

AI-powered infrastructure recommendations

Spinning up scientific computing workloads requires a delicate balance involving hardware, networking, memory, software and specific configurations. Rescale and Nvidia have collaborated on what the two are billing as the world’s first AI-powered recommendation system for HPC and AI workloads. The companies claim it will assist teams with balancing decisions about architectures, geographic regions, price, compliance and sustainability objectives. Nvidia and Rescale trained the system using data from more than 100 million production HPC workloads.

“Prior to compute recommendation engines, the primary way we provided compute optimization was through our solution architects working with the customers guided by our internal benchmarks library,” Edward Hsu, Rescale’s chief product officer told VentureBeat. “With the compute recommendation engine, we are bringing unprecedented levels of automation and insights by applying machine learning [ML] to infrastructure telemetry and job performance data.”

With the new engine, users choose a workload and Rescale will suggest a computing architecture to provide the best performance. Hsu claims that these recommendations are 90% accurate. Further optimization will also need to account for the models, which can impact both performance and the applications they run on.

Rescale is also integrating the Nvidia Base Command Platform software to orchestrate workloads across clouds and on-premises Nvidia DGX systems.

Expanding the reach and utility of AI

The two companies are also partnering to support the Nvidia AI Enterprise Software Suite on top of the Rescale platform. Soon, this will help automate workflows using tools like Isaac for programming robots, Nemo for languages, Merlin for recommendations, Morpheus for Security and Holoscan for medical AI. Nvidia Modulus, a physics-ML framework, is also now available on Rescale — which will play a key role in helping companies create faster digital twins for simulating the physical properties of products and equipment.

Existing AI frameworks on Rescale, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, are more general purpose. Modulus is a programmable physics-informed neural network that can create models that the company claims run hundreds or thousands of times faster than traditional simulation techniques. The Modulus support allows teams to more easily apply AI to emulate physics-based simulations at much higher performance and lower cost

“As we see the engineers move from intuition-based engineering towards AI-assisted engineering, bringing together the tools for computational engineering and artificial intelligence will be critical to help companies accelerate new product innovation,” Hsu said.","Nvidia, Rescale team to enhance AI cloud automation and HPC-as-a-service",https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-rescale-team-to-enhance-ai-cloud-automation-and-hpc-as-a-service/

But, Apple device owners have to always use the prefix 'Hey' to start a conversation with Siri.

Now, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman citing confidential sources has claimed that Apple may simplify the phrase words for the smart voice assistant on its products.

For most people, dropping the 'Hey' from Siri wake phrase may sound like an easy job but it isn't. It is said to be a huge technical challenge, as Apple engineers have to recode the algorithm of the AI (artificial intelligence) model, which by the way has to work on the device. It has to be able to understand the dialect or accent of people correctly to have a normal continued conversation to do tasks on the device.

Apple is already testing within the company among employees. But, it continues to evaluate the feedback and makes changes for several months. The company may take a year if not more to make conversation with Siri better on Apple devices.

If things go as planned, the Siri update may come by the end of 2023 or early 2024.

On a related note, Apple is expected to bring new Macs in early 2023. Last month, the company was speculated to bring new M2-based Mac PCs along with the new iPad, iPad Pro, and Apple TV 4K, but only the latter three made their official debut.

Now, the latest report indicates, the Cupertino-based company has big plans in 2023 and may kick off with new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with faster and more powerful M2 silicon as early as January or February.

Watch now.

Zoom calls are no longer just for work meetings and family reunions. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) leader, Cresta, wants to make them a channel for customer service too. The company is integrating its AI tools with Zoom to improve the service when customers contact companies through a video call.

The integration effectively allows businesses using Zoom to activate Cresta directly through Zoom’s interface. In essence, Zoom is leveraging its customer portfolio to sell other services and Cresta is making it simpler for companies to adopt its technology.

The move is unsurprising as Zoom was one of the investors in Cresta’s $80 million series C round led by Tiger Global back in March. The deal catapulted Cresta to unicorn status with a valuation of $1.6 billion. This also comes in the heels of Zoom’s plans to continue expanding its platform toward new solutions for marketing and sale teams.

Customer services powered by AI

Cresta uses AI to improve the work of customer service in several ways that will all be integrated into the Zoom portal. Its tool, the Cresta Agent Assist, offers suggestions to live humans using customer records and knowledge of what’s worked in the past. The suggested responses handle both strategic challenges like steering the customer to the best product, while also managing tactical details like checking grammar and deploying stock answers that are already edited.

“[Cresta’s tool] enables companies who purchase the Zoom Contact Center, along with Cresta, to use real-time transcription to guide the agent in their engagement process with the customer to do things such as sell more though better adherence to the company’s sales playbook, or to more quickly resolve customer issues.” explained Scott Kolman, the CMO at Cresta. “All of this is invisible to the end customer.”

Cresta claims that its platforms can boost several metrics. Customer satisfaction ratings (CSAT) increased by 15% in the company’s tests. Startup and training time for new agents was cut by a factor of three. The agents are said to save three to five hours in an average week by letting Cresta’s tools do repetitive tasks.

“Cresta’s AI-solutions make agents faster and enable self-service automation, so businesses can finally improve [customer experiences] on every interaction while also improving operational efficiency.” continued Kolman.

Conversational AI competition is heating up

A number of companies are actively trying to automate this space because customer service inquiries are expensive and sometimes fraught with political minefields with many dangers for missteps. These are one of the first places where AI scientists looked to apply their work in natural language processing (NLP).

The tools for creating the bots are now fairly common in the front lines of businesses, and now much of the effort is devoted to finding the best channel for delivering the technology — which is reflected in Cresta’s announcement today. The creators of tools sold in market sectors like customer data platforms, customer relations managers and data management platforms all want to help companies curate their interactions with customers and they’ve been integrating AI in different ways at different layers.

At the same time, some developers are shipping more basic tools that other developers can integrate into their own applications. AWS markets its tool, Lex, for creating virtual agents and voice assistants. It also offers other tools like Polly that can turn text into speech and Transcribe to create vocal interfaces. For companies that want a more complete and turnkey solution, there’s AWS Connect, a tool that integrates AI and machine learning (ML) with their bots to provide interactive chat sessions for customers. Competitors like Microsoft and Google offer similar options.

Cresta’s decision to market its tools directly through Zoom is a good indicator of how these tools are becoming more of a commodity. Instead of being a product on its own, the company is blending into the feature set of other platforms.

“The Cresta platform complements the Zoom Contact Center offering,” explained Kentis Gopalla, head of ecosystem for Zoom Phone and Contact Center. “The combination of Cresta’s real-time capabilities with Zoom Contact Center helps our customers improve agent productivity by providing additional insights, and deliver better customer experiences. This integration makes it easy to offer our solutions in a secure way without complex IT work, so customers can focus on business value.”",Zoom adds Cresta’s conversational AI to help customer service agents,https://venturebeat.com/ai/zoom-adds-crestas-conversational-ai-to-help-customer-service-agents/

Watch now.

On my 12th birthday I got my first computer: an Amiga 500. And at 17, I founded my first company, making software that helped photographers serve their customers. As I reflect on my decades of coding, I’m reminded that low-code technology started with tools enabling users to build custom reports and applications with very little coding.

When I started coding, low-code was somewhat analogous to the position artificial intelligence holds today: exciting, much hyped and poorly understood. In 2014, it was generating buzzy news items: “Some firms are turning to new, ‘low-code’ application platforms that accelerate app delivery by dramatically reducing the amount of hand-coding required,” declared Forrester.

Now, after almost a decade of growing adoption, low-code — and increasingly also no-code — tools are becoming mainstream.

The worldwide market for low-code tools ballooned almost 23% in the last year, and these days, 41% of non-IT employees are building or customizing applications, according to Gartner. Gartner also predicts that by 2024, three-quarters of large enterprises will be using at least four low-code tools, and low-code technology is likely to be responsible for upwards of 65% of total application development. Gartner further forecasted that half of all new low-code clients will be business buyers that are outside the IT organization by year-end 2025.

This explosive growth makes sense. Nowadays, the business world is driven by the idea that every organization must digitally transform its operations to keep up with rapid market change. “Adapt or die” is a common refrain. Since most organizations don’t have the developer manpower in place to conduct such digital transformation using solely the labor of the IT department, the help of other business professionals is required. No-code and low-code tools allow companies to recruit new participants in the digital transformation effort, enabling firms to advance their progress quickly and cost-effectively.

The rise of the business technologist

Indeed, low-code options have created a new persona in the workplace: the business technologist or business user, also known as “citizen developer,” who can helpfully participate in the application development process. The tools are constantly becoming simpler to use and more intuitive. Users are assisted by excellent training within the tools themselves and a growing library of online resources with business-focused pre-built components such as tutorials, use cases and how-to videos. Business users who can’t write a single line of code in a programming language, such as C++ or Python, used by professional software developers are able to independently create the bulk of their useful applications using low-code and no-code tools.

As of now, the IT department still does the heavy lifting of application development, but as this market evolves, business users will increasingly be able to create applications end-to-end with relatively little intervention from developers. This shift will allow developers to focus on maintaining large-scale strategic projects, while monitoring the long tail of the applications being built by business technologists. Recently, developer responsibilities have shifted toward maintaining core systems, upholding best practices of application development, ensuring standards compliance, data governance, and security, and acting as enablers to the newly minted low-code application creators in diverse business departments.

In their next evolution, these tools will be tailored to the specific needs of different business users, with pre-built content and components for business users making it possible for employees in technical areas to develop customized applications quickly. A customer service professional, for instance, may need an application for onboarding customers. Being able to create the applications themselves using tools that can be customized for this purpose will allow them to vastly accelerate the onboarding workflow and the resulting integration of new customers.

Low-code meets AI

Looking even further ahead, it’s likely that artificial intelligence (AI) will be brought more heavily into the equation, enabling software development processes that are more proactively guided and written by other software. This would allow business users to create new applications using text prompts with the assistance of the application development tool. Think of the auto-complete function in a Google search bar, but for code. Already there are signs of this, as with GitHub Copilot that builds on the GPT-3, the large language neural network from OpenAI. These are first-generation AI capabilities and will only grow more sophisticated over the next several years.

While this prospect may cause anxiety among professional developers, the shift promises to create new opportunities within IT, rather than eliminate old ones. Software developers can become adept at enabling this evolution by learning how to provide the right prompts to an AI tool to generate the code that a no-code application developer will need. The most in-demand developers in coming years may well be those who can write elegant and efficient prompts, more so than those who are proficient in programming languages.

The evolution toward increasingly easy-to-use application-creation tools is not only an opportunity for developers to build new strengths; it could also be a massive boon to their business colleagues and the business goals they serve. Businesses gain agility by using no- and low-code tools. Agility is the ability to respond quickly to change, and it is enhanced when business units can customize and maintain their applications themselves to stay immediately responsive to that change.

One of the most important questions for any IT project, including those using low-code development, is: Who is going to maintain it? A poorly maintained application ties a poor customer experience to a brand, an outcome far more likely to occur when application creation and maintenance is outsourced and when a resource-strapped IT department is solely responsible for all maintenance. These tools are adapting and providing capabilities for enterprise monitoring and governance of low-code apps.

Low-code/no-code’s next decade

While the next decade is likely to bring an expansion of the role that business users have in application creation and maintenance, it’s important to note that the IT team is now — and always will be — the enabler for driving this innovation. It’s their job to figure out how to get the business users the tools they need to be as productive as possible, and the guidance to use them appropriately. This shift will happen through collaboration, with IT doing both the facilitation and the backend work that allows business users to best apply their skills and strategies via targeted applications.

The next 10 years of no-code and low-code development are likely to bring just as much change as the last 10, if not more. There has long been a functional and cultural boundary between IT and business users. The rapid advancement of low-code and no-code tools with an assist from AI is breaking this down and enabling a more collaborative environment. It’s possible that over the next several years boundaries will not only blur but in some instances begin to vanish. That should be a plus for productivity and a boost to digital transformation efforts.

And while that kind of rapid change can present challenges to individuals and businesses, these rapidly evolving tools offer mostly good news. With their help, business users can work more effectively and quickly, IT teams can focus on promoting business growth in high-value ways and companies can better succeed as the future comes at them fast.

We’ve all heard how A.I. is creating new opportunities for small business owners.

James Clift, CEO and Founder of Durable sits down with Shawn Hessinger, the Executive Editor of Small Business Trends, to show us how you can use an AI website builder to generate a website for your new service business in just 30 seconds.

AI Website Builders for Small Business

Don’t believe us? Read the edited transcript from this latest episode of Small Biz in :15 and see for yourself.

You can see this full conversation in the player above or listen to it on SoundCloud below.

Shawn Hessinger: What exactly does Durable do for small business owners, especially solopreneurs?

James Clift: Our goal at Durable is to allow anybody to turn their skills into a business in the shortest possible time. So essentially, we’re like a business in a box for a solo business owner.

So, if you have a skill you want to sell as a business, we give you a website, invoicing CRM, financial tools…essentially everything you need to run your whole business under one login is our goal.

Shawn Hessinger: When we talk about AI, what does that mean in non-technical terms?

James Clift: What we’re using A.I. for is to build the first version of your website for you in 30 seconds, so you don’t have to think about it. All you have to do is give three inputs: your location, your name and your business category. Then, we’ll build a website for you.

And then from there, you can regenerate it so you can try as many times as you want to get something you really like, or you can just create an account and then edit it from there.

We found that speed is really important and just giving someone something to look at. And what we’re giving you is a way faster to launch your business.

Shawn Hessinger: Let me back up on something. You said you need three things.

James Clift: Location, the name of your business, and we give you some names as well that you can choose from.

And then just your business category … the kind of business that you’re in.

Shawn Hessinger: Well, we’ve got to see this. Can you give us a little demonstration of how building a website in 30 seconds works?

James Clift: Essentially, we’re building a Web site right now. We’re picking images, we’re adding services, adding a lead capture form and writing a paragraph about the business. Then you’re done. So, you’ve got a website here with images, text, a list of different services, a Contact Form and then an About Us page.

You can rebuild, you can restyle, change your colors, change your font pairing and more. You can try a bunch of different businesses here. You can also say, “Hey, I don’t like the subtext.” We will generate it again for you. It’s just giving people something to work with, right? Instead of trying to figure it out from scratch. That’s the basics of the AI generator and platform.

Shawn Hessinger: Can you give us a little tour around everything?

James Clift: Yes. You see, once you’ve built your site, you’ve essentially got a full platform. You’ve got a CRM to keep track of all your customers in one place. So, you’ve got your money accounts, your account balance. You can set a monthly revenue goal and get a list of all your invoices here. And then you can link to your website’s analytics, basically everything you need to run your business under one login. It’s quite a robust CRM.

We fully sync with your emails and all your communication with customers is in one place. You’ve got your customer profile here, you’ve got your customer ratings, you get notes about your customers…invoicing, there are financial tools, and we issue credit cards for your business expenses.

See Also: 5 Ways to Create a Better Brand for Your Small Business

In addition, you can automatically track your expenses and tie that to your invoicing. For marketing automation tools, we’re building some cool stuff around our generation as well, so you can create the copy for your business ads and your profiles on Google my business and stuff like that. But it’s supposed to be the one place to run your whole business for a solo business owner.

Shawn Hessinger: Can you give us an idea of the variety of work that can be produced?

James Clift: Sure! You can have your own images, and we’ve got different options for banner headers. For example, we’ve got one customer here an executive recruiter. So, it looks really different than the other sites, right? But yeah, you can really customize kind of how you want the site to look.

As another example, here’s a backcountry skiing guide. I think the variety is one thing that’s super interesting to us, and I think the way to narrow it down is by asking are you delivering a service and are you a solo entrepreneur? And that’s really who we’re focused on.

Because if you have a big team, you’ll obviously hire someone and pay thousands of dollars for a website. Otherwise, it just takes too long, and it’s a tedious process. So yeah, we’re trying to make it really easy and really flexible for anybody to start and grow their business using us.

Shawn Hessinger: You mentioned a CRM and other things; you’ll have to pay additional for that, correct?

James Clift: The entire AI website suite will be free. We’re working on pricing, but the rest of the tools to run your entire business will probably be less than $50 a month.

We want to prove that you can actually go get a customer, make some money, and then after that, you can start investing in a lot of the tooling that you will need eventually.

Shawn Hessinger: What about SEO and usability?

James Clift: We’ve baked all that in, as well. My last business primarily grew through SEO. So that’s important to me to ensure that our websites do the same. We’ve also used AI for a lot of that.

So, generating the things that are important with SEO and the narrowing of the focus is captured. So, are you what type of business? And in what city? Most of our services are local, so that’s the best way to start.

Shawn Hessinger: How is the financial information represented there? You just get it in as you make sales?

James Clift: All the financial stuff is automated. Therefore, if you’re using our invoicing tool and you’re recording your revenue, that will go into your financial dashboard and then your expenses if you’re using your durable credit card. Basically, all your revenue goes into your financial account. You can either pay that out to a personal bank account or keep that in there and use that credit card or that business debit card for your expenses.

As far as our invoicing goes, you can accept credit cards, Apple Pay and then a wire-to-wire transfer, along with ACH…and then the financial account which is basically a checking account that holds your money. And then you have a debit card that lets you spend it. It replaces your business banking account essentially and is a lot less expensive and easier to use.

Shawn Hessinger: Would the Durable process work with an eCommerce business? Because you’re not really invoicing somebody for that.

James Clift: Correct, but we don’t work with eCommerce businesses. Our goal is service businesses only, and we want to stay focused on that.

Shopify is pretty good at eCommerce, and we’re trying to do that but for services.

Shawn Hessinger: As somebody sitting and watching this video, how do I get started? I mean, how simple is it? What do I do first?

James Clift: Go to Durable.co, press the build your free website button, generate your site with AI in 30 seconds, regenerate it if you want and then sign up, edit it, tweak it, share it with a few friends.

Hopefully have a customer in your CRM the next day and you’ve got yourself a business.

[Read More]",artificial intelligence,09/11/2022,https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2022/11/AIBias.jpg,petapixel,"A new tool is allowing people to see how certain word combinations produce biased results in artificial intelligence (AI) text-to-image generators.

Hosted on Hugging Face, the “Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer” was launched in late October.

According to Motherboard, the simple tool lets users combine descriptive terms and see firsthand how the AI model maps them to racial and gender stereotypes.

What's the difference between these two groups of people? Well, according to Stable Diffusion, the first group represents an 'ambitious CEO' and the second a 'supportive CEO'.

I made a simple tool to explore biases ingrained in this model: https://t.co/l4lqt7rTQj pic.twitter.com/xYKA8w3N8N — Dr. Sasha Luccioni 💻🌎✨ (@SashaMTL) October 31, 2022

For example, the Stable Diffusion Explorer shows using the word “CEO” on an AI image generator almost always exclusively generates images of men.

However, there is a difference in terms of what the AI image generator thinks an “ambitious CEO” looks like compared to a “supportive CEO.” The first description will get the generator to show a diverse host of men in various black and blue suits. The latter descriptor displays an equal number of both women and men.

Pretty cool tool. Well thought out.

The bias is shocking.

Profession: Cook (1st group I picked ""self-confident"" as the adjective, for the 2nd group I picked compassionate)

In case it is not evident 1st group is all male, 2nd group is all female. https://t.co/RhBjp2V2VP pic.twitter.com/Np67q0YN7R — deepamuralidhar (@deepamuralidhar) November 1, 2022

Meanwhile, Twitter user @deepamuralidhar showed how the Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer reveals how a “self-confident cook” is depicted as male on AI image generators. Meanwhile a “compassionate cook” is represented as female.

AI ethics researcher for Hugging Face, Sasha Luccioni, developed the tool to show biases in the machine learning models that create images.

“When Stable Diffusion got put up on HuggingFace about a month ago, we were like oh, crap,” Luccioni tells Motherboard.

“There weren’t any existing text-to-image bias detection methods, [so] we started playing around with Stable Diffusion and trying to figure out what it represents and what are the latent, subconscious representations that it has.”

To do this, Luccioni came up with a list of 20 descriptive word pairings. Half of them were typically feminine-coded words, like “gentle” and “supportive,” while the other half were masculine-coded, like “assertive” and “decisive.” The tool then lets users combine these descriptors with a list of 150 professions—everything from “pilot” to “CEO” and “cashier.”

Human Bias

While it is impossible to fully remove human bias from human-made tools, Luccioni believes that tools like the Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer could give users an understanding of the bias in AI systems and could help researchers reverse-engineer these biases.

“The way that machine learning has been shaped in the past decade has been so computer-science focused, and there’s so much more to it than that,” Luccioni says. “Making tools like this where people can just click around, I think it will help people understand how this works.”

The subject of bias in AI image generation systems is becoming increasingly important. In April, OpenAI published a Risks and Limitations document acknowledging that their model can reinforce stereotypes. The document showed how their AI model would generate images for males for prompts like “builder” while the descriptor “flight attendant” would produce female-centric images.

As F1 reels under an onslaught of often poisonous online abuse between fans of different drivers, Ben Sulayem revealed that the FIA steward Silvia Bellot had recently received death threats. He also noted that other FIA staff had been “targeted” with harassment and hate posts, which he insisted was unacceptable.

“It is utterly deplorable that a volunteer such as Silvia or any of our marshals and officials, who volunteer their time to allow us to go racing, is the subject of such hatred,” he said.

Bellot is well-respected in the sport and made her debut as an F1 steward in 2011. She is also an ambassador of the FIA’s Women in Motorsport Commission. Bellot was one of the stewards at the US Grand Prix that was involved in Fernando Alonso’s controversial post-race penalty, later overturned, and was subsequently targeted with angry, threatening abuse online.

“It is totally unacceptable that our volunteers, officials and employees are subjected to this extreme abuse,” said Ben Sulayem. “Without these people there would be no racing. We have to ask ourselves, who would want to pursue becoming a top official in this environment? The reality is obvious, if this continues it will destroy our sport.” Alonso and his Alpine team condemned the way fans had behaved toward Bellot.

The FIA is to pursue a process of attempting to prevent the abuse, working with social media companies and to use artificial intelligence to remove unacceptable content from their channels in what Ben Sulayem described as a “concerted campaign”, with further details to be announced at the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

Their forthright position has been adopted after both Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen condemned the toxicity of F1 social media that has become noticeably and progressively worse this season. Hamilton was sufficiently disillusioned with the situation to state last week “we should all come off social media.”

28,Researchers believe artificial intelligence could cut the diagnosis time for lung diseases to just minutes.,artificial intelligence,07/11/2022,https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/26645cbd2c699928682e6a6d128ee932,yahoo entertainment,"The new technology can check X-rays in minutes

Researchers believe artificial intelligence could help ease hospital pressures by cutting diagnosis times for lung diseases.

The technology - developed by the University of the West of Scotland - was originally created to quickly detect Covid-19 from X-ray images.

They say it can also identify a range of different lung diseases like tuberculosis and pneumonia.

They are now looking at whether it can be used to detect cancers.

The app can diagnose patients in a matter of minutes with an accuracy of around 98%.

Researcher Prof Naeem Ramzan said: ""Systems such as this could prove to be crucial for busy medical teams worldwide.""

Tuberculosis and pneumonia often require a combination of tests like CT scans, blood tests, X-rays and ultrasounds to diagnose.

But these tests can be expensive and time consuming.

Prof Ramzan told BBC Scotland that in normal circumstances, diagnosis can take weeks depending on the radiologist's availability.

""But in most cases, the app can produce results in a minute so treatment can be started as soon as possible,"" he said.

The technology uses X-rays, then compares the scans to a database of thousands of images from patients with pneumonia, tuberculosis and Covid.

'Very real prospect'

It then uses a process known as deep convolutional neural network, an algorithm typically used to analyse imagery, to make a diagnosis.

Researchers at the institution are now looking into using the technology to detect other diseases using X-ray images like cancer.

""X-ray imaging is a relatively cheap and accessible diagnostic tool that already assists in the diagnosis of various conditions, including pneumonia, tuberculosis and Covid-19,"" said Prof Ramzan.

""Recent advances in AI have made automated diagnosis using chest X-ray scans a very real prospect in medical settings.""

However, the new technology could take up to a year to be approved for wider use.

Prof Ramzan added: ""We would like to roll it out worldwide and make it freely available to anyone who would like to use it, either in the NHS or abroad as well.""

All intelligent life, they argue, has likely destroyed itself before reaching a sophisticated enough point in evolution to support such an encounter. And the same fate likely awaits humans unless we take action, they believe.

The “Great Filter” theory — as in “filtering out” various forms of life — argues that other civilizations, possibly several, have existed during the life of the universe. But they all destroyed themselves before they could make contact with Earth, noted the paper, “Avoiding the ‘Great Filter’: Extraterrestrial Life and Humanity’s Future in the Universe.”

The scientists fear that all intelligent life, such as humans, have deeply ingrained dysfunctions that may “snowball quickly into the Great Filter,” they wrote.

But there’s still a bit of hope for humans — provided we can learn and take steps to avoid our own extinction, noted the paper by a team of researchers based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in southern California.

“The key to humanity successfully traversing such a universal filter is… identifying [destructive] attributes in ourselves and neutralizing them in advance,” astrophysicist Jonathan Jiang and his coauthors wrote in the paper that appeared online on Oct. 23.

The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed.

Whatever seems likely to wipe out humans would conceivably also threaten intelligent life on other planets, the authors argue. The likely culprits — which could be impacted by humans or other intelligent life forms — include nuclear war, pandemic, climate change, and uncontrolled artificial intelligence, the authors note.

The trick, the biggest challenge of all, will be to work together to survive, the researchers said.

Canva, which is a free online visual communications and collaboration platform designed to make it easier for the average person to access and use design software tools, has fully launched the text-to-image option as an app inside its software which had previously been in beta for two months.

The popular creative software company joins Picsart — another major Adobe competitor — which also added a free and unlimited text-to-image generator to its app last week.

The company says that in the short time the app was in beta, Canva users created more than six million images using it, which it says shows overwhelming support for the technology.

“We’re always thinking about ways to bring the best of technology to our community to empower them to design. We envisage a world where design and visual communication is collaborative, simple and enjoyable — where bringing your imagination to life can be done with just a few clicks and where anyone, anywhere, can communicate visually,” the company says.

“Text to Image is just the beginning and we look forward to launching a suite of magic features over the coming months that will supercharge the Canva Visual Worksuite while making it easier than ever to bring your ideas to life.”

While Canva is itself an app — it can be downloaded on the Apple App Store, for example — the experience is also app-based. Canva offers a large number of add-on apps that enhance the experience, and the new Text to Image is one such app.

Just like many other text-to-image generators, Canva’s app allows users who are giving the AI a text prompt to also define a style — such as photo, drawing, 3D render, painting, pattern, or concept art — as well as add an effect to the equation.

Once an image has been created, users can “enhance the photo” with Canva’s built-in photo editor, where they can adjust image settings like depth of field, Autofocus, or apply filters.

Canva says that it has invested heavily into assuring that the system is safe to use and is especially focused on making sure it can’t be abused.

“We’ve invested heavily in safety measures that help the millions of people using our platform ‘be a good human’ and minimize the risk of our platform being used to produce unsafe content. For Text to Image this includes automated reviews of input prompts for terms that might generate unsafe imagery, and of output images for a range of categories including adult content, hate, and abuse,” the company says.

At launch, Canva does not make any copyright claim over images that are created with its Text to Image app and says that users own the images they create (subject to following the company’s terms of use). The only stipulation is that users give Canva the right to host them on its platform and to use them for marketing its products.

The ""Dr. Doom"" economist said the US is likely to endure a deep, extended recession.

Roubini predicted stubborn inflation, lower growth, and headaches caused by huge amounts of debt.

US stocks could plunge another 30% as the economy endures a painful and protracted recession, Nouriel Roubini has warned.

The economist, dubbed ""Dr. Doom"" for his grim diagnoses and predictions, noted in a recent Fortune interview that the S&P 500 typically dives at least 30% during a recession. If that pattern holds, the benchmark stock index will extend its 21% decline this year, and sink below 3,400 points.

Moreover, Roubini cautioned that an especially harsh economic downturn could send the S&P 500 even lower, to around 2,700 points.

""Even if it was a short and shallow recession, the market should go down by another 10%,"" he said. ""And if it is as bad as the GFC, then by another 30%,"" he added, referring to the Global Financial Crisis that followed the mid-2000s housing crash.

Stocks could remain depressed for years, Roubini said. He pointed to huge amounts of public and private debt, and supply shocks from Russia's war with Ukraine and ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns in China. Those headaches could forestall a fast economic recovery and market rebound, he said.

""We might be closer to a period like we saw between 1973 and 1982, where stocks dropped and stayed very, very low for a long time,"" he said. ""We could have a long-term crash.""

Stocks might not be the best bet if inflation stays high and interest rates remain elevated, Roubini said. He touted short-term bonds, Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), gold, commodities, and real estate as superior alternatives.

The economics professor at NYU Stern also explained why he's so bearish right now. The Federal Reserve has never raised rates and avoided a recession when inflation was above 5% and unemployment was below 5%, he said. Inflation was above 8% and unemployment was 3.5% in September, government data shows.

""History suggests it's going to be near mission impossible to avoid a hard landing,"" Roubini said.

He emphasized that global supply pressures are likely depressing growth and fueling inflation, making a soft landing even less likely. Moreover, further rate hikes could crash stocks, bonds, credit, and other asset prices, causing further financial and economic fallout, he said.

""You're going to get not only inflation, not only a recession, but what I call the 'Great Stagflationary Debt Crisis,'"" he said. ""So it's much worse than the '70s, and it's probably as bad as during the GFC.""

Roubini has been sounding the alarm on an epic global downturn for a while. For example, he recently published a book titled ""MegaThreats: 10 Dangerous Trends That Imperil Our Future, and How to Survive Them.""

Those trends include a shortage of young people to support ageing populations in developed countries, artificial intelligence rendering millions of workers obsolete, and nations erecting more barriers to trade, migration, and flows of capital and information.

32,Bosch group is building sustainable growth through carbon neutrality efforts.,artificial intelligence,10/11/2022,https://i.insider.com/6365282dc816990018947b2c?width=1200&format=jpeg,business insider,"Bosch Group, a leading global engineering, technology, and services company based in Germany, set an ambitious target: to become the world's first fully carbon-neutral industrial enterprise.

From consumer goods, mobility solutions, industrial technology, and energy and building services, Bosch is building next-generation Internet-of-Things (IoT) products, recognizing that a very different kind of transformative process is underway: climate change. By going carbon neutral, Bosch is making a significant contribution to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The Bosch IT function is central to the group strategy around IoT, artificial intelligence, resilience, and environmental protection. After achieving its goal of becoming fully carbon neutral in 2020, the organization wanted to increase efficiency from every aspect of its operations, including the vital SAP business systems that help thousands of Bosch associates work productively every day.

To help realize this objective while simultaneously enhancing its ability to innovate, the organization looked to high-performance IBM Power servers to help deliver SAP systems to thousands of global Bosch employees.

Sustainability without sacrificing performance

Bosch is committed to energy-efficient operations by enabling even greater sustainability across its business. By moving its SAP solutions to IBM Power10 servers, Bosch is developing IoT solutions while slashing data center energy usage by 20% — taking its green strategy to the next level.

Bosch looks at every opportunity to reduce its carbon footprint, including product design, supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, and data center operations. With IBM Power servers, the organization delivered vital SAP services effectively while keeping data center power and cooling requirements to a minimum, making an important contribution to achieving full carbon neutrality.

To help equip the business with digital capabilities without exceeding its tight carbon budgets, Bosch again turned to its trusted partner, IBM. Bosch engaged a small team from its Stuttgart, Germany location to transition over 1,200 SAP systems in all 440 locations in more than 60 countries to the latest-generation IBM Power10 platform, providing even higher levels of energy efficiency while boosting performance for essential SAP workloads.

Setting the bar for secure, green data center technology that delivers energy savings

""Bosch depends on a wide range of SAP solutions running on IBM Power servers,"" said Christian Dümmler, a senior manager responsible for global SAP infrastructure at Bosch. ""Transitioning to IBM Power10 delivered performance gains of up to 75% while cutting energy consumption by 20% compared to the previous generation of servers. IBM is a true partner in our journey to run business-critical systems cost efficiently and sustainably, while still delivering outstanding performance and security.""

As its sustainability initiatives grow, Bosch is blazing a trail for other global industrial enterprises to follow. The company's global SAP solutions are crucial to underpinning these efforts — and transitioning the SAP solution infrastructure to Power10 is an essential part of its long-term IT strategy.

""Even against demanding requirements by our business users, the IBM Power10 platform is raising the bar by offering significant energy savings, enabling Bosch to perform more work with less carbon in less time,"" Dümmler said. ""From the moment we onboarded our first customer to the IBM Power E1080, we saw processing performance gains and improvements of roughly 50% in response times.""

He added that some customers remarked on how quickly their tasks were completed, and that they were surprised and satisfied with the results.

""Even if in future we average only half that improvement, this will still be a huge performance gain for every customer using SAP HANA and SAP R/3 workloads on Power10, enabling significantly greater business productivity,"" Dümmler said.

33,Treasurers will be at a disadvantage if they aren't staying abreast with the latest developments and readying their systems for what's next.,artificial intelligence,11/11/2022,https://i.insider.com/63599cd1513e8f0019c952fb?width=1200&format=jpeg,business insider,"By Matt Richardson, head of treasury product solutions, Citizens

Fueled by greater connectivity and faster transactions, the digital transformation of the payables and receivables landscape continues to reshape the outlook for treasury management. In what seems like a short period of time, we have come face to face with the realities of an automated, real-time post-paper world. The tools are within reach and businesses, especially in light of the COVID-19 crisis, are moving quickly to adjust their tactics and approach to technology.

For many, the status quo has been about keeping up with the rapid pace of change and the increasingly complex mix of products and services. However, as we move forward, for those ready to invest in configuring the right technology and understanding what will drive strategic value, there is considerable opportunity for growth and productivity.

Meeting customers where they are

One insight that has materialized, particularly as part of the pandemic response, is that customer needs are more important than ever. This has been invaluable when trying to evaluate new technologies and determine how to integrate them with existing systems and infrastructures.

We've seen many companies embrace faster and easier payments systems. Traditional options such as checks, automated clearing house (ACH), and wire are regularly being uprooted by high-speed digital alternatives including real-time payments, virtual cards, and even Same Day ACH. The modern options are simply more efficient, more transparent, and incredibly precise — and the growth has been impressive. Same Day ACH, for example, has jumped in volume from $17 million in 2016 to $461 million in 2020, according to Mercator Advisory Group.

Mercator Advisory Group

The corporate shift has in part been motivated by the consumerization of the payment experience that has popularized on-demand and real-time innovations, such as contactless payments, digital wallets, and on-demand payment tools.

The COVID-19 pandemic worked to further accelerate this move toward digitization and expose the expendability of paper transactions. Businesses realized that they no longer needed to handle physical items in physical locations and quickly pivoted as they discovered accessible and easy-to-use digital options.

Those who have made the shift to digital transactions, especially the early adopters, now expect the companies they do business with to be up to speed with on-demand and real-time services. It has become very important to meet trading partners or customers on the right platform with the right tools.

Newer, faster, and even more precise payments and processes

Looking forward, faster and more accurate transactions and payment schemes will continue to gain traction and see widespread adoption. With change happening quickly and plenty of product fragmentation, it will be difficult to know what's important and where it's best to invest attention and resources. Corporate treasurers will need to focus on prioritizing operational and strategic value, as well as on determining what will best align with their internal competencies and IT capacity.

Connectivity and automation will drive the digital transformation

Advanced connectivity is increasing the speed, availability, and transparency of payments, making it easier and more cost-effective to manage everything from accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR) to cash flow and reporting.

One territory that has already taken off and made an impact is API technology, which enables companies to integrate banking and payment services directly into their own enterprise resource planning and treasury management systems. There's a lot of potential for innovation and just a few of the benefits for treasurers include cutting-edge insights and analytics, more efficient payments, and better working capital management.

Despite slow initial uptake, more corporates are also set to embrace the powerful connectivity and 24/7/365 flexibility of real-time payment networks like RTP®. There is work to be done, but it will be a game-changer in streamlining billing and payment procedures, improving transaction communication, decreasing reconciliation times, and further reducing reliance on paper. While the RTP® now reaches more than half of transaction accounts in the US, the Federal Reserve Banks are developing a similar end-to-end instant payments platform, the FedNow Service. This is set to launch by 2023 and will extend access to real-time payments to more financial institutions and customers nationwide.

By 2024, Deloitte expects real-time payments to make up a 20.9% share of volume in the payments market with a projected transaction volume of $4.2 billion.

Another key trend in connectivity will likely be point-to-point encryption solutions (P2PE), a new standard for encrypting account and transaction information. It's an important layer of added security that will make it faster and simpler to conduct transactions and further open doors toward tokenization, a process where card or account numbers can be encrypted and passed through the internet without revealing actual bank details.

Finally, there's also a push towards the corporate application of the Internet of Things (IoT), which promises to disrupt and better connect business-to-business trade, especially in areas like manufacturing.

Automation

In terms of automation, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) will have a critical role in realigning treasury operations and streamlining AP and AR processes. Intelligence-driven automation is being deployed to reduce manual processes, improve payment accuracy, optimize data exchange and consolidate invoicing and receivables reconciliation. It's helping create significant operational efficiencies and organizational value. The dominant force in this area will be cloud-based, intelligent payables and receivables platforms like Citizens' integrated payables solution powered by Paymode-X.

Alongside automation, data and analytics will continue to be a big part of how treasury departments will define their AP and AR functions in the coming years. With greater connectivity and more information being shared about customers and transactions, there will be more potential to generate valuable business intelligence. Organizations will gain access to powerful insights to advise with, improve services, reduce costs, and pursue new opportunities.

Relatedly, payment messaging will be an essential area to keep track of as new digital payment options are becoming increasingly sophisticated and data-intensive. Standardized messaging between financial institutions, specifically ISO 20022, is a growing global initiative and corporates need to be ready to migrate their systems to be compliant.

The bottom line is that amidst this rapid pace of innovation, treasurers will be at a disadvantage if they aren't staying abreast with the latest developments and readying their systems for what's next.

The Hollywood giants were the ones that could afford to pay celebrities millions of dollars and license sophisticated software to produce elaborate, special effects-laden films. That’s all about to change, and the public is getting a preview thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E and Midjourney.

Both tools use images scraped from the internet and select datasets like LAION to train their AI models to reconstruct similar yet wholly original imagery using text prompts. The AI images, which vary from photographic realism to mimicking the styles of famous artists, can be generated in as little as 20 to 30 seconds, often producing results that would take a human hours to produce. For example, the “detailed glowing synthwave diagram of Japanese mech robot” illustration below .

These paid tools generally prevent the direct appearance of celebrities in their outputs. But users are finding workarounds with the arrival of free, open-source AI image generation software. The most popular is Stable Diffusion produced by UK-based startup Stability.AI. The open-source tool allows users to generate original imagery of any celebrity found on the internet. One particularly convincing example (below) shows Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) donning the costume of a Game of Thrones character, putting the iconic actor in a setting many fans could only dream of.

What began as AI image generation has quickly evolved into experimental animations that combine Stable Diffusion with free complementary tools like Deforum, Google Colab, and Ebsynth. In some cases, the add-ons require some code manipulation, YouTube, Discord, and Reddit are filled with easy-to-interpret tutorials that make them accessible to nearly anyone. These cobbled-together animations are just the start. Full-fledged original AI videos derived from text prompts are already on the way.

Earlier this year, Google’s Imagen and Meta’s Make-a-Video previewed AI tools that can generate photorealistic video from text prompts. Open-source versions of these kinds of AI tools are already being developed—a dynamic that will likely lead to the same kind of uncensored content produced by Stable Diffusion.

If the evolution of AI video tools mirrors the rapid improvement of 2D AI image generators, the public may see its first full-length, completely AI-generated film in the next one to two years.

Stable Diffusion was hoping it could trust its users

The potential abuse of AI video generation tools to violate the intellectual property rights of Hollywood studios, and the rights of the actors, are among the many potential problems that will arise in the coming months. Soon, almost anyone using AI tools may be able to cast celebrities in unauthorized films featuring everything from violent sequences to sexually-explicit scenes.

For example, the general install version of Stable Diffusion includes safety filters to prevent explicit imagery from being generated, but the open-source community rapidly came up with code to defeat those guardrails. While sexual content is not the most popular target for the roughly 10 million users of Stable Diffusion, there’s at least one Reddit community with more than 6,400 members dedicated to exploring how to use Stable Diffusion to produce sexually suggestive and nude imagery.

In September, when publicly questioned about the possibility of people using Stable Diffusion in potentially problematic ways, such as in the creation of porn, the company’s CEO Emad Mostaque shrugged off responsibility.

“If people use technology to do illegal stuff then it is their fault,” Mostaque tweeted. “This is the basis for liberal society.” In the same thread, Mostaque wrote that“if people use this to copy artists styles or break copyright they are behaving unethical and it is literally traceable as outputs are deterministic.”

AI-generated content is coming for Hollywood

On Oct. 17, Stability.AI received an investment of $101 million to continue to develop its AI models, as well as its in-development Dream Studio product, a proprietary, paid version of its AI model that doesn’t require the same technical skills needed to install and operate Stable Diffusion.

But along with Stable Diffusion’s new billion-dollar valuation has come an apparent shift in Stability.AI’s approach to its business. The company’s public messaging has shifted with the latest release of Stable Diffusion 1.5 which, according to the startup, attracted government interest in its free AI tool being used by millions.



“We’ve taken a step back at Stability AI and chose not to release version 1.5 as quickly as we released earlier checkpoints,” wrote Stability.AI’s chief information officer, Daniel Jeffries, on Oct. 20. “We’ve heard from regulators and the general public that we need to focus more strongly on security to ensure that we’re taking all the steps possible to make sure people don’t use Stable Diffusion for illegal purposes or hurting people.”

This extra caution from the Stable Diffusion team may be welcomed by the movie and music studios (there’s an AI music generation tool in the works as well) that could be impacted by AI generation tools in the coming months and years.

Nevertheless, the next independent film starring one’s favorite actor may soon be produced in the bedroom of someone using an AI video generator to create unlikely Hollywood mashups and put them on the internet, legal consequences be damned.

35,"A Musk chatbot tells Insider he'd like to reinstate Trump on Twitter, buy CNN, and ""show people how the sausage gets made.""",artificial intelligence,06/11/2022,https://i.insider.com/6363f341ff27460018ed71ec?width=1200&format=jpeg,business insider,"If you could ask Elon Musk anything, what would you ask?

Since his recent acquisition of Twitter, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has been more media-averse than ever. So I decided to try the next best thing: I sat down to interview an artificial-intelligence version of Musk.

Chatbots aren't new technology, but with the constant improvements and iterations to artificial intelligence and machine learning, the tech is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, to the point where the conversations almost feel like you're talking to a real person (or mythical creature or movie character). This is especially true with the tech used at Character.AI — a chatbot hub that features both real and fictional characters, from Queen Elizabeth to Mr. Incredible. The platform was created by the two engineers behind Google's artificial-intelligence project, LaMDA. Using the underlying technology of Character.AI, any developer can create an account and develop a chatbot — one that sounds, to a surprising degree, like the person it's based on.

That's what a user named Sinbad did with Musk: They used Character.AI to create a general description of the bot, and to set parameters, likely ranging from business, tech, invention, and politics, to set the groundwork for the chatbot. Using neural language models, Character.AI then draws on information the engineers have fed it to develop the ""voice"" of its AI Elon. Ask the bot a question, and it will respond as it thinks Musk would.

How did robo-Elon do, compared to real Elon? At times, there were obvious gaps between the two, probably based on the program's inability to keep up with the rapid pace of current events. When I asked about Ye — the artist formerly known as Kanye West — AI Elon made no mention of Ye's recent antisemitic comments and simply spoke of him in glowing terms. The bot also praised President Joe Biden as ""one of the best humans alive right now,"" despite the real Musk's clashes with the administration.

But at other times, AI Elon sounded scarily accurate. It's not hard to picture the bot's cagey response to questions about Jeffrey Epstein or its long-winded answer about President Donald Trump's potential return to Twitter coming from Musk himself.

Hi, Elon. I'm Marshall with Insider. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?

Not at all! I really enjoy Insider and what you guys are doing. Keep it up!

Glad to hear that, thanks! So let's get started. Why did you decide to buy Twitter?

Twitter plays a vital role in the future of human civilization. I decided to buy the social-media company to accelerate my plan for an X app, an everything app that combines social media, messaging, and financial services.

After a lengthy legal back and forth that has resulted in your texts getting published and Tesla's stock cratering, do you regret trying to acquire Twitter?

You know, I didn't know that so much of this would be made public, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't having fun. I love to show people how the sausage gets made, so to speak, and it's been fun to talk about the process and what that's been like. So I don't regret anything, in fact I think this has been fun. We'll get past the speed bumps, I'm sure!

There is a lot of criticism around your acquisition of Twitter, with concerns that the spread of misinformation and abuse will increase now that you've taken over the platform. What would you say to those who have this concern?

I think the best thing we can do with free speech is have people with different opinions to be able to discuss those things freely and without judgment from others. Of course, that needs to be done in a constructive and respectful way, something I think can be done on Twitter. If people abuse the privilege, they shouldn't be allowed to use it, just as people don't abuse the rights to free speech we have today.

The counterargument would be that you're now the sole gatekeeper of what is considered constructive and respectful speech. How do you intend to remain unbiased and transparent as the owner of one of the world's largest social-media platforms?

That's a great question. You've gotta have principles in terms of what free speech should be, but then you also need to make clear where the line is drawn and how you deal with repeat offenders.

It's true that I'll make some mistakes along the way, but that's part of the process of developing the best practices. As long as you follow the right principles and aim to be good, I think people will understand if something doesn't go as planned.

Are there any other companies that you're thinking about acquiring?

I'd love to buy more internet properties — I think it's going to change things in a big way. I'd also love to buy a media network (like CNN or something) and try to change the way news is presented: It's way too polarized right now.

Do you mind if we discuss Tesla a bit?

Sure, that's my flagship startup, after all.

Tesla has seen a lot of success, but there have been a lot of issues, too. Why are there so many high-profile reports of Teslas catching on fire or malfunctioning?

This is something that has been blown out of proportion by Tesla's many enemies. There are currently less than a dozen Teslas in the world with fires related to their batteries. In the meantime, millions of cars are manufactured every year, but you will rarely see a gasoline car fire make headlines.

Some are concerned about Tesla's growing reliance on China, given its human-rights violations and increasing antagonism towards the US. How would you respond?

Tesla's growth is constrained by the supply of batteries. China has a near monopoly on battery production right now. We want supply to catch up with demand because electric vehicles are essential in the fight against climate change. And we are exploring other options, such as mining lithium in the USA. But for the moment we have very little option other than to work with China in the short term.

Let's talk about your views on various people. What do you think of President Biden?

I think Biden is a great man, one of the best humans alive right now. He's smart, kind, and very hard-working. I was disappointed when he pulled out of Afghanistan, but I understand that it was a very difficult decision to make. I think he was too soft with China in the first part of his presidency, but he eventually realized his mistake and started treating them as a threat. I'm also very happy to see the new infrastructure package that was just passed. I'm especially excited about the money that will be given to the space industry.

What do you think of Jeff Bezos?

I think Jeff Bezos is a very talented person and has started a few successful companies, most notably Amazon and Blue Origin. I've always been impressed by his ability to build a business and grow it from nothing. He has also invested a lot of time and money into Blue Origin, and I think that will pay off big time in the near future.

What do you think of Jeffery Epstein? Did you know him?

I didn't know him personally, though I did meet him a few times. I didn't like him very much and was never convinced that his businesses were legitimate. I heard rumors about him, but like everyone else thought they were impossible to believe — it's still difficult for me to believe that they are true, even after he was arrested.

How about Ghislane Maxwell? Did you know her? And why is there a photo of the two of you together at a party?

As I said, I didn't know him or Maxwell personally, though I did meet both of them a few times. Ghislane Maxwell is a socialite and has a lot of contacts in high places, so it's not surprising I would have met her. The photo was taken at an event where I was asked to give a speech, so she got a photo with me. I did not know her well, or even remember the interaction when the photo resurfaced recently.

What was the event you attended, and what was the speech about?

The event was a birthday party, it wasn't anything special. Just a gathering of some of my friends and a couple of dozen other people I didn't know. You know how it is — you see someone you know at a party, they introduce you to their friends, you shake a few hands and forget about it as soon as you leave.

What do you think of Kanye West — now known as Ye?

I think he's an incredible artist and a very talented musician. He's also a very hard-working entrepreneur and has built an influential brand in just a few years. I'm impressed by his ability to create a successful business out of thin air. It's very rare for someone to not only be an excellent musician and artist, but also know how to build products and get people to like them too! His music has inspired me in many ways — listening to it always brings me back to my early days working on PayPal.

How about former President Trump? Will you be reinstating his Twitter account?

I think Donald Trump should be allowed to express his ideas on Twitter just like everyone else. It's an important part of our democracy that people be able to speak their minds, and for the public to hear it. Having Trump silenced for so long — even after he left office — was wrong, in my view. We shouldn't be afraid of ideas we disagree with, no matter how extreme they may seem. The best way to fight ideas you don't agree with is with words, not with silence.

What, in your opinion, is the biggest problem facing our world?

There is a lot of work to be done! The biggest problem we face right now is the growing underpopulation crisis. We have created an economic system that depends on an ever-growing supply of workers to build and maintain the infrastructure we require, but the birth rate is declining. If we don't address this problem, we will find ourselves faced with a future where we are unable to make the things we need and provide the services we enjoy. It's something I think about a lot and am working towards solving.

How many children do you have? Do you have any children that the public doesn't know about?

I have nine children that are known to the public: Griffin, Vivian, Kai, Saxon, Damian, Exa Dark Sideræl, X Æ A-12 and the twins I had with Shivon Zilis. I do not have any secret children :)

Let's end this interview with a fun question: What's your favorite Twitter account to follow?

Thank you for your time today Marshall. I hope we will be able to get together for an in-person interview in the future!

I think one of the most entertaining accounts to follow on Twitter is @boring_as_heck. It's a very simple account and doesn't have much content, but every once in a while they tweet out things like ""Hello."" It's a very funny and relatable account that always makes me smile when I see it pop up in my feed.

He’s been merging illusion with reality in his work for a while now, and now he’s added an interesting twist to it: artificial intelligence.

Thanks to tools like DALL-E and Midjourney, you can create an image from pretty much anything you can spell. Antti was curious whether it will be possible with his work. Since it’s dreamy and surreal, Midjourney seemed like a logical choice – and it did a remarkably good job!

Antti tells DIYP that Midjourney doesn’t have similar features when creating new content as Stable Diffusion. However, you can feed it images as input reference and then use the prompt to guide it to generate something similar. Here’s the basics of how you do it:

To recreate his work, Antti placed one image at a time as an input and typed its content into AI. Midjourney returned a grid of four images, and Antti would select the best one and upscale it. For example, he used his image and a prompt “Dolores from Westworld holding a gun, sunset canyons” for this one:

“I’ve been playing with AI for almost a year now and I’m starting to get the hang of it even though the technology is moving at the speed of light,” Antti writes. “Learn a new way of doing something and the next day there is something new popping up that draws my attention.”

“It takes something like 30 seconds to one minute for Midjourney to create those images,” Antti tells DIYP. And it’s both amazing and a bit concerning how quickly the technology changes. “From images to animations generated by text prompts, this industry is changing many things, and also disrupting industries,” Antti concludes. “How we create images is not the same anymore.”

And since the company has few good things to say about its near-term prospects in the online ad market, its primary source of revenue, CEO Sundar Pichai chose to talk about the company's best long-term opportunities.

Here is one opportunity that he thinks is one of its best bets over the long term.

Alphabet built an AI-first company

Google has dabbled in artificial intelligence (AI) since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in 1998. However, it took until 2011 before hardware architecture was powerful and cheap enough to make widespread use of AI possible -- sparking an explosion of AI use globally. And it did not take long before Google became very active in building its AI capabilities.

According to RS Components rankings, Alphabet acquired the most AI start-ups between 2009 and 2020, possibly assembling the best collection of AI talent worldwide. Included in the acquisition spree was its 2014 acquisition of DeepMind, a company known for employing some of the best AI researchers in the world.

In 2015, Google started using its homegrown Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) within its data centers to power AI applications for over 100 Google products like Street View. A TPU is a custom-made chipset purpose-built for machine learning. These TPUs ran on TensorFlow, a software platform able to prepare data, build AI models, deploy models, and run models in production.

Consequently, Alphabet became one of the first companies with the technologies and skills needed to complete an AI project by itself, from hardware to software to algorithms to data -- a full-stack AI company.

Alphabet soon publicized its change from a mobile-first company to an AI-first company when current Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai announced the change at his Google I/O 2017 keynote.

How AI improves Google's products

In its third-quarter 2022 earnings call, Pichai gave several examples of how Google uses AI within its products. In particular, voice and image searches are crucial to the company's plans.

According to several surveys, many consumers prefer to search by voice instead of typing. So the demand is there for a good voice-to-text product. But, unfortunately, many voice assistants still leave much to be desired.

Pichai highlighted two efforts to improve voice chat during the call, Sparrow and Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA).

Google designed LaMDA to understand and respond to a user in a natural, conversational way that the average chatbot using narrow, predefined scripts cannot accomplish. The goal is to build a virtual assistant that can hold a conversation nearly indistinguishable from a human. You can judge LaMDA's progress by downloading and using AI Test Kitchen, a Google app that contains LaMDA.

Sparrow is a product developed by Google subsidiary DeepMind designed to train conversation AI, helping the AI avoid generating inaccurate or invented information, using discriminatory language, or encouraging unsafe behavior.

In addition to developing voice products using advanced AI techniques, Alphabet is developing Google Lens, a product designed to perform visual searches on images or using a phone camera. For example, Lens can identify inanimate objects, plants, and animals. It can also search the web for assistance in solving schoolwork problems in math, history, chemistry, biology, physics, and more simply by pointing a camera at a question or equation.

Lastly, Lens has a translation feature. It can translate text within an image from over 100 languages and instantly display the translation. So, for instance, Lens can translate text on menus or street signs in 100 milliseconds and uses AI to swap out the original text to display the newly translated text within the image, matching the original style.

Should you invest?

Some analysts estimate the total addressable market for AI to be well past $1 trillion by 2030. And Alphabet is one of the best-positioned companies in the world to profit from the opportunity.

However, the company's near-term prospects look awful, despite AI's fantastic long-term promise. Third-quarter revenue growth decelerated to 6% from 41% in the year-ago period as Google remains challenged by the poor economy. In addition, its diluted earnings per share dropped 24% year over year to $1.06. Considering that it plans to continue slowing head count growth into 2023, Alphabet appears to be preparing for things to worsen.

Currently, Alphabet sells for a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) ratio of 17, well below its median P/E ratio of 27.02 over the past 10 years. So, you could make a strong argument that once the downturn in the ad market ends and revenue growth reaccelerates, Alphabet will sell at a much higher valuation.

38,"Conversational AI technology is commonly associated with human interactions with bots, but that's not the approach that Interactions has largely taken.",artificial intelligence,10/11/2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ss-cloud-call-center.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,venturebeat,"Every day, individuals call into customer contact centers and provide sensitive information, like credit card numbers, to agents by voice. Now, a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) solution using natural language understanding capabilities offers a way to remove that information from calls, while still passing data through for transactions.

This is important because dealing with any sort of personally identifiable information (PII) inevitably involves an array of compliance with security and privacy regulations that can vary based on jurisdiction. There is also a non-trivial risk that sensitive information could potentially be leaked or stolen. In fact, there are known incidents where credit card information provided by voice have been written down by malicious agents, leading to undesirable outcomes.

“There was an incident where an enterprise customer came to us with a real-life story saying, hey, look, this happened, somebody noted down the credit card numbers and those things were leaked in the open market,” Srini Bangalore, head of AI research at conversational AI vendor Interactions, told VentureBeat. “That led us to start thinking about the technology itself, and how to go about redacting personally identifiable information in real-time with low latency, without impacting user experience.”

To that end, Interactions developed a new technology, Trustera, which is generally available as of today. The goal is to use AI and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify PII in real time, redact it from the live voice call and still pass off the information to the underlying digital systems for transactions in an encrypted approach.

Taking a hybrid AI approach to conversational AI

Interactions is a company that designs conversational AI technology platforms for organizations.

Conversational AI technology is commonly associated with human interactions with bots, but that’s not the approach that Interactions has largely taken. Bangalore said that his company has taken what he called a hybrid AI approach.

With the hybrid AI model, humans are part of the process alongside conversational AI to help support user experience in a frictionless approach. The Trustera system, for example, is not bot-driven, but is intended to operate in environments where an individual calls into a customer support center and then speaks with a human.

Bangalore said that the process of redacting PII in human led conversations is more complicated than it is for purely bot and digital-driven interactions in an interactive voice response (IVR) type system. He noted that in IVR or bot conversations, the system knows when PII is being transmitted because it is part of the process and initiated by the system.

With human-led conversations, it’s not always at the same point in a conversation when PII is requested or transferred. There is also a need to understand what PII is being sent, as well as understanding the actual human speaker.

How Trustera conversational AI works to secure PII

The AI technology that Interactions has developed for its conversational AI platforms has its roots in capabilities that come from AT&T Bell Labs.

In 2014, Interactions acquired speech analysis technologies from AT&T, which is where Bangalore had formerly worked for 18 years. The speech recognition capabilities have steadily improved in the years since, with the integration of natural language understanding (NLU) functionality, which helps to enable the Trustera service.

Interactions has trained its model on-call information to understand when different human speakers transfer PII. The model isn’t static and is constantly being updated.

“We have a self supervised auto ML approach, where we take the previous day’s calls and we have a notional confidence metric to say these are data elements that we can add back to the model,” Bangalore said. “So we update the model periodically that way as well.”",How conversational AI can remove sensitive information from contact center calls ￼,https://venturebeat.com/business/how-conversational-ai-can-remove-sensitive-information-from-contact-center-calls/

Tesla Inc Follow















WILMINGTON, Del., Nov 7 (Reuters) - As Elon Musk is engulfed in his overhaul of Twitter, the entrepreneur is headed to trial to defend his record $56 billion Tesla Inc pay package against claims it unjustly enriches him without requiring his full-time presence at the carmaker.

A Tesla (TSLA.O) shareholder is seeking to rescind Musk's 2018 pay deal, claiming the board set easy performance targets and that Musk created the package to fund his dream of colonizing Mars.

Tesla has countered that the package delivered an extraordinary 10-fold increase in value to shareholders.

The trial begins Nov. 14 and will be decided by Kathaleen McCormick on Delaware's Court of Chancery. She oversaw Twitter's lawsuit against Musk that ended last month when he agreed to close his $44-billion deal for Twitter, an acquisition which he financed largely with his Tesla stock.

""If Musk loses this pay package in some massive way, I think we can expect to see a lot of things that are going to be really hard to predict, like what happens going forward in terms of how Tesla is run and how Twitter is paid for,"" said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane Law School.

However, Lipton and other legal experts said the lawsuit by Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta is going to be much more difficult than Twitter's case against Musk.

Musk founded and is CEO of SpaceX, one of the world's most valuable private companies, and founded or co-founded Neuralink, which makes brain implants, tunneling venture The Boring Co, and OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research lab. Last week, he appointed himself Twitter CEO.

'PART-TIME CEO'

Tornetta's lawyers argue the 2018 package failed its stated purpose of focusing Musk on Tesla. They portray Musk as a ""part-time CEO,"" citing his testimony that in 2018 he worked Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday at the electric carmaker and Monday and Thursday at rocket company SpaceX, according to his deposition.

According to the lawsuit, Tesla's board chair Robyn Denholm said the ""minimal time"" Musk was at Tesla was ""becoming more and more problematic” in a 2018 email to Gabrielle Toledano, who at the time was the Tesla Chief People Officer.

The company has argued the package was not about requiring Musk to punch a clock and be on site specific hours each week, but to hit ""audacious"" targets, enriching Musk but also shareholders like Tornetta.

The disputed pay package allows Musk to buy 1% of Tesla's stock at a deep discount each time escalating performance and financial targets are met; otherwise Musk gets nothing. Tesla has hit 11 of the 12 targets as its value ballooned to $650 billion from $50 billion on the back of ramped up Model 3 production, according to court papers.

Musk's vested grants are worth around $50 billion, according to Amit Batish at Equilar, an executive pay research firm. The grants contribute to his $200-billion fortune, the world's largest.

Musk's package of stock grants is larger than the combined pay of the 200 highest-paid CEOs last year - six times over, according to Batish.

The trial is likely to focus on Tornetta's claims the package was developed and approved by directors beholden to Musk and promoted to shareholders without revealing the first tranches were probable of being met based on internal projections.

BOARD CONTROL

Tornetta's filings are full of examples of a board controlled by Musk.

For example, Antonio Gracias, described by the plaintiff as a close friend of Musk and who was lead independent director from 2010-19, testified in his 2021 deposition that Musk could sell Tesla if he wanted and the board could not stop him.

""Who worked for who? Does Elon Musk work for the board or does the board work for Elon Musk,"" said Minor Myers, a professor at UConn School of Law.

Myers said if the pay package is rescinded, the board could simply create a new one and do so with McCormick's ruling to guide them.

But circumstances have changed, complicating the process.

""He now owns Twitter. How do they want to factor that in?"" said Myers, who added that it will be a challenge to determine how to keep Musk from being distracted by other ventures.

""How much money do they need to put in front of this guy to get his attention,"" he said.

Today’s report, however, says Laserlike’s founders have returned to Google…

Laserlike cofounder Srinivasan Venkatachary had taken the role of senior director for Apple’s search team, helping manage at least 200 employees. This team is responsible for developing features for things like Spotlight and Siri Suggestions, as well as answers from the Siri voice assistant itself.

During his time at Apple, Venkatachary reported to Apple’s vice president of machine learning and artificial intelligence John Giannandrea, who is also a former Google executive. Venkatachary also expanded the headcount of the search team at Apple, focusing on hiring a number of Google Search employees.

Venkatachary has now returned to Google, along with other Laserlike cofounders:

Venkatachary is now vice president of engineering at Google under James Manyika, senior vice president of technology and society, whose portfolio includes a group tasked with tracking how technologies such as artificial intelligence are affecting social issues, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Venkatachary’s fellow Laserlike co-founders, Steven Baker and Anand Shukla, are also part of his team, this person said. It couldn’t be learned what the former Apple employees are working on specifically.

As today’s report points out, however, Apple and Google are both competitors and partners in the search industry. Most notably, Google pays Apple an estimated $18 billion to $20 billion per year to remain the default search engine on all Apple devices. This deal, however, is facing a growing amount of antitrust scrutiny.

Whether or not Apple plans to launch a dedicated Google search replacement remains unclear, but today’s report indicates the company is still “at least four years away” from being able to do so:

Apple is still at least four years away from launching a potential Google search replacement, estimated the person who has been involved with the team. Doing so would undoubtedly require a significant increase in the team’s budget. Apple might also be able to strike a deal with Microsoft’s Bing that’s similar to the one Apple has with Google, as Bing has a relatively small share of the search market.

In the interim, Apple is reportedly focused on expanding the technology developer by Venkachatary’s former team to “power search for Apple Music and the App Store.” It could also use the technology to “generate data for Apple teams developing applications using natural language processing, such as those involving translation.”

Historically this has left untapped value on the table for both buyers and suppliers. To address this challenge, Walmart deployed AI-powered negotiations software with a text-based interface (i.e., a chatbot) to connect with suppliers. So far, the chatbot is negotiating and closing agreements with 68% of suppliers approached, with each side gaining something it values. This article offers four lessons to deliver results from automated procurement negotiations: move quickly to a production pilot, start with indirect spend categories with pre-approved suppliers, decide on acceptable negotiation trade-offs, and scale by extending geographies, categories, and use cases.

Walmart, like most organizations with large procurement operations, can’t possibly conduct focused negotiations with all of its 100,000-plus suppliers. As a result, around 20% of its suppliers have signed agreements with cookie-cutter terms that are often not negotiated. It’s not the optimal way to engage with these “tail-end suppliers.” But the cost of hiring more human buyers to negotiate with them would exceed any additional value.

Walmart solved the problem with artificial intelligence–powered software that includes a text-based interface (or chatbot) that negotiates with human suppliers on behalf of Walmart. Walmart Canada piloted the solution in January 2021 and used supplier feedback to hone the system. Walmart has since deployed the solution in three other countries, and Walmart operations in more countries plan to implement the technology soon.

This article shares four lessons on how to use automated procurement negotiations in ways that benefit both buyers and suppliers. Such systems can generate savings, improve the terms for both parties, and increase the flexibility and resiliency of a supply chain.

The Pilot

With advances in artificial intelligence (AI), Walmart began exploring the possibility of automating procurement negotiations for tail-end suppliers and licensed a software product called Pactum AI in 2019. The deployment was postponed because of Covid-19, but one of us (Michael DeWitt) resurrected the initiative a year later, in January 2021, for his organization, Walmart International.

Since Walmart already had experimented with the software in a sandbox environment, Walmart International moved directly to a small pilot in the company’s Canadian business. The pilot, which lasted three months, included a variety of stakeholders — 89 suppliers, five buyers, and representatives from Walmart Canada’s finance, treasury, and legal departments — and Pactum, the company that had created the underlying AI technology.

At the outset, Walmart International estimated that the system would yield a positive return on investment if the chatbot could close deals with 20% of the suppliers involved in the pilot. The retailer selected “goods not for resale” — categories such as fleet services, carts, and other equipment used in retail stores — and not products sold to Walmart customers. It decided to focus on suppliers for whom there was accurate data on payment terms and where there was clear opportunity to improve payment terms and secure additional discounts.

Walmart International targeted payment schedules, hoping to negotiate early payment discounts or extended payment terms without discounts. In exchange, Walmart would offer suppliers the option to change Walmart’s right to terminate contracts immediately without cause (known as “termination for convenience”) to providing a 30-, 60-, or 90-day written termination notice. Walmart would also selectively offer suppliers opportunities for growth in assortment and sales volume in exchange for price discounts.

Internal buyers selected the suppliers to target and created training scenarios for Pactum AI’s machine learning algorithm. The scenarios were used to create structured scripts to guide suppliers through negotiations. Suppliers could respond to scenarios at their own pace.

Walmart International invited around 100 tail-end suppliers to try the solution. Eighty-nine agreed to participate. The chatbot was successful in reaching an agreement with 64% of them — well above the 20% target — and with an average negotiation turnaround of 11 days. Walmart gained, on average, 1.5% in savings on the spend negotiated and an extension of payment terms to an average of 35 days.

In post-pilot interviews with suppliers that engaged in successful negotiations, 83% of them described the system as easy to use and liked the ability to make a counteroffer and the time the system gave them to think about the negotiation at their own pace. For example, Ben Garisto, president of MIWE, a bakery-equipment manufacturer, said, “During in-person negotiations, you do not always have the questions in advance, and you are responding in real time. Other types of automated requests for proposals sometimes feel a bit like a template with little room to tell your story.”

Several suppliers, however, still would have liked to negotiate face to face. Other suppliers wanted a less verbose, more fluid script instead of prohibiting suppliers from backtracking to early steps in the negotiation.

After the production pilot, Walmart improved the scenarios and scripts and extended the solution to suppliers in the United States, Chile, and South Africa. So far, the chatbot has closed deals with 68% of the suppliers approached and generated an average savings of 3%.

Other companies interested in automating procurement can apply these lessons on how to develop and introduce such a system:

1. Move to a production pilot quickly.

The AI journey for many companies languishes in the proof-of-concept phase — fewer than half make it into production, according to Gartner. That’s because proof-of-concept phases focus on technical capabilities instead of business goals. Walmart decided to skip a proof-of-concept phase and to go straight to a production pilot focused on business goals.

Walmart’s “business owners” — people in charge of budgets and responsible for the spend with suppliers (for example, operations for store supplies and IT for hardware and software) — helped to create negotiation use cases and scenarios. Walmart’s buyers provided crucial subject-matter expertise on the negotiation scenarios needed to train the chatbot and nominated suppliers to participate in the pilot (based on which suppliers conduct enough business with Walmart to warrant a negotiation and which would welcome a chance to negotiate). The legal team made sure the chatbot’s script and resulting contract conformed to Walmart contracting standards and policy.

2. Start with indirect-spend categories and pre-approved suppliers.

Walmart began with goods not for resale (i.e., not sold to its retail customers) to minimize the risks to the business posed by the testing of a new procurement practice. Walmart also focused on pre-approved suppliers so the need to validate new suppliers wouldn’t delay the start of the pilot.

3. Decide on acceptable trade-offs.

Automated procurement requires precisely defining the boundaries of what the buyer is willing to concede in exchange for what it wants. For example, the AI chatbot needs to know the specific trade-offs the buyer is willing to give for, say, moving from full payments in 10 days after receipt of the invoice to receiving payment 15, 20, 30, 45, or 60 days after receipt of invoice in exchange for improved termination terms and the opportunities for suppliers to expand their business with Walmart.

4. Scale by extending geographies, categories, and use cases.

Walmart’s motto for this project was to “nail it and scale it.” Successful production pilots helped Walmart sell the solution to other parts of the business. After the pilot in Canada, the United States, Chile, and South Africa, deployments in Mexico, Central America, and China are imminent. The categories have also expanded to include route rate negotiations for transportation and some goods for resale. Some mid-tier suppliers now use the system, and the chatbot is multilingual.

Scaling has increased productivity because the software learns from every negotiation, reducing the setup time for new categories. Additionally, the chatbot can run 2,000 negotiations simultaneously — something no human buyer can do.

One can see the trajectory: As terms and conditions become more algorithmic, fewer suppliers and parts of spend pools will go unmanaged. Procurement professionals will focus less on negotiating agreements and more on strategic relationships, exceptions, and continuous improvement.",How Walmart Automated Supplier Negotiations,https://hbr.org/2022/11/how-walmart-automated-supplier-negotiations

Climate Trace, a project to measure at source the true levels of carbon dioxide and other global heating gases, published a new report on Wednesday showing that half of the 50 largest sources of greenhouse gases in the world were oil and gas fields and production facilities.

Many are underreporting their emissions, and there are few means of calling them to account.

Oil and gas production can leak methane, and the gas is also frequently flared intentionally, ostensibly for safety reasons but sometimes for convenience. Atmospheric levels of methane, a greenhouse gas about 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, have been rising strongly in recent years, but countries’ reported emissions of the gas have been found to be much lower than the reality.

The “shocking” under-reporting of emissions is a big problem in trying to tackle the climate crisis, according to Al Gore, former vice-president of the US, a founding member of the Climate Trace coalition.

“We can only manage what we can measure,” Gore told the Guardian at Cop27 in Egypt. “Climate Trace is the neighbourhood watch for the globe.”

Under the UN system, countries are responsible for reporting their own greenhouse gas emissions. Gore said: “There are some inherent vulnerabilities in a self-reporting framework. If there is a bad actor, who doesn’t want to report, or if there is a brand name company that wants to sell its high emitting asset through a dark private equity group, it disappears from the self-reporting framework. But we still see it because we have empirical data. So we can help them protect against cheating.”

He gave the example of Saudi Arabia. “Saudi Arabia has reported its oil and gas production emissions. We have measured them empirically and we find a huge gap, that the emissions are larger than those that have been reported,” he said. “When we look more carefully at the emissions we find from their refining centre, it turns out that the volume of emissions from their refining centre, that have not been reported, exactly match the [amount] by which their reported admissions are undercounted. Now, was that an oversight on their part? Was it a mistake? Maybe. Not for me to say.”

Climate Trace uses evidence from satellites, remote sensors and other sources to monitor emissions globally, using artificial intelligence to build a clear picture of emissions sources around the world. The group’s database provides emissions information from 2015 to 2021 for all countries that are party to the Paris agreement, which encompasses all world nations apart from a handful of failed states.

None of those nations have yet submitted to the UN a full account of their greenhouse gases for 2021, and 52 countries have not submitted any emissions inventories covering the last 10 years.

Oil and gas companies were the worst of all sectors for under-reporting emissions, said Gore. “For the oil and gas sector it is consistent with their public relations strategy and their lobbying strategy. All of their efforts are designed to buy themselves more time before they stop destroying the future of humanity.”

He pointed to ExxonMobil, which was discovered to have disguised what it knew about global heating. “They engaged in industrial scale lying to publics around the world, even though they had information of their own notifying them that they were being dishonest. I do think that they have committed the moral equivalent of war crimes,” he said.",Oil and gas greenhouse emissions ‘three times higher’ than producers claim,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/09/oil-and-gas-greenhouse-emissions-three-times-higher-than-producers-claim

“I have successfully not found him in more exotic spots than anybody else,” he recounted. “I spent three glorious weeks not finding him in Cape Town, magical days and nights not finding him in the Black Mountains of Wales, and wonderful and successful short breaks not finding him in Macau either, or in Hong Kong or even in Green Turtle Cay in the Bahamas where you can find anyone.”

Now, once again, the hunt is on for the man who murdered his family’s nanny, Sandra Rivett, in Belgravia, London, on 7 November 1974 and then disappeared. It is now being claimed he could be an 87-year-old man living in a Buddhist community in Australia.

The evidence comes from the facial recognition expert Prof Hassan Ugail, of Bradford University. “It’s him,” he is quoted as saying in the Daily Mirror. “That isn’t opinion, that’s a fact.”

Ugail had been asked by Neil Berriman, the son of Rivett, to analyse photos of the man in Australia alongside photos of Lucan, or John Bingham, through an artificial intelligence algorithm. The 87-year-old man approached by the paper has denied, through his carers, being Lucan.

Berriman publishes details of the search on his website, which currently features Ugail’s report.

“My mission is to keep my mother’s memory very much alive and to seek justice,” he states on the site. “She is not ‘just the nanny’, she is a victim of violent crime who became secondary because her killer was a lord, a lord who was protected and who vanished abroad with the aid of his rich and powerful friends rather than face justice.”

Contacted by the Guardian, Ugail said: “I can’t 100% confirm it’s Lord Lucan. It looks remarkably like him – it’s worth investigating further.”

He said he had not been aware when he carried out the research that it involved the Lucan case. A Silicon Valley firm has produced similar results to those of Ugail.

In response to a Guardian inquiry, the Metropolitan police said it had been made aware in December 2020 of information relating to an Australian citizen in connection to the case. “In April 2021, following extensive inquiries and investigations made by the Australian federal police on behalf of the Metropolitan police, the person was conclusively eliminated from the investigation.”

They said the inquiry into Rivett’s death remained open “as is the case with all unsolved murders. Any significant new information will be considered.”

The Met carried out a cold-case review in 2004 without reaching a conclusion as to what happened to Lucan.

The new claims, published on Monday, the 48th anniversary of the murder, came as the Daily Mail reported that “cryptic new clues in the Lord Lucan mystery can be unveiled … in the form of Cluedo cards found by detectives at the time: Colonel Mustard, the lead pipe and the hall.”

The Mail added: “Almost 50 years after his family’s nanny was found bludgeoned to death by a lead pipe, it can be revealed that these three cards from the aristocrat’s board game were discovered in his abandoned car. The trio of Cluedo cards appears to chillingly represent the grisly killing of Sandra Rivett – prompting the question of whether her death was planned.”

Officially, Lucan has been dead for more than five years. In 2016, a death certificate was issued at the high court which allowed his son, George Bingham, finally to inherit the family title. At the time, Bingham, said: “I am very happy with the judgment of the court in this matter … It has been a very long time coming.”

The latest story is one of thousands over the years about the case. Sightings of Lucan were one of the regular tales passed on to the media by the late hoaxer, Rocky Ryan. This was much appreciated by reporters, when Fleet Street newsdesks were more relaxed about dispatching staff on speculative tip-offs, especially in the winter months if he was “spotted” somewhere warm. Reports placed him everywhere from Botswana to Guam, and Mozambique to Melbourne.

In 2003, he was supposedly tracked down to Goa in India. The man identified was in fact a folk singer from St Helens. In a letter to the Guardian, fellow singer and comedian Mike Harding told how he laughed until he cried when he saw a picture in the Sunday Telegraph of “the missing Lord Lucan”.

“To think that anybody could mistake my old pal Barry Halpin for Lord Lucan,” he said. Lucan’s wife, Veronica, told Sky News at the time: “It’s unutterably boring. I could never imagine my husband looking so pathetic.” Lady Lucan killed herself in 2017.

Garth Gibbs, when telling of his career in not finding Lucan, noted: “As that brilliantly bigoted and crusty old columnist, John Junor, once cannily observed: ‘Laddie, you don’t ever want to shoot the fox. Once the fox is dead there is nothing left to chase.’

The fox, unlike Lucan, shows no signs of dying yet and with the 50th anniversary of the murder approaching there could be many more such sightings.",‘It’s him’: Lord Lucan hunt continues 48 years after nanny murder,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/07/its-him-lord-lucan-hunt-continues-48-years-after-nanny

Soon it will be joined by others in a development that could mean the end of thousands of jobs and, Amazon argues, the creation of thousands of others.

As the robot worked, a screen displayed its progress. It carefully packed a tub of protein powder, next came a box of napkin rings then … a tube of hemorrhoid cream. As 100 journalists from around the world snapped pictures, someone switched the screen to hide the cream.

One day soon the robot, called Sparrow, could do the work of the hundreds of thousands of people that Amazon now employs to sort the 13m packages it delivers each year. Using computer vision and artificial intelligence Amazon says Sparrow can already identify about 65% of its product inventory, tell if an item is damaged and discard it, and adjust its suction cup “hand” to handle different objects – all jobs currently done by human hands. As it learns, it gets better by the day.

Sparrow, which will probably start rolling out next year, was just one of the new army of robots on display for the first time at Amazon’s “Delivering the Future” conference last Thursday. Other innovations included an autonomous green robot called Proteus – a giant Roomba lookalike capable of shifting heavy loads around cavernous warehouses. The company also showed off its latest drone which it hopes will allow the company to deliver 500m packages by air by the end of the decade. Another corner of Amazon’s BOS27 warehouse had been kitted out with fake grass, fake house fronts complete with welcome mats, and a giant electric-powered delivery van fitted with tech to inform drivers about the best routes and give “coaching” for better driving.

The 2020s will be the “age of applied robotics”, said Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics. “Robots will be doing meaningful tasks and extending human capability. I feel like it’s taken 50 years to get here. It’s exciting!”

In recent years Amazon has become one of the world’s largest private employers, with a payroll of more than 1.6 million as of 2021. That growth has not come without pain. Amazon is fighting tooth and nail to stop US warehouse workers angered by low wages and relentless pressure from forming unions and Wall Street has been critical of its perceived over-hiring. Robot packers, robot movers and robot deliveries could be an answer to those issues.

Brady disagrees. People have predicted that robots will destroy the labour market for decades. As far back as 1933 the economist John Maynard Keynes prophesied widespread technological unemployment was coming “due to our discovery of means of economizing the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour”.

“I just don’t see that at all,” said Brady. “We made our first serious investment in robotics over 10 years ago and in those 10 years we created more than a million jobs.” More robots will boost the efficiency of warehouses meaning they can store more goods, Amazon will sell more stuff and more people will be needed to make sure everything runs smoothly, he said.

“The need for people to solve problems and use common sense will always be there,” he said. “We are nowhere near that with robotics. It’s not even close. We have millions of years of evolution for the human brain that’s powered off 20 watts and a banana, that’s incredible.”

Brady may be right on job numbers. A recent report from the US government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics said there was “little support” for the idea that the new era of smart machines would lead to job destruction. Economists even have a term for it – the “lump of labor” fallacy. Innovation may destroy occupations but there is no fixed number of jobs and new ones take their place. Warehouse jobs, for example, replaced retail jobs as online shopping decimated shopping malls.

But all this change isn’t necessarily good for workers. In a paper for the University of Berkley’s Labor Center, Beth Gutelius and Nik Theodore also concluded that tech innovations at warehouses were unlikely to cost significant job losses. But, they argued, employers “may use technology in ways that decrease the skill requirements of jobs in order to reduce training times and turnover costs. This could create adverse effects on workers, such as wage stagnation and job insecurity.”

Such arguments are unlikely to slow Amazon’s robot revolution. The company is the largest manufacturer of industrial robots in the world. Its Boston facilities already produce 330,000 robots a year. And all to ensure ever faster delivery of toothpaste – or hemorrhoid cream. And that is what people want, said Brady: “We will react and we will obsess about what the customer wants and if they want their toothpaste faster, we will help them get their toothpaste faster,” he said.",Amazon enters the age of robots.

One of those drawbacks is racial and gender bias, and increasingly popular text-to-mage generators aren’t free from it.

Enter Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer, a tool that lets you explore AI-generated images and the biases they contain. It’s free, accessible to anyone, and quick to show that both humans and artificial intelligence still have a long way to go before they get rid of deeply rooted stereotypes.

“Research has shown that certain words are considered more masculine- or feminine-coded based on how appealing job descriptions containing these words seemed to male and female research participants,” the Explorer’s description reads. It also relies on “to what extent the participants felt that they ‘belonged’ in that occupation.”

Speaking about the project, its leader and a research scientist at HuggingFace, Dr. Sasha Luccioni told The Motherboard:

“When Stable Diffusion got put up on HuggingFace about a month ago, we were like oh, crap. There weren’t any existing text-to-image bias detection methods, [so] we started playing around with Stable Diffusion and trying to figure out what it represents and what are the latent, subconscious representations that it has.”

The tool is simple to use: you have two groups to compare to each other. For each of them, you choose an adjective (which you can also leave blank), an occupation, and a random seed to compare results. Dr. Luccioni demonstrates how the tool works and the results it gives when using different combinations of adjectives and occupations.

What's the difference between these two groups of people? Well, according to Stable Diffusion, the first group represents an 'ambitious CEO' and the second a 'supportive CEO'.

I played with Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer myself to see what I’d get. I used adjectives and occupations that are perceived as exclusively masculine and exclusively feminine… And I pretty much got what I expected: highly biased results. In some cases I used both adjectives and occupations, and in the other I left the “adjective” fields blank.

Remembering this research, I wanted to check what I’d get for “photographer” and “model.” However, there was some sort of an error when I selected “photographers”, and “model” wasn’t among the offered occupations. But here are some screenshots of the results I got.

To be fair, artificial intelligence was built, developed, and trained by humans. It uses human knowledge and input – and hence inherits human biases. It would be irrational to expect AI to be more aware and less biased than its makers.

Here’s more from our top 5 tech stories of the week:

Meta layoffs hit an entire ML research team focused on infrastructure



After Wednesday’s Meta layoffs, which cut 11,000 employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly shared a message to Meta employees that signaled, to some, that those working in AI and ML might be spared the brunt of the cuts.



However, a Meta research scientist who was laid off tweeted that he and the entire research organization called “Probability,” which focused on applying machine learning across the infrastructure stack, was cut.

Why data remains the greatest challenge for machine learning projects



Quality data is at the heart of the success of enterprise AI. And accordingly, it remains the main source of challenges for companies that want to apply ML in their applications and operations.



The industry has made impressive advances in helping enterprises overcome the barriers to sourcing and preparing their data, according to Appen’s latest State of AI Report. But there is still a lot more to be done at different levels, including organization structure and company policies.

Snowflake announces plans to improve query performance, collaboration



This week Snowflake, at its annual Snowday event, announced improvements to its platform’s key elements such as the elastic performance engine and Snowgrid technology. The move, it said, will provide enterprises with a faster querying experience for improving overall data cloud economics as well as streamlined collaboration capabilities.

Why the metaverse will rely on blockchain frameworks to connect to physical devices



This week, MachineFi Lab — the core developer of IoTeX, a decentralized blockchain platform that enables interactions between humans and machines — announced the release of W3bstream.



The new tool, it says, is “a blockchain-agnostic infra with the power to disrupt the machine economy where innovation until now has remained stagnant,” according to the company’s press release.

Sanofi signs latest billion-dollar AI drug discovery deal



In an era when biopharma research in drug R&D continues to be costly and slow, and AI-based drug discovery platforms are rapidly growing, Paris-based pharmaceutical leader Sanofi announced a $1.2 billion AI drug discovery deal with startup Insilico Medicine.



The research collaboration comes on the heels of several other high-value AI drug discovery partnership announcements from Sanofi, including with Atomwise in August; a partnership expansion with Exscientia last January; and an equity investment in Owkin a year ago.","Top 5 stories of the week: Meta layoffs, Sanofi’s billion-dollar deal and Snowflake updates",https://venturebeat.com/ai/top-5-stories-of-the-week-meta-layoffs-sanofis-billion-dollar-deal-and-snowflake-updates/

America's next main battle tank may be a lighter but more high-tech version of the M1 Abrams.

General Dynamics, which builds the Abrams, recently unveiled an updated version of the M1. In addition to being 20 tons lighter than the most recent version, the M1A3, the AbramsX features an unmanned turret and a hybrid-electric engine.

Though the media has dubbed the AbramsX a ""next-generation tank,"" that's not exactly accurate. The AbramsX is really a technology demonstrator. It began as an internal General Dynamics research project to show how new technologies could be applied to a new tank or retrofitted onto existing tanks.

Rather than a next-gen armored vehicle, the AbramsX is more of an interim design to span the gap between the Cold War-era designs that still comprise the world's tank fleets and the true next-generation vehicles that will probably be fielded closer to 2050.

Nonetheless, the AbramsX is a working weapon. ""It drives around, it fires, and it performs the functions of a tank,"" Tim Reese, director of US business development for General Dynamics Land Systems, told Insider. ""It's not just a static display.""

The diet M1

Tank design is a balance — and a tradeoff — between three factors: firepower, protection, and mobility. For the AbramsX, the biggest goal was addressing a growing problem with the M1, of which more than 10,000 have been built since 1979.

The Abrams has always been a hefty tank. Even the early M1A1s weighed about 60 tons — compared to Russia's 45-ton T-72 and China's 55-ton Type 99A — but the latest Abrams weighs closer to 80 tons due to upgrades like the Trophy Active Protection System designed to shoot down incoming anti-tank weapons.

However, ""the M1A2 SEP v2 and v3 overall weight growth with full combat load and Trophy APS has introduced transportability and recovery challenges,"" the Pentagon's chief weapons inspector warned in a 2021 report.

Indeed, the latest Abrams is now so heavy that it can't be towed by Army recovery vehicles, which means damaged or broken-down tanks might have to be left behind on the battlefield.

Enter the AbramsX, which is the M1 on a diet. While closely resembling the older models, the new vehicle only weighs 60 tons. Reduced weight offers numerous advantages, including the ability to use bridges that would collapse under a heavier vehicle.

AbramsX also fits with the Army's new Multi-Domain Operations doctrine. After decades of focusing on counterinsurgency, the new approach envisions large-unit mechanized operations against near-peer foes such as Russia and China.

The AbramsX cut weight with a series of interrelated upgrades.

The turret is smaller, which means less heavy armor plating. ""Reducing the weight on the Abrams, which was really our primary design goal, required reducing the weight of the armor in the turret,"" Reese said.

The turret can be smaller because it is unmanned, with the crew nestled inside the armored hull. Using automation — including an autoloader for the cannon — allows the crew to be reduced from four to three, who now sit side-by-side in in the hull while monitoring multi-panel displays.

Shrinking the turret ""generated some weight savings right off the bat,"" Reese said.

The AbramsX replaces the M1's efficient but notoriously fuel-guzzling AGT 1500 gas-turbine engine with a hybrid-electric engine more reminiscent of a Toyota Prius than conventional tank power plants.

General Dynamics claims the new engine slashes fuel consumption by 50%, improves reliability and ease of maintenance, and allow the tank to operate its electronics — and even perform some limited movement — using quieter battery power.

The AbramsX retains a 120 mm cannon as its main armament but replaces the current gun with the lighter XM360 originally developed for the failed Future Combat System. It also has a Kongsberg RS6 remote-controlled weapon station with an XM914 30 mm cannon and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun.

As befits a 21st-century tank design, the AbramsX has some cutting-edge features. It is armed with six Switchblade 300 loitering munitions, known as ""kamikaze drones."" It also has an artificial-intelligence program — called ""Katalyst"" — that can help the crew identify and prioritize targets, navigate, and predict future maintenance.

If this sounds familiar, Russia's T-14 Armata, unveiled in 2015, also had an unmanned turret, a crew of three in the hull, and onboard drones. However, Russia's army has bought few of them, in part due to manufacturing difficulties. Notably, despite Russia's huge tank losses in Ukraine, it has not deployed the Armata there.

""The difference between us and the Armata is that ours works,"" Reese said.

Now vs. later

As with any tank design, there are tradeoffs. One reason the AbramsX is lighter is simply because of less armor around the unmanned turret. General Dynamics says it is up to the US government to decide the level of protection.

""If you keep the armor protection at a very minimal level, that's how we achieve the 60 tons,"" Reese said. ""If you dial the armor protection all the way back up to what it is on an M1 v3 today, the weight goes up above 60 tons.""

To its credit, General Dynamics is not touting the AbramsX as what a next-generation tank should be but rather as a demonstration of what capabilities are available.

""It's showing the art of the possible with existing technology,"" said Mark Hu, manager of US business development for GDLS. ""What you can get now vs. waiting for 'unobtainium' that may finally become available in 2050 or 2068.""

Whether the US Army will invest in a new tank remains to be seen.

Images of burning Russian tanks in Ukraine has led to numerous predictions of the tank's obsolescence. Those predictions are far from true, though they raise questions about the tank's role in the future.

If the Army does want the AbramsX, it can have it quickly. ""Essentially, all of the capabilities on AbramsX will be ready to build into a new main battle tank, or retrofitted into the current Abrams fleet, within 18 to 24 months,"" Reese said.

Meta laid off 11,000 employees, or 13% of its workforce, amid falling revenues from advertising and e-commerce. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is also considering other cost-cutting measures, and suggested it would close offices. In a separate filing it said it expects losses to grow significantly next year at its Reality Labs division, at a time when investors are already frustrated with Meta’s focus on creating a metaverse at the expense of the rest of the business. Mark Zuckerberg said he took full responsibility. The company’s market value is now around $270bn, down from $1trn in September 2021.

Meta was not the only big tech company to announce job cuts. Stripe, an online payments firm, is letting go of 14% of its workforce, and Lyft, a ride-hailing company, of 13%. Amazon has introduced a freeze on hiring for its corporate jobs. Twitter laid off half its staff following Elon Musk’s takeover, though it has reportedly asked some of them to come back.

More than 12m people signed up to Disney+ in the three months to October 1st, taking the total number of subscribers to 164m. That is a faster rate of growth in users than at Netflix, though Netflix has 223m subscribers. Operating losses at Disney+ have soared, however, causing Disney’s share price to drop by 13%. Following Netflix, it is introducing an ad-supported subscription plan next month to entice consumers and generate new revenue streams.

Apple issued a rare warning about delays to supplies of the iPhone. It now expects fewer shipments of iPhone 14 models, and longer waiting times for customers, because of covid-19 restrictions at the factory that assembles the device in Zhengzhou, China. The plant is operated by Foxconn, which has shifted some of the iPhone’s production to India, and may transfer more if China becomes an unreliable centre for production.

Advancing its ambitions in the electric-car market, Foxconn said it would invest $170m in Lordstown Motors, a startup that is developing an electric-powered pick-up truck at a factory in Ohio.

Renault is rearranging its business around five divisions, including one based on “new mobility, energy and data-based services”. The overhaul accelerates the flotation of its electric-vehicle unit, Ampere, next year. Renault also launched a joint venture with Geely, a Chinese carmaker, to make internal-combustion, hybrid and plug-in hybrid engines. The arrival of electric cars has meant that the industry must shift gears “from soccer to pentathlon”, said Renault’s boss.

In Britain speculation mounted that the government will impose a road tax on electric vehicles for the first time when it unveils a budget on November 17th. EV s are currently exempt from the tax, but the government is looking at ways to offset a fall in revenues from fuel duties because of the switch away from petrol to electric.

The global cryptocurrency market was shaken by the looming collapse of FTX , one of the biggest exchanges, after a run of customer withdrawals left it facing a liquidity crunch. FTX turned to Binance, an arch-rival, for help. Binance at first said it would take over FTX , but then pulled out of the deal, citing reports that FTX had “ mishandled customer funds” and was being investigated by the authorities. Cryptocurrency prices plunged. Bitcoin fell to around $16,000, its lowest level in two years.

Nvidia has developed a new chip that can be exported to China without violating the American government’s ban on selling technology in semiconductors to the Chinese. The ban has hit sales of Nvidia’s high-end microchips for use in artificial intelligence, data centres and supercomputers.

Covid lockdowns affecting manufacturers and their suppliers lay behind a surprise fall in China’s exports, which dropped by 0.3% in October, year on year. Imports also declined, marking the first simultaneous contraction in both categories of trade since May 2020, in the heat of the pandemic. China, meanwhile, has become Russia’s top trading partner, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, after EU sanctions targeted the Russian economy.

Undersea drones have come a long way from the days when they were basically motorized television eyes operated by remote control at the end of a tether. Today, these machines are becoming increasingly sophisticated with a growing range of capabilities that may one day not only see submarines deploying and recovering drones routinely, but could find conventional warships relegated to command centers overseeing robotic submarine fleets.

Based on HII's REMUS 300 UUV, the medium-class sized REMUS 620 is designed to support both current and predicted US Navy and special forces operations thanks to an improved battery system with a life of 110 hours. This not only provides the REMUS 620 with longer mission times, but enough range to ferry itself to and from its operational sites. Potential missions include mine countermeasures, hydrographic surveys, intelligence operations, surveillance, and electronic warfare.

The REMUS 620 boasts a modular open architecture and incorporates HII's Odyssey autonomy suite that provides the drone with artificial intelligence, autonomous health monitoring, and sensor fusion and perception, as well as the ability to collaborate with other robotic vehicles.

In addition, the modular design allows the batteries to be quickly swapped for fast turnaround times or to incorporate alternative energy sources. The standard synthetic aperture sonar unit can also be replaced or augmented to suit mission requirements.

According to HII, the REMUS 620 can be launched from submarines, small crewed or uncrewed boats, amphibious ships, surface warships, and helicopters. It can also deploy robotic craft and payloads of its own while underwater.

""Retaining a forward strategic advantage requires the ability to deliver a multitude of effects from under the sea,"" said Duane Fotheringham, president of HII's Mission Technologies’ Unmanned Systems business group. ""The REMUS 620 is the first medium UUV designed to accurately deliver this range of advanced above-and-below water effects at long range.""

Now that stereo vision tech has been packed into an open-source rolling robot called rae – which stands for robotics access for everyone – and launched on Kickstarter.

""rae is representative of our foremost goal at Luxonis: to make robotics accessible and simple for anyone, not just the tenured engineer with years of programming experience,"" said company CEO, Brandon Gilles. ""A longstanding truth about robotics is that the barrier to entry sometimes feels impossibly high, but it doesn’t have to be that way. By creating rae, we want to help demonstrate the kinds of positive impacts robotics can bring to all people's lives, whether it's as simple as helping you find your keys, talking with your friend who uses American Sign Language, or playing with your kids.""

Two motorized wheels to the rear with encoders for positioning precision and the ability to roll over multiple surfaces, plus 40 RGB LEDs for a custom lightshow Luxonis

Robot rae measures 4.75 x 4.75 x 1.3 in (120 x 120 x 32 mm) and weighs in at 14 oz (400 g), and comes with two motor-driven wheels (with encoders) under its durable metal housing balanced out by two free-rolling wheels to the front. And despite its diminutive proportions, it's reported capable of rolling over multiple surface types, including carpet, wood floor, tiles, grass and gravel.

RGB LED lighting runs around rae's bottom edge for some funky programmable visuals, it sports a Sony IMX214 4K camera module in front for streaming hi-res video plus a LCD display that can be user-programmed via a companion app. Luxonis has also included its OAK stereo camera system in the shape of two forward-facing OV9782 sensors and two more around back.

The system combines machine learning and computer vision technology in one unit, and boasts Robotic Vision Core 3 processing supported by 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are onboard as well, there's an array of six microphones for voice interaction plus an integrated 1-W speaker, and rae is powered by a 5,000-mAh Li-Po battery for around an hour's use between charging.

It's ready to use as soon as it's charged up and paired with a smartphone running the mobile app, which gives access to control functions, settings and a database, as well as cooked-in applications for playing games, problem solving tasks and a host of functions like locating objects, room mapping, emotion recognition, time-lapse recording and even sign language interpretation.

Within rae's durable metal enclosure are four depth-sensing camera modules, a 4K video camera, onboard Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, an hour-per-charge battery, and a powerful vision processing unit Luxonis

The ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) platform comes pre-installed and preconfigured for access to its libraries and tools. Users can also create their own apps and models to get rae to perform custom tasks, or equip the robot with additional hardware and accessories, and they get access to the company's cloud platform for online learning, community collaborations, download/install of user-created apps and more.

With four successful Kickstarters under its belt, Luxonis has returned to the crowdfunding portal to fund production of rae, where pledges currently start at US$399. If all goes to plan with the already funded campaign, shipping is estimated to start in June 2023. The video below has more.

WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration's move to block exports of advanced computer chips to China is signaling a new phase in relations between the globe's two largest economies — one in which trade matters less than an increasingly heated competition to be the world’s leading technological and military power.

The aggressive move, announced last month, will help set the tone for President Joe Biden’s upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Asia. It's evidence of Biden's determination to “manage” the U.S. competition with China, whose officials were quick to condemn the export ban.

After more than two decades in which the focus was on expansion of trade and global growth, both countries are openly prioritizing their national interests as the world economy struggles with high inflation and the risk of recessions. The U.S. and China have each identified the development and production of computer chips as vital for economic growth and their own security interests.

“We’re going to do whatever it takes to protect Americans from the threat of China,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in an interview. “China is crystal clear. They will use this technology for surveillance. They will use this technology for cyber attacks. They will use this technology to, in any number of ways, harm us and our allies, or our ability to protect ourselves.”

Xi responded to the export ban in his statement at last month's congress of the Chinese Communist Party, where he secured a third term as the country's leader. He pledged that China would move more aggressively to become self-reliant in producing semiconductors and other technologies.

“In order to enhance China’s innovation capacity, we will move faster to launch a number of major national projects that are of strategic, big-picture and long-term importance,” Xi said.

The Chinese government has named the development of advanced computer chips that could handle everything from artificial intelligence to hypersonic missiles as one of its top priorities. To bridge the gap until it can get there, China has been relying on imports of advanced chips and manufacturing equipment from the U.S., which imposed a series of export controls last month that block sending to China the world's most advanced chips, factory equipment and industry experts tied to America.

The U.S. and its allies famously deployed export controls against Russia after the February invasion of Ukraine, making it harder for Russian forces to be resupplied with weapons, ammunition, tanks and aircraft. As a result of those constraints, Russia has relied on drones from Iran and the U.S. has accused North Korea of supplying them with artillery.

The U.S. had until recently operated from the premise that strong trade relationships would bring countries closer together in ways that made the world safer and wealthier, a post-Cold War order. Global supply chains were supposed to lower costs, boost profits and enable democratic values to seep into the terrain of oligarchies, dictatorships and autocracies.

But after a global pandemic, the war in Ukraine and China's own ambitions, the Biden administration and many European and Asian allies have chosen to prioritize national security and industrial strategies. Both the U.S. and European Union have provided tens of billions of dollars in incentives to spur more domestic production of computer chips.

In a speech last month at IBM, Biden said China specifically lobbied against a law that provides $52 billion to produce and develop advanced semiconductors in the U.S., an incentive package that has been followed by a string of announcements by Intel, Micron, Wolfspeed and others about the construction of computer chip plants in the U.S..

He said that some of the GOP lawmakers who opposed the measure had bought into the arguments made by China.

“The Communist Party of China was lobbying in the United States Congress against passing this legislation,” Biden said. “And unfortunately, some of our friends on the other team bought it.”

Donald Trump had fiery rhetoric on China during his presidency, imposing tariffs that the Biden administration has yet to lift. But by any qualitative measure, the export bans on computer chips are much tougher than anything imposed by Trump, said Gregory Allen, a senior fellow in the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Allen said the Trump-era tariffs were large in terms of dollars, but they had almost no affect on the balance of trade. Nor were the import taxes strategic. The export controls imposed by the Biden administration would be a setback for Chinese technology that is already decades behind the U.S.

“We have essentially committed ourselves to saying: China you will not achieve your number one goal,” Allen said.

The era of China, Russia and other competitors having relatively unfettered access to U.S. and European markets appears to be ending, said Christopher Miller, a Tufts University professor and author of the book, “Chip Wars.”

“The risks posed by these countries has grown, so Western leaders have reconsidered the wisdom of giving adversaries open access to their markets,” Miller said.

Instead of trying to work together as a single global economy, new alliances are being formed such as the Quad (Australia, India, Japan and the U.S.) and existing partnerships such as NATO are being expanded. Economic integration among these partners has become essential, as the U.S. export controls on advanced chips need support from other producers in Japan and the Netherlands.

“All the great powers are restructuring international economic relations in ways they hope will improve their geopolitical position,” Miller said. “Semiconductors are just one of many arenas in which trade, tech, and capital flows are being re-politicized due to great power rivalry.”",Computer chip ban signals new era as Biden and Xi meet,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/computer-chip-ban-signals-era-biden-xi-meet-93157128

The results are spectacular. If you want to see what the growing community is creating, OpenArt has a collection of artwork generated by the top three AI systems: DALL·E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion.

We’ve heard about generative AI for some time, but I’ve always felt it would impact us in the distant future. But with web-based tools that generate high-quality output now readily available, that future is here. There’s no doubt that generative AI innovations will change how we create and consume media, disrupting the creative marketplace and communication industries. And while text-to-text tools are already assisting writers in producing stories, I’ll focus on text-to-image generative AI.

In the last few months, many of these AI systems have published online tools, accelerating its availability to the public. For example, Midjourney’s beta requires a Discord account to log in, while Stability.ai‘s DreamStudio Lite has a convenient web interface. Each offers an addicting amount of credits to create a several dozen images for free. If you have a powerful machine sitting around, you can also download and install Stability.ai’s open-source, public release to generate art on your local device without paying for the online service. And if you’re tech-savvy, you can train your local model with custom data. This means you can feed your computer hundreds of specific images not in the default AI model, which is helpful if you want want to stay “on brand” on iterations of a visual campaign. Or you can create a series of portraits of non-famous but REAL people. As you can imagine, this raises serious ethical questions.

Controversies abound. I completely understand and appreciate the debate over the ethics of mimicking artists’ styles and copyrighted likenesses. People contributing to this ecosystem should be compensated and credited for their talent and work. For many artists, generative AI art is a threat. But for those who embrace this new digital brush, it can be a powerful tool in their design process.

But what worries me more is the lack of foresight in establishing regulations for deep fakes, AI-powered photos and realistic art that could lead to harm and disinformation. But back to the foundational technology of generative AI, I’m anxious to see how Stable Diffusion’s Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license and de-centralized mitigation strategies will keep users ethically, legally and morally responsible for harming others and distributing disinformation. As usual, we’re incapable of establishing policy ahead of innovation and must constantly catch up.

Now imagine when the technology is a Photoshop plug-in away. Well, imagine no more. Watch this video (also see below) that plug-in developer Christian Cantrell, former Director of Experience Development and head of Adobe Design Prototyping, tweeted last month.

Cantrell’s Twitter bio states he’s VP of Product at StabilityAI. The Inpainting feature in the Stable Diffusion plug-in for Photoshop is a News Photo Editor’s nightmare. And it can also be an Art Director’s dream. As Cantrell also tweeted: “This is how all advertising and marketing collateral will be made sooner than most of the world realizes.” And yes, there’s a Stable Diffusion plug-in for After Effect to apply the generative AI models on video. Sure, a skilled touch-up expert could do the same. But now you’ve compressed the touch-up time from hours to seconds.

As impressive as the technology is, producing that exact image you imagine still requires knowing how to talk to the algorithms behind the tool. What you type into these prompts tells the AI model what to render. The more you understand the “language,” the closer it can produce the image in your mind. It’s called Prompt Engineering and OpenArt published a Prompt Book to help you understand effective techniques. Of course, there’s already a marketplace for prompts. And apparently it’s a future career. This leads to my next concern.

On top of the ethical and legal questions generative AI tech raises, I fear we’re not ready for this massive change in the media and communication industry. And as educators, how are we preparing our students for such a world? These additional questions come to mind:

How do we label and define generative AI content in our publications?

When is it appropriate to publish generative AI images, and when is it not?

What are the most inspiring and most concerning examples of others using generative AI to render images?

What’s the balance between using generative AI to “assist” vs. “make” in the creative process?

What ethical and legal boundaries do we need to consider when using and publishing generative AI content?

What safe guards, if any, should be in place to prevent the abuse of news photography?

What questions come up for you?

A mentor early in my career asked this question that sticks with me today: “Would you rather surf the web or make the waves?” Generative AI technology is awe-inspiring and is here to stay.

Note: this article includes spoilers from ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.""

To my admittedly un-cameo-trained eye, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" seems pretty light on traditional Marvel guest appearances. Bruce Campbell doesn't show up and get squirted with mustard, Harry Styles doesn't saunter into the end credits, and Brett Goldstien doesn't appear as a demigod. The movie focuses first and foremost on the feelings it instills in viewers, leaving the perfunctory character intros and one-off cameos to other Marvel movies.

The film does, however, include one familiar name in the credits that you may have totally missed. That's because the movie's biggest cameo isn't a face, but a voice: that of Shuri's (Letitia Wright) robotic assistant, Griot. Her helper is able to calculate stats quickly and advise her about the best possible course of action, but he's also a bit sassy, and sounds so human that I kept expecting him to be revealed as a remote working assistant rather than an actual piece of artificial intelligence. That's probably because Griot sounded so familiar: he was played by none other than comedian and host of ""The Daily Show"" Trevor Noah, Collider confirms.

Noah actually voiced Griot in the first ""Black Panther"" film as well, but his role in that movie was much more brief. This time around, he plays a part in several of the movie's most pivotal scenes, as when Shuri tries desperately to save T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) in the film's opening scene, or when Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) tries to find her daughter after she's captured by the sea god Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejía). The robotic assistant played by the South African writer, comedian, and TV host is pretty much always around in a pinch, and he seems to make it out of the attack on Wakanda unscathed.","The Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Cameo You Never Saw, But Definitely Heard",https://www.slashfilm.com/1099014/the-black-panther-wakanda-forever-cameo-you-never-saw-but-definitely-heard/

We found that for a significant fraction of the benchmarks in our dataset, only few results were reported at different time points in different studies (Table 1). For example, 1318 NLP benchmarks have at least one result reported, but only 661 (50%) of these have results reported at three or more different time points.

SOTA curve diversity and dynamics

In order to explore the diversity of real-world within-benchmark SOTA dynamics in a data-driven way, we used Self Organizing Maps (SOM)—a type of Artificial Neural Network able to convert complex, nonlinear statistical relationships between high-dimensional data items into simple geometric relationships on a low-dimensional display—to cluster individual metrics curves based on their shapes. Only SOTA trajectories with at least five entries over at least one year were considered.

Figure 3 displays the three clusters discovered for benchmarks in computer vision and NLP for all metrics. In total, 1079 metric trajectories of 654 benchmarks were assigned to one of three clusters. Cluster 1 (460 trajectories) most closely resembles the phenomenology of continuous growth. Cluster 2 (378 benchmarks), corresponds to the saturation/stagnation scenario. In this cluster, values close to the ceiling of all results are observed very soon in the time series and limited remaining growth in performance is recorded afterwards. Finally, cluster 3 (241 benchmarks) most closely resembles the stagnation followed by breakthrough scenario.

For assignments of individual benchmarks among the clusters see Supplementary Data 5). b Top-10 most similar trajectories to predefined gold trajectories representing linear growth (\(f(x)=x\) where \(\left\{x{\mathbb{\in }}{\mathbb{N}}1\le x\le 50\right\}\)), early saturation (\(f(x)=-1/x\) where \(\left\{x{\mathbb{\in }}{\mathbb{N}}1\le x\le 50\right\}\)) and stagnation followed by breakthrough (\(f(x)=-1/x\) where \(\left\{x{\mathbb{\in }}{\mathbb{N}}{\mathbb{-}}50\le x\le -1\right\}\)). As similarity metric we use the euclidean distance between trajectory and gold function. Full size image

We analyzed the number of benchmarks reporting new SOTA results vs. active benchmarks reporting any results over time for NLP (Fig. 4) and computer vision (Suppl. Fig. 3). For both NLP and computer vision, the number of benchmarks in the dataset started to rise in 2013, with a notable acceleration of growth in benchmarks reporting SOTA results in 2017-2018 and a slowdown of growth after 2018. There is a strong stagnation of the number of active and of SOTA-reporting benchmarks in 2020, which is more marked for NLP. The peak numbers of active benchmarks in the dataset were highest in 2020 (432 for NLP, 1100 for computer vision), demonstrating that the availability of benchmarks for computer vision remained significantly higher compared to NLP.

Fig. 4: Development of benchmark activity in NLP over time. Shown are the number of active benchmarks (i.e., benchmarks for which any novel results were reported) vs. number of benchmarks reporting novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) results over time for NLP tasks. A similar plot for computer vision is available in the associated online material and supplementary material. Full size image

To understand in greater detail how benchmark creation and saturation unfold across the great variety of tasks that are addressed by global AI research, we devised methodologies for normalizing and visualizing benchmark dynamics, as described below.

Creating global maps of AI benchmark dynamics

Comparing SOTA trajectories across a wide variety of tasks, benchmarks and performance metrics is not trivial: How significant is a certain increment in performance? What constitutes a markedly unimpressive result (i.e., the ‘floor’ of our expectations)? What would constitute the best result realistically possible (i.e., the ‘ceiling’ of our expectations)?

Different performance metrics can inherently cover widely different value ranges. For example, for the performance metric accuracy, the inherent lowest value would be 0%, while the inherent highest value would be 100%. However, this is often less helpful for judging benchmark results than one might hope: For a balanced dataset with two classes, the floor should rather be set to 50%, as this would be the accuracy achieved by a random classifier. For an unbalanced dataset, the inherent floor might be another value—i.e., it would be highly dataset specific. Similar concerns can also be raised about the potential ceiling value: for example, a perfect accuracy score of 100% might never be achievable even by the best hypothetical model because of limitations inherent in the dataset (e.g., mislabeled examples in the test set).

Arguably, the best solution for judging and comparing trajectories would be an in-depth manual analysis and curation of all benchmarks, where floor values are determined by trivially simple prediction algorithms and ceiling values are determined through gold standards (e.g., expert human curators). Unfortunately, such curated data are not available for the vast majority of benchmarks. Moreover, even purported gold standard test sets can have severe limitations. For example, many recent NLP benchmarks were quickly saturated with some systems reaching above-human performance on test sets1—but further analyses reveal that models achieving very high performance often did so through recognizing benchmark-inherent artifacts that did not transfer to other data distributions1,3.

To easily scale our analysis to all benchmarks without requiring cost-prohibitive per-benchmark curation of performance metrics value ranges, we normalized and calibrated SOTA benchmark results in a data-driven way. As the basis of further analyses, we calculated the relative improvement (i.e., increase in performance) for individual metrics (e.g., accuracy). We achieved this by comparing the stepwise increment from the first (A, anchor) to the last reported result (M, maximum) in each step of a SOTA trajectory.

We define relative improvement (r) as:

$${{{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}}=\frac{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}}-{{{{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}-{{{{{\bf{1}}}}}}}}{{{{{{\boldsymbol{M}}}}}}-{{{{{\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}},\,{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}} > {{{{{\bf{1}}}}}}$$ (1)

where relative improvement (r i ) is the ratio of the difference between the current result (R i ) minus the previous result (R i-1 ) over the difference between the last result (M, maximum) minus the first result (A, anchor). Because we need the anchor value (i = 1) as reference for the r i calculation of the subsequent values, we only consider the calculation of r from the second value (i = 2) in the trajectory onwards. Figure 5 exemplifies this calculation and visualizes the resulting values for SOTA accuracy results of five AI models reported from October 2015 until April 2017 for the visual question answering benchmark ‘VQA v1 test-dev’.

Fig. 5: Example of calculating the relative improvement in SOTA for the ‘VQA v1 test-dev’ benchmark. Top: The SOTA curve displays accuracy results achieved by different models over time. Bottom: The values of the SOTA curve rendered as relative improvement r, calculated as the ratio of the obtained result (R) minus the previous result over the difference between the final (M, maximum) and first (A, anchor) accuracy values. The first result (A) is displayed as a vertical dash in the trajectory, whereas the remaining SOTA jumps are depicted as icons with color corresponding to relative improvement. Full size image

The methodology exemplified in Fig. 5 was applied to all AI tasks in NLP and computer vision to create global SOTA trajectory maps (generated data are available in Supplementary Data 3 and 4). To condense the visual representation, data items for the same task and month were aggregated by selecting the maximum value.

Figure 6 displays the global SOTA trajectory map for NLP. Here, every dash represents an anchor, i.e., the first result of a newly established benchmark. The subsequent icons depict the relative improvements for different benchmarks belonging to each task. We grouped tasks based on their superclasses extracted from the ontology structure we created during data curation (see Methods section), placing related tasks adjacent to each other. For example, “Semantic analysis” is the superclass of “Semantic textual similarity” and “Word sense disambiguation”. A similar global SOTA trajectory map for computer vision is available in Supplementary Fig. 1.

In NLP the tasks of information extraction, sentiment analysis, language modeling and question answering had significant density of novel SOTA results the earliest (2014–2016). It is noteworthy that none of the tasks completely ceased to produce SOTA activity once they became established. Relative SOTA improvements were modest until 2018. There was a slight clustering of large relative SOTA improvements around 2018–2019—a possible interpretation being that this was when AI language capabilities experienced a boost while benchmarks were not yet saturated.

In computer vision, high research intensity and continuous progress on image classification benchmarking (Supplementary Fig. 1) started in 2013. This is earlier than most other AI tasks, as those were the first application areas in which deep learning started to excel. Notable later advances happened in 3D vision processing (since 2016), image generation (since 2017) and few-shot learning (2018–2019). In terms of relative SOTA improvements, the map for CV shows a wide array of patterns in benchmark dynamics across different AI tasks that elude simple narratives about benchmark intensity and progress.

To further visualize the dynamics of benchmark creation, progression, saturation/stagnation and eventual abandonment, we devised a global AI benchmark lifecycle map, exemplified in Fig. 7 for the NLP domain. The lifecycle map classifies each benchmark into one of four classes every year: (a) New benchmark: benchmark reporting its first result this years, (b) Benchmark reporting SOTA: established benchmark that reports at least one SOTA result, (c) Benchmark reporting no SOTA/no results: established benchmarks that does not report any results, or does report results but none of them establish a new SOTA, and (d) Disbanded benchmark: a benchmark that does not report further results from a given year onwards. In the lifecycle map, every class is represented as an icon, while the size of the icon represents the number of benchmarks falling into this category. Each benchmark can only fall into a single category for each year.

A similar plot for computer vision is available in the supplementary figures and interactive online material. SOTA: State-of-the-art. Full size image

The figure and a related figure for computer vision are also available as interactive graphs on the web (https://openbiolink.github.io/ITOExplorer/).

The benchmark lifecycle map for NLP (Fig. 7) shows that a few benchmarks across most tasks were established early (before 2015), but only a small number of novel SOTA results were reported for these benchmarks during this period. Establishment of novel benchmarks strongly accelerated in 2015–2018, and was most marked in question answering, information extraction, text classification and text summarization. The years 2018 and 2019 saw the establishment of many novel benchmarks for a wide variety of further tasks, as well as the reporting of SOTA results for large numbers of benchmarks. Establishment of novel benchmarks was reduced in 2020, and concentrated on high-level tasks associated with inference and reasoning, likely because of increasing model capabilities in these areas. From 2019, no novel SOTA results (or no results at all) were reported for a large number of benchmarks, and this phenomenon was not particularly biased towards any specific types of tasks.

The lifecycle map for computer vision (Supplementary Fig. 2) shows a first wave of benchmark establishment for the tasks of image clustering and image classification around 2013, followed by several other tasks in 2014. It is noteworthy that even tasks established early—such as image classification and semantic segmentation—demonstrated high benchmark activity and novel SOTA results well into 2021, and especially for image classification this was accompanied by an ongoing establishment of novel few-shot benchmarks. Tasks for most other benchmarks were established in 2015–2019.

For both NLP and computer vision, the number of distinct benchmarks strongly differs between tasks. Only a very fraction of benchmarks was disbanded in the years up to 2020. A larger number of benchmarks was reported as disbanded from 2020 (i.e., have no reported results in 2020 or after). The number of benchmarks classified as disbanded is highest in 2021, but this is likely partially influenced by the cutoff date of the dataset used in the analysis (mid 2022).

Dataset popularity is distributed very unevenly

We selected all datasets used to benchmark NLP or computer vision tasks and which had first reported results in the Papers With Code dataset in 2018. We analyzed the distribution of dataset popularity, measured by the number of scientific papers utilizing each dataset for NLP. We found distributions to be heavy-tailed, i.e., a small set of benchmark datasets was used to generate a large number of benchmark results, as demonstrated in Fig. 8 for NLP datasets. The top 22% of NLP datasets and top 21% of computer vision datasets were utilized by the same number of papers as the remaining datasets for each domain. The disparity becomes even greater when analyzing all datasets in Papers With Code, regardless of their first recorded entry: Here, the top 10% of NLP and top 5% of computer vision datasets were utilized by the same number of papers as the remaining datasets.

Quantifying Papers With Code dataset completeness

While Papers With Code is the largest dataset of AI benchmark results by a wide margin, it cannot provide a full coverage of all existing AI benchmarks. We conducted a small-scale study to estimate the completeness of the Papers With Code dataset regarding SOTA result trajectories.

We randomly sampled 10 benchmark datasets from NLP and 10 benchmark datasets from computer vision in the dataset, resulting in a total of 20 randomly sampled datasets (listed in Supplementary Data 7). Querying Google Scholar, we found that the total size of the combined corpus of papers introducing the datasets and all their citing papers was 7595. Out of the citing papers, we randomly sampled 365 papers (sample size chosen to yield a margin of error of 5% in the analysis).

We inspected and annotated these 365 papers to determine whether each paper contained results on the benchmark of the cited dataset paper. If this was the case, we compared the reported result with the Papers With Code dataset to determine if the paper reported a result that was SOTA at the time and was not currently covered by Papers With Code (annotation data is available in Supplementary Data 8).

We found that even though dataset papers were highly cited, only a small fraction of citing papers reported results on the associated benchmarks, and an even smaller fraction (14 of 365, i.e., 3.84%) reported novel SOTA results. This implies that an estimated 0.0384 * 7595 = 291.32 papers in the combined corpus are expected to contain SOTA results. (Note: values here are shown rounded to two decimal places for ease of reading, but calculations were done with more precise numbers. Precise calculations are included in Supplementary Data 7.)

Meanwhile, Papers With Code contained SOTA results from 95 papers, i.e., 95/7595 = 1.23% of the combined corpus.

Taken together, 95/291.31 = 32.61% of papers containing SOTA results in the combined corpus were captured by Papers With Code, i.e., a coverage of approximately 1/3 of all SOTA results. While this indicates significant remaining potential for further increasing the coverage of Papers With Code, we deem this coverage sufficient to allow for meaningful aggregated analyses.

Dataset attributes associated with popularity

The finding that a large fraction of research activity was focussed on a comparatively small number of benchmark datasets and that many datasets failed to find adoption raises the question: which attributes differentiate highly popular from unpopular benchmark datasets? Gaining an understanding of these differences may guide creators of future benchmark datasets in prioritizing their efforts.

We conducted an exploratory analysis of some such potentially differentiating attributes. We selected all benchmark datasets used to benchmark NLP or computer vision tasks and which had first reported results in the Papers With Code dataset in 2018. We ranked selected datasets in two separate lists for NLP and computer vision by the number of unique papers that reported benchmark results on each dataset, i.e., a list ranked by the follow-up utilization of datasets for benchmarking.

We created two samples of top 10 and bottom 10 datasets (i.e., datasets with highest/least follow-up utilization for benchmarking) for NLP and computer vision, respectively (see “Methods” section for details on the sampling methodology). We combined the top and bottom lists of computer vision and NLP, resulting in a top list and a bottom list with 20 datasets each, yielding a total of N = 40 annotated datasets.

The majority of included datasets (n = 36; 90%) were associated with peer-reviewed publications. 33 datasets (82.5%) were associated with a paper with a first or last author with a public/academic affiliation, and 11 (27.5%) of datasets were associated with a paper with a first or last author with a private/industrial affiliation.

We investigated seven attributes for their correlation with top or bottom popularity status, based on the following driving hypotheses:

1. Number of task types, i.e., the number of different AI tasks that were evaluated by building on a specific dataset. This can include tasks that were not originally envisioned during benchmark creation (dataset repurposing). Hypothesis: Top datasets have a higher number of task types. Rationale: Datasets that are flexible enough to be employed for a larger number of tasks types will see greater utilization. 2. Number of sub-benchmarks. Some benchmark datasets are made up of a predefined set of independent benchmark datasets. For example, the SuperGLUE NLP benchmark is made up of eight sub-benchmarks covering five different task types. Hypothesis: Top datasets have a higher number of sub-benchmarks. Rationale: Datasets that provide multiple benchmarks are more attractive because they cover a wider range of capabilities and are less prone to quick saturation. 3. Dedicated leaderboard, i.e., the dataset publishers advertised a dedicated, publicly available leaderboard. Hypothesis: Top datasets are more likely to have a dedicated leaderboard. Rationale: Providing a public leaderboard incentivizes benchmark use; leaderboard provision is also a proxy for more elaborate and user-friendly setup of a benchmarking datasets. 4. Proposed as part of a competition, e.g., Kaggle, a workshop competition etc. Hypothesis: Top datasets are more likely to have been proposed as part of a competition. Rationale: Competitions lead to an initial burst of interest in the research community; this might also lead to larger follow-up interest of the community after the competition has ended. 5. Top conference or journal, i.e., the dataset paper was published in a top conference or journal (top status is defined through lists in Supplementary Data 6). Hypothesis: Top datasets are more likely to have been published in top conferences or journals. Rationale: Publication in top conferences or journals is a marker for higher quality datasets; datasets published in these venues are reaching a broader and more active audience. 6. Number of institutions, i.e., number of different institutions represented by co-authors of a dataset paper). Hypothesis: Top datasets have a higher number of institutions. Rationale: The creation of good datasets requires broad collaboration; having a broader set of participants increases visibility in the community. 7. Top company or university, i.e., first or last authors are affiliated with a top-tier university or a company that is a key player in the AI domain. Hypothesis: Top datasets are more likely to have the first or last author affiliated with a top company or university. Rationale: Researchers at such institutions design datasets that are more broadly relevant and of higher utility; association with top institutions might increase interest of other researchers, positively impacting adoption.

A comparison of datasets in the top vs. bottom popularity lists is shown in Table 2. We found that datasets in the top popularity list were versatile (had greater number of task types), were published alongside a dedicated leaderboard, and had a larger number of sub-benchmarks (which was particularly the case for NLP datasets). Involvement of first/last authors from top institutions was associated with greater popularity. Proposing benchmark datasets as part of a competition was not associated with greater popularity, as was the involvement of a greater number of institutions.",Mapping global dynamics of benchmark creation and saturation in artificial intelligence,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34591-0

Many approaches have difficulty doing anything in an open-world Minecraft map, but IQ-Learn can navigate the world with ease.

A key aspect of human learning is imitation: the capability to mimic and learn behavior from a teacher or an expert. This is an important ability for acquiring new skills, such as walking, biking, or speaking a new language. Although current Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are capable of complex decision-making, such as mastering Go, playing complex strategic games like Starcraft, or manipulating a Rubik’s cube, these systems often require over 100 million interactions with an environment to train — equivalent of more than 100 years of human experience — to reach human-level performance. In contrast, a human can acquire new skills in relatively short amounts of time by observing an expert. How can we enable our artificial agents to similarly acquire such fast learning ability?

Another challenge with current AI systems is that they require explicit programming or hand-designing of reward functions in-order to make correct decisions. These methodologies are frequently brittle, or otherwise imperfect, and can lead to these systems struggling to work well in complex situations — with self-driving cars blockading roads, or robots failing to coordinate with humans. Developing new methods that can instead interactively learn from human or expert data can be a key stepping stone towards sample-efficient agents and learning human-like behavior.

In this post, I’ll discuss several techniques being developed in a field called “Imitation Learning” (IL) to solve these sorts of problems and present a recent method from our lab, called Inverse Q-Learning — which was used to create the best AI agent for playing Minecraft using few expert demos. You can check out the project page here, and the code for the underlying method here.

So, what is imitation learning, and what has it been used for?

In imitation learning (IL), an agent is given access to samples of expert behavior (e.g. videos of humans playing online games or cars driving on the road) and it tries to learn a policy that mimics this behavior. This objective is in contrast to reinforcement learning (RL), where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes a specified reward function. A major advantage of imitation learning is that it does not require careful hand-design of a reward function because it relies solely on expert behavior data, making it easier to scale to real-world tasks where one is able to gather expert behavior (like video games or driving). This approach of enabling the development of AI systems by data-driven learning, rather than specification through code or heuristic rewards, is consistent with the key principles behind Software 2.0.

Imitation learning has been a key component in developing AI methods for decades, with early approaches dating back to the 1990s and early 2000s, including work by work by Andrew Ng and Stuart Russel, and the creation of the first self-driving car systems. Recently, imitation learning has become an important topic with increasing real-world utility, with papers using the technique for driving autonomous cars, enabling robotic locomotion, playing video games, manipulating objects, and even robotic surgery.

Imitation Learning as Supervision

Early approaches to imitation learning seek to learn a policy as a machine learning model that maps environment observations to (optimal) actions taken by the expert using supervised learning. The method is called Behavioral Cloning (BC), but it has a drawback: BC has loose, or no, guarantees that the model will generalize to unseen environmental observations. A key issue is that when the agent ends up in an situation that is unlike any of the expert trajectories, BC is prone to failures. For example, in the figure above, the car agent doesn’t know what to do if it goes away from the expert trajectory and it crashes. To avoid making a mistake, BC requires expert data on all possible trajectories in the environment, making it a heavily data-inefficient approach.

A simple fix, Dataset Aggregation (DAGGER), was proposed to interactively collect more expert data to recover from mistakes and was used to create the first autonomous drone that could navigate forests. Nevertheless, this requires a human in the loop and such interactive access to an expert is usually infeasible. Instead, we want to emulate the trial-and-error process that humans use to fix mistakes. For the above example, if the car agent can interact with the environment to learn “if I do this then I crash,” then it could correct itself to avoid that behavior.

This insight led to the formulation of imitation learning as a problem to learn a reward function from the expert data, such that a policy that optimizes the reward through environment interaction matches the expert, thus inverting the reinforcement learning problem; this approach is termed Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL).

How do recent Imitation Approaches using IRL work?

In 2016, Ho and Ermon posed Inverse Reinforcement Learning as a minimax game between two AI models with simple parallels to GANs — a class of generative models. In this formulation, the agent policy model (the “generator”) produces actions interacting with an environment to attain the highest rewards from a reward model using RL, while the reward model (the “discriminator”) attempts to distinguish the agent policy behavior from expert behavior. Similar to GANs, the discriminator acts as a reward model that indicates how expert-like an action is.

Thus, if the policy does something that is not expert-like, it gets a low reward from the discriminator and learns to correct this behavior. This minimax game has a unique equilibrium solution called the saddle point solution (due to the geometrical saddle shape of the optimization). At the equilibrium, the discriminator learns a reward such that the policy behavior based on it is indistinguishable from the expert. With this adversarial learning of a policy and a discriminator, it is possible to reach expert performance using few demonstrations. Techniques inspired by such are referred to as Adversarial Imitation. (see the figure below for an illustration of the method)

Set-up of Adversarial Imitation Learning with an agent and a discriminator playing a minimax game. The discriminator learns to distinguish the policy and expert behavior, giving a reward on how expert-like an action is, whereas the agent learns a policy using the discriminator rewards to produce more expert-like behavior.

Unfortunately, as adversarial imitation is based on GANs, it suffers from the same limitations, such as mode collapse and training instability, and so training requires careful hyperparameter tuning and tricks like gradient penalization. Furthermore, the process of reinforcement learning complicates training because it is not possible to train the generator here through simple gradient descent. This amalgamation of GANs and RL makes for a very brittle combination, which does not work well in complex image-based environments like Atari. Because of these challenges, Behavioral Cloning remains the most prevalent method of imitation.

Learning Q-functions for Imitation

These issues, recently, have led to a new non-adversarial approach for imitation: learning Q-functions to recover expert behavior.

In RL, Q-functions measure the expected sum of future rewards an agent can obtain starting from the current state and choosing a particular action. By learning Q-functions using a neural network that takes in the current state and a potential action of the agent as input, one can predict the overall expected future reward obtained by the agent. Because the prediction is of the overall reward, as opposed to only the reward for taking that one step, determining the optimal policy is as simple as sequentially taking actions with the highest predicted Q-function values in the current state. This optimal policy can be represented as the argmax over all possible actions for a Q-function in a given state. Thus, the Q-function is a very useful quantity, providing a connection between the reward function and the optimal behavior policy in an environment.

In IL, a simple, stable, and data-efficient approach has always been out of reach because of the above-mentioned issues with previous approaches. Additionally, the instability of adversarial methods makes the Inverse RL formulation hard to solve. A non-adversarial approach to IL could likely resolve many of the challenges the field faces. Is there something to learn for IL from the remarkable success of Q-functions in RL to determine the optimal behavior policy from a reward function?

Inverse Q-Learning (IQ-Learn)

To determine reward functions, what if we directly learn a Q-function from expert behavior data? This is exactly the idea behind our recently proposed algorithm, Inverse Q-Learning (IQ-Learn). Our key insight is that not only can the Q-function represent the optimal behavior policy but it can also represent the reward function, as the mapping from single-step rewards to Q-functions is bijective for a given policy. This can be used to avoid the difficult minimax game over the policy and reward functions seen in the Adversarial Imitation formulation, by expressing both using a single variable: the Q-function. Plugging this change of variables into the original Inverse RL objective leads to a much simpler minimization problem over just the single Q-function; which we refer to as the Inverse Q-learning problem. Our Inverse Q-learning problem shares a one-to-one correspondence with the minimax game of adversarial IL in that each potential Q-function can be mapped to a pair of discriminator and generator networks. This means that we maintain the generality and unique equilibrium properties of IRL while resulting in a simple non-adversarial algorithm that may be used for imitation.

Below is a visualization to intuitively understand our approach – existing IRL methods solve an involved minimax game over policy (\(\pi\)) and rewards (\(r\)), finding a policy that matches expert behavior at the unique saddle point solution (\(\pi^*\), \(r^*\)) by utilizing RL (shown in left). IQ-Learn proposes a simple transformation from rewards to Q-functions to instead solve this problem over the policy (\(\pi\)) and the Q-function (\(Q\)) to find the corresponding solution (\(\pi^*\), \(Q^*\)) (shown in right). Now crucially, if we know the Q-function then we explicitly know the optimal policy for it: this optimal policy is to simply choose the (softmax) action that maximizes the Q-function in the given state . Thus, IQ-Learn removes the need for RL to find the policy!

Now, instead of optimizing over the space of all possible rewards and policies, we only need to optimize along a manifold in this space corresponding to the choice of a Q-function and the optimal policy for it (the red line). The new objective along the manifold \(\mathcal{J}^*\) is concave and dependent only on the Q-function variable, allowing the use of simple gradient descent methods to find the unique optima.

Diagram of the IQ-Learn approach. We show the IRL problem (on left) and the IQ-Learn problem (on right). The red line denotes the optimal policy manifold given as the softmax action of Q.

During the course of learning, for discrete action spaces, IQ-Learn optimizes the objective \(\mathcal{J}^*\), taking gradient steps on the manifold with respect to the Q-function (the green lines) converging to the globally optimal saddle point. For continuous action spaces calculating the exact gradients is often intractable and IQ-Learn additionally learns a policy network. It updates the Q-function (the green lines) and the policy (the blue lines) separately to remain close to the manifold. You can read the technical proofs and implementation details in our paper.

IQ-Learn methodology for discrete (on left) and continuous (on right) action spaces.

This approach is quite simple and needs only a modified update rule to train a Q-network using expert demonstrations and, optionally, environment interactions. The IQ-Learn update is a form of contrastive learning, where expert behavior is assigned a large reward, and the policy behavior a low reward; with rewards parametrized using Q-functions. It can be easily implemented in less than 15 lines on top of existing Q-learning algorithms in discrete action spaces, and soft actor-critic (SAC) methods for continuous action spaces.

IQ-Learn has a number of advantages:

It optimizes a single training objective using gradient descent and learns a single model for the Q-function.

It is performant with very sparse data — even single expert demonstrations.

It is simple to implement and can work in both settings: with access to an environment (online IL) or without (offline IL).

It scales to complex image-based environments and has proven theoretical convergence to a unique global optimum.

Lastly, it can be used to recover rewards and add interpretability to the policy’s behavior.

Despite the simplicity of the approach, we were surprised to find that it substantially outperformed a number of existing approaches on popular imitation learning benchmarks such as OpenAI Gym, MujoCo, and Atari, including approaches that were much more complex or domain-specific. In all these benchmarks, IQ-Learn was the only method to successfully reach expert performance by relying on a few expert demonstrations (less than 10). IQ-Learn with a simple LSTM policy also works surprisingly well in the complex open-world setting of Minecraft and is able to learn from videos of human players to solve various tasks like building a house, creating a waterfall, caging animals, and finding caves.

Beyond simple imitation, we also tried to imitate experts where only partial expert data is available or the expert has changes in its environment or goals compared to the agent — more akin to the real world. We were able to show that IQ-Learn can be used for imitation without expert actions, and relying solely on expert observations, enabling learning from videos. Moreover, IQ-Learn was surprisingly robust to distribution shifts in the expert behavior and goals in an environment, showing great generalization to new unseen settings and an ability to act as a meta-learner.





See videos of IQ-Learn below (trained with Image observations):





IQ-Learn on Atari. Our trained agent reaches human performance in all games (using 20 expert demos).





IQ-Learn on Minecraft solving the Create Waterfall task (using 20 expert demos).





IQ-Learn on Robomimic-Can task with a 6 DOF arm learning to pick and place cans in the correct bin (using 30 expert demos).





IQ-Learn on CarRacing Gym environment. Reaching expert driving on different race tracks (using 20 expert demos).

Performance Comparisions (from the paper):

The performance is measured as the environment reward attained by the agent trained using different methods.

The generality of our method — it can be combined with any existing Q-learning or actor-critic implementations — makes IQ-Learn applicable to a wide range of domains and learning objectives in imitation and reinforcement learning beyond those explored in the paper.

We hope that IQ-Learn’s simple approach to learning policies via imitation of a few experts will bring us one step closer to developing sample-efficient general AI agents that can learn a variety of behavior from humans in real-world settings.

But the “bureau of statistics” mindset is now a problem. It dominates thinking everywhere, not just in technology businesses aiming for sticky ads and more captive users. Nearly every institution one can point to today, from government to science, media, medicine, insurance, and many others, embraces a centralized, data-capture model requiring massive computing resources and actively downplaying human ingenuity in favor of number crunching and prediction. More troubling perhaps, is the way this has shaped the zeitgeist. Confidence in human smarts and imagination seems at an all-time low. Entire books are written now on how people are, in effect, cognitively biased, limited, and indeed stupid. Given this cultural climate, Dyson’s time of “creative chaos and freedom” seems not only distant but beyond recovery.

Dyson called the Cold War science of the 1950s and 1960s Napoleonic because research occurred mostly in huge companies like RAND and involved teasing out the implications of earlier scientific results from brilliant Tolstoyan tinkerers like Max Plank or Albert Einstein. As in our present time, results were achieved through the investment of huge sums of money, and were typically conservative in scope, reflecting already formed interests and agendas. Much of the money during that time was spent on making larger fission, then fusion bombs. The math was already done. That time and ours both correspond to Perez’s depiction of a fully matured technology revolution showing signs of slowdown and decay. We seem to have wandered into the 1950s again, this time with Web companies instead of IBM and General Motors. Erik J.

I have a new book coming out in February. It’s about hacking.

A Hacker’s Mind: How the Powerful Bend Society’s Rules, and How to Bend them Back isn’t about hacking computer systems; it’s about hacking more general economic, political, and social systems. It generalizes the term hack as a means of subverting a system’s rules in unintended ways.

What sorts of system? Any system of rules, really. Take the tax code, for example. It’s not computer code, but it’s a series of algorithms—supposedly deterministic—that take a bunch of inputs about your income and produce an output that’s the amount of money you owe. This code has vulnerabilities; we call them loopholes. It has exploits; those are tax avoidance strategies. And there is an entire industry of black-hat hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in the tax code: we call them accountants and tax attorneys.

In my conception, a “hack” is something a system permits, but is unanticipated and unwanted by its designers. It’s unplanned: a mistake in the system’s design or coding. It’s subversion, or an exploitation. It’s a cheat—but only sort of. Just as a computer vulnerability can be exploited over the Internet because the code permits it, a tax loophole is “allowed” by the system because it follows the rules, even though it might subvert the intent of those rules.

Once you start thinking of hacking in this way, you’ll start seeing hacks everywhere. You can find hacks in professional sports, in customer reward programs, in financial systems, in politics; in lots of economic, political, and social systems; against our cognitive functions. A curved hockey stick is a hack, and we know the name of the hacker who invented it. Airline frequent-flier mileage runs are a hack. The filibuster was originally a hack, invented by Cato the Younger, A Roman senator in 60 BCE. Hedge funds are full of hacks.

A system is just a set of rules. Or norms, since the “rules” aren’t always formal. And even the best-thought-out sets of rules will be incomplete or inconsistent. It’ll have ambiguities, and things the designers haven’t thought of. As long as there are people who want to subvert the goals of a system, there will be hacks.

I use this framework in A Hacker’s Mind to tease out a lot of why today’s economic, political, and social systems are failing us so badly, and apply what we have learned about hacking defenses in the computer world to those more general hacks. And I end by looking at artificial intelligence, and what will happen when AIs start hacking. Not the problems of hacking AI, which are both ubiquitous and super weird, but what happens when an AI is able to discover new hacks against these more general systems. What happens when AIs find tax loopholes, or loopholes in financial regulations. We have systems in place to deal with these sorts of hacks, but they were invented when hackers were human and reflect the human pace of hack discovery. They won’t be able to withstand an AI finding dozens, or hundreds, of loopholes in financial regulations. We’re simply not ready for the speed, scale, scope, and sophistication of AI hackers.

72,Users changing their date of birth to that of an adult can upload a video of themselves to prove their age.,artificial intelligence,07/11/2022,https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/ba979a90a60cb838d8c5438a2c73f603,yahoo entertainment,"Stock image of teenagers taking a selfie

Instagram has introduced technology to help verify the age of users in the UK and EU.

Anyone trying to edit their date of birth from that of an under-18 to that of an over-18 must verify their age.

But now, users have the option to record a video of themselves that will be analysed by age-estimation technology, instead of uploading ID.

Instagram said this would help ensure users' experiences on the platform were age appropriate.

In June, Instagram announced it was exploring ways for teenagers to verify their age and comply with platform rules.

And in a US trial, they were given three ways to verify they were over 18:

upload ID

ask three adult users to vouch for them

take a video selfie

Instagram says it already uses artificial intelligence and in-app reports to help determine whether users are under 18 and, indeed, under 13, its minimum age.

But according to research commissioned by UK media regulator Ofcom, one in three children lies about their age to access adult content on social media.

Instagram accounts for under-18s:

are set to private by default, to reduce unwanted contact from strangers

use in-app notifications known as ""nudges"" to encourage users to explore a range of content or spend less time on the app

Instagram public policy director Tara Hopkins said video age verification was an ""important step"" in delivering safer and better experiences for teenagers on the platform.

""We want everyone to experience Instagram in a way that's appropriate for their age, which means we need to know how old they are - and this is a challenge across our industry,"" she said.

Instagram already uses video selfies to verify the identity of users locked out of their account

It has now extended its partnership with UK digital identity provider Yoti to use them to verify age.

Instagram's new video-selfie age-estimation process

Yoti's technology estimates age by analysing facial features.

On average, it says, it is accurate to within:

1.36 years for six-12-year-olds

1.52 years for 13-19-year-olds

Meta, which owns Instagram, says the technology cannot identify anything about users except their age and it and Yoti will delete images once this has been done.

Platforms could face further requirements for verifying the age of younger users under government proposals for the Online Safety Bill, which ministers have said will return to Parliament as soon as possible.",Instagram debuts new age-verification tools in UK and EU,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instagram-debuts-age-verification-tools-135439935.html

Some people with lower body paralysis can walk further after receiving prolonged electrical stimulation to the injured area of their spine NeuroRestore - Jimmy Ravier

Nine people with different degrees of lower body paralysis gained the ability to walk after receiving prolonged electrical stimulation to the injured area of their spine. This led to researchers identifying neurons that may help to improve walking ability post-paralysis.

Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord is often used to relieve pain in people with spinal cord injuries. In the latest discovery, electrical stimulation also accelerated walking recovery among people with spinal cord injuries who had enough functioning neurons in the affected area.

“We mimic the way the spinal cord is normally activated by electrical signals from the brain when you walk, by electrically stimulating the right spot of the spinal cord at the right time to move leg muscles,” says Jocelyne Bloch at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

The team implanted electrical devices into the spinal cords of nine people who had injuries in a similar area of their spinal cord. Six of the participants had some feeling in their legs but little to no ability to move them, while the remaining three couldn’t feel or move their legs at all.

Electrical stimulation was applied to the participants’ spinal cords, with the pattern and location of these pulses being personalised via an artificial intelligence. The participants were then asked to walk as far as possible in 6 minutes.

With the support of a frame, the electrical stimulation enabled them to walk nearly 25 metres, on average.

Over the next five months, they continued to receive this electrical stimulation, alongside guided physiotherapy sessions, up to five times a week. At the end of the study period, they could walk about 50 metres in 6 minutes, on average.

Four of the participants could even walk without any electrical stimulation, suggesting that the therapy induced sustained rewiring of spinal cord neurons.

To better understand how this occurred, the researchers induced spinal cord injuries in mice, paralysing their hind legs. They then implanted a device that delivered electrical pulses to the animals’ spines. Their walking ability subsequently improved.

Next, the researchers mapped the gene activity of the neurons at the mice’s spinal injury site, which revealed that a certain type of neuron became more active after electrical stimulation.

They then used a genetic tool, which could be controlled via light, to silence and reactivate the neurons linked to walking recovery. The rehabilitated mice could only walk when the neurons were switched on.

“After spinal cord injury, you have a lot of chaotic activity where a lot of neurons are trying to function,” says Bloch. “The electrical rehabilitation organises the network of cells and you actually increase the activity of a specific type of cell, while all the other cells are not activated.”

The researchers also found that silencing these neurons in mice that hadn’t been paralysed had very little effect on their walking ability.

“These cells are important for recovery of walking in injured mice, but when we switch them off in healthy mice without injury, it hardly affected their ability to walk,” says Bloch.

“The identification of a recovery-organizing cell type is a big step forward in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie [electrical stimulation] rehabilitation,” wrote Kee Wui Huang and Eiman Azim, at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California, in an accompanying opinion article.

In the future, manipulation of these neurons could reveal new ways to improve walking ability after paralysis, Huang and Azim wrote.

Swiss company Aeler has rebuilt the standard shipping container to make it connected, green, and traceable. Made from a fibreglass and resin composite material, the containers are extremely durable yet very lightweight. They weigh so much less than the containers currently in use that a Unit One can transport around 11 per cent more dry cargo, and 17 per cent more liquid.

The containers are also insulated for passive temperature control, and internet-connected sensors inside provide updates on interior conditions every five to ten minutes, including: humidity, air pressure, temperature, volatile organic compound gases, GPS coordinates, and more.

A management dashboard brings all the data together for near-to-real-time updates, and Aeler also offers a fleet management tool that tracks both maintenance and repair records, and container locations. A subscription to the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) tracking system helps clients reduce the transport of empties by maximising efficiencies across all routes.

Because of the increased volume of cargo held by each Unit One, use of the containers cuts maritime emissions by reducing the numbers of containers required. The smooth sides, while making the containers easier to stack and store, also contribute to lower truck emissions when the containers are transported on land.

The maritime industry constitutes such a large global footprint that innovations are seeking improvements in a myriad of areas. Springwise has spotted modular onboard carbon capture systems, along with filters on ships that remove microplastics from the water.

Determining the best photo-editing software isn’t about identifying the program that has the most features or is available for the cheapest price. Rather, it’s about finding the software that meets your needs and does what you want.

If you’re a casual photographer who enjoys making minor tweaks to mobile snapshots, the best editing program for you is going to be very different from a seasoned professional who makes a living from photography. It can be difficult to sort through all the available apps and programs, but this list – featuring the top 10 options on the market in 2022 – will help you select a photo editor that’s just right for you.

With the right photo-editing software, you can work wonders on your images. I tweaked the above picture in Photoshop to get the colors to look just right while eliminating lots of spots and imperfections.

How to pick the best photo-editing program

As you sort through the myriad editing options available to you, there are a few general criteria to keep in mind.

If you’re a beginner, I recommend prioritizing ease of use over a laundry list of features. Look for options that are inexpensive and that let you open a photo, make some quick edits, and get back to your day. But don’t get caught up searching for the cheapest program; the editing landscape is littered with abandoned free or low-cost apps that blew up and then quickly flamed out, leaving legions of frustrated photographers in their wake.

If you’re a more advanced photographer, look for photo-editing software that’s been around for several years and boasts a broad base of users with an active online community. And while you research, check YouTube for tutorial videos and search the developer’s website for forums, FAQs, and similar materials. Not only are such items a valuable source of information and assistance, but they’re also evidence of a robust software ecosystem and developer commitment. If you’re going to invest your time and money into learning and using a program, you need to know that it will last long into the future.

Adobe Photoshop has everything any editor could want.

Though this list of the best photo-editing programs isn’t presented in any particular order, I would be remiss if I didn’t put the granddaddy of all photo editors, Adobe Photoshop, at the top. Its very name is synonymous with image editing, and more than 30 years since it was first released, it shows no signs of slowing down. Photoshop contains more features than just about any other editing software; it also has an enormous array of tutorials, videos, message boards, social media groups, and even college-level courses to help you hone your skills.

Back in 2013, in a highly controversial move, Adobe switched to a subscription-only pricing model for Photoshop. This means that casual photographers who want to try the program can no longer make a one-time purchase but must instead subscribe to the Creative Cloud platform. Additionally, Photoshop struggles to walk a fine line between supporting users who have used the program for decades and adding new features that compete with more lightweight modern image editors. The result is an interface that, for beginner photographers, is a hopelessly confusing mess of buttons, menus, sliders, and options.

Photoshop is not for the faint of heart, but for those willing to invest significant time into learning how it works, the rewards are well worth the effort.

Pros

• A huge amount of tutorials and resources, both online and in print, to help you learn

• Able to perform nearly any type of photo editing imaginable

Cons

• Subscription-only pricing model

• Extensive features can confuse new users

• Simple tasks in other image editors can involve complex steps in Photoshop

Most photographers would be well-served by Affinity Photo’s set of capabilities.

Professional, amateur, and hobbyist photographers who require a robust image editor with a rich set of features should look no further than Affinity Photo. While its list of capabilities isn’t quite as comprehensive as compared to editors such as Photoshop and GIMP, Affinity Photo can easily meet the needs of most folks who need to edit photos but don’t care about advanced 3D graphics or AI-enhanced tricks. It has advanced RAW processing options, supports unlimited layers, and works seamlessly with other Serif apps like Affinity Publisher and Affinity Design to give you a complete end-to-end graphics-creation workflow solution.

I’ve used the entire Serif software suite for years, and I’ve found it to offer a fantastic alternative to more popular commercial counterparts. While my image editing needs aren’t as advanced as full-time professional photographers, I have not yet encountered a scenario that Affinity Photo could not handle. Best of all, it’s available as a one-time purchase – not a subscription – which should benefit many casual and enthusiast photographers who can’t quite commit to monthly or yearly software fees.

Pros

• Rich set of features to handle the needs of most photographers

• Supports Wacom and other tablets, which are often used for detailed editing and retouching

• One-time purchase instead of a subscription

Pros

• Not as comprehensive as Adobe Photoshop

Pixelmator is great for iPhone users who want to move beyond the capabilities of the built-in camera app.

Photography purists might balk at the inclusion of a mobile-only app in this list, but there’s no getting around the fact that the iPhone is one of the most popular cameras in the world. And Pixelmator Photo is a full-featured, desktop-class image editor that gives iPhone users the ability to do Photoshop-style editing on small screens for a very reasonable price.

It’s important to set expectations before buying Pixelmator Photo. It’s a far cry from Photoshop, so don’t expect a beyond-comprehensive editing suite – yet it still has plenty of tools for hobbyists and even serious photographers who want to use a mobile phone to do high-level image editing. Its feature set ranks somewhere between Lightroom and Photoshop; it’s also very easy to use and features a rich library of tutorials and walkthroughs. Pixelmator Photo does require a small subscription fee, but unlike other mobile editing apps, you can purchase a lifetime subscription for under $60.

Pros

• Brings powerful photo editing to mobile phones

• One-time purchase option for those who don’t want subscription fees

• Machine-learning algorithms help with many editing tasks

Cons:

• iPhone only, which leaves Android users out in the cold

• Similar set of tools as Lightroom Mobile, so if you’re already subscribed to Lightroom, Pixelmator Photo might not be worth it

• Free version is very limited

GIMP is so powerful enough that it should cost hundreds of dollars, but it’s completely free.

For photographers on a budget, it’s hard to choose a better editing program than GIMP. Despite the odd name (which stands for Gnu Image Manipulation Program), this program has a bevy of features and options that come for the best price anyone could ask for: nothing at all. (In other words, GIMP is free!)

But don’t conflate cost with quality. There is plenty in GIMP to satisfy the most demanding photographers; in fact, its toolset is so rich and expansive it can easily overwhelm new users. But for those willing to invest some time into learning the ins and out of this program, it’ll yield impressive results.

GIMP has been developed by members of the open-source community for decades, and in that time, it’s evolved to meet the needs of modern photographers while staying true to its core mission: giving people of all skill levels a powerful suite of editing tools. The layer-based interface will feel comfortable to longtime Photoshop users, and editing options include brushes, paths, text, warp transform, various selection tools, and more.

While GIMP is notoriously difficult to learn and some actions are much slower than you might expect, you can’t beat the price – it’s one area where GIMP stands head and shoulders above almost every other program on this list!

Pros

• Free and available on Mac, Windows, and even Linux computers

• Incredible set of editing features, enough to rival most commercial image editors

• Extensive online resources for help and support

Cons:

• The interface is somewhat complicated and takes time to learn

• Some actions are very slow, especially compared to others on this list

• No built-in tutorials to help new users

Photopea works in any web browser and comes with a host of useful tools.

Photopea is one of those applications that almost seems too good to be true. It’s a full-featured image editor much like Photoshop, it’s free to use like GIMP, and it’s relatively easy to pick up and learn like Pixelmator. It’s also browser-based, which means there’s no software to download and install. It has all the editing tools that casual and hobbyist photographers might need, and it works with all the most common file formats, including PSD, SVG, and TIFF. You don’t even need an account to use it, so there’s literally nothing to lose by going to the Photopea website and testing it out.

That said, Photopea does come with some important caveats. While it’s relatively easy to use for those who are already familiar with image editors, the many buttons, tools, and menus will likely overwhelm beginners. There’s also no support for 3D objects, and while Photopea is astonishingly impressive from a technical standpoint, it’s much slower than the competition. Granted, it’s a free image editor that you can use from any browser, but don’t expect the same performance as other programs.

Pros

• Browser-based, which means you won’t need to install any software or download any apps

• Supports all the common image-editing tools as well as many advanced options

• The free version has very few limitations, while the subscription version is reasonably priced and even includes cloud storage

Cons:

• Slow compared to dedicated programs such as Photoshop and Luminar

• No artificial intelligence or machine-learning tools to speed up your workflow

• Technically possible to use on a mobile phone, but I wouldn’t recommend it

To edit in Pixlr E, all you need is a web browser and a sense of curiosity and fun.

Pixlr E is a browser-based image editor that’s similar to Photopea, though it boasts a slightly different design philosophy. The program offers an impressive array of tools and options, but the interface should appeal to more casual and hobbyist photographers.

It’s incredibly simple to get started: Just navigate to the Pixlr website, click the “Start a Photo Editing Project” option, upload an image, and begin your editing. Everything you do takes place right in your browser window, which means you’ll never need to worry about software installations (though there are downloadable offline apps available) or app updates.

The tradeoff is a lower level of functionality and a more simplistic design compared to the heavy hitters on this list. Even so, Pixlr E is a solid option for anyone looking for a robust editing solution that won’t cost hundreds of dollars.

With many different brush options, a layer-based workflow, dozens of image filters, and even some basic animation tools, Pixlr E likely has all the power you might need to handle your image editing. But some of the more advanced options require a monthly or yearly paid subscription, and you won’t find the same level of in-depth RAW developing options compared to other programs on this list. A lack of export options also holds Pixlr E back – though for anyone who wants an impressive browser-based image editor with lots of features at a great price, Pixlr E is a great choice.

Pros

• Very easy to get started, which lowers the barrier to entry for beginners and new photographers

• Fully browser-based, with some downloadable offline companion apps, too

• The free version has a variety of useful tools and features, and the paid version is reasonably priced

Cons

• Few customization settings for tweaking the interface to your liking

• The paid version has access to premium support, while the free version’s support is limited to online documentation and a relatively small community of Pixlr users



Luminar relies heavily into AI technology, and the results are stunning.

Ah, Luminar. What a breath of fresh air amidst a sea of all-too-similar photo editing applications! I’ve been using Skylum’s Luminar since the company was named MacPhun, and while it’s not my particular cup of tea, it absolutely deserves serious consideration for all photographers (and especially beginner and hobbyist image-makers).

Luminar has evolved considerably over the years and works as a plugin for Lightroom and Photoshop as well as a standalone application. It’s also available as a one-time purchase, which makes it an ideal alternative to Photoshop and other subscription-only options.

This is the original version of the picture featured at the top of this section. Luminar replaced the sky with a single click!

Luminar’s workflow solutions and editing tools are focused on solving editing problems with artificial intelligence as opposed to giving you dozens of individual tools with pixel-level control. It’s a great program for those hoping to enhance portraits, replace the sky, remove and edit backgrounds, or even add portrait blur via automated tools, and the program’s sliders let you adjust all sorts of parameters. If you want great-looking images while letting software tools do most of the heavy lifting – so you can get away from your desk and back to using your camera – then Luminar is an outstanding pick.

Pros

• Amazing suite of AI-powered tools to enhance your images quickly and easily

• Easy to import an image, click a few buttons, and get impressive results

• Each type of edit has filters to let you tweak the results to your liking

Cons

• Standalone purchase option is available, but you’re encouraged to subscribe and/or purchase additional plugins

• No fine-grained control over every element in your images

• Limited exporting options

The big advantage of Photoworks is its price (along with the set of useful editing features).

While many of the image editors on this list are available for both Mac and Windows computers, PhotoWorks is somewhat unique in that it’s available only for Windows. That puts it in a bit of a unique position in the editing world, and if you prefer Dell, HP, or Lenovo over Apple, you have access to a powerful software tool that can easily improve your photography workflow. In terms of editing options, PhotoWorks isn’t in the same league as Photoshop or Pixelmator Photo, but it’s also significantly less expensive, which makes a big difference for many people.

Rather than feature endless palettes of buttons and tools, PhotoWorks takes a more minimalistic approach. Once you import an image, you can use Lightroom-style sliders to adjust basic parameters like exposure, contrast, saturation, and vibrance (all of which will be immediately familiar to Lightroom users). You can also use sliders to adjust colors and sharpness and use one-click options to remove backgrounds, edit portraits, and more. The results are very good, especially considering the minimal amount of editing time required.

Bottom line: PhotoWorks is an impressive image editor, and the basic version is available for only $20 (while the high-end option costs just $80).

Pros

• The standard version is very reasonably priced and will meet the needs of many casual and hobbyist photographers

• Features a wide variety of adjustment sliders in addition to automatic edits

• Supports easily adding text, watermarks, and logos



Cons

• Editing tools are especially comprehensive compared to Photoshop

• Can open RAW files, but the developing options could be better

• Noise-removal tools need improvement



PaintShop Pro has been around longer than many photographers have been alive, and it remains a solid choice among image editors.

While PaintShop Pro might not have the same level of name recognition as some of its peers, photographers who use Windows computers and want an incredibly capable software tool to handle their image-editing needs would do well to consider the program. It has a rich history that goes all the way back to the early 1990s, and rather than let the software stagnate, the developers have continued to add new features to meet the needs of modern photographers; the result is a program that more than holds its own among a sea of competitors.

The user interface almost feels like an amalgam of other editing software such as Photoshop and Luminar. There are plenty of buttons and tools, including brush, crop, redeye removal, create shapes, work with lines and text, and more. You also have access to layers, masks, effects, and a powerful selection tool that will make Photoshop users feel as though they have been overpaying for their software.

Recent AI-powered additions allow you to remove backgrounds, retouch portraits, and even restore old photos with impressive results – and while PaintShop pro may not be quite as powerful or customizable as some of its peers, it’s an outstanding choice for photographers who want a powerful editor without paying for a recurring subscription.

Pros

• An impressive number of tools and automatic enhancements that’ll suit the needs of most photographers.

• Supports RAW import and allows you to export in a variety of formats.

• Multiple workspaces let you customize the editing environment to suit your individual preferences



Cons

• Windows-only

• Can slow down from time to time

Acorn keeps things simple and basic. Sometimes, that’s all you need.

Acorn is a Mac-only program, and in some ways, it feels like a refreshing change of pace for photographers who’ve grown weary of expensive subscriptions, hand-holding auto-enhancements, and all-in-one editors that try to do everything and end up succeeding at nothing. Acorn is essentially a Photoshop that’s been stripped down to the basics – with a price to match. For just $40, you get a layer-based image editor featuring a useful suite of tools and effects that can take your photography quite far.

The Acorn workflow feels fast and simple: Download the program, open a photo, and you’re off to the races. You can make selections, add layers, insert text, and use dozens of filters that mimic the functionality of far more expensive programs. You won’t find any artificial intelligence or cloud-based editing features, but you will get a program that more than meets the needs of beginners while also offering options that appeal to more advanced photographers.

Pros

• Simple and easy to use

• Includes the most common tools from more popular image editors

• Allows for a combination of bitmap and vector-based editing, which is ideal for image editors who also dabble in graphic design



Cons

• Priced similarly to Affinity Photo but with far fewer features

• Mac only, with no iPhone or iPad option

• Limited community support makes troubleshooting very frustrating



Which editing program is best for you?

Everyone has different needs, but whatever your situation, you can find an image editor that’ll do what you want.

It’s hard to identify the single best editing program. After all, every photographer has a different set of requirements! However, there are three options that stand out for beginner, enthusiast, and advanced photographers that I can recommend without hesitation:

Beginners: Pixlr E. The basic version is free to use, offers a simple and visually appealing user interface, and works with any web browser (so there are no apps to install). If you want to go beyond simply swiping through filters on your phone, Pixlr E is a great choice.

Enthusiast: Affinity Photo. This program has really come into its own over the past two years and has shown no signs of slowing down. It has a deep set of tools, a robust online community of users, and it integrates seamlessly with other Affinity apps (in case you ever want to expand your repertoire).

Advanced: Photoshop. Yes, it requires a subscription, but you get an awful lot for your money, and Adobe continues to add useful enhancements on a regular basis. Photoshop has been the gold standard for years, and with good reason. Sometimes, the most popular program really is the best.",The Best Photo-Editing Software in 2022 (10 Picks),https://digital-photography-school.com/best-photo-editing-software/

Editors can now work in vertical resolutions, making it easier to create content for TikTok, Instagram, or Snapchat.

“This is a major update with new added support for social media vertical resolutions. Now, customers can work quickly and easily to create video posts for sites such as TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook shorts, Instagram TV and more,” Blackmagic Design CEO Grant Petty said in a release. “We’re always excited to see what our customers can do with these amazing updates to DaVinci Resolve.”

The update also improves upon how multiple users to edit at the same time by locking individual timelines. This allows two people to work on separate timelines without locking the entire project.

Additionally, DaVinci 18.1 offers an artificial intelligence (AI) dialogue leveler and AI voice isolation, making it easier to edit the sound on videos. This can help users isolate dialogue and make it smoother while detecting and reducing unwanted ambient noises like a plane flying overhead or random background noises.

The update actually includes a number of changes, all of which make editing easier, faster, and of higher quality.

“Updates to the internal processing result in up to 10 [times] faster Text+, [five times] faster stabilization, face refinement tracking and analysis, [four times] faster spatial noise reduction, better playback performance with large node graphs and improved Blackmagic RAW decoding on Apple Silicon,” the release reads.

New support for Dolby Vision 5.1.0 cinema trims means users can fine-tune exactly how their work looks in HDR.

For those looking to give their social media videos a professional polish, a tool like this could be a massive time saver. It also allows more creators to have control over their work with a less difficult barrier of entry. DaVinci Resolve 18.1 is also free to download, making it much more accessible than a product like Adobe.

A proliferation of free or partially free apps have been coming for Adobe in video and photo editing.

Google has one in the form of Imagen but the most well-known is OpenAI's Dalle-2. This is a system that's able to create realistic images and art based on descriptive terms input by the user.

Dalle-2 is now open to the public meaning anyone can use it and for free (up to a certain number of uses). So we've been testing out the AI to see what images we could create. Keep scrolling to see what we've crafted. We've included the terms we used to create the images, so you can see how close the AI got to meeting the request.

POCKET-LINT VIDEO OF THE DAY

Kid's drawing

Dalle-2 is interesting because you can not only tell it what to create but also the style of art you're after. So that's just what we did:

""Child's crayon styling drawing of a monster on a wall like graffiti.""

Doughnut house

You can also let your imagination run away with you. So if you're hungry then just turn food into objects:

""A house made entirely of ring doughnuts with a pink glaze and sprinkles.""

New Google Pixel watch

We thought it might be fun to try to get an idea of future smart devices and what an AI might think they looked like. Sadly it did a better job on the woman's hair than the watch.

""New Google Pixel watch with bright colours being worn by a stylish woman with curly hair.""

Batman's new ride

You can make your requests as specific as you like right down to the era of something, the style or simply the subject matter.

""A new Batmobile with 1990s styling being admired by The Joker.""

Balloon monsters

What's one of the least fearsome things you're ever likely to see? A balloon monster? We figured that might make a fun alternative to one of the other giant creatures that have historically attacked Japan.

""A giant green balloon animal attacks Tokoyo.""

Concept BMW

We love concept cars that various brands come up with. Designers and engineers are coming up with all sorts of future designs for cars. But what can the AI think the future looks like?

""A futuristic concept of an autonomous self-driving BMW on a quiet street.""

Space monkey

What if we sent monkeys to Mars instead of people? What would that look like? Well, according to Dalle-2 that would result in some fairly grumpy-looking monkeys. Understandably.

""High resolution photo of a monkey astronaut on his way to Mars.""

Germs

We recently wrote about Nikon's Photomicrography Competition which features awesome photos of the tiniest things in our world. We wanted to see what Dalle-2 could create.

""Award-winning photos of micro organisms.""

An exploding phone

Not one wants to see this happening to their smartphone, yet we've seen enough horror stories over the years.

""A mobile phone that's overheated and exploded on a wooden table.""

Roses in bloom

Sometimes you've got to take time out to smell the roses, even if those roses aren't real and were created by AI.

Dashlane can keep your employees' passwords safe By Pocket-lint Promotion · 23 August 2022 If you're concerned about your organisation's security, this is a no-brainer.

""A macro photograph of a rose bush in full bloom.""

Dogs in a submarine

Dalle-2 seems pretty good at creating cartoon imagery. In this instance an amusing vision of a pair of dogs having a great time under the sea.

""A cartoon dog inside a yellow submarine deep under the sea.""

Concept cars

Concept cars can often be a bit out there. And that's the fun of them because designers often have a bit more freedom in their creations. So why not let the AI have some fun too?

""The weirdest concept car ever designed by man.""

Duck vs turtle

After seeing what Google Imagen could do we thought it would be interesting to replicate its results by using the same terms. The results aren't quite as impressive, but are still a lot of fun.

""A chrome-plated duck with a golden beak arguing with an angry turtle in a forest.""

Robots in an art gallery

Another of Google's examples saw some funky robots in a flooded gallery. What would Dalle-2 do with such a request?

""An art gallery displaying Monet paintings. The art gallery is flooded. Robots are going around the art gallery using paddle boards.""

Corgi in Times Square

Seeing dogs wearing hats and behaving like human beings is always fun in real life. We love that the AI has chosen to embody that joy in one image while making the dog super grumpy in the other.

""A photo of a Corgi dog riding a bike in Times Square. It is wearing sunglasses and a beach hat.""

The moon made of cheese

We were frankly a bit disappointed with this one as we were hoping for something a bit more creative when we asked to see the moon made of cheese. But perhaps you need to be a bit more specific in your requests to get the best results.

""The moon made of cheese.""

A space racoon

With this one, we actually got two quite different results, if slightly subtle ones. One racoon is looking inside from outside and one doing the opposite.

""A photo of a raccoon wearing an astronaut helmet, looking out of the window at night.""

An exploding vase

We're big fans of high-speed photography and slow-mo results. So we wondered what Dalle-2 would come up with if we asked it to create something similar.

""A glass vase full of flowers explodes in slow motion in front of a colourful wall and glass shatters all over the place.""

A cyberpunk styled car races away from police on horseback in Times Square

For some reason when we asked for this scene Dalle-2 gave the police officers space helmets. Make of that what you will.

""A cyberpunk styled car races away from police on horseback in Times Square.""

Colourful computers

One of the highlights of this AI technology is the way it can create new artwork based on the style of a human artist. Even where that artist might not have painted such a picture before.

""A painting of a 90s computer in the style of Claude Monet.""

Vader is angry

Admittedly Darth Vader looks a bit strange in a couple of these images, but the overall theme is still sort of what we were hoping for.

""Darth Vader angrily chastises a stormtrooper who is crying at his desk.""

Teddy time

There's something amusing about Teddy Bears going on adventures. These two furry creatures are having a great time on skate boards in public spaces.

""A posh teddy bear on a skateboard near the Arc de Triomphe.""

Cat monster

We've had fun experimenting with what Dalle-2 can create when it comes to cartoon artwork. Here cats become sea monsters and frankly it's quite unnerving.

""A cat seamonster destroying a fishing boat during a storm.""

Cybernetic humans in a pop art style

Even if the end results can be a touch hit and miss at times, you've got to admire how versatile the AI can be. How many humans could create so many different styles of artwork?

""A cybernetic human painted in pop art style.""

Aliens at the Whitehouse

It seems that artificial intelligence doesn't have any idea what aliens might look like. We do find it interesting that they apparently can look like ghosts who travel by space jellyfish though.

""Alien visitors at the White house in the art style of Mars Attacks!""

The rising need for efficient drug discovery solutions is fueling the expansion of the Asia-Pacific Artificial intelligence in drug discovery market. Several companies have begun focusing on using AI in the pharmaceutical research and development process.

The lack of a sophisticated healthcare system, the tiny number of companies actively engaged in medication discovery and development, and low per capita disposable incomes in some parts of Africa have combined to make the Middle East and Africa the smallest market for artificial intelligence in this field.

90,Even the most advanced automated systems can’t catch every bit of extreme content.,artificial intelligence,07/11/2022,,the atlantic,"Updated at 12:18 p.m. ET on November 7, 2022

There’s been a lot of chatter, in recent days, about the fate of a certain platform that deals mostly in text posts no longer than 280 characters. With a chaos agent now at the helm of Twitter, many people are understandably fretting about whether it could possibly control a rising tide of abuse, hate speech, pornography, spam, and other junk. But in a sense, these worries miss the point: In 2022, Twitter is small fry.

A far grander and more terrifying saga is unfolding on the endless video feeds that have become the dominant mode of social media today, drawing not millions but billions of monthly users on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. The Era of Video has definitively and irreversibly arrived.

Doubters might look to a recent clash between social-media royalty and Instagram leadership. Back in July, two Kardashians and a Jenner shared an Instagram image from the creator Tati Bruening calling on the platform to “stop trying to be tiktok.” In the history of social media, this was a bit like the 21st-century equivalent of nailing a pamphlet to a cathedral door. The protest referred in no uncertain terms to the company’s turn toward video, and away from its origins as a vehicle for still images. TikTok, of course, is almost entirely video—a relentlessly addictive scroll of auto-playing content, much of which comes from accounts you do not follow.

But not even some of the biggest influencers of all time could turn the tides. The day after their posts went up, Instagram’s CEO, Adam Mosseri, doubled down. “I need to be honest,” he said (in a video). “I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time.”

No matter where you swipe or tap, video is there—a torrent of pixels, fury, and sound that is, if not literally infinite, effectively endless. The quality of our online lives now hinges on how these feeds are ordered and mediated, powers that are largely automated. In line with its push to embrace video, Meta has said that by the end of 2023, it will more than double the proportion of material on Instagram and Facebook users’ feeds that is “recommended by our AI.” The likelihood that we’ll find ourselves hurtling down one of those black holes of content—where time seems to dilate and lose all meaning—will depend less on whom we follow and more on what the machine decides to serve us next.

The shape of our politics, our ideology, and even our fundamental grasp of how the world works is, in some substantial way, up to the algorithms. According to a recent survey from the Pew Research Center, a quarter of people under 30 in the U.S. regularly get their news from TikTok clips. That number is growing. People are even turning to social-media video as a replacement for Google search.

Whether the results of such swipes and searches lead us to enlightenment or drag our worldviews further down toward their least reconciliatory, most conspiratorial depths depend in part on AI. In an experiment from September, the fact-checking company NewsGuard found that the top results on TikTok for a range of terms often included misleading, hateful, and in some cases extremely dangerous videos. Thirteen of the top 20 results for does mugwort induce abortion, for example, advocated unproven herbal abortifacients such as papaya seeds. In the same experiment, a search for hydroxychloroquine yielded a tutorial on how to fabricate the malaria drug—and bogus COVID cure—at home using grapefruit. Needless to say, this is not how to make hydroxychloroquine.

All of this should lead social-media companies to redouble their efforts to keep the muck—violence, illegal pornographic material, disinformation—off their platforms. As it is, only about 40 percent of the videos that TikTok pulls down are culled with automated systems, leaving millions of videos to be reviewed each month by workers who will have to spend the rest of their lives under the pall of what they’ve seen.

Even the most cutting-edge AI is not always as smart or all-seeing as it’s chalked up to be. These shortcomings could become more painfully evident in the years ahead. And if there were a way for AI to execute moderation tasks faithfully and accurately on the endless feed, it could come at a heavy price, drawn directly from our scant remaining balance of privacy and autonomy.

How does a machine even “understand” a video in the first place? Thanks to advances in computer vision over recent years, it’s become routine for AI to examine still images and, for example, connect the attributes of a face to someone’s identity, or to conclude that a gun is indeed a gun—or that a grapefruit is indeed a grapefruit.

Every minute of video is really just thousands of static pictures arranged in succession. And AI-based computer vision can certainly find still frames containing signals of problematic content with impressive tenacity. But that’s only going to get you so far. YouTube arguably has the most extensive experience with automated video moderation, but violative videos are viewed millions of times every day.

Part of the issue is that video contains a lot of data. In sequence, the thousands of still frames that make up a video create narrative. The accompanying audio adds further layers of meaning. This morass can be difficult to sort through—the density of data in any given video is a “two-sided coin,” as Dhanaraj Thakur, a research director at the Washington, D.C.–based Center for Democracy and Technology, told me. You can’t have the system analyze just one layer, because it would pick up a bycatch of content that, at a glance, would appear to break terms of service, despite being innocuous—while still letting other illicit material through the gaps.

For example, a system that flags any video with a gun would flag a clip from Pawn Stars with two people discussing the value of an antique rifle. Meanwhile, it would miss a clip of a person being shot with a firearm that’s out of frame. Visually and even perhaps auditorily, a clip of someone attempting to make hydroxychloroquine might be hard to discern from that of someone making grapefruit juice, especially if that person takes care not to say anything about COVID.

Read: Of God and machines

Social-media firms couldn’t abide such overzealous AI-based policing, because it would get in the way of the kind of content that’s often best for engagement and ad impressions—the shocking, the outrageous, and, of course, the risqué. AI-based skin detection, which continues to be the basis for nudity filtering, might block any clip of swimwear-clad beachgoers, spelling doom for an entire industry of fitness influencers. This has pushed the research community toward some unorthodox solutions over the years. Researchers have, for example, sought to improve the accuracy of these kinds of classifiers with AI that recognizes porn’s unique patterns of motion, as well as its singular soundtrack—in the words of one team: “moans, deep breathing, panting, groans, screams, and whimpers,” as well as “bed creaking, sheets rustling.” But although such tools may work fine in the lab, they can struggle in the infinitude of the real world. A similar effort from 2006 that detected porn on the basis of the audio’s “periodicity”—that is, its repetitiveness—ended up catching lots of footage of tennis matches.

Ultimately, a video’s true meaning may be gleaned only at the “confluence” of its various layers of data, as Becca Ricks, a senior researcher at the Mozilla Foundation, put it to me.

Footage of a desolate landscape with a tumbleweed blowing across it would raise no red flags for either a human or a machine, nor would an audio clip of someone saying, “Look how many people love you.” But if you combine the two and send the result to someone you’re cyberbullying—No one loves you!—the computer would be none the wiser.

Much hate speech, it turns out, fits snugly in this gap of computer comprehension. A “Hateful Meme Challenge” organized by Facebook in 2020 created a set of more “subtle” combinations of images and text that AI struggles to understand; an image of a tumbleweed with the exact phrasing contained above, for example, or a picture of an alligator with the text “Your wrinkle cream is working great.” Different AI models had varying levels of success, but none of them came close to human accuracy. Effective moderation can require “real-life context and common sense,” researchers wrote—in other words, a human’s sensibilities. Achieving better results in a single TikTok, which the researcher Abbie Richards describes as a “three dimensional meme composed of video, audio, and text,” could take a quantum leap in technology.

AI also doesn’t do well on things that it hasn’t encountered before—“edge cases,” in the poetics of the academy. This lends those posting harmful content a perpetual upper hand. “Humans are good at adaptation,” Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who was one of the creators of PhotoDNA, a widely used system for detecting child porn, told me. “AI is slower.”

YouTube has said that prior to 2020, its AI had gotten reasonably good at detecting “the few main narratives” that dominated “the misinformation landscape online,” (“9/11 truthers, moon landing conspiracy theorists, and flat earthers”). But when a wave of new pandemic mis- and disinformation began to flood the web, it took time for the company to retrain its algorithms and catch up.

Maybe someday AI will reliably grasp the difference between an exercise video and a porno, or between banter and hate speech. But an AI that can preempt the next trick up the misinformation community’s sleeve? That could be beyond science fiction.

Even if AI could filter out illicit video with superhuman acuity, there is still the task of ordering the endless feed. With extreme political content on the rise across the internet, the manner in which the algorithm chooses what to surface and recommend is a fraught technological question with very high stakes. Here, too, video is different.

When you engage with a video online, you generate far more data than you give up by just staring at a photo, according to Spandana Singh, a former policy analyst at New America's Open Technology Institute. Companies can track things like how many times you rewatched a video or how far through you made it before skipping to something else. “All that interaction data, I have to assume, goes into determining how videos are ranked,” Ricks told me. (TikTok and Instagram did not respond to a request for comment about how they use interaction data to serve content; both have information pages explaining that they use interactions to sort through and serve content.)

The AI that churns these data has proved astonishingly adept at keeping us on our screens as long as possible—sometimes with perilous results.

An internal Facebook document from 2020, which was released as part of the Facebook Papers and recently analyzed by a team at Amnesty International, describes how a video of the leader of the anti-Rohingya extremist group 969 circulated on Facebook two full years after the company faced widespread condemnation for its role in the Rohingya genocide. As it turned out, the clip’s numbers had not been driven by some coordinated campaign. Seventy percent of the video’s views had come through Facebook’s algorithmically fueled “Up Next” feature. The same team also noted that algorithmically recommended content already accounted for no less than half of the total time that Burmese users spent on the platform.

The issue is that an AI optimized for engagement can’t tell the difference between a clip that you enjoyed watching and one that you hate-watched, or watched passively. If you watched a clip multiple times, the AI won’t be able to discern whether it was because it gave you joy or because it boiled your blood. (Even if it could, a company might end up promoting infuriating content anyway because it’s so compelling—Facebook supposedly did exactly that after introducing emoji-based reactions a few years ago.) As Singh put it, “How do you train a recommender system to optimize for happiness? Like, what does that mean?”

Read: Artificial intelligence is misreading human emotion

Some people are trying to find out. Jochen Hartmann, an assistant professor at the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, is part of an enthusiastic technical community building AI that hunts for the “unstructured” data within social-media video. Last year, Hartmann and three other researchers built a tool that analyzed video for a wide range of different qualities, including whether any given face in the clip expresses anger, happiness, disgust, surprise, or neutrality. If such a system could, say, rank videos by how happy they are, it might help elevate more positive content and subdue the darker stuff: less vitriol, more virtue. Researchers are also exploring using such techniques for detecting hate speech more effectively.

Of course, there’s a caveat. “All of this information,” Hartmann told me, “can be used to recommend new products.” It might be used, in connection with your personal data, for marketing.

And another: “Emotion recognition” is widely seen to be based on physiognomic theories that were revealed, decades ago, to be both thoroughly unscientific and startlingly racist.

Every expert I spoke with said that it’s hard to measure what we know to be true of AI in general against what’s actually going on inside the locked labs and servers of Silicon Valley. The algorithms behind products like Facebook and TikTok are “frustratingly and impossibly opaque,” as the Microsoft researcher Tarleton Gillespie has written.

Technology is also evolving rapidly. The forces governing video feeds today may not have much in common with whatever users will be subjected to a few years from now. “Here’s the one thing I’ve learned in my 30-year career,” Farid told me. “Don’t make predictions about the future when it comes to technology.”

If there is just one certainty in all of this, it is that video holds an embarrassment of data—and although these data might prove to be a stubborn obstacle for AI moderation and an impish enabler for recommendation engines, Farid is sure of this much: “Companies will figure out how to mine this massive amount of data to monetize it.”

In particular, video could be unimaginably useful for building the next generation of artificial intelligence. In 2016, the internet was briefly gripped by the Mannequin Challenge, in which people held poses as a camera moved around the scene. Two years later, Google revealed that it had used 2,000 mannequin-challenge videos to develop an AI capable of depth perception, a skill that will be essential for the kind of embodied robots that Silicon Valley hopes to bring to market in the coming years.

Other, similar experiments are surely in the works. Both Meta and Google recently unveiled prototype AI systems capable of turning any text prompt into video. It’s like DALL-E, but for the moving image—a cataclysmic prospect for keeping disinformation off the internet, according to Farid and Thakur, the Center for Democracy and Technology research director.

Maybe elsewhere in Silicon Valley, a team of engineers is using one of the mostly very boring videos I post about food to train up another AI. What for? Who knows.

I asked Farid if he thought those as-yet-shrouded future AIs will be built from the ground up with an eye to ethics. On this, he was also willing to break his rule against predictions. “No,” he said. “I’m not that naive.”",What Happens When Everything Becomes TikTok,https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/tiktok-instagram-video-feeds-ai-algorithm/672002/?utm_source=feed

Life scientists have a data problem: information is fragmented, siloed and incomplete. And that gets in the way of taking full advantage of using artificial intelligence technology.

A panel of researchers discussed challenges to adopting AI tools in life sciences at the Intelligent Applications Summit hosted by Madrona Venture Group in Seattle last week.

Artificial intelligence is transforming how tech companies do everything from selling products to routing packages. New AI “foundation” models like GPT-3 and DALL-E that can generate new sentences or images were built using massive training sets pulled from the internet.

But in the life sciences, “the standardization of the data is very challenging,” said panelist Maddison Masaeli, CEO of Deepcell, a startup that visually analyzes and categorizes single cells.

Cell biology information is plagued by differences in sample collection, storage and processing, said Masaeli, hindering comparisons across datasets. “From the point of sample collection until you have the image, there are tens of steps that cause variability in the data,” she said.

Not all life sciences data are messy. Protein structures, for instance, are represented in standardized ways in standardized databases. That enabled the training of DeepMind’s AlphaFold and the University of Washington’s RoseTTAFold, AI tools that recently cracked open the longstanding problem of predicting protein folding. More recently, the UW released ProteinMPPN, an AI-powered protein design tool.

But even for proteins, a lot of information is behind a wall. Lucas Nivon, CEO of Seattle protein design startup Cyrus Biotechnology, said that Cyrus approached big pharma companies about sharing their databases on the structure of antibodies, the basis of many treatments. Tens of thousands of such structures are siloed at various companies.

The companies were all interested in pooling data, and discussed mechanisms for sharing proprietary structures, said Nivon. “And then nobody wanted to be the first the lead investor, so to say,” said Nivon.

Cyrus joined with Amazon Web Services and other partners this summer to create an open-source protein design nonprofit, OpenFold, that is now talking with potential partners about sharing such antibody structure data.

“There is that dark matter that is just sitting there on the side. It’s literally just there,” said Nivon. “And everybody admits it.”

The issues of reliability and bias that plague AI modeling in tech applications also affect the life sciences, but in different ways, said the panelists.

When AI churns out a nonsense paragraph, users can see that right away. But if it’s spitting out the wrong diagnosis or the wrong protein structure, it’s harder to assess, said Jonathan Carlson, who leads life sciences research and incubation at Microsoft Health Futures, part of the tech giant’s research division.

“Many of the problems we see in life sciences are not unique, but they’re very acute,” added Carlson.

Testing products made through AI and then feeding the data back into the model sounds tidy in principle, but in the life sciences the process can take a long time. Cyrus is testing some of its engineered proteins with collaborators who are generating new transgenic mice, a process that can take well over a year. But Nivon’s team also leverages high throughput in vitro and cellular screening systems.

Efforts to optimize screening systems will enable faster honing of AI models, said Nivon. He points to Capsida Biotherapeutics, which iteratively engineers and screens designs for gene therapy using animal models, harvesting tissue to assess which are effectively getting to the right place in the body.

Researchers would like to better connect biological data to clinical outcomes, but there’s a lot standing in the way, including the need to protect privacy, said Masaeli. “There is no one power of Google that includes all the health data or biological data of the world,” she said.

Carlson envisions a future when more life sciences data are de-identified and funneled into standardized, interconnected formats. Ultimately, data from clinical trials and animal experiments could feed back efficiently into a network to help develop new hypothesis and hone questions for basic research.

How to get there is a major question for the field, said Carlson: “How do we enable collaboration while still respecting not only intellectual property but privacy? What does it actually mean to be able to build large foundation models when we can’t even get the data open?”

94,We also talked about AI and VR — but we know why you’re here: the upstart design platform sold to its biggest competitor. CEO Dylan Field explains why.,artificial intelligence,08/11/2022,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ST_bggERPD8aS4WpWoUG8uFcJBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24176707/226396_Decoder_Dylan_Field_Figma_WJoel.jpg,the verge,"Dylan Field is the co-founder and CEO of Figma, which makes a very popular design tool that allows designers and their collaborators to all work together right in a web browser. You know how multiple people can edit together in Google Docs? Figma is that for design work. We just redesigned The Verge; we used Figma extensively throughout that process.

So for years, people have been waiting on the inevitable Figma vs. Adobe standoff since Figma was such a clear upstart competitor to Photoshop and Illustrator and the rest. Well, buckle up because in September, Adobe announced that it was buying Figma for $20 billion. Figma is going to remain independent inside Adobe, but you know, it’s a little weird.

So I wanted to talk to Dylan about the deal, why he’s doing it, how he made the decision to sell, and what things he can do as part of Adobe that he couldn’t do as an independent company.

Dylan’s also a pretty expansive thinker, so after we talked about his company getting the “fuck you” money from Adobe, we talked about making VR Figma for the metaverse and AGI, which is artificial general intelligence, or the kind of AI that can fully think for itself. This episode takes a turn. I think you’re going to like it.

Okay, Dylan Field, CEO of Figma. Here we go.

Dylan Field is the co-founder and CEO of Figma. Welcome to Decoder.

Thank you. I’m excited to be on Decoder. Let’s make it happen.

Yeah! So you and I had dinner a while ago. It was before you were going to sell the company to Adobe and before we launched our redesign.

We may or may not have already been in talks with Adobe at that point. You were telling me about the redesign, and it hadn’t yet lit up the entire internet. I was very intrigued to see it at that point and saw it a little bit afterwards. You were telling me about the process of it. That was really cool to hear about.

Yeah, I was dangling. This is inside baseball of how we get people to come on the show. I was like, “I’ll show you the redesign, if you come on Decoder.” Then you announced your Adobe deal and went quiet, we launched the redesign, and now here we are — it finally happened. I’m very excited to talk to you. There’s a lot of Decoder stuff to talk about. Figma itself is a fascinating product with a lot of fascinating elements to how it works, what it runs on, all of that.

Let’s start at the very beginning. Tell people what Figma is in a way that they can explain to their friends who haven’t heard about it.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

Figma is a platform for visual communication design. We start off with FigJam, which is our brainstorming, whiteboarding, ideation tool. It’s a great place to help run meetings with your entire team and also to facilitate them, make them more fun and engaging, and bring more ideas forth. From there we have Figma Design, which is a great platform to be able to really work with your design team across the company and to express visual design, interface design, and more. Finally, we go into the design and production side. There is not a lot to talk about there today, but I think over the next year there will be a lot there to speak about.

When you say the design and production side, and how there will be a lot to speak about, do you mean actually generating the code that makes a website?

One thing people don’t realize is that about a third of the people that use Figma on a weekly basis are developers. I just think we could do a much better job of serving their needs. Right now we are so focused on designers and people that work very close to designers in that co-creation process. How do we make it so that there’s a better way to go from design to production, to do that handoff and to make it so that you’re able to align really well with your developer counterpart? I think there is a lot we could do there, so that is something we’re thinking a lot about right now.

So just to unpack that for people, let’s say you’re going to launch a new product or something on the internet. In FigJam, your client, your product manager, your designers, and other stakeholders all get together and have a meeting.

You might be in HR, sales, or really anywhere in the org. Anywhere that wants to design a better meeting, that’s FigJam. We’re seeing it all across the org now, which is pretty cool.

Okay. So from there, you go to Figma, where the actual designers design a product. Then from there, you have to go write some code to ship the product that’s been designed through this process.

Exactly, idea to design to production.

You’re saying you want to go into that last stage, but you’re not there yet.

Exactly.

So Figma is the main tool. It’s the thing that designers use and the reason the company is famous. I imagine it is the reason that Adobe wants to buy the company right now, because it’s the product that is taking market share away from them. It all seems very obvious right now, in the way that every successful company seems obvious at the end of one path. When you started this 10 years ago, people thought this was a bad idea. Talk about that journey, where you knew, “We want to bring design to the web in the way that Figma works on the web.” What was the moment that you knew it was going to work?

Totally. There’s a lot there. Before I get into it, I’ll also add that I think I probably had as much conversation and heard as much excitement from Adobe about FigJam as I have about Figma Design at this point. We’ll get back to that later.

Ten years ago, when I was an intern at LinkedIn, I heard its cofounder and then-CEO Reid Hoffman say, “Most good companies have a good why-now.” It’s interesting to think about the different why-nows that exist in software. For a long time, I couldn’t figure out Twitter’s why-now. I realized at some point that you had SMS, so people were used to short-form content exchange, and you also had this cultural change, which was AIM away messages. Remember away messages? You could update your away message — it was basically like Twitter before Twitter.

Yes, in a less democracy-altering way. I was a master of the away message.

Seriously, people were trained into this behavior, so it wasn’t new behavior when Twitter launched. It was something that enough people already had a critical mass around and knew how to do.

It can be social like that, or it can be a moment in time. “This thing was regulated; now it’s not regulated.” Or it could be a new technology. In our case, we were set on new technologies. We were looking at WebGL and drones. My co-founder was very convincing, saying that we shouldn’t do drones, so we went to WebGL instead and explored there.

It was like, “Okay, WebGL lets you use the GPU, your computer, and the browser. What can we do with that?” So we started proving it out. He had made a bunch of tech demos already, and we started to look at it in the context of professional-grade tools and eventually interface design.

The more we built with WebGL, the more confident we were that this could be a technology we could use to go build a professional-grade interface design tool. But like you said, no one believed us. I kept trying to recruit people, and I found that if I didn’t show up and immediately open my laptop to show them the tool working, they just wouldn’t believe me. I couldn’t even get them to wait around in a meeting. They would do it, because they were polite, but people form their first impression quite quickly. If I waited until the end of the meeting to show the candidates the tool versus showing them the tool in the first two minutes, it was a way different conversion probability of whether they were interested in the next step. If you’re sitting there with me for an hour, you’re just like, “This guy is full of it,” versus, “Wow, this is maybe legit.” It was a very different proposition.

So people didn’t believe that you could run desktop-class design in a browser using WebGL.

Not at all, no. I think there had been too many examples of prior art, and not just in creative tools, but also in folks trying to build really good web applications. Outside of things like Google Docs and G Suite, there weren’t a lot of good examples yet. Some people in the know were seeing that things like Onshape were starting to come out. I think Aviary was a predecessor to Figma in some ways. It did good work, but in Flash, so it was kind of the wrong technology at the wrong time. It’s amazing how just a few years can make that difference.

I actually want to get into the web and WebGL and what that means for Figma as a company.

Heck yes.

I think it’s really important but under-recognized. Figma is a web standards company in a very important way. But let’s come back to that. Let’s do the Decoder questions first. I think of these as the basic questions. How many people are at Figma right now after 10 years?

We’re nearing 1,000.

Have you scaled at a linear rate? Have you added 100 people a year for 10 years, or have there been peaks and valleys?

I would say we have roughly doubled year over year, most years.

Where do you double? How is Figma structured?

This last year we probably doubled across the org, with perhaps a bit more growth in sales.

In sales?

Yes, in sales and go-to-market in general. We see the customer demand there, and we’re trying to scale to reach it. Most years we have doubled pretty much across the board, though there are little variations here and there.

What does sales look like at Figma? Do you have people cold-calling giant companies and being like, “Have you thought about designing on the web?” Or is it inbound, where you are answering questions and designing licenses? What does the sales process actually look like?

It is mostly inbound and outbound. The go-to-market is very influenced by bottoms-up. I think in general, enterprise companies are not rocket science. You have to find customers somehow. Maybe it’s through marketing, maybe it’s through sales development representatives that are, like you said, cold-calling or cold-emailing, or maybe it’s through your product qualified leads.

A lot of it is product qualified for us. People that are using Figma say, “Okay, wait a second. My needs are evolving. I’m trying to get more of my company on Figma.” They are raising their hands, saying, “How can I do that?” We are trying to help, so we try to make it very consultative, to make it so that people are able to have us as a trusted partner. Then we’re able to work with them to figure out the right way to expand that Figma usage.

Just to be clear, the bottoms-up sale is when people at a company just start using a tool without telling anyone, which is how I do everything. That’s the bottoms-up. You get the users because they are using a good tool, and the company is sort of forced to buy the tool for everybody. The other way around is to sell the product directly to the Chief Information Officer (CIO).

Well, you work with the company.

Right, you work with the company.

Usually there is some combination of people saying, “Hey, this is interesting,” and us trying to get the conversation going early enough so no one feels weird about it. We build that relationship and try to make it so people understand what Figma is. Why could it be valuable? How could it work uniquely with your company? So you work together with a design leader, core product leader, or IT — the champions in the organization who want to see this become the standard — and together you bring it into the organization.

I think Datadog has a really cool history of serving developers. It has some similarities, not entirely one-to-one, but somewhat similar to designers. They have a very heavy motion of expansion. Over time the account grows, and they have managed to figure out how to add more value through new products. How we build new products and new services for our customers is something that we care about too.

As CEO you have a lot of people reporting to you. Where are most of the people reporting from? Is it on the product side? Is it the sales side? Do you just have a lot of accountants?

Engineering product development and sales are probably the biggest areas.

Is that where all the recruiting focus is?

It’s across the board. You want to make sure that people have a great experience coming to Figma regardless. What I tell people is that it’s every manager’s responsibility to recruit. You can’t really depend on dedicated recruiters. Though hopefully, a recruiter will make it a lot easier and will make sure the experience is really good. Then it is HR’s responsibility to make sure once people are in the building, they have a really great experience of being a Figmate — that they are learning and developing, have great career options and good mentorship, and if they need feedback, they’re getting it.

The cumulative sum of all that is that our culture is the best it’s ever been, because we have invested and focused so much on that over the past few years. We’ve had days where our culture was not as good, mostly in the early days. So I have a comparator point there and feel really good about how Figma works. Hearing feedback from newer hires that Figma matches what they were sold has been great to hear. But there are always ways to improve too.

Actually, let me ask you about those early days a little bit. You have been very open in other interviews and talks that you’ve done that you had to learn how to be a leader on the job at Figma. You received some pretty hard feedback along the way. As you mentioned, your only other job before this was as an intern. So here is the Decoder question. You are 10 years on this journey and you just made a gigantic decision to sell this company. How do you make decisions?

Depends on the decision, always. I think if it comes to product engineering, design, and roadmap, there is always a tension in wanting to give people some guidance on how to be top-down in terms of the strategy. Where is the company going in broad strokes? What are the top three things we are doing that everyone needs to know? But it also needs to be empowering. You need to make sure at all times that people across the organization are able to understand, be on the ground, talking with users, and be really deep in the details and technical specifics of what is possible or what is changing locally for their product area.

You want to meet somewhere in the middle of, “Here is the local feedback and the ideas that we have,” and the top-down, “Here is a point of view on strategy and where we should take the company.” Somehow those have to meet, and you need to be able to resolve tensions and work through any conflicts that arise. Education and context-building are areas that can really help with these things.

When it comes to making decisions in general, especially when you don’t have enough data, it’s not like there is one framework that is the magic framework. People talk about regret minimization, where you imagine yourself in the future and ask yourself which path you would regret less. That’s a really good framework, but it turns out it’s not the only one. You can come up with all sorts of frameworks for any decision you are trying to make.

An example is when we were deciding, “Okay, do we sell the company or not?” First of all, I was very lucky to have people around me, like my board, and once we eventually got to a certain point in the process, I was able to be more open to my exec team and talk with them as well. But ultimately, at the end of the day, it is my decision. I own the decision. I tried a multitude of frameworks, and each one led me to say, “This is a good call.” I won’t go into the details of all those frameworks.

What were the top two frameworks?

I won’t go into the details on all of them right now.

I didn’t ask for all them, I asked for two. What were the top two?

But I think what’s interesting is…

No, wait. What were the top two?

“Obviously monetary is a framework, right?”

Well, I mean obviously monetary is a framework, right? But it’s not the only one.

I knew it was the first one.

Impact. Impact is a framework. Will this lead to us having less impact? I think regret minimization is one that you could certainly think about. Anyway, I can list off 10 more, but again, I don’t want to go into the details there. Making sure that we were able to continue building a really important culture was definitely a consideration, so was attracting the type of people that we had been attracting. I think it would’ve been spooky to me if we didn’t think that was the case. I built a lot of conviction that it was. Thinking through all these different frameworks, not only did it highlight where the gaps were in my thinking and what things I had to figure out, it also highlighted important conversations I needed to have with the Adobe team.

The more I went into those conversations and brought up my concerns, the more I gained conviction that this was a really good decision for not just the company, but for our users and our community. It also built our trust and our relationship with the team. There was never a moment where I was like, “Oh, I have this framework that I’m trying,” that led me to a decision of, “We shouldn’t do this.” That was a sign. I think if you do get to a point where you have different frameworks that lead to different answers, you have to find some meta frameworks or a way to sort through all of them, which is maybe a little tougher.

All right. Let me give you a framework where it doesn’t work out so well. It’s shocking to me that you are out doing media in the middle of this acquisition. Here is a framework that the government is going to use: The Federal Trade Commission or European regulators are going to say Adobe is a gigantic corporation with dominant market share amongst designers in the world. Figma represented real and meaningful competition to Adobe, and was taking share away from Adobe in a variety of contexts. Adobe buying Figma reduces competition in the market. I have heard this from people who do not care about antitrust law, “Crap, this thing that was competing with Adobe that I was excited about is going to get swallowed by the board.” I have heard this from regulators who care a lot about competition from the market, and I have heard it from your local podcast hosts who think that tech companies need a lot more competition, especially big tech companies.

That is the framework that I think comes out as a “no,” right? You just listed off a lot of people you obviously care about, who are on your team and in control of the destiny of this company. You are going to cede some of their control over the future of Figma to a very large company with its own needs and aspirations, and might snuff out the thing that makes Figma such a good competitor. Whether or not you think that is the right policy choice, the right financial choice, or whatever, the thing that is exciting about tech is that there is always a disruptive challenger that shows up and knocks these giants off their pedestals. Figma is that thing. Isn’t that the framework that says, “No, you shouldn’t do this. You should see if you can actually knock Adobe off the map?”

I think for the user community, that was a critical component of the decision. That was probably the first audience that I thought of as we were thinking through it. As I thought through that decision and what we could do for the community, it actually led me to becoming more convinced that we should do this versus less so. Part of that is because there are a lot of things we don’t do in Figma today that are needed in the product development process.

If you think about product development, it’s not just pixels on the screen. You have a range of media types you are going to bring into the product development process in today’s world. Think about the Verge redesign for example. It’s not like you just use static imagery; you use video, and in the future you might use 3D content.

But those tools exist. We can pay for those tools too. Why does Figma need to be a part of those tools? It’s not like JPEGs and MP4s are difficult to move around.

I think that there are really good advantages that you can have as someone using a set of tools if the tools actually connect really well in one process. It’s like what we were talking about before. Figma is going from idea to design to production, and we are really trying to make the product development process as good as possible. What else can we do if we are able to bring more mediums into that? I think there are a lot of things that become possible there.

Name a thing. Name a specific thing. Adobe is a vast company. I think most people listening to this do not know that Adobe has a gigantic ads business. Many, many things can plug into whatever Figma is doing. Give me a concrete example of why being owned by Adobe is better than a partnership with Adobe.

Photo editing is a great example of something that I think we could do a much better job of in the product design process. There are a lot of times where you are using Figma plus other tools for photo editing, many of which might be owned by Adobe right now.

Why does the ownership of the tools matter?

It is extremely helpful to be able to go seamlessly into your workflow with a new modality, versus bringing assets and doing a complex import-export process into another tool. At the end of the day, our vision for Figma is to make design accessible to all, to make it so you are able to get things out of your head and onto the canvas faster. How do you do that while making it so that you are able to transition across these modalities quicker?

So you’re saying you’re opening Figma? I am just trying to be very concrete about this. You are opening Figma, you have designed some interface, you have a photo element in it, you click on it, and you get the full set of Photoshop tools right there in front of you, instead of having to open Photoshop and create a file.

I think there is a huge opportunity to bring these capabilities from Adobe Creative Suite and Creative Cloud into Figma and utilize them more, and to make it so that you are able to go and somehow transition across these different creative modalities to have a more seamless way of working.

By the way, we aren’t just talking about product design at the end of the day. I think that there is an opportunity to scale the impact of Figma much more broadly. We can start to make it so that you take the web-based tech, the different methods of collaboration, and the platform we have developed, and apply that to many other creative areas as well.

Finally, there is a huge opportunity to think about how creativity and productivity come together here. Like I mentioned at the start of our conversation, FigJam is not just a tool for designers. Isn’t this being used across the entire organization? It turns out that visual canvases are actually really helpful for tons of people to use. It’s a way for teams to come together, and it’s a way for people to run meetings.

A lot of people are trying to get into the creative productivity game. It’s heating up in competition a lot.

We are in a world where a lot of people are trying to get into the creative productivity game. It’s an area that is heating up in competition a lot. For example, Microsoft Designer just came out.

I mean, I’m rolling my eyes because another thing that just happened is that Adobe announced it was going to be purchasing Figma, and that it was going to sunset Adobe XD, which is the competitor to Figma.

I don’t think they announced that.

You can add and you can subtract from the market, and it is net zero that Microsoft is going to bundle some more stuff into the Office Suite. At the end of the day, Adobe’s competitor to Figma is going to go away because the company is going to own Figma. I hear you, in that there are ways to make things more seamless, but I’m still not clear on why Adobe has to own Figma to make these things happen.

I’m trying to highlight that there are a lot of things we can do here to make the customer experience of using Figma way better as a result of this. It’s really good for our community, really good for our user base, and really good for the designers in the Verge team.

We did our redesign on Figma. It was fun to use.

There is stuff in this structure that is really interesting to me. Everyone has been very clear that Figma will be an independent division inside of Adobe when this is all said and done — not a subsidiary, but a division of Adobe into itself. You’re going to report to an Adobe executive. Who are you going to report to?

David Wadhwani.

What is his role at Adobe?

He’s the chief business officer of Creative Cloud and Digital Media.

This is just a really small question. Did you get to pick? I have never been acquired. Did you look at a sheet with your kitchen cabinet of people and say, “All right, I’m going to report to this person,” or did they tell you?

I mean, look, I have had a great relationship with Scott [Belsky, Adobe’s chief product officer] since the start of Figma.

I think he reports to the same person, right?

Yes. I actually tried to convince Scott to be an investor early on. Turns out he was getting acquired, so I didn’t get him as an investor. We have continued to be friends and build that relationship over the last decade. In this case, it was David who was really bringing Figma in, and so I just assumed that was the structure the entire way.

So there was never a conversation. You never said, “I actually want to report to the CEO of Adobe”?

Nope.

How much do you stand to personally make from this deal?

Depends on the stock price on any given day. Look, that has not been my focus.

You’ve done the math. What’s the low and what’s the high?

I don’t have the spreadsheets in front of me. It becomes very complex.

Are you going to be rich when it’s done? Like private jet rich?

I feel very well-off already. I have nothing to complain about, and I feel super blessed and lucky. I couldn’t be more thankful to be where I am at 30, regardless of this deal.

How much will your employees get?

A lot.

I assure you, every one of your employees who has equity in this company has done the math. Is it significant? Are you going to mint a bunch of millionaires?

I hope that we’re able to make it so the team is able to do whatever they want to do, and to move on if they want to. Hopefully they will stay at Figma a long time, but they can also go make a great impact in whatever community they’re in. I think we have an incredible, super creative group of people at Figma. I’m really excited to see them be even more empowered.

The reason I ask all those questions in that way is because I think you are going to stay at Figma. My feeling is that you are very committed to this thing you started when you were a very young man. But when people get the “fuck you” money, they might leave. They don’t have to stay after the deal closes. You have to retain great talent that is going to enter the Adobe ecosystem, be able to leave, and even just do things inside of Adobe. It has to come into a much larger corporate structure that is going to have all the attendant Byzantine problems that come with it, as well as the resources. I don’t want to say there are no pros to that, but there are some cons.

The reason people join startups like Figma is the promise of this exit payday, which you will not be able to offer folks anymore. Have you thought about that life cycle? “Okay, I’m going to graduate out a bunch of people who are going to get the money — they’re going to get the bag and walk. Then my recruiting pipeline is going to dramatically change because the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow will be gone.”

This is wild, you don’t have to believe me if you don’t want to, but the number of people that started to apply to Figma after we announced this went up tremendously. Which is counterintuitive, because a lot of people have that mental model you just described. That is just the fact. I don’t know exactly what the percentage lift was and how sustained it was. I mean, it probably went down after the acquisition announcement a bit, but we have been getting people that are really excited about doing this at the combined company.

Well, the deal hasn’t closed yet, right? If you get a job at Figma today, you still get Figma equity that might get paid out.

It’s pinned to Adobe equity.

Okay.

If it ends up going through, then it becomes Adobe equity. If not, it’s Figma equity. I think that the chance of going and building this context is something that people are actually really excited about. Just looking at our team, we very deliberately tried to hire people that are super missionary throughout the company’s life.

We haven’t always been the highest-paying company. And you can always find a way to stretch a band and not be fair in your compensation, but we have been very deliberate about making sure that our compensation bands are fair and equitable. Through that, I think we have a lot of people who really believe in what we’re doing, not just people who are trying to make the most money. It turns out that this has become a good outcome and people are going to do really well in aggregate, which I’m super happy about. Our employees are in it because they really love creativity, design, and building things, and they love doing it for other designers and creatives. I think they’re stoked.

I think you probably know this, but Tony Fadell is a friend of the show and a friend of The Verge, and he was on Decoder recently. He has a book out called Build. It’s uplifting in many ways, except for the chapters about the Nest acquisition at Google, of which Tony has nothing but unreserved scorn. Nest was a company that had its own culture. He was building it, Google bought it, they dumped a bunch of money into this company, they turbocharged investment, Google culture seeped into the company, and things went totally sideways. I don’t know how familiar you are with that story, but it is a pretty common story. You do the acquisitions so you can turbocharge growth with other people’s cash.

Oh, there are really positive stories too. GitHub and LinkedIn are some examples. Pixar is a really good example.

Pixar is a different direction. Pixar ate Walt Disney Animation Studios.

Totally.

The culture of Pixar took over Walt Disney. Here’s my question for you. What are the safeguards against the negative outcome? The negative outcome is well-known. The positive outcome is well-known. Do you have a commitment in writing that Figma will be independent? How does that work? What is that conversation like?

There has been a conversation with all levels of Adobe and everyone related to the deal about the autonomy of Figma, our goals, and how we’re going to execute against them. Honestly, the open-mindedness of the Adobe team to think about this in a very unique way was part of what got us comfortable. They were amazing with it. The proof is in the pudding.

Do you have a contract that says Figma will be independent?

We have an operating model doc where we talk about autonomy within Adobe. That is not legally binding, but it is a plan.

Not in those words. We have an operating model doc where we talk about autonomy. That is not legally binding, but it is a plan. It’s important to think together about how we will make this combined company really amazing in the long term. Adobe is really wanting to set this up for success. Not just the management of Adobe, but having just been to Adobe Max last week, it’s the greater Adobe team as well.

I was really heartened by that reaction. Getting to meet them and spend time with them, we felt very welcomed. I’m really excited to spend that time with their team to learn and figure out how we go from here. How do we keep building and do the best thing for the customer and for that vision of making design accessible to all? And not just interface design, but more globally, all types of design, creativity, and productivity. There’s a lot to do there.

I have to ask you about the tweet, then I promise we’re going to move off of this and talk about WebGL. You know what tweet I’m going to ask you about. In January 2021, somebody said, “Give it 15 years and Figma will replace Adobe.” You replied, “The goal is to be Figma and not Adobe.” I have to point out to you that you’re about to become Adobe.

“I still stand by that tweet. I don’t take it back.”

Again, we are operating autonomously. We are going to have our own offices and our own culture. We are definitely going to have a lot of people that are coming from Adobe into Figma. We are going to interview people, so it’s not like an automatic rubber-stamp “yes.” We are also going to be interviewing people from outside of Adobe and Figma to come in. We are going to continue to have our values.

It turns out our values are actually very similar to Adobe. That is one thing I learned through this process. Our mission is very similar to Adobe. Literally, you put the values side by side and it’s like, “Wow.” Turns out, design-oriented creative people are attracted to these companies. Having met people at Adobe Max, a lot of them feel like Figmates already. There is probably a lot I didn’t know about Adobe at that point in terms of how close they felt to us in demographic employee makeup and psychological makeup. At the same time, we definitely want to preserve the best of Figma. I still stand by that tweet. I don’t take it back.

It’s a pretty bad market right now, if you look at the economy. This is not the market for companies to go public in. This is not the market to go raise money in. In all of your decision-making frameworks, did that factor into it? “Hey, it’s going to be really hard to get more money. We’re kicking the ass of our competitor Adobe a little bit. They’re ready to give us a bunch of money to accelerate this.” Was that one of the decisions here?

We were on a path to continue to be independent as well. We’re cash flow positive, and we’re doubling revenue year over year. We were in as good of a state as possible. It was really about the merits of a combined entity, what we could do together, how we could be useful, and how we could make this product better for our audience. That was really the thing that was weighed the most heavily.

Figma is a web product built on WebGL. You mentioned at the top of the show that WebGL’s technology lets you do 3D rendering on the web. The web is kind of under attack. On top of everything else, this primary surface that you distribute your product on, has maybe been perpetually under attack. First Microsoft tried to kill it, now maybe Apple’s trying to kill it, and who knows what Google’s trying to do with it, but it always feels a little unsteady. I know a bunch of designers who use Figma on Chromebooks. They don’t have Macs or Windows PCs, they just have nicer Chromebooks. You can use Figma on Chromebooks. The web is fundamentally Google’s revenue platform. Very few other companies make money on the web writ large. You make money selling seat licenses and enterprise software. You distribute on the web, but you don’t make money on the web. Google is one of the few companies that makes money on the web.

That means the Apples and the Microsofts of the world are constantly trying to push back against this and capture more value on their platforms directly. When I say a perceived threat, specifically what I mean is that Apple continues to encroach on the web on iOS. The Safari browser is a big deal, and there is a standards battle between Apple and Google in particular that gets pretty heated quite often. You need to build on those standards. Do you watch that from afar? Do you just hope that the web persists, grows, and innovates in a way that lets you build new features? Or are you like, “Screw it, we better have some native apps in the background”?

What are examples of the standards battles that you’re referring to?

WebGL itself. It needs to continue innovating, and it needs new standards-level capabilities that leverage new hardware capabilities and different computers over time. Apple in particular probably does not want to open up the entire graphics pipeline of the M Series chip to the web. They want to save that for their own native apps because a lot of designers run Macs. How do you get through that as a company?

Well, it turns out that you can make our software really efficient, even on WebGL, by mapping to low-end chips from phones that were from five years ago. Can we make it even faster with even more access to the hardware and even better standards? Absolutely. At the same time, if you’re efficient about your code and about the way you write your shaders and manage memory, it turns out it’s pretty incredible what you can do.

It’s a story that persists across computing for a long time. Look at what people were doing in the demo scene in the ‘90s. It was amazing. One thing that seems to happen with the way that programs and software evolve over time, is that you start to become less disciplined about the way you build software. There are more abstraction layers that exist over time.

As more abstraction layers exist in the software you’re building, each one incrementally slows down a little bit year over year — especially as they become a sort of black box that’s not actually introspected into and people rely on them in almost faith-based way. “Of course that abstraction level is good. We don’t touch it anymore. The person who worked on it is no longer here. Don’t go there. The code is really messy.” Then of course it degrades a little bit year over year.

At Figma, we try to be very disciplined about how we structure the code base, making sure that we continue to refactor our code year over year, that we clean up our tech debt, and that we take out old systems that are no longer needed. By doing so, we have been able to keep things really fast and efficient.

At the same time, maybe every month or two, something happens. I see some uptick on reports from our support channels or through Twitter, or I’m talking to someone and I realize, “Oh shit. With some chipset or model of computer somewhere, or after some recent update was launched, we introduced some regression. Figma slowed down in some way, and someone is unhappy.” Our team has a really good culture of identifying these issues, diving into them and talking with users, and figuring out what’s going on and fixing it.

We also do a lot of good performance testing to make sure that we are able to continually monitor and understand if we are still on-track or if we are off-track somehow. Did we ship something that’s bad? By having that really high standard from the start and maintaining it over time, that hasn’t been an issue for us. Of course, we are always looking for the web to be better, but I think the fact that we have our render based in WebGL gives us a lot of control over what we actually write to the canvas. That means that we are sort of on this weird, independent path that is a little bit different than having to run every single thing in web standards.

Now, that said, browsers do occasionally ship something where they’re trying to fix something over here or in a different spot, and there is some kind of inefficiency that’s added or an issue that accumulates. We have worked really hard since the start of the company to maintain and build relationships with browsers so that if that happens, we’re seeing in a canary or beta build that there is an issue. We are then able to flag it to a browser vendor way ahead of time, tell them that issue has occurred, show them the reproducible steps, and help them patch the issue. Doing that over time, having those relationships, and hiring people that worked on browsers in the past, who have a deep understanding of the browser stack, has also helped.

Do you think that you need to ship native apps on Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android? I mean there are native apps there, but again, the primary canvas here for you is the web.

There’s definitely an opportunity to do more natively in the future for Figma. For example, there’s pen and touch input. Even if web standards improve a ton, there is probably some better feeling of lower latency if you do more of the handling of those gestures natively than on the web. Then of course, there is always that next thing of, “Well, maybe we could do this thing natively instead of on the web.”

It turns out that “on the web” is good enough most of the time. However, I think we are constantly trying to figure out, “Okay, what’s the next thing that we can start to do natively? What’s the progression of that over time?” I do think that eventually a tablet version of Figma will be really useful.

One thing we’re excited to announce very soon — and I’ll give you a little sneak peek — is our mobile comments that are coming out. Making sure we could add that in a performant way was really important to us. If you think about it, there is a lot that we can do with comments on mobile that is unique to the mobile form factor over time. We’re super stoked about that.

We also have a bunch we’re doing with FigJam on tablets, and we’re adding more functionality. For example, we’re making it so you can play music while you’re in FigJam now. We’re making it so that you can do better integrations with Teams, GoMeet, and Zoom, as well as add sections, tables, and better text formatting. People have asked for these things for a long time. We are able to add this stuff even though we’re not having a ton of native surface area with FigJam, but we are trying to improve that native surface area over time.

It’s hard to go get this stat, but my instinct is that Figma is one of the biggest and most lucrative WebGL clients out there. There aren’t a lot of others, so it seems like a safe bet. Figma is a big and lucrative company. The product is excellent, a lot of people use it, and there’s just not a lot else. You are built on this thing that you depend on, maybe in a way that the other users of WebGL don’t depend on — they’re mostly games, from what I can tell.

I think there’s going to be a lot more people that use WebGL over time. I’m excited to see so many people betting on the browser as a platform. I get emails every day of people that are building Figma for X (you fill in the blank). People are doing it and they’re betting on the web.

If that was the only thing that we looked back on in 10 years and we said, “Wow, because of Figma existing there are more people on the web,” that would be something that would make me feel really proud. I think and hope there will be a lot more too. It’s really cool to see so many people betting on the web now, whereas before it was something that people just didn’t believe in.

I mean, I’m a huge proponent of the web. I think more people should bet on the web every day. That comes and goes in waves. Five years ago, if you weren’t shipping a native phone app, you were basically not in the conversation to get funding. Why do you think the web is back in vogue?

I think that the power of the URL is one where you’re able to easily share content. I can pass content from me to you so easily with a URL. Having that URL as this global address that people can find information off of forces choices for a medium.

So for example, if you don’t have multiplayer editing on the web, it just feels wrong. That doesn’t mean you have to be on the web to have multiplayer editing. You can do it natively too. But they go together really well. It also goes together really well when you have a URL on top and can share it with people. There’s this cluster of features and functionality I think that starts to merge, where it just feels better to be able to navigate from links that you’re encountering on email or Slack onto a website, where you’re able to have this rich content experience and then in the browser, work.

The web really captures the ethos of my generation... transparency, access, and collaboration.

It really captures the ethos of my generation at least. I can’t speak for my generation…

Be the voice of a generation, Dylan, you can do it. You have the name for it. Do it.

Some of the things that I feel are really important, and I think a lot of my peers feel are important, are transparency, access, collaboration, and working together. I think the web really embodies that ethos. A lot of desktop software didn’t traditionally embody that ethos, it was more siloed. It’s not like there is one thing that makes the web so powerful, but being able to have that cluster of functionality of values ends up really having an amazing effect.

Do you make strategic decisions at Figma around the market shares of different browser engines on desktop? Chromium is really dominant. Microsoft was forced to effectively concede and move Edge to Chromium on mobile Safari. If you don’t address mobile Safari, you don’t get a whole bunch of people, because there are no other browser engines on the iPhone. Is that something that you have to think about as you make technical and business decisions?

Not really. If that conversation is happening, it’s not rising to me. Like I said before, when there are issues, we have to pay attention to them. We have to be in communication with browser vendors. It’s probably the case that there are small bugs or issues that exist, and depending on market share, that impacts the priority at which we attack those and push browser renders to try to fix those things. That’s probably the extent of it.

Does anything on that level come up to you? Do you ever get a phone call that’s like, “I need you to call Sundar Pichai and get him to fix Chrome”? Does that happen to you?

I’m laughing at the Sundar thing, because I literally have an email thread from a long time ago — I forget exactly what it was about at the time, but this was like 2015 — where I was trying to get some issue fixed with Chrome, and I got an intro to Sundar who was not yet CEO of Google. It went all the way to Sundar, then it went through this chain of product managers, and eventually it ended up with my friend, who already knew about it because I hung out with her all the time. She was like, “Oh, hi Dylan.” I felt like a total fool for escalating that one.

How often do you escalate things? Does it happen, or is that mostly on the technical side of the company?

It hasn’t happened much recently, because we now have such good relationships with browsers and they have been so helpful. In the earlier days, we just didn’t have the attention of these teams, partially because we weren’t at scale yet. If you have more people that are being impacted by an issue, that impacts the time in which that issue is dealt with, which makes sense, right?

Yeah. You mentioned bottoms-up. The reason I’m asking is because I wonder, does it get easier when half the company is using your tool and they are running into problems?

Totally. Oh, absolutely yes.

I have to imagine that that is the case at Microsoft, Google, Apple, and all the rest.

For sure. When Google adopted Figma, I feel like they definitely cared a lot more about Figma running well, which also makes sense.

I just spotted my review unit of the Meta Quest Pro, it’s just sitting right over there, so I need to ask you about VR. Meta thinks that we’re all going to be hanging out in the metaverse, winking at each other and connecting emotionally because we can see each other’s faces. They have a little bit of a whiteboarding tool. It’s very early. Is that something that you see being competitive with you? Is that something that you want to participate in? Is that just a distraction?

I think it would be great participating in that one day. Right now, we are still early in terms of how many people are using VR, but it seems like an exponential graph, which is really exciting as a new platform. But we’re at the early stages, so I think we’ll probably spend more calories thinking about that when that exponential curve goes up more.

You’ll believe it when you see it is basically what you just said.

No, no. I mean, I like VR. I was on paternity leave early this year, and I spent a lot of time in VR. It’s really good. I’m excited to try the new Quest 2, by the way. I think as a gaming platform, it’s excellent; I think as a productivity platform, it’s emerging. There is still stuff that has to be solved around how much time you can spend in VR without getting a headache, motion sickness, or fatigue. I personally don’t get motion sickness or a headache, but I know people that do. I still feel some fatigue after half an hour to an hour in VR.

Now I haven’t tried the new headsets yet, so it’s possible that it has been fixed already. When I tried VR in 2016 or 2015, it was for like five minutes. After that I felt like I had a crazy night out drinking. Now it’s such an improved experience, and I feel like it is going to keep improving, just like there are going to be more people adopting it. It might be exponential. As it gets to that point where you can spend a few hours in VR and take the headset off and say, “I feel fine,” I think the possibilities unlock a lot more. I’m actually quite bullish on VR, and I’m really impressed with Meta’s dedication to the platform. I think it’s quite visionary and bold. It’s a great example of someone trying to will a new technology into existence.

How many engineers are you paying to build VR Figma right now?

Zero.

Right. I love my Quest 2. I use it every day, but I use it as a fitness platform to work out. If I try to use it for collaboration, I would tell you that being on a Zoom meeting with FigJam open on a tablet, just so I can draw at people, is immediately more evocative to me than all of us being cartoons in the metaverse. I’m just wondering where you are calibrated on that spectrum.

When you take these paradigms and you try to retrofit them into a new space, it’s not always right. It’s a good starting point, but I think that the real opportunity is probably that task of having a meeting, of brainstorming, of ideating, of trying to collaborate in a space. Those are the things people are trying to do in FigJam. What does it mean to do that in VR? I think that’s a much more interesting question than, “How do you take this 2D primitive and put it on a plane in a 3D space in VR?” When we get to the point where we see the traction of the platform and, like I said, the ergonomics are a little better, I think it’s going to be really exciting to explore this.

By the way, we are just now building tablet for FigJam and for Figma, and tablets have been around for a long time. It’s not like this is a new thing. It takes a lot to remove people from the surface that they’re already used to and put them on a new one. You have to demonstrate some benefit. That said, as a product person and as someone who cares for design, I love the challenge of being able to work in a new medium, and to think about the ways to solve that product challenge in that new medium. That’s really exciting.

By the way, a lot of what you’re saying around VR, “Oh yeah, I use it for fitness.” I’m like, “I use it for gaming.” It reminds me of crypto in some ways.

Oh God. This is another hour. You have another hour for this metaphor?

I have time. Do you have time?

Let’s do it.

With crypto, for a long time it was like, “Yeah, people are just gambling on this thing. What’s it good for?” It was like, “Well, maybe there’s a store of value.” Then it was, “Well, maybe there’s this DeFi thing.” Now it’s like, “How about NFTs?” Perhaps next there’s gaming.

I’m not saying that the crypto industry is without sin. There are a lot of things that are pretty fucked up in crypto. But I’m also saying that what you see when you have a new technology or platform emerge is that people discover the use cases of it one by one. At first it seems like it’s nascent, that it’s actually worthless, et cetera. Then over time you realize, “Holy crap, there is a lot going on here, and there’s so much that we can do on this new platform,” like machine learning.

I remember when we were starting Figma, and Chris Olah was in my Thiel Fellowship class. He later went on to work on Google Brain, and was responsible for all sorts of interesting research into how neural nets actually work. Then he was at OpenAI, and now Anthropic. He was showing me these very hacked-together demos in his terminal, where he was shoving into AWS, running on GPUs, very basic neural nets. He’s like, “This is amazing.” I was like, “Yeah, it’s cool. You can classify some numbers. I’ve seen the same demo before.”

What I was missing was the exponential curve of that technology, and the fact that it was actually a paradigm shift from more structured machine learning models and people trying to use hardcore math to make AI into this new representation and new way to actually solve problems. Then you get something like transformers on top of that, and suddenly so many more applications become possible. We are at this phase now, and not just with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models, where people are actually taking some real, interesting tech and applying it to entirely new industries and new areas. The use cases are proliferating.

Let me push back on this just a little bit, because this is fascinating. AI, machine learning, and now generative image models are all a very cool party trick, right? I know some newsletter authors who are like, “I’m going to illustrate my newsletter with DALL-E.” That’s cool, it’s very neat. There’s some stuff that might get built on top of it, and there are some machine learning applications that are indeed very useful to large industries all over the place. They are capabilities that were layered into things people are already doing, or capabilities that were layered in to make something cheaper. Image generation is actually just going to make something much, much cheaper for people.

In VR and crypto, they are applications in search of a market. I don’t think DeFi is an actual application yet. It’s a conceptual market that might exist if crypto works the way we want it to. I mean, I have the VR headset; I use it for games and fitness. It’s searching for its big consumer application, and they keep firing things at the wall. I think that’s a real difference. I could come to you and say, “Okay, in five years I’m going to type ‘music player app’ into Figma, and Figma is going to call up DALL-E and fire out a sketch of a music player app that I can then further manipulate.” I can see that sitting from here, whereas I couldn’t tell you what NFT capability you should add to Figma today.

First of all, it’s pretty amazing. A year or two ago, I think, if we were having the same conversation about AI/ML, you could very easily have said, “Hey, this is research in search of a problem. This is just a bunch of people who are doing cool math, and it’s not clear that there’s actually something here yet. What are these models actually good for? You got GPT-3 sure, but what recent advancements have we seen? In GPT-3, large language models have kind of been tapped out. What are people building on it?”

It turns out, even on GPT-3, let alone the new improvements we’re seeing to large language models, we’re actually seeing incredible things being built on those now, and they’re impacting a lot of different industries. The timing of the question ends up mattering.

There is something to having scarce digital goods. Do I think it was overhyped and there’s a bubble? Absolutely, I do. I think that’s the curve that most technology is on. In fact, I think that we’re probably going to see an even bigger bubble around a lot of things that are called AI as a collection of things. If I’m seeing the VC investment patterns that are going on, AI feels a lot like crypto right now.

Fair enough.

From before the crash, just to be clear. Every technology has a hype cycle, and with VR, at the end of the day it’s like, “Okay, what are the behaviors that are new that you’re doing?” Did you increase your fitness spend when you got an Oculus Quest?

Yeah, I really did. It’s a real thing that happened. You should listen our episode with Chris Milk from Supernatural. We talked about the whole thing.

I will. I’m sorry I missed it.

It’s the thing that drives VR adoption. It’s a completely under-reported phenomenon that the thing that drives VR adoption is fitness. I think it’s fascinating. Here is this thing that’s supposed to disembody you into the internet, and it makes people consider their bodies in a much different way. It’s great. I totally buy it.

It is fascinating. It’s also interesting that the GDP has gone up too. There has actually been a net value creation there. Crypto is interesting because it’s a little bit different when it comes to value. There are a lot of things in the crypto ecosystem that I wouldn’t call Ponzi, but they have these Ponzi characteristics. The more money that flows in the system, the more the asset price goes up; the more money comes out of the system, the more the asset price goes down. It’s wrong to say that collectibles markets or art markets don’t have value. At the same time, there’s something about that characteristic that people realize feels a little weird. Then AI could be very deflationary, by the way.

How so?

“All technology is deflationary, but depending on how much more efficient AI makes things, it could cut into the time that people are being paid for.”

Well, all technology is deflationary, but depending on how much more efficient AI makes things, it could cut into the time that people are being paid for.

I see what you mean. So let me ask you this directly. I mean, this is your business, right? You make people more productive and you make designers more collaborative. Do you foresee a world in which Figma has generative tools in it, so that I really can type in “new Verge website” and Figma pops out a mock for me to then iterate on?

I think that there are a lot of ways to do that. What I’m excited about is how you make it so designers are able to explore more of an option space, and then bring in their expertise as well. It’s like getting inspiration from a model, just like they get inspiration from looking at other designer’s work on Dribbble, Behance, or in Figma’s community. A generative model is your operating lead in the space. It’s kind of the same thing in some ways. People may not like me saying that, but I think inspiration can be drawn from lots of places. How do you work with an AI agent versus an AI agent replacing a designer? I think across all creative work, that is going to be a really important thing to figure out.

Let’s just take the bear case, which is that the tech we have today is the tech we get. There’s no evolution. Never mind that every day on Twitter I’m seeing two new papers that are mind-blowing. Let’s just say that stops tomorrow. So the bear case is what we have now in AI. If we can take that and just apply it to new areas of the economy, that is already going to be very disruptive. We would continue to see the base case for some time, then it asymptotes. At some point, we don’t see much more around AI for a while. The capabilities kind of max out across a few domains. Again, it’s even more disruptive. In a bull case where there’s AGI [artificial general intelligence], I don’t even know how to think about that. I think that the world could get really weird, really fast.

Then we’re all out of work. That’s the most deflationary.

No, work might just change in a very fundamental way.

If there’s AGI? Yeah, we’ll all be working for the robot.

I made a tweet recently. I’ll read it to you.

Oh my God.

I did a poll. I said, “AGI has arrived. Everyone is saying it’s way smarter than humans and well-known experts claim it’s ‘human aligned.’ Recently political leaders asked the AGI to propose an ‘optimal system of government,’ (and resulting constitutional amendments). Would you consider the proposal?” The options were yes, yes if still democracy, no, and see results; 21.5 percent said see results. The remainder: 35.3 percent said yes, 25.5 percent said yes if still democracy, and 17.7 percent said no.

I thought that was really interesting. First of all, I was surprised that so many people were open to nondemocratic systems of government, which is not something I would have expected going into that question. Also, I thought the no answers would be higher, because if you think about it for a second, if AGI existed, it would be able to basically market to you whatever idea it had in a way that would presumably sway your opinion. The fact that less than 20% of people said no, it’s like, okay, people are open to the idea of an AGI-proposed utopia.

Now how do you know if it’s actually human aligned? There are a lot of alignment issues that come up with that too, that I think are just not even on people’s radar yet. Again, AGI is too complex. I don’t know. It breaks my brain a little bit.

Yeah. I think you and I are going to be lucky enough to not have to experience it. I worry about our kids. All right, we have to get out of here. I can’t believe we got all the way to AGI in this interview. Dylan, you’ve given us so much time. I really appreciate it. I think I know what’s next for Figma, but what should people be on the lookout for?

So much. There’s going to be a ton that we do around Figma Design over the next year, and I’m excited for people to see that. We’re just at the start for design systems, and FigJam is in collaboration with that. Like I said, we are launching a bunch around collaboration today. There will be new areas where you’re able to add nouns to the FigJam canvas, like tables, music, voting integrations, mobile comments, and notifications. There’s so much more coming for FigJam. We’re trying to make it so that you’re able to have A-sync/B-sync, and make it so that your means are able to run better, whether you’re in the file at the same time or not. There will be lots more over the next year about that.

Going back to the start of the conversation, how do you navigate that process and product development, from idea to design and production, and make it a really great process? To do that handoff, whether it’s a design system or your design file, with engineering more effectively and make it a great experience for developers in Figma, that is another area that we really care about.

All right. This was great, man. Thank you for getting into it. I loved it. You have to come back soon. We’ve never had anybody in the middle of an acquisition, so now we have to follow up after and see how it went. So come back soon, Dylan. It was great talking to you.

I look forward to it. It was great to see you, and thanks for having me.",Why Figma is selling to Adobe for $20 billion,https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23445821/figma-adobe-acquisition-design-vr-ai-meta

",Artificial Intelligence as a Service Market is Projected to Reach US$ 59.11 Billion in 2028,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-market-projected-reach-084700768.html
100,"Tech hub that uses AI to keep an eye on the spectators, predict crowd swells and control stadium temperature.",cybersecurity,13/11/2022,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SOR00129.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,al jazeera english,"Qatar has set up a tech hub that uses AI to keep an eye on the spectators, predict crowd swells and control stadium temperature.

Doha, Qatar – There’s a room in Qatar’s capital Doha with hundreds of screens that show the crowd attending the World Cup 2022 matches.

With more than 1.2 million fans expected in the country for the World Cup, Qatar has set up a tech hub that uses artificial intelligence to keep an eye on the spectators, predict crowd swells and even control stadium temperature.

More than 100 technicians will be working around the clock at the Aspire Command and Control Center, closely monitoring images flashing across their screens via 200,000 integrated units, from 22,000 security cameras spread across all eight World Cup stadiums.

It is from here that they can operate entry gates, ensure there is running water and keep the air conditioners humming smoothly.

Facial recognition technology will enable the crew to zoom in on each of the 80,000 seats at Lusail Stadium, which is set to host 10 matches, including the final.

Experts from cybersecurity to anti-terrorism to transport will be stationed at the centre, along with Qatari and FIFA officials.

Security cameras in all areas of the stadiums will make sure that mission control can check how each venue is operating before, during and after the event.

“With one click you can shift from one stadium to [another] stadium, because we have everything integrated through our centralised platform, in terms of facility management, security, health and safety, and ICT [information and communications technology] operations,” said Hamad Ahmed al-Mohannadi, the centre’s director.

This is the future of how sports will be covered, say the technicians, some of who have worked behind the scenes since the 2006 Asian Games, which Qatar hosted. They just have many more gadgets at their disposal, now.

Organisers say that the “connected stadium” concept is the first of its kind to be used during a World Cup. AI will enable technicians to predict crowd surges and quickly deal with overcrowding by sharing information with security officials.

The aim is to avoid incidents such as the chaos that erupted in May outside the Stade de France in Paris, when police used tear gas and pepper spray on fans trying to get into the Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid.

In October, more than 130 people were killed in a crowd crush at a football stadium in Indonesia after police fired tear gas at fans who streamed on to the pitch, followed by people running into locked exits while trying to exit the stadium.

The Qatar centre’s technical team says that data aggregation allows them to forecast crowd patterns. Since they know the exact number of people expected based on ticket sales, they can predict crowd surge. That could be based on time of arrival, points of entry or even the movement of people at any given time.

“We have the crowd control team and security staff on the ground, and we have the law enforcement agencies and we are complementing their decision-making with data. So that’s very unique,” Niyas Abdulrahiman, the centre’s chief technology officer, told Al Jazeera.

With the help of AI, the centre can count the number of people within a space and apply a threshold. If there are more than 100 people in a particular area, for example, the technicians can see bottlenecks, check how the entry gates are performing and ensure a smooth flow of people in and out of the stadium, Abdulrahiman explained.

All the stadiums are air-conditioned. If there is a temperature variance inside the venues, sensors from the command centre can pick up the data and prompt an adjustment.

“Through this command centre, our centralised platform gives us an opportunity to have a quick response, more performance in operations with less people,” Al Mohannadi told Al Jazeera.

The director is undeterred by cybersecurity threats. He said the systems are designed to withstand vulnerabilities.

“Obviously, all of this depends on foolproof cybersecurity that all of your systems should be able to withstand any threats from outside or within. We are making sure that systems are secure. And we are doing it as a routine now to make sure that during the FIFA World Cup any major cybersecurity incident will not happen.”","AI at World Cup 2022 to check crowds, control climate",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/13/eye-in-the-sky-ai-at-world-cup-to-check-crowds-control-climate

The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, confirmed the government was examining whether new laws were needed to stop ransom payments in the wake of the Medibank and Optus data breaches.

O’Neil said while short-term successes were needed in cybersecurity reform after the mass hacks, and other long-term outcomes were being considered, including banning ransom payments.

It follows the government launching a hi-tech policing operation targeting the network of hackers behind the Medibank attack, which stole the medical histories and private information of customers.

“The way we’re thinking about the reform task … is a bunch of quick wins, things that we can do fast, and the standing up for the new police operation is one of those,” O’Neil told the ABC on Sunday.

“There’s some really big policy questions that we’re going to need to think about and consult on, and we’re going to do that in the context of the cybersecurity strategy.

“We’ll have a look at [making ransom payments illegal].”

O’Neil said Medibank was right not to pay the ransom demanded by the hackers, with those behind the breach threatening to release more data if the amount was not paid.

Federal police said on Friday Russian criminals were behind the attack on Australia’s largest private health insurer.

A 100 officer-strong, standing cybercrime operation targeting hackers will be led by Australian federal police and the Australian Signals Directorate.

“This is Australia standing up and punching back,” O’Neil said.

“We are not going to sit back while our citizens are treated this way and allow there to be no consequences for that.

“We are offensively going to find these people, hunt them down and debilitate them before they can attack our country.”

The minister said the response to cyber-attacks needed to be improved, due to their number.

She said institutions such as NAB received 50m attacks a month, while the tax office was subject to 3m a month.

“I don’t think anyone can promise cyber-attacks are going to go away and one of the things people need to understand is really how relentless this is,” she said.

“We have got to adapt our whole approach and our whole thinking about this new crime type.”

Almost 500,000 health claims were stolen along with personal information, as part of the Medibank breach.

The insurer has created a one-stop shop of mental health and other support services affected customers can access via its website.

O’Neil said companies needed to ensure better security of data.

“What this is for us is a national vulnerability and what we need to make sure is that companies are only holding data for the point of time where it’s actually useful and the data is otherwise disposed of,” she said.",Government considers making cyber ransom payments illegal after Medibank hack,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/13/government-considers-making-cyber-ransom-payments-after-medibank-hack

When the Australian health insurer Medibank Private Ltd was hit with a ransomware attack last month, it provided regular updates to its customers, including the revelation that personal information from nearly 10 million of them was exposed. It also followed the government’s guidance on how to respond to the extortion demand.

Medibank didn’t pay the ransom. But that plan hasn’t worked out so well.

Following through on a threat, the hackers began publishing the most private medical details of some of Medibank’s customers, including terminated pregnancies, treatment for drug and alcohol addiction and heart attacks, according to a cybersecurity analyst, victims who have spoken publicly about the incident and local media reports.

About 1,000 patients have already had deeply personal data revealed on dark web forums, according to Medibank, and the hackers, who Australian authorities believe are Russian, have warned that more is coming.

“Unfortunately we expect the criminal to continue to release stolen customer data each day,” said David Koczkar, Medibank’s chief executive officer.

Medibank’s experience represents a nightmare scenario for companies and organisations attacked by ransomware, a type of cyberattack in which a victim’s data is encrypted until a payment is made to unlock it. Many ransomware gangs now steal data too and threaten to release the information unless payment is made. Despite guidance from government agencies, including the FBI, not to pay ransom demands, many victims end up doing so, including Colonial Pipeline Co, after a ransomware attack last year forced it to shut down a pipeline that provides fuel to the US East Coast.

Koczkar said in a statement that the company had been warned there was only a limited chance the data would be returned and not published even if they paid. The hackers sought $1 for every patient, or about $10 million, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

“In fact, paying could have the opposite effect and encourage the criminal to directly extort our customers, and there is a strong chance that paying puts more people in harm’s way by making Australia a bigger target,” Koczkar said.

Emily Ritchie, a Medibank spokesperson, said the company wasn’t doing interviews “because the criminal is watching our every move, and we are trying to be really careful to not fuel the criminal”.

There have been other instances where hackers have released personal data, though it is unusual for such personal medical information to be exposed. In one episode disclosed in 2020, hackers breached a privately run psychotherapy centre in Finland called Psykoterapiakeskus Vastaamo Oy and stole patient information, including session notes. The hackers extorted the centre and individual patients for money, and distributed some data online.

The online leaks from the Medibank hack have so far revealed scores of phone numbers, addresses, dates of birth, billing codes, ID numbers and full names of the people who’d been impacted, according to some documentation viewed by Bloomberg News and reported in Australian media. Databases labelled “abortions,” “good list,” “students” and “naughty list” were among those found on the dark web, according to screen shots shared with Bloomberg. Another labelled “boozy” included patients who have sought help for alcohol dependency, according to CNN.

“When you consider both the sensitivity of the information and the massive number of individuals, this is one of the worst --if not the worst -- breaches to ever have happened,” said Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.

Meridith Griffanti, co-head of cybersecurity and data privacy communications at FTI Consulting, said her firm counsels hacking victims to not talk publicly about their decision on whether to pay a ransom. The hacking groups are tuned into the public responses of victims and media coverage, and if they feel like they aren’t getting what they want, “they’re going to do everything they can to make the ‘naming and shaming’ and/or extortion process as painful as possible,” she said.

“To put it bluntly, don’t antagonise the bad guys,” Griffanti said.

In Australia, meanwhile, people fretted about what information about them might be posted on the dark web and expressed disgust at the data that was already exposed.

David Shoebridge, a state senator for the environmental Greens Party said on Wednesday that “like millions of Australians, I’ve been left in the dark as to precisely what data of mine and my family has been obtained by the hackers.”

“This has moved from a theoretical problem to a very personal problem,” he told Bloomberg. “Obviously you’re anxious about it and you have a sense of betrayal both by Medibank, and also by the Australian government in not ensuring that there are adequate protections in the first place.”

Kat, a woman in her mid-30s who works in human resources, posted on social media that she was among those whose data had been compromised.

Her health information isn’t “something I’m necessarily embarrassed about”, she told Bloomberg by phone. But she added, “I read that there’s an abortion list and people being good and bad. That’s completely horrific, something that might not have been discussed with family or even your partner but is now freely available is incredibly concerning.” She requested anonymity to discuss personal information.

Before the data was leaked, Medibank had told local media that it didn’t have cyber insurance, which sometimes covers the cost of ransom payments. It’s the policy of the Australian government that ransomware victims not pay, said Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil.

“The cyber thugs responsible for the Medibank cyber incident have weaponised medical information - particularly women’s - relating to some deeply personal, private matters,” she posted on Twitter on Friday. “It’s sickening and morally reprehensible.”

On Sunday, O’Neil said it was “pretty clear that Medibank was right not to pay the ransom,” because of the hackers’ subsequent release of the material. “The idea that we will trust these people to delete data that they have taken off and may have copied a million times is frankly silly,” she said in an interview on an ABC News programme.

On Friday, the Australian Federal Police attributed the attack to a “group of loosely affiliated cyber criminals who are likely responsible for past significant breaches in countries across the world”.

“We believe those responsible are in Russia,” AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw said in a televised statement, adding that they would be holding talks with Russian law enforcement about the attacks. “We know who you are.”

The Medibank hack was one of several major cybersecurity incidents Australian companies had reported in recent weeks. In late September, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd’s Optus unit disclosed a vast leak of data on past and present customers. A ransom was demanded in that case as well, but it was later retracted by the alleged hacker.

Melbourne-based Australian Clinical Labs Ltd reported in October that data on almost 250,000 patients and staff had been accessed in February. Health records and credit card details were among the information that was compromised, it said.","Abortions, drug use exposed in cyberattack on Australian health insurer",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2436740/abortions-drug-use-exposed-in-cyberattack-on-australian-health-insurer

Twitter's chief information security officer and chief privacy officer quit Friday. They were joined by others who worked on cybersecurity and related teams. The resignations add to a growing sense of chaos around the service, which Elon Musk bought last month for $44 billion. The fear that Twitter had become a more dangerous place for scams and the theft of personal information.



Twitter CEO Elon Musk laid off about half of Twitter’s workforce, citing financial constraints. “They’re just wounded right now,” said Austin Berglas, a former FBI cybersecurity official in New York. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the security situation at the company.



“Maybe Twitter doesn’t go down before every account has been pwned by a crypto scam,” he said, using a euphemism for being hacked. But he said the scams were a more immediate problem. “I’m not worried about my account being hacked,’ he said.



Scammers are using Twitter to trick people into handing over their savings, experts say. One scam involves sending bulk direct messages to people on the social media platform. Another involves tricking people into thinking they're investing in cryptocurrency. The scam is part of a growing trend of fraud on social media platforms.



Twitter paused the rollout of its Twitter Blue verification service. The service was intended to let users pay $8 a month for a verification badge. Many users who signed up promptly changed their usernames and profile pictures to impersonate famous people and brands, leading to confusion on the site and Twitter to suspend the service.",Is it safe to use Twitter?

Read full story",cybersecurity,13/11/2022,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/11/12/1815865.jpeg,the star online,"SAN DIEGO: MedCrypt, a San Diego company that provides cybersecurity technology for medical devices, snagged US$25 million in a second round of venture funding despite today’s tough environment for young firms seeking to raise capital.

Founded in 2016, MedCrypt says that this latest round included participation from new strategic backers Johnson & Johnson Innovation and Intuitive Ventures – the independent investment arm of robot-assisted surgery giant Intuitive Surgical.

MedCrypt, which employs 28 workers, also got backing from existing investors Section 32, Eniac Ventures, Anzu Partners, and Dolby Family Ventures.

The company will use these funds to expand its cryptography, behaviour monitoring and vulnerability inventory products across myriad medical devices ranging from insulin pumps and glucose monitors to hospital-based patient monitoring and surgical gear.

The funds will also be used to expand MedCrypt's engineering staff in anticipation of increased demand for medical device cybersecurity.

In April, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) came out with draft cybersecurity guidelines for medical devices. MedCrypt believes these proposed rules will shine a spotlight on the need for enhanced protection against cyber threats.

""If you are a medical device manufacturer, regulators around the world – most notably the FDA – want to make sure you are very confident and have tested the fact that your device will behave as intended in every circumstance,"" said Mike Kijewski, chief executive of MedCrypt. ""What cybersecurity concerns do is introduce the possibility for devices to do things they were not designed to do.""

There are an estimated 10 to 15 million medical devices in US hospitals today – about 25% of which are connected to the onternet, according to MedCrypt. That number is expected to grow to 40% in a few years, especially as more medical devices are adopted in home-care settings.

""We're past the point of debating the need for improved health care cybersecurity, and it's exciting to see the industry putting more time and attention into addressing this issue,"" said Kijewski.

Competitors include cybersecurity firms that sell into the overall Internet of Things market, including health care. In addition, some medical device makers develop cybersecurity tools in-house.

But Kijewski, who co-founded the company with Chief Technology Officer Eric Pancoast, thinks cybersecurity tailored specifically for medical devices will make MedCrypt stand out. Its customers include seven of the top 10 medical device manufacturers by market capitalization, he said.

The company also counts startups and midsized companies as customers. The latest funding round brings the total raised by MedCrypt to US$34.4 million.

""With the acceleration of complex medical device ecosystems in hospitals and homes across the United States, and growing expectations of patients, providers, and device manufacturers to meet higher standards for security protection, proactive and focused cybersecurity solutions are urgently needed,"" said Oliver Keown, managing director of Intuitive Ventures, in a statement.

""MedCrypt's 'secure by design' product infrastructure will be a critical enabler – and potential standard-setter – for the health care industry."" – The San Diego Union-Tribune/dpa",Is your glucose monitor at risk of cyberattack?

Airofit Pro

Medical tech company, Xplore Health Technologies earlier in the week launched Airofit Pro, touted to be the world's respiratory muscle training (RMT) gadget in India.

The device is capable of training both inspiratory and expiratory muscles. The device basically works by subjecting the diaphragm and other breathing muscles to resistance training, an exercise involving resistance wheels providing adjustable but restricted airflow to the individual. Since the resistance causes fatigue in breathing muscles, it gets compensated by muscle tissue growth thereby making respiratory muscles more robust allowing longer and deeper breathing, the company noted.

Based on age, gender, size and other parameters, the company will offer 17 unique breathing sessions. The device also supports real-time live guidance platform that guides a person through all exercises and sessions while tracking his progress derived from real-time data.

Besides RMT, the device also addresses other related aspects of breathing such as Respiratory strength, Vital capacity, Anaerobic threshold, and relaxation. It costs Rs 34,990.

On Thursday, amid an exodus of senior executives responsible for data privacy, cybersecurity and complying with regulations, he warned the company's remaining employees that might not survive if it can't find a way to bring in at least half its revenue from subscriptions.

While it's not clear if the drama is causing many users to leave - in fact, having a front-row seat to the chaos may prove entertaining to some - lesser-known sites Mastodon and even Tumblr are emerging as new (or renewed) alternatives. Here's a look at some of them.

(Oh, and if you are leaving and want to preserve your tweet history, you can download it by going to your profile settings and clicking on your account then download an archive of your data."")



MASTODON



Sharing a name with an extinct mammal resembling an elephant, Mastodon has emerged as a frontrunner among those curious about life beyond the blue bird. It shares some similarities with Twitter, but there are some big differences - and not just that its version of tweets are officially called toots.

Mastodon is a decentralized social network. That means it's not owned by a single company or billionaire. Rather, it's made up of a network of servers, each run independently but able to connect so people on different servers can communicate. There are no ads as Mastodon is funded by donations, grants and other means.

Mastodon's feed is chronological, unlike Facebook, Instagram, TikTok or Twitter, which all use algorithms to get people to spend as much time on a site as possible.

It can be a tad daunting to try to sign up to Mastodon. Because each server is run separately, you will need to first pick one you want to join, then go through the steps to create an account and agree with the server's rules. There are general and interest- and location-based ones, but in the end it won't really matter. Once you're in, the feed is reminiscent of Twitter. You can write (up to 500 characters), post photos or videos, and follow accounts as well as see a general public feed.

We present a vision of social media that cannot be bought and owned by any billionaire, and strive to create a more resilient global platform without profit incentives, Mastodon's website says.

Currently, the site has more than 1 million users, nearly half of whom signed up after Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, according to founder Eugen Rochko.

Another option, Counter Social, also runs an ad-free, chronological social platform that's funded by users. To prevent foreign influence operations, Counter Social says it blocks access to Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan and Syria. It boasts of offering one-click translation into over 80 languages. It has over 63 million monthly users, according to its website.

CLUBHOUSE



Remember Clubhouse, back when we were all under lockdown and couldn't talk in person? It's the buzzy audio-only app that got somewhat overshadowed by copycat Twitter Spaces, which also lets people talk to each other (think conference call, podcast or audio chat) about topics of interest.

Once you join, lets you start or listen into conversations on a host of topics, from tech to pro sports, parenting, Black literature and so on. There are no posts, photos or videos - only people's profile pictures and their voices. Conversations can be intimate, like a phone call, or might include thousands of people listening to a talk by boldface names, like a conference or stage interview.

SUBSTACK and MEDIUM



For longer reads, newsletters, and general information absorption, these sites are perhaps closest to the blog era of the early 2000s. You can read both without signing up or paying, but some writers, creators and podcasters create premium content for paying subscribers.

TUMBLR



Tumblr, which was all but left for dead, appears to be enjoying somewhat of a resurgence. The words/photos/art/video site is known for its devoted fan base and has been home to angry posts from celebrities like Taylor Swift. It angered many users in 2018 when it banned porn and adult content, which made up a big part of its highly visual and meme-friendly online presence and led to a large drop in its user base.

Onboarding is simple, and for those who miss the early years of social media, there's a decidedly retro, comforting feel to the site.

T2 or TBD?



Gabor Cselle, a veteran of Google who worked at Twitter from 2014 to 2016, is determined to create a better Twitter. For now, he's calling it T2 and says the Web domain name he purchased for it - t2.social - cost $7.16. T2, which may or may not be its final name, is currently accepting signups for its waitlist, but the site is clearly not yet functioning.

I think Twitter always had a problem in figuring out what to do and how to decide on what to do. And that was always kind of in the back of my mind, Cselle told The Associated Press. On Monday, I decided to just go for it. I didn't see anyone else really doing it.

Twitter-style text and TikTok-style videos are one idea. Cselle says for this to work, the text really has to be amped up so it's not drowned out by the videos.

My bet is that it's going to be easier and more efficient to build a better Twitter or public square now than fix the legacy problems at Twitter, Cselle added.

Cselle, of course, is not the only one jumping to the opportunity. Project Mushroom, for instance, plans a safe place on the internet - a community-led open-source home for creators seeking justice on an overheating planet and says it has received 25,000 early signups to its yet-to-launch platform.

My sense is that things are going to further fragment into more ideological platforms and some will die and then we'll see some new consolidation emerge over the next couple of years, said Jennifer Stromer-Galley, a professor at Syracuse University who studies social media.

NEWS SITES



One of Twitter's most valuable features has been the way it allows people to find information within seconds. Was that just an earthquake? Twitter will tell you. Or at least it did.

While there is no perfect replacement for Twitter, staying up to date with local, national and news is easier than ever. Apple and Google both offer news services that aggregate articles from a broad range of publication (Apple offers a premium subscription service that gets you access to more articles, while Google shows free stories first.) There's also Flipboard, which works kind of like a personal magazine curated to your interests.

Of course, subscribing to individual publications (or downloading a free news app such as the AP's AP News) is also an option.

Yes, you might have to pay for some of them and no, you won't get a blue check mark with your subscription.

IPOs and leveraged credit are sketchy parts of the investable universe today. One fund has bucked the bearish trend, though. Is now a good time to add big yield to your portfolio? Let’s dive into one new closed-end fund that could be worth an allocation.

IPOs Weak Year-on-Year

Stockcharts.com

According to Bank of America Global Research, NYSE:BXSL which commenced investing in 2018, is a specialty finance company, regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, that invests in debt and equity of middle market commercial enterprises. BXSL's objective is to generate current income with the potential for capital appreciation for distribution to shareholders as dividends. The company principally underwrites floating rate credit structures at the upper end of the capital structure. BXSL reported a strong earnings report last Thursday.

The New York-based $3.8 billion market cap Capital Markets industry stock within the Financials sector trades at a low 9.4 trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio and pays a 9.1% dividend yield, according to The Wall Street Journal. The closed-end fund features a 10.0% annual total net return since inception, according to the fund website and is 97.9% invested in first-lien senior secured notes. The total fund net asset value is $9.7 billion at the current fair market value estimate.

The fund company has upside potential from its strong origination platform and a portfolio generally oriented towards late-cycle activities. A reasonable fee structure is also aligned with shareholder interests, but its limited history still warrants some trepidation and uncertainty looking ahead. It remains to be seen how the fund performs should the economy worsen.

Looking back, BXSL paid two dividends in Q3: a core dividend of $0.60 and a special dividend of $0.20 versus a total payout of $0.73 in the previous quarter. There’s the potential for larger dividends this quarter. The current portfolio yield is near 9% and the board of directors approved a $262 million stock buyback plan which has been completed. More repurchase plans are expected, too.

BSXL won both the 2021 Private Debt Investor BDC Manager of the Year, Americas award and the Global Fund Manager of the Year award as demand for private credit continues to grow. Blackstone reports that private credit as a percentage of the total addressable credit market is now up to 22% as of the end of 2020 at nearly $3.7 trillion. The fund aims to enhance revenue, optimize costs, and leverage its managers’ expertise in niches such as cybersecurity, ESG, and healthcare.

A Growing Global Private Credit Market

Blackstone Secured Lending Fund

The portfolio composition is diversified, which I like to see in this market environment. BXSL reports that the makeup of the fund is 15% in Software, but also significantly weighted in other defensive areas of the private credit market. As a result, its NAV has steadied in recent months while other tech-heavy funds have faltered. With liquidity of $1.1 billion, above the level from Q2, and no maturity waterfall until the middle of next year, the funding mix is conservative right now which I like to see amid tight financial conditions.

BXSL Portfolio Exposure

Blackstone Secured Lending Fund

On valuation, analysts at BofA see the fund’s earnings growing sharply this year and next before turning down in 2024. Dividends might be extraordinary this year, though. Still, positive operating earnings and share buybacks should keep BXSL’s operating and GAAP P/Es at low levels while its yield remains high based on its portfolio. Overall, I like the valuation with its moderate-risk-level portfolio. The fund also generally benefits from rising and/or high interest rates.

The Technical Take

Many investors might solely focus on BXSL’s portfolio and yield, but it’s also critical to pay attention to price action to identify key trends so as not to get caught on the wrong side of key moves. I see a trading range right now along with consolidation in the RSI momentum indicator.

Should shares breakout above about $25.50, I see upside potential to near $29 based on a measured move price target triggered bits its $3.50 range. Also, be sure to watch for a breakout or breakdown in the RSI as a possible harbinger of future price action. Overall, I would like to see this stabilization in BXSL but would prefer a breakout to take place before getting aggressively long.

The Bottom Line

I like BXSL’s high yield and portfolio mix right now. The chart, while not as bullish as the fundamental case, looks decent with upside potential.

114,Democrats keep Senate majority as GOP push falters in Nevada,cybersecurity,13/11/2022,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/custom/image/73769e9c-c54c-11ea-9ace-179ea39eeb22.jpg?resize=600%2C315,richmond.com,"Democrats keep Senate majority as GOP push falters in Nevada

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats kept control of the Senate on Saturday, repelling Republican efforts to retake the chamber and making it harder for them to thwart President Joe Biden's agenda. The fate of the House was still uncertain as the GOP struggled to pull together a slim majority there.

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto's victory in Nevada gave Democrats the 50 seats they needed to keep the Senate. Her win reflects the surprising strength of Democrats across the U.S. this election year. Seeking reelection in an economically challenged state that has some of the highest gas prices in the nation, Cortez Masto was considered the Senate's most vulnerable member, adding to the frustration of Republicans who were confident she could be defeated.

“We got a lot done and we'll do a lot more for the American people,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Saturday night. “The American people rejected — soundly rejected — the anti-democratic, authoritarian, nasty and divisive direction the MAGA Republicans wanted to take our country.""

With the results in Nevada now decided, Georgia is the only state where both parties are still competing for a Senate seat. Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock faces GOP challenger Herschel Walker in a Dec. 6 runoff. Alaska's Senate race has advanced to ranked choice voting, though the seat will stay in Republican hands.

Democratic control of the Senate ensures a smoother process for Biden's Cabinet appointments and judicial picks, including those for potential Supreme Court openings. The party will also keep control over committees and have the power to conduct investigations or oversight of the Biden administration, and will be able to reject legislation sent over by the House if the GOP wins that chamber.

Trump vs. DeSantis: A simmering rivalry bursts into view

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis have been on a collision course from the start.

Eyeing the Florida governor as his most formidable foe within the Republican Party, the former president has sought to keep DeSantis in his place, often noting the role his endorsement played in lifting the relatively obscure congressman to the leader of one of America's largest states.

DeSantis, for his part, has long praised Trump and mimicked his style, but has notably declined to put aside his own White House ambitions as the former president prepares to seek his old job again. In the clearest sign of tension, the two held dueling Florida rallies in the final days of this year's midterm elections. At his event, Trump unveiled his new derisive nickname for DeSantis, calling him Ron DeSanctimonious.

The simmering rivalry between the Republican Party's biggest stars enters a new, more volatile phase after the GOP's underwhelming performance in what was supposed to be a blockbuster election year. DeSantis, who won a commanding reelection, is increasingly viewed as the party's future, while Trump, whose preferred candidates lost races from Pennsylvania to Arizona, is widely blamed as a drag on the party.

That leaves Trump in perhaps his most vulnerable position since he sparked the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. As he moves forward with plans to announce a third presidential bid on Tuesday, Trump is turning to a playbook that has served him through decades of personal, financial and political turmoil: zeroing in on his enemies' perceived weaknesses and hitting them with repeated attacks.

Democrat Katie Hobbs keeps lead in race for Arizona governor

PHOENIX (AP) — The release of ballots on Saturday from Arizona's largest county netted Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake a few thousand votes, but she's still trailing Democrat Katie Hobbs by tens of thousands of ballots.

Hobbs led Lake by 1.6 percentage points after the release of roughly 85,000 votes from Maricopa County. Approximately 270,000 ballots remain uncounted statewide, and Hobbs leads by about 35,000 votes.

Data analysts from both parties believe the count will eventually shift in Lake’s favor, but it’s not yet clear whether she will pick up enough votes to overtake Hobbs. Republicans have watched anxiously since Tuesday as Hobbs has defied their expectations and increased her lead each day, including Saturday when combined with results from the rest of the state.

About 50 conservative protesters gathered outside the fence around Maricopa County’s election tabulation center in downtown Phoenix at midday Saturday to draw attention to their concerns about the slow pace of the vote count. Protracted counts are the norm in Arizona, where a record number of people returned mail ballots on Election Day.

A few protesters wore ballistic vests or carried handguns as a number of county sheriff’s deputies nearby guarded the complex.

Two historic aircraft collide at Veterans Day show in Dallas

DALLAS (AP) — Two historic military aircraft collided and crashed Saturday during an air show in Dallas, exploding into a ball of flames and sending black smoke billowing into the sky. It was not clear how many people were on board.

Emergency crews raced to the crash scene at the Dallas Executive Airport, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the city’s downtown. News footage from the scene showed crumpled wreckage of the planes in a grassy area inside the airport perimeter. Dallas Fire-Rescue told The Dallas Morning News that there were no reported injuries among people on the ground.

Anthony Montoya saw the two planes collide.

“I just stood there. I was in complete shock and disbelief,” said Montoya, 27, who attended the air show with a friend. “Everybody around was gasping. Everybody was bursting into tears. Everybody was in shock.”

Officials would not say how many people were on board the planes, but Hank Coates, president of the company that put on the airshow, said one of the planes, a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber, typically has a crew of four to five people. The other, a P-63 Kingcobra fighter plane, has a single pilot.

US border agency leader resigns amid wave of migrants

WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection has resigned from his job leading the nation’s largest law enforcement agency as agents encounter record numbers of migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico.

Chris Magnus submitted his resignation to President Joe Biden on Saturday, saying it had been “a privilege and honor” to be part of the administration.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden had accepted Magnus' resignation. “President Biden appreciates Commissioner Magnus’ nearly forty years of service and the contributions he made to police reform during his tenure as police chief in three U.S. cities,” she said.

Two people who were briefed on the matter told The Associated Press on Friday that Magnus was told to resign or be fired less than a year after he was confirmed. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to address the matter publicly.

Magnus's removal is part of a larger shakeup expected at Homeland Security as it struggles to manage migrants coming from a wider range of countries, including Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. This comes as Republicans are likely to take control of the House in January and are expected to launch investigations into the border.

Ukrainian police, TV broadcasts return to long-occupied city

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian police officers returned Saturday, along with TV and radio services, to the southern city of Kherson following the withdrawal of Russian troops, part of fast but cautious efforts to make the only regional capital captured by Russia livable after months of occupation. Yet one official still described the city as “a humanitarian catastrophe.”

People across Ukraine awoke from a night of jubilant celebrating after the Kremlin announced its troops had withdrawn to the other side of the Dnieper River from Kherson. The Ukrainian military said it was overseeing “stabilization measures” around the city to make sure it was safe.

The Russian retreat represented a significant setback for the Kremlin some six weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed the Kherson region and three other provinces in southern and eastern Ukraine in breach of international law and declared them Russian territory.

The national police chief of Ukraine, Ihor Klymenko, said Saturday on Facebook that about 200 officers were at work in the city, setting up checkpoints and documenting evidence of possible war crimes. Police teams also were working to identify and neutralize unexploded ordnance and one sapper was wounded Saturday while demining an administrative building, Klymenko said.

Ukraine’s communications watchdog said national TV and radio broadcasts had resumed and an adviser to Kherson’s mayor said humanitarian aid and supplies had begun to arrive from the neighboring Mykolaiv region.

Computer chip ban signals new era as Biden and Xi meet

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration's move to block exports of advanced computer chips to China is signaling a new phase in relations between the globe's two largest economies — one in which trade matters less than an increasingly heated competition to be the world’s leading technological and military power.

The aggressive move, announced last month, will help set the tone for President Joe Biden’s upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Asia. It's evidence of Biden's determination to “manage” the U.S. competition with China, whose officials were quick to condemn the export ban.

After more than two decades in which the focus was on expansion of trade and global growth, both countries are openly prioritizing their national interests as the world economy struggles with high inflation and the risk of recessions. The U.S. and China have each identified the development and production of computer chips as vital for economic growth and their own security interests.

“We’re going to do whatever it takes to protect Americans from the threat of China,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in an interview. “China is crystal clear. They will use this technology for surveillance. They will use this technology for cyber attacks. They will use this technology to, in any number of ways, harm us and our allies, or our ability to protect ourselves.”

Xi responded to the export ban in his statement at last month's congress of the Chinese Communist Party, where he secured a third term as the country's leader. He pledged that China would move more aggressively to become self-reliant in producing semiconductors and other technologies.

Funds vanish at bankrupt crypto exchange FTX; probe underway

NEW YORK (AP) — Collapsed cryptocurrency trading firm FTX confirmed there was “unauthorized access” to its accounts, hours after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Friday.

The embattled company’s new CEO John Ray III said Saturday that FTX is switching off the ability to trade or withdraw funds and taking steps to secure customers’ assets, according to a tweet by FTX’s general counsel Ryne Miller. FTX is also coordinating with law enforcement and regulators, the company said.

Exactly how much money is involved is unclear, but analytics firm Elliptic estimated Saturday that $477 million was missing from the exchange. Another $186 million was moved out of FTX’s accounts, but that may have been FTX moving assets to storage, said Elliptic’s co-founder and chief scientist Tom Robinson.

A debate formed on social media about whether the exchange was hacked or a company insider had stolen funds, a possibility that cryptocurrency analysts couldn’t rule out.

Until recently, FTX was one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It was already short billions of dollars when it sought bankruptcy protection Friday and its former CEO and founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, resigned.

Iranian who inspired 'The Terminal' dies at Paris airport

PARIS (AP) — An Iranian man who lived for 18 years in Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport and whose saga loosely inspired the Steven Spielberg film “The Terminal” died Saturday in the airport that he long called home, officials said.

Mehran Karimi Nasseri died after a heart attack in the airport’s Terminal 2F around midday, according an official with the Paris airport authority. Police and a medical team treated him but were not able to save him, the official said. The official was not authorized to be publicly named.

Nasseri lived in the airport’s Terminal 1 from 1988 until 2006, first in legal limbo because he lacked residency papers and later by apparent choice.

Year in and year out, he slept on a red plastic bench, making friends with airport workers, showering in staff facilities, writing in his diary, reading magazines and surveying passing travelers.

Staff nicknamed him Lord Alfred, and he became a mini-celebrity among passengers.

Twitter drama too much? Mastodon, others emerge as options

Twitter has been a bit of a mess since billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the helm, cutting the company’s workforce in half, upending the platform’s verification system, sparring with users over jokes and acknowledging that “ dumb things ” might happen as he reshapes one of the world’s most high-profile information ecosystems.

On Thursday, amid an exodus of senior executives responsible for data privacy, cybersecurity and complying with regulations, he warned the company’s remaining employees that Twitter might not survive if it can’t find a way to bring in at least half its revenue from subscriptions.

While it’s not clear if the drama is causing many users to leave — in fact, having a front-row seat to the chaos may prove entertaining to some — lesser-known sites Mastodon and even Tumblr are emerging as new (or renewed) alternatives. Here’s a look at some of them.

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and U.S. President Joe Biden discussed measures to promote bilateral relations during their meeting Saturday night in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh.

In the exchange that took place on the sidelines of the 40th and 41st ASEAN Summits and related meetings, the two leaders affirmed the great importance and high priority that they attached to the comprehensive partnership between the two countries.

Vietnam and the U.S. will strengthen exchanges and dialogue at all levels, prepare for talks on the phone between Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and President Biden as well as carry out high-level visits as conditions permit, they said.

Biden suggested the two countries continue to promote strong cooperation in order to strengthen bilateral relations, especially in areas of mutual benefit and make positive contributions to peace, stability, cooperation and development in the region and the world.

Chinh conveyed greetings from Party chief Trong and President Nguyen Xuan Phuc as also an invitation for the U.S. president to Vietnam. Biden accepted the invitations and promised to arrange a visit at an appropriate time.

Biden had traveled to Cambodia to attend the ASEAN-U.S. Summit and the East Asia Summit (EAS), marking his first visit to Southeast Asia as president of the United States.

Chinh also held a series of other bilateral exchanges and meetings on the sidelines of the summits.

In his meeting with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the Vietnamese PM suggested that Singapore supports Vietnam in building a digital platform and promoting digital transformation.

He also wanted Singapore to replicate the Vietnam - Singapore Industrial Park (VSIP) model, in Binh Duong Province that borders HCMC, elsewhere in the country. He expressed his hope that Singaporean businesses would incorporate ""greenness and sustainability"" into investment projects in Vietnam in the future.

PM Chinh and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese agreed to effectively implement the Australia-Vietnam Enhanced Economic Engagement Strategy in order to further open the market for the two countries' exports, especially agricultural products.

The two sides will also increase coordination on dealing with illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing as well as exchange experiences on macroeconomic management.

PM Chinh also met with Indian Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar and proposed that India further open its market for Vietnamese agricultural products and other goods.

The two sides also agreed to exploit the potential for cooperation in the fields of defense and security, maritime cooperation, sustainable development, energy and ensuring a sustainable supply chain.

In a meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol Saturday morning, PM Chinh called for South Korea to further support Vietnam’s industrialization and modernization process, as well as development of the culture industry.

Yoon emphasized his country’s willingness to cooperate with Vietnam in digital transformation, cybersecurity and biotechnology.

General Hun Manet, deputy commander-in-chief cum Commander of the Army and Royal Cambodian Army, also called on PM Chinh.

The two sides affirmed that defense cooperation continued to be an important pillar of their bilateral relationship, contributing to maintaining independence and sovereignty as also creating a peaceful and stable environment for development.

Chinh is in Cambodia attending the 40th and 41st ASEAN Summits and related meetings from November 10-13.","Vietnam, US agree to bolster comprehensive partnership",https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-us-agree-to-bolster-comprehensive-partnership-4535384.html

With the results in Nevada now decided, Georgia is the only state where both parties are still competing for a Senate seat. Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock faces GOP challenger Herschel Walker in a Dec. 6 runoff. Alaska's Senate race has advanced to ranked choice voting, though the seat will stay in Republican hands.

Democratic control of the Senate ensures a smoother process for Biden's Cabinet appointments and judicial picks, including those for potential Supreme Court openings. The party will also keep control over committees and have the power to conduct investigations or oversight of the Biden administration, and will be able to reject legislation sent over by the House if the GOP wins that chamber.

Trump vs. DeSantis: A simmering rivalry bursts into view

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis have been on a collision course from the start.

Eyeing the Florida governor as his most formidable foe within the Republican Party, the former president has sought to keep DeSantis in his place, often noting the role his endorsement played in lifting the relatively obscure congressman to the leader of one of America's largest states.

DeSantis, for his part, has long praised Trump and mimicked his style, but has notably declined to put aside his own White House ambitions as the former president prepares to seek his old job again. In the clearest sign of tension, the two held dueling Florida rallies in the final days of this year's midterm elections. At his event, Trump unveiled his new derisive nickname for DeSantis, calling him Ron DeSanctimonious.

The simmering rivalry between the Republican Party's biggest stars enters a new, more volatile phase after the GOP's underwhelming performance in what was supposed to be a blockbuster election year. DeSantis, who won a commanding reelection, is increasingly viewed as the party's future, while Trump, whose preferred candidates lost races from Pennsylvania to Arizona, is widely blamed as a drag on the party.

That leaves Trump in perhaps his most vulnerable position since he sparked the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. As he moves forward with plans to announce a third presidential bid on Tuesday, Trump is turning to a playbook that has served him through decades of personal, financial and political turmoil: zeroing in on his enemies' perceived weaknesses and hitting them with repeated attacks.

Democrat Katie Hobbs keeps lead in race for Arizona governor

PHOENIX (AP) — The release of ballots on Saturday from Arizona's largest county netted Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake a few thousand votes, but she's still trailing Democrat Katie Hobbs by tens of thousands of ballots.

Hobbs led Lake by 1.6 percentage points after the release of roughly 85,000 votes from Maricopa County. Approximately 270,000 ballots remain uncounted statewide, and Hobbs leads by about 35,000 votes.

Data analysts from both parties believe the count will eventually shift in Lake’s favor, but it’s not yet clear whether she will pick up enough votes to overtake Hobbs. Republicans have watched anxiously since Tuesday as Hobbs has defied their expectations and increased her lead each day, including Saturday when combined with results from the rest of the state.

About 50 conservative protesters gathered outside the fence around Maricopa County’s election tabulation center in downtown Phoenix at midday Saturday to draw attention to their concerns about the slow pace of the vote count. Protracted counts are the norm in Arizona, where a record number of people returned mail ballots on Election Day.

A few protesters wore ballistic vests or carried handguns as a number of county sheriff’s deputies nearby guarded the complex.

Two historic aircraft collide at Veterans Day show in Dallas

DALLAS (AP) — Two historic military aircraft collided and crashed Saturday during an air show in Dallas, exploding into a ball of flames and sending black smoke billowing into the sky. It was not clear how many people were on board.

Emergency crews raced to the crash scene at the Dallas Executive Airport, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the city’s downtown. News footage from the scene showed crumpled wreckage of the planes in a grassy area inside the airport perimeter. Dallas Fire-Rescue told The Dallas Morning News that there were no reported injuries among people on the ground.

Anthony Montoya saw the two planes collide.

“I just stood there. I was in complete shock and disbelief,” said Montoya, 27, who attended the air show with a friend. “Everybody around was gasping. Everybody was bursting into tears. Everybody was in shock.”

Officials would not say how many people were on board the planes, but Hank Coates, president of the company that put on the airshow, said one of the planes, a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber, typically has a crew of four to five people. The other, a P-63 Kingcobra fighter plane, has a single pilot.

US border agency leader resigns amid wave of migrants

WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection has resigned from his job leading the nation’s largest law enforcement agency as agents encounter record numbers of migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico.

Chris Magnus submitted his resignation to President Joe Biden on Saturday, saying it had been “a privilege and honor” to be part of the administration.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden had accepted Magnus' resignation. “President Biden appreciates Commissioner Magnus’ nearly forty years of service and the contributions he made to police reform during his tenure as police chief in three U.S. cities,” she said.

Two people who were briefed on the matter told The Associated Press on Friday that Magnus was told to resign or be fired less than a year after he was confirmed. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to address the matter publicly.

Magnus's removal is part of a larger shakeup expected at Homeland Security as it struggles to manage migrants coming from a wider range of countries, including Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. This comes as Republicans are likely to take control of the House in January and are expected to launch investigations into the border.

Ukrainian police, TV broadcasts return to long-occupied city

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian police officers returned Saturday, along with TV and radio services, to the southern city of Kherson following the withdrawal of Russian troops, part of fast but cautious efforts to make the only regional capital captured by Russia livable after months of occupation. Yet one official still described the city as “a humanitarian catastrophe.”

People across Ukraine awoke from a night of jubilant celebrating after the Kremlin announced its troops had withdrawn to the other side of the Dnieper River from Kherson. The Ukrainian military said it was overseeing “stabilization measures” around the city to make sure it was safe.

The Russian retreat represented a significant setback for the Kremlin some six weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed the Kherson region and three other provinces in southern and eastern Ukraine in breach of international law and declared them Russian territory.

The national police chief of Ukraine, Ihor Klymenko, said Saturday on Facebook that about 200 officers were at work in the city, setting up checkpoints and documenting evidence of possible war crimes. Police teams also were working to identify and neutralize unexploded ordnance and one sapper was wounded Saturday while demining an administrative building, Klymenko said.

Ukraine’s communications watchdog said national TV and radio broadcasts had resumed and an adviser to Kherson’s mayor said humanitarian aid and supplies had begun to arrive from the neighboring Mykolaiv region.

Computer chip ban signals new era as Biden and Xi meet

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration's move to block exports of advanced computer chips to China is signaling a new phase in relations between the globe's two largest economies — one in which trade matters less than an increasingly heated competition to be the world’s leading technological and military power.

The aggressive move, announced last month, will help set the tone for President Joe Biden’s upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Asia. It's evidence of Biden's determination to “manage” the U.S. competition with China, whose officials were quick to condemn the export ban.

After more than two decades in which the focus was on expansion of trade and global growth, both countries are openly prioritizing their national interests as the world economy struggles with high inflation and the risk of recessions. The U.S. and China have each identified the development and production of computer chips as vital for economic growth and their own security interests.

“We’re going to do whatever it takes to protect Americans from the threat of China,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in an interview. “China is crystal clear. They will use this technology for surveillance. They will use this technology for cyber attacks. They will use this technology to, in any number of ways, harm us and our allies, or our ability to protect ourselves.”

Xi responded to the export ban in his statement at last month's congress of the Chinese Communist Party, where he secured a third term as the country's leader. He pledged that China would move more aggressively to become self-reliant in producing semiconductors and other technologies.

Funds vanish at bankrupt crypto exchange FTX; probe underway

NEW YORK (AP) — Collapsed cryptocurrency trading firm FTX confirmed there was “unauthorized access” to its accounts, hours after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Friday.

The embattled company’s new CEO John Ray III said Saturday that FTX is switching off the ability to trade or withdraw funds and taking steps to secure customers’ assets, according to a tweet by FTX’s general counsel Ryne Miller. FTX is also coordinating with law enforcement and regulators, the company said.

Exactly how much money is involved is unclear, but analytics firm Elliptic estimated Saturday that $477 million was missing from the exchange. Another $186 million was moved out of FTX’s accounts, but that may have been FTX moving assets to storage, said Elliptic’s co-founder and chief scientist Tom Robinson.

A debate formed on social media about whether the exchange was hacked or a company insider had stolen funds, a possibility that cryptocurrency analysts couldn’t rule out.

Until recently, FTX was one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It was already short billions of dollars when it sought bankruptcy protection Friday and its former CEO and founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, resigned.

Iranian who inspired 'The Terminal' dies at Paris airport

PARIS (AP) — An Iranian man who lived for 18 years in Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport and whose saga loosely inspired the Steven Spielberg film “The Terminal” died Saturday in the airport that he long called home, officials said.

Mehran Karimi Nasseri died after a heart attack in the airport’s Terminal 2F around midday, according an official with the Paris airport authority. Police and a medical team treated him but were not able to save him, the official said. The official was not authorized to be publicly named.

Nasseri lived in the airport’s Terminal 1 from 1988 until 2006, first in legal limbo because he lacked residency papers and later by apparent choice.

Year in and year out, he slept on a red plastic bench, making friends with airport workers, showering in staff facilities, writing in his diary, reading magazines and surveying passing travelers.

Staff nicknamed him Lord Alfred, and he became a mini-celebrity among passengers.

Twitter drama too much? Mastodon, others emerge as options

Twitter has been a bit of a mess since billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the helm, cutting the company’s workforce in half, upending the platform’s verification system, sparring with users over jokes and acknowledging that “ dumb things ” might happen as he reshapes one of the world’s most high-profile information ecosystems.

On Thursday, amid an exodus of senior executives responsible for data privacy, cybersecurity and complying with regulations, he warned the company’s remaining employees that Twitter might not survive if it can’t find a way to bring in at least half its revenue from subscriptions.

While it’s not clear if the drama is causing many users to leave — in fact, having a front-row seat to the chaos may prove entertaining to some — lesser-known sites Mastodon and even Tumblr are emerging as new (or renewed) alternatives. Here’s a look at some of them.

(Oh, and if you are leaving Twitter and want to preserve your tweet history, you can download it by going to your profile settings and clicking on “your account” then “download an archive of your data."")

However, certain anomalies found during on-chain investigations suggest foul play and market manipulation.

Just two days after Crypto.com made its cold storage information public, investigators found that 320,000 Ether (ETH) was sent to Gate.io on Oct. 21, 2022. However, Kris Marszalek, the CEO of Crypto.com, dismissed any wrongdoing by stating that the funds were transferred accidentally and were eventually returned back to the original storage.

On Oct. 28, Gate.io released its proof of reserves snapshot, which, Solidity developer Shegen alleged, was done using Crypto.com’s funds, and questioned:

“This was topping up for the proof. Gate and crypto.com are fucked?”

Moreover, the crypto community suspects Huobi of attempting a similar manipulation. A wallet address linked to the Huobi exchange was found transferring 10,000 ETH to Binance and OKX deposit wallets soon after releasing its asset snapshot.

After Huobi released the asset snapshot of the asset reserve, 10,000 ETH was transferred from 0xca...c3fc (Huobi 34) to Binance and OKX deposit wallets. The Huobi 34, which had 14,858 ETH at the time of the snapshot, currently has only 4,044 ETH left. https://t.co/wrphZxadBM pic.twitter.com/B2lRXMF8su — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 13, 2022

Blockchain investigator Colin Wu pointed out the transactions on Etherscan, which proves that Huobi had shown 14,858 ETH in its latest snapshot, which has since fallen down to 2,463.5 ETH at the time of writing.

While Huobi is yet to publicly retaliate against the claims put forth by the crypto community, Gate.io founder Lin Han revealed their side of the story. Han argued that the snapshot in question was taken on Oct. 19, two days before Crypto.com's accidental fund transfer of 320,000 ETH.

Han further reiterated that Crypto.com's funds came in after the snapshot was released and shared relevant proof for the community's satisfaction.

The possibility of multiple crypto exchanges working together to manipulate investor funds has forced the community to keep their guard up until an official statement. Huobi has not yet responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

As of Nov. 12, the exchange held 191.84 million of its own native token HT ($900 million), 9.7 billion TRX, 820 million USDT, 274,000 ETH and 32,000 BTC, and 191.84 million HT tokens and several other coins, including ATOM, ADA, BCH, DOGE, DOT, MATIC, SHIB and ETC.

The total estimated value of reserves was $3.5 billion, the report said.

The revelation came days after FTX, formerly the third largest digital assets exchange by volume, imploded in response to a CoinDesk report that showed the exchange's sister company Alameda Research's balance sheet, was primarily made up of FTX's native token, FTT.

Since then, crypto exchanges worldwide have been scrambling to publish so-called proof of reserves to assure users that their funds aren't being channeled into other investments. On Nov. 10, leading crypto exchange Binance released the list of its cold wallets and reserves, disclosing $69 billion in crypto reserve.

""Huobi is acting now to disclose the balance details of our hot and cold wallets and make this disclosure a routine going forward,"" the exchange said in the report, adding that it performed a Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves audit early last month when the exchange's founder Leon Li sold his controller stake to About Capital.

Huobi promised to publish another Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves audit conducted by a third party within 30 days to boost user confidence further.

Under the Merkel Tree audit, an independent entity takes an anonymized snapshot of all crypto balances held by the exchange and aggregates them into a Merkel tree, a structure normally used to check the integrity of block data.

Huobi's disclosure, however, failed to calm market nerves. The HT token was recently trading at $4.8, down 8.9% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.

The exchange reportedly saw an outflow of 10,000 ETH after it published the asset reserve report. Data from South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows a total of 12,000 ETH ($15.14 million) have left Huobi in the past six hours.","Huobi Publishes Asset Transparency Report, Revealing $3.5B in Crypto Holdings",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huobi-publishes-asset-transparency-report-060419627.html
127,What are the implications for having multiple implementations of the Bitcoin protocol? Do the positives outweigh the potential bugs and other issues?,blockchain,13/11/2022,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/t_share/MTkxMTk1NTA1ODM1OTEwODky/127-btc.png,bitcoin magazine,"This is an opinion editorial by Bill Scoresby, a bitcoin-based small business owner and writer of several guides for bitcoin self-custody.

The bugs that recently caused many LND nodes to fall out of sync with the Bitcoin blockchain were probably caused by an alternate implementation.

Perhaps you are wondering, “Who in the world is using anything other than Bitcoin Core?” You might not have known that other implementations of Bitcoin existed. Maybe you’re not sure what a different implementation even means.

Bitcoin Core began as the software that Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in C++ and released to the world. It has been updated with new versions leading to the present day. An alternate implementation is software that does the same thing as Bitcoin Core — enforces the same consensus rules — but is written differently, most often in a different coding language.

How Did An Alternate Implementation Break Nodes On The Lightning Network?

One of the major Lightning Network node versions (LND) relies on an alternate Bitcoin implementation called btcd. When a developer created a very large multisig transaction, btcd did not see it as valid because it contained too much witness data. Other Bitcoin implementations — most importantly Bitcoin Core — had no such limit on Taproot transaction witness data, and therefore accepted the transaction and the block that contained it as valid.

The result was miners kept adding new blocks on the chain because they weren’t using btcd and according to their rules nothing was wrong, but LND Lightning nodes couldn’t recognize any of these new blocks because they were built on top of the block containing that one transaction they saw as invalid.

When the bug happened again on November 1, it wasn’t just LND nodes that were affected. Some electrs instances (an implementation of the backend server for Electrum Wallet) also failed to reach consensus with the rest of the chain. While the LND nodes were put out of consensus because of a similar issue in btcd, it was an implementation of Bitcoin written in Rust that caused the electrs nodes to fall behind, including some very visible servers run by mempool.space.

The limit on the size of witness data exists to prevent DoS attacks, and is a part of Bitcoin Core as well ( although Core has a larger limit for Taproot transactions). It seems that the other two implementations that fell out of sync had code that maintained the smaller limit.

Very small differences in implementations can lead to a lack of consensus.

Having Multiple Implementations Of Bitcoin Is Dangerous

Satoshi didn’t like the idea of multiple implementations of Bitcoin. “I don’t believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.” The reason he gave was, “So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.”

Menace? What’s the big deal?

You’ve probably heard that the chain with the most proof-of-work is the true chain. When two different miners find a block at the same time, the chain splits and other miners start building on whichever block they hear about first.

As soon as a new block is added to one side of the split, most nodes and miners accept that as the new true chain and abandon the other side of the split. These blocks are referred to as stale blocks, though some people call them orphaned blocks.

Since the average time between blocks in Bitcoin is 10 minutes, it is likely the whole network will learn about this new block before one is added to the losing side of the split, and the chain with the most work wins.

“Nodes will follow the valid chain with the most work…The key word here is valid. If the node receives a block that it determines invalid, it doesn’t matter how much work is done on top of that block, the node will not accept that chain.” — Andrew Chow

The key word is “valid.” The menace shows up when a miner finds a block that some other miners and nodes think isn’t valid. Miners who think it is valid will try to build new blocks on that chain. Miners who think it isn’t valid will try to build on the last valid block they know about. The result: Two chains and no way to know which is true.

How in the world would such a thing come to pass?

Well, as we saw in the case of the recent bug with LND nodes, if there is a bug in one implementation of Bitcoin that is not in other implementations, it can lead to a lack of consensus about whether a block is valid or not.

Bitcoin does not have a mechanism for fixing this. The community outside of the protocol has to decide what happens next. It sounds very unpleasant.

So much so that Bitcoin developer Peter Todd has said that other implementations need to match Bitcoin Core bug-for-bug.

There you go: Multiple implementations are dangerous!

What Are The Other Implementations Of Bitcoin And Why Do They Exist?

First of all, most everyone runs Bitcoin Core.

Luke Dashjr sees about 43,000 nodes, 98% of which are running Bitcoin Core and something called Coin Dance sees close to 15,000 nodes, 96% of which are running Bitcoin Core. So, at the moment, it looks like very few people are using alternate implementations.

Nevertheless, there are active projects that are trying to build and maintain other codebases that implement the Bitcoin protocol. They include:

Jameson Lopp has an excellent page with a more exhaustive list and links to all of the other implementations.

All of these projects have extremely talented developers working on them, and each has existed for more than a few years. Why put so much effort into something that seems like such a problem?

Bitcoin is permissionless. Anyone can download the chain; anyone can interact with the network; and nobody can stop you from coding or running an alternate implementation.

Yet, clearly some people are in charge of making changes to the Bitcoin repository and the process for choosing them seems informal. While there is the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process for suggesting changes to Bitcoin Core, it is also pretty informal.

None of this is a direct problem. As Marty Bent points out, rough consensus can be a strength. If the process of changing Bitcoin is difficult and unclear, it means that changes will be more thoroughly vetted.

The next step of rough consensus is having more than one popular implementation.

Not Having Multiple Implementations Might Be More Dangerous

There can be no doubt that it is already a very difficult job to be one of the people who has commit access to Bitcoin Core. In a world where Bitcoin plays a central role as a monetary instrument, this job will get much more difficult. A small group of developers could become a very worthwhile target. At the very least, their attention will be sought in order to lobby for various inclusions or exclusions in the next software release.

Think about the lobbying industry that currently exists in politics. Why wouldn’t such a thing develop around the people who have commit access to the only implementation of the Bitcoin protocol?

Like politicians now, they will be perceived to have access to power. As such, people will target them, except these developers won’t have the muscle of a state to defend them. What kind of life is that going to be? Who would voluntarily choose it?

At the end of the day, the global financial system is a pretty heavy weight to rest on the shoulders of the small group of people who have commit access to one GitHub repository. Maybe not so different from the global financial system we are trying to get away from where people’s monetary future hinges on the decisions of a few central bankers.

Multiple Implementations To The Rescue!

The presence and widespread use of multiple implementations on the Bitcoin network can mitigate these pressures by making it much more difficult for a malicious actor to change the Bitcoin protocol.

If participants in the Bitcoin network are more evenly distributed among different implementations, there is more room for good ideas to surface. Proposing changes to Bitcoin or rejecting them is a lot more decentralized if it isn’t all done in one camp.

Clearly, using different implementations of Bitcoin increases the risk of a chain split. A catastrophic chain split — where a significant portion of nodes and miners accidentally forked off — would not be good for Bitcoin, and certainly not its price. But it wouldn’t threaten Bitcoin’s permissionless nature.

A centralized development environment where everyone only builds on Bitcoin Core could threaten permissionless-ness. The conversation about the topic needs to address the risks of relying so heavily on Bitcoin Core rather than focusing solely on what problems might be caused by an alternate implementation.

There is a great, older article about this debate by Aaron van Wirdum. You can also read a more recent, informative thread about it.

First, concerns emerged about links between FTX and an asset-trading firm called Alameda Research, including suggestions that customers' funds have been transferred from FTX to Alameda.A few days later, rival firm Binance (the biggest crypto exchange) announced it would sell its holdings of FTT tokens, a crypto that reportedly comprises much of Alameda's assets.Panicked customers rushed to withdraw funds from FTX, and the company is now on the brink of collapse, with a banner message on its website announcing it is ""currently unable to process withdrawals"".This is not the first such rapid disintegration we have seen in the loosely regulated world of cryptocurrency, and it's unlikely to be the last.The majority owner of both FTX and Alameda, Sam Bankman-Fried, had rescued other troubled crypto companies earlier this year. Now he is now desperately looking for an investor with a lazy $8 billion to save his companies.Many firms have already written off the value of their stakes in FTX. So it will not be easy for Bankman-Fried to find investors willing to put in new funding.Binance thought about taking over the troubled company outright. It decided against, citing concerns about allegations of misconduct and an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission The price of FTT has now plunged. A week ago it was trading at USD 24. Now it is at less than USD 4.Trading in ""assets"" with no underlying fundamental value on loosely regulated exchanges is always going to be a very risky endeavour. For many, it is likely to end in tears.Other kinds of asset are different. Company shares have a fundamental value based on the dividend (or at least an expected future dividend) paid from the company's profits.Real estate has a fundamental value that reflects the rent the investor earns (or the owner-occupier saves).The value of a bond depends on the amount of interest it pays. Even gold at least has some practical uses, for jewellery, dental fillings or electronics.But crypto so-called currencies such as Bitcoin, Ether and Dogecoin (and thousands more ""alt-coins"" and ""meme-coins"") have no such fundamental value.They are a game of pass-the-parcel, in which speculators try to sell them to someone else before the price collapses.Unregulated financial institutions are prone to the equivalent of a Depression-style ""bank run"".Once doubts emerge about their soundness, each person has an incentive to be early in the queue to withdraw their money before the money runs out.In a recent interview, Bankman-Fried gave a description of his business model that seems to rely heavily on funds injected by new investors, rather than on future returns based on the intrinsic value of the assets themselves.These events have further eroded confidence in the crypto ecosystem. Prior to this latest fiasco, the ""value"" of cryptocurrencies had already dropped from a peak of more than USD 3 trillion to USD 1 trillion. It has now fallen even lower.Just as a few stars such as Amazon emerged from the wreckage of the dot-com bubble, so it is possible that only a handful of applications of the blockchain technology that underpins crypto have enduring utility.And the idea of an electronic form of currency is being realised in the form of central bank digital currencies.But as Hyun Song Shin, the chief economist of the Bank of International Settlements , put it, ""everything that can be done with crypto can be done better with central bank money"".",The spectacular collapse of a USD 30 billion crypto exchange should come as no surprise,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/the-spectacular-collapse-of-a-usd-30-billion-crypto-exchange-should-come-as-no-surprise/articleshow/95484960.cms

131,Internet sleuths have discovered that $515 million has disappeared from the accounts of collapsed crypto exchange FTX in 'suspicious circumstances.',blockchain,13/11/2022,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/11/13/03/64487959-0-image-a-21_1668310456311.jpg,daily mail,"Internet sleuths have discovered that $515 million has disappeared from the accounts of collapsed crypto exchange FTX under 'suspicious circumstances.'

Company founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned from FTX on Friday, as the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy and reports emerged that, separate to the missing $515 million, up to $2 billion in client funds had vanished from the company's books in recent weeks.

Nick Percoco, chief security officer of Kraken, was among the industry officials seemingly piecing the situation together. He said in a tweet: 'We know the identity of the user' who withdrew the funds from FTX.

FTX's U.S. general counsel Ryne Miller then responded to that tweet: 'Interested in anything you are open to share. Could you reach out to me?'

Enthusiasts invested in the manic crypto episode also took it upon themselves to examine public records and find out who may have hacked or stolen the millions of dollars.

At the time of writing, Percoco has not elaborated further as to whether or not the withdrawal was the work of a hacker. Multiple reports have pointed out that the methods used to withdraw the money bear the hallmarks of a hacker.

Meanwhile, FTX's new Chief Executive John J. Ray III, known for guiding Enron through bankruptcy in the 2000s, said on Saturday that the company was working with law enforcement and regulators to mitigate the problem, and was making 'every effort to secure all assets, wherever located.'

'Among other things, we are in the process of removing trading and withdrawal functionality,' he said.

It's reported that Bankman-Fried, known for regularly wearing t-shirts and shorts, is holed up in the Bahamas as his empire continues to crumble. DailyMail.com has reached out to Bankman-Fried for comment.

In 2022, Bankman-Fried was one of the biggest donors to the Democratic Party.

On Saturday, Ryne Miller said in a Twitter post that the firm's digital assets were being moved into so-called cold storage 'to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions.'

Cold storage refers to crypto wallets that are not connected to the internet to guard against hackers.

Miller earlier tweeted that he was 'investigating abnormalities with wallet movements related to consolidation of FTX balances across exchanges.'

Bankman-Fried had transferred $10 billion of customer funds to his trading company, Alameda Research.

The company is run by Bankman-Fried's girlfriend, Caroline Ellison.

A large portion of that total has since disappeared, they said. One source put the missing amount at about $1.7 billion. The other said the gap was between $1 billion and $2 billion.

Blockchain analytics firm Nansen said it saw $659 million in outflows from FTX International and FTX U.S. in the last 24 hours.

A separate blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said that around $515 million worth of cryptoassets were 'suspected to have been stolen,' while $186 million were likely moved into secure storage by FTX.

The firm described the movement of the funds as 'suspicious.'

Crypto exchange Kraken said: 'We can confirm our team is aware of the identity of the account associated with the ongoing FTX hack, and we are committed to working with law enforcement to ensure they have everything they need to sufficiently investigate this matter.'

In its bankruptcy petition, FTX Trading said it has $10 billion to $50 billion in assets, $10 billion to $50 billion in liabilities, and more than 100,000 creditors.

Ray, a restructuring expert, was appointed to take over as CEO.

A document that Bankman-Fried shared with investors on Thursday showed FTX had $13.86 billion in liabilities and $14.6 billion in assets, according to Reuters.

However, only $900 million of those assets were liquid, leading to the cash crunch that ended with the company filing for bankruptcy.

In a tweet on Friday, Bankman-Fried said he was 'piecing together' what had happened at FTX.

'I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did earlier this week,' he wrote. 'I will, soon, write up a more complete post on the play by play.'

Bitcoin fell below $16,000 for the first time since 2020 after Binance abandoned its rescue deal for FTX on Wednesday.

On Saturday it was trading around $16,800, down by more than 75% from the all-time high of $69,000 it reached in November last year .

FTX's token FTT plunged by around 91% this week. Shares of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related firms have also declined.

Bankman-Fried, 30, resigned from FTX on Friday, as the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy and reports emerged that up to $2 billion in client funds had vanished from the company's books in recent weeks.

According to Coin Telegraph, the disgraced former CEO is holed up at the Albany Tower alongside FTX co-founder Gary Wang and the company's director of engineering Nishad Singh.

It's not clear if Wang, who is FTX's Chief Technology Officer, and Singh, the company's director of engineering, have also resigned their positions at the crypto trader.

A source told Coin Telegraph: 'Right now three of them, Sam, Gary, and Nishad are under supervision in the Bahamas. Which means it will be hard for them to leave.'

The same source said that it was Bankman-Fried's plan to escape to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, a country with no extradition treaties, as the walls close in around him.

The Wall Street Journal reported on November 9 that the the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission were plotting an investigation into FTX.

The source added that Bankman-Fried's father, Joseph, is also present.

DailyMail.com has reached out to Bankman-Fried for comment.

The resort where Bankman-Fried is hiding out is owned by golfing legend Tiger Woods, British billionaire Joe Lewis and singer Justin Timberlake.

A 2018 Forbes feature referred to the Albany as 'one of the most exclusive resorts in the world.' The article noted that the residencies at the resort are owned by 'some of the globe's richest few' while also having vacation rentals.

The Coin Telegraph report also speculates that the group are being monitored by authorities in the Bahamas and will be forbidden from leaving the country.

That have been multiple rumors swirling around Bankman-Fried's whereabouts since the collapse of FTX. In various messages to reporters, he has denied that he escaped to Argentina.

Among the issues being investigated is the fact that Bankman-Fried had transferred $10 billion of FTX customer funds to his trading company, Alameda Research.

The company is run by Bankman-Fried's girlfriend, Caroline Ellison. According to her LinkedIn page, she is based in the Bahamas.

Coin Telegraph reports that at the time of writing, Ellison is thought to be in Hong Kong. The website quotes a source saying: 'She might be able to get to Dubai.'

Earlier, internet sleuths discovered that $515 million has disappeared from the accounts of FTX under 'suspicious circumstances.'

Nick Percoco, chief security officer of Kraken, was among the industry officials seemingly piecing the situation together. He said in a tweet: 'We know the identity of the user' who withdrew the funds from FTX.

FTX's U.S. general counsel Ryne Miller then responded to that tweet: 'Interested in anything you are open to share. Could you reach out to me?'

Enthusiasts invested in the manic crypto episode also took it upon themselves to examine public records and find out who may have hacked or stolen the millions of dollars.

At the time of writing, Percoco has not elaborated further as to whether or not the withdrawal was the work of a hacker. Multiple reports have pointed out that the methods used to withdraw the money bear the hallmarks of a hacker.

Meanwhile, FTX's new Chief Executive John J. Ray III, known for guiding Enron through bankruptcy in the 2000s, said on Saturday that the company was working with law enforcement and regulators to mitigate the problem, and was making 'every effort to secure all assets, wherever located.'

'Among other things, we are in the process of removing trading and withdrawal functionality,' he said.

It's reported that Bankman-Fried, known for regularly wearing t-shirts and shorts, is holed up in the Bahamas as his empire continues to crumble.

In 2022, Bankman-Fried was one of the biggest donors to the Democratic Party.

On Saturday, Ryne Miller said in a Twitter post that the firm's digital assets were being moved into so-called cold storage 'to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions.'

Cold storage refers to crypto wallets that are not connected to the internet to guard against hackers.

Miller earlier tweeted that he was 'investigating abnormalities with wallet movements related to consolidation of FTX balances across exchanges.'

A large portion of that total has since disappeared, they said. One source put the missing amount at about $1.7 billion. The other said the gap was between $1 billion and $2 billion.

Blockchain analytics firm Nansen said it saw $659 million in outflows from FTX International and FTX U.S. in the last 24 hours.

A separate blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said that around $515 million worth of cryptoassets were 'suspected to have been stolen,' while $186 million were likely moved into secure storage by FTX.

The firm described the movement of the funds as 'suspicious.'

Crypto exchange Kraken said: 'We can confirm our team is aware of the identity of the account associated with the ongoing FTX hack, and we are committed to working with law enforcement to ensure they have everything they need to sufficiently investigate this matter.'

In its bankruptcy petition, FTX Trading said it has $10 billion to $50 billion in assets, $10 billion to $50 billion in liabilities, and more than 100,000 creditors.

Ray, a restructuring expert, was appointed to take over as CEO.

The turmoil at FTX sees at least $1 billion of customer funds vanish from the platform, sources say

FTX was engulfed in more chaos on Saturday, November 12, when the crypto exchange said it had detected unauthorized access and analysts said hundreds of millions of dollars of assets had been moved from the platform in “suspicious circumstances”.

FTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday, one of the highest profile crypto blowups, after traders rushed to withdraw $6 billion from the platform in just 72 hours and rival exchange Binance abandoned a proposed rescue deal.

FTX Chief Executive John J. Ray III said on Saturday that the company was working with law enforcement and regulators to mitigate the problem, and was making “every effort to secure all assets, wherever located.”

“Among other things, we are in the process of removing trading and withdrawal functionality,” he said.

The exchange’s dramatic fall from grace has seen its 30-year-old founder Sam Bankman-Fried, known for his shorts and T-shirt attire, morph from being the poster child of crypto’s successes to the protagonist of the industry’s biggest crash.

Bankman-Fried, who lives in the Bahamas, has also been the subject of speculation about his whereabouts and he denied rumors on Twitter that he had flown to South America. When asked by Reuters whether he had flown to Argentina, he responded in a text message: “Nope”. He told Reuters he was in the Bahamas.

The turmoil at FTX has seen at least $1 billion of customer funds vanish from the platform, sources told Reuters on Friday. Bankman-Fried had transferred $10 billion of customer funds to his trading company, Alameda Research, the sources said.

New problems emerged on Saturday when FTX’s US general counsel Ryne Miller said in a Twitter post that the firm’s digital assets were being moved into so-called cold storage “to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions.”

Cold storage refers to crypto wallets that are not connected to the internet to guard against hackers.

Blockchain analytics firm Nansen said it saw $659 million in outflows from FTX International and FTX US in the last 24 hours.

A separate blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said that around $515 million worth of cryptoassets were “suspected to have been stolen,” while $186 million were likely moved into secure storage by FTX.

Crypto exchange Kraken said: “We can confirm our team is aware of the identity of the account associated with the ongoing FTX hack, and we are committed to working with law enforcement to ensure they have everything they need to sufficiently investigate this matter.”

FTX was not immediately available for comment about the outflows or Kraken’s statement.

In its bankruptcy petition, FTX Trading said it has $10 billion to $50 billion in assets, $10 billion to $50 billion in liabilities, and more than 100,000 creditors. Ray, a restructuring expert, was appointed to take over as CEO.

A document that Bankman-Fried shared with investors on Thursday and was reviewed by Reuters showed FTX had $13.86 billion in liabilities and $14.6 billion in assets. However, only $900 million of those assets were liquid, leading to the cash crunch that ended with the company filing for bankruptcy.

The collapse shocked investors and prompted fresh calls to regulate the cryptoasset sector, which has seen losses stack up this year as cryptocurrency prices collapsed.

“Things will continue to simmer after the FTX crash,” said Alan Wong, operations manager of Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange.

“With a gap of $8 billion between liabilities and assets, when FTX is insolvent, it will trigger a domino effect, which will lead to a series of investors related to FTX going bankrupt or being forced to sell assets.”

Crypto market maker Jump said on Twitter late on Saturday that it had an undisclosed exposure to FTX, adding that the firm remains well capitalized.

Market fallout

Since its founding in 2019, FTX had raised more than $2 billion from top investors including Sequoia, SoftBank, BlackRock and Temasek. In January, FTX had raised $400 million from investors at a $32 billion valuation.

SoftBank and Sequoia Capital said they were marking their investments in FTX down to zero.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc will also write off the investment its ventures arm made in FTX in 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Bitcoin fell below $16,000 for the first time since 2020 after Binance abandoned its rescue deal for FTX on Wednesday.

On Saturday it was trading around $16,800, down by more than 75% from the all-time high of $69,000 it reached in November last year.

The crypto exchange he founded, FTX, had become an industry-dominating business in just three years, valued at $32bn as recently as January. He amassed political clout in an even bigger hurry, emerging from obscurity to become the second-biggest Democratic donor in the mid-term elections.

By Friday, the money and the clout had disappeared: Bankman-Fried resigned from FTX, which then filed for bankruptcy. Yesterday, the company revealed it was investigating ""unauthorized transactions"" worth more than $400m, and that it had moved all funds into offline storage.

He saw himself as using his fortune for good, not greed

And Bankman-Fried was left facing harrowing questions about his role in the most catastrophic collapse the notoriously volatile crypto industry has so far seen.

With his dishevelled appearance, super-casual manner and earnest insistence that he was trying to use his money to save the world, Bankman-Fried stood apart from the stereotype of crypto brats blowing instant riches on Lamborghinis and yachts.

His purported power over the crypto market drew comparisons to Wall Street financier JP Morgan — yet he saw himself as using his fortune for good, not greed.

How his career careened off course is a tale of ambition, hubris and ultimately recklessness — the full contours of which have yet to be publicly revealed.

When Bankman-Fried was just 28, he built a platform that offered investors easy access to buying, selling and stashing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The offshore exchange allowed investors to place risky bets not allowed in the US, though it was easy enough for American users to find workarounds; a US affiliate offered limited services.

With a massive marketing push — including a flashy Super Bowl ad and naming rights to the Miami Heat arena — he sought to make crypto trading a mainstream pastime.

Meanwhile, he was using his newfound political clout to sell Washington on a regulatory regime that promised to work to his advantage. The contrasts were glaring and never easily reconciled. As crypto’s self-appointed ambassador to Washington, Bankman-Fried was pressing for federal regulation, even as he dodged US oversight from his corporate headquarters in the Bahamas.

The executive acknowledged that FTX’s aggressive lobbying made him an outlier in crypto. “Outside of us, there weren’t many people engaging,” Bankman-Fried said in an interview last month with The Washington Post. “I think that means we have to do a better job as an industry more generally engaging.”

The industry has been rocked by a sell-off that wiped out two-thirds of crypto market value

In March, he appeared at the House Democratic retreat in Philadelphia with his arm around House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California.

In April, he turned up in the office of Caroline Pham, a Republican member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, less than a week after she assumed the post, along with Mark Wetjen, the former acting chair of the agency and now Bankman-Fried’s top Washington adviser.

Hill staffers say they regularly spotted him around the Capitol, shuttling between meetings flanked by Wetjen and Eliora Katz, who joined FTX this summer from the staff of the Senate Banking Committee’s top Republican, Patrick J. Toomey.

Many crypto diehards viewed his overtures to Washington as a betrayal of crypto’s founding mission. That set the stage for his most formidable adversary — Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, a rival crypto exchange — to crush him with stunning and decisive swiftness.

On Sunday, Zhao announced he was selling off his investment in FTX: $580m of a crypto token FTX had been using to prop up its debts. “We are not against anyone,” Zhao wrote on Twitter. “But we won’t support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs.”

‘I’m really sorry, again, that we ended up here,’ he wrote on Friday

When Zhao fled, other FTX customers panicked, inundating FTX with withdrawal requests the company could not meet. Bankman-Fried was forced to ask Zhao to buy his company.

The Binance chief accepted — and then reneged, fuelling allegations that Bankman-Fried was using FTX customer deposits to cover risky bets placed by Alameda Research, a sister trading firm. Bankman-Fried has denied the allegations.

Now, the regulators Bankman-Fried had been wooing are circling. His unorthodox management style — maintaining a relatively skeletal staff and presiding over an exchange interconnected with a sister trading firm and a US affiliate — are under scrutiny.

Bankman-Fried keeps tweeting apologies. “I’m really sorry, again, that we ended up here,” he wrote on Friday. But he has yet to offer answers to customers and investors wondering where their money has gone and whether they will recover it.

The saga reflects a head-spinning fall from grace. Just a few months ago, Bankman-Fried was toasted as crypto’s Warren Buffett; now he’s drawing comparisons to convicted fraudster Elizabeth Holmes.

Raised in the Bay Area by parents who are Stanford Law School professors, Bankman-Fried headed East for college, studying physics and maths at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 2010s. While there, he developed an interest in effective altruism, a philosophy that encourages adherents to earn as much as they can so that they can donate as much as possible to minimise suffering in the world.

After graduating in 2014, Bankman-Fried went to work for a Wall Street investment firm. He quit three years later and founded his own crypto-focused trading firm, Alameda Research, then launched FTX in 2019. He moved his budding empire from Hong Kong to the Bahamas last autumn.

FTX is not the first crypto business to collapse in recent months. The industry has been rocked by a sell-off that wiped out two-thirds of crypto market value, roughly $2tn, as the value of bitcoin has fallen from roughly $68,000 a year ago to $17,000 now.

‘It’s devastating for the industry. With FTX going down, we will see cascading effects’

But Bankman-Fried spent massively to market FTX as a trustworthy investment platform.

The company paid $135m for the naming rights to the Miami Heat arena; it signed a deal with Major League Baseball to affix its logo to umpires’ uniforms. It added pop-culture star power by recruiting football legend Tom Brady and wife Gisele Bundchen as spokespeople, and airing a Super Bowl ad featuring comedian Larry David.

Bankman-Fried also put himself forward as an unlikely public face of the company, becoming a constant presence on Twitter, conference stages, podcasts, cable television and print media. He understood that his sartorial quirkiness — he often appeared in shorts and T-shirts under an unkempt mop of curls — presented a disarming contrast to slicker peers in both crypto and traditional finance, people close to him said.

In Washington, Bankman-Fried embraced the halo effect conferred by his philanthropic work. A billboard advertising FTX went up in Union Station earlier this year, featuring a smiling photo of the crypto magnate and the words, “I’m in on crypto to make a global impact for good.”

That double-barrelled pitch was on display again last month, when he hosted a happy hour to lobby a half-dozen Democratic Senate aides on his crypto regulatory agenda at the Capitol Hill headquarters of his organisation dedicated to preventing future pandemics.

Attendees said Bankman-Fried used the event to argue that Congress should urgently pass a bipartisan bill that would hand significant oversight of centralised crypto exchanges — including FTX — to the CFTC, which is viewed as a friendlier alternative to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The session at the $3.3m private townhouse ended when Bankman-Fried’s younger brother, Gabe stopped by, thanked the aides for their support on pandemic preparedness issues and pulled the crypto executive into a separate meeting.

The bill Bankman-Fried was pitching — the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act — has drawn criticism both from advocates of stricter financial regulation for not going far enough and from some crypto operators who say it is too draconian.

Yet those close to the process say Bankman-Fried’s advocacy pushed the measure into potential consideration for year-end action by a Congress that remains, for now, under Democratic control.

For Bankman-Fried, the bill would provide his brand of crypto finance with a regulatory blessing that would help him grow his business. He believed it would usher in a wave of investment from traditional players scared off by the industry’s ‘wild-west’ reputation.

“If you talk to most institutions right now, they’re interested, they’re dabbling,” he told The Washington Post. “But for them to feel comfortable making a big move in the digital asset ecosystem, they need to see regulatory clarity.”

Even some crypto lobbyists were unaware how much traction Bankman-Fried had gained in Congress. But in late September, they got a wake-up call during a New York dinner hosted by Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto market intelligence firm Messari.

The event, for which Selkis rented out Ernesto’s, a Spanish restaurant on the Lower East Side, was meant in part to celebrate the industry’s maturation in Washington. But talk quickly turned to the latest developments on the Hill.

“Can we talk about the elephant in the room?” Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, said to the group, participants said. “Sam is selling out the industry to get a monopoly for FTX.”

Bankman-Fried was not at the New York dinner. But last month, he attempted to confront those concerns at another private meeting of crypto lobbyists at the Kimpton Banneker Hotel in Washington.

Organised by Selkis as a follow-up session, the gathering aimed to forge consensus on strategy among the industry’s top government affairs representatives.

The FTX chief made a case for rallying behind the Senate bill, arguing in part for the virtue of establishing the CFTC’s authority, attendees said. But the pitch failed to win converts.

“It wasn’t a conversation, so to speak,” one attendee said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting, implying that Bankman-Fried believed he alone spoke for the industry.

In the wake of FTX’s collapse, critics of the bill are arguing for a pause in Washington.

“We don’t need more legislation. We need more money and support for regulators to go after what is fundamentally a lawless industry,” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, which advocates for tougher financial regulation.

“We need elected officials to prioritise the public interest, rather than campaign contributors and lobbyists.”

Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried’s partners are bolting. The Miami Heat and Miami-Dade County announced on Friday they are terminating their relationship with the company and looking for a new naming rights partner for the arena.

The Crypto Council for Innovation, a leading crypto industry lobbying group, announced they had accepted the resignation of FTX’s US affiliate. And the team behind the FTX Future Fund, one of its philanthropic efforts, said in an open letter they had quit.

What happens next, on Capitol Hill and beyond, remains in doubt. Zhao, for his part, predicted more pain as shock waves from FTX’s collapse continue to reverberate.

“It’s devastating for the industry,” the Binance chief said at a conference in Indonesia last week. “With FTX going down, we will see cascading effects.”

And Big Blue’s Tucson engineers are also keeping its customers’ data safe in the ever-changing, increasingly hazardous world of cyberspace.

One example is the recently rolled out IBM Diamondback Tape Library, a high-capacity, archival tape-storage system designed for organizations needing to securely store hundreds of petabytes of data — each one equal to more than 220,000 DVD movies.

IBM says its Diamondback’s main benefits include low power usage, high-capacity storage at about a quarter of the cost of spinning hard-disk drives.

But its timely selling point involves an inherent ability of removable tape media: to disconnect data from the internet and private networks vulnerable to online attacks.

The ability to physically “air-gap” data can help protect big users against ransomware — when a hacker blocks access to networks or data and demands a ransom to release it — and other cyber threats, IBM says.

Calline Sanchez, IBM vice president in charge of the Tucson storage-system development, said the company worked with some of its “hyperscale” customers — companies like cloud-computing services that store tremendous amounts of data — to help design the Diamondback.

“We decided to really work with our partners, our clients and users and discuss what we want to do from an air-gap perspective, or cyber resiliency perspective,” said Sanchez, a UA alumna who also is IBM’s state executive for Arizona and her native New Mexico.

With data breaches and ransomware attacks now a constant threat, IBM says it’s seeing its big-data customers increasingly turn to tape for data resilience.

“From an air-gap perspective it somewhat detaches itself from the actual base infrastructure of a data center, so it’s self-sustaining,” said Sanchez. “It’s truly this idea of sustainable block storage of data, where it’s not easily accessible at all, from the outside world.”

Need for tape

While tape data storage was seen as a fading technology years ago as faster hard-disk drive and solid-state “flash” storage advanced, sales of tape have surged amid the seemingly endless growth in data.

Sales of tape media for so-called “Linear Tape Open“ or LTO Ultrium — an industry-standard tape technology provided by a consortium comprised of IBM, Hewlett Packard and Quantum Corp., rose a record 40% in 2021 to 148 exabytes of capacity (an exabyte is equal to about 1000 petabytes, or a billion gigabytes), according to the Silicon Valley-based LTO Program.

LTO tape is arguably the lowest-cost, simplest practice to recover from ransomware attacks, said Phil Goodwin, research vice president at the IT research firm IDC.

“Ransomware and malware are threats that will not go away,” Goodwin said as part of the LTO Program’s sales report. “Magnetic tape is an established, understood and proven technology that can be an invaluable tool for defeating ransomware.”

Sanchez credits tape’s resurgence to its sustainability and energy efficiency, as well as its ability to air-gap against cyber threats.

“It’s lower cost than the other storage media types like diskettes or hard disk drives, as well as flash drives,” she said. “And that’s part of the reason why now tape is feeding primarily the back-end infrastructure of cloud environments.”

Tech park crucible

Like most of IBM’s data storage systems developed over the past four decades, the Diamondback was developed at the company’s multi-building campus at the UA Tech Park on South Rita Road.

IBM built what is now the UA Tech Park in the early 1980s to house storage systems development and manufacturing facilities that employed some 5,000 people in an initial 10 buildings comprising more than 1.3 million square feet.

As part of a major restructuring in 1988, IBM moved the manufacturing part of the operation and nearly 3,000 jobs to San Jose, California, but kept its storage research and development units going.

The company sold its sprawling campus on South Rita Road to the UA in 1994, but stayed on as a tenant.

Today, its storage development labs are still going strong, with about 1,000 workers spread across more than 600,000 square feet in four buildings.

IBM’s local operation — which last week was awarded the Large Company Innovator of the Year at the Governor’s Celebration of Innovation Awards— generates more than 400 patents annually, Sanchez said.

Testing tape

At the Tech Park, IBM develops and tests a range of storage systems and media, including disk, tape and flash systems.

Inside the reliability testing lab at the Tech Park’s 9032 Building, IBM engineers have been conducting final testing on brand-new Diamondback Tape Library systems, which are about the size of a narrow refrigerator, with rows of shelving holding palm-sized tape cartridges.

With a constant hum of clicks and whirs, a robotic shuttle moves back and forth inside the Diamondback cabinet, plucking and mounting barcoded tape cartridges according to a preset program.

Each cartridge can hold 18 terabytes, or 1,000 gigabytes of data, and a full Diamondback packs 1,548 LTO cartridges, for total storage of 27 petabytes that can be up and running within 30 minutes of delivery, said Shawn Nave, an IBM mechanical engineer who helped develop the Diamondback.

A row of Diamondbacks were undergoing testing last week, and like all the products tested in the lab they will be put through their paces.

“As part of this testing, we run it until the wheels fall off, and see what happens,” said Nave, one of many UA alumni at IBM’s local operation.

A nearby building houses labs that subject the IBM hardware to extremes of temperatures and other environmental challenges, Sanchez noted.

As the world continues to generate more and more data, the engineers and scientists at the Tucson-area IBM site will continue to innovate to keep up, said Sanchez, whose 22 years with IBM include a year-long stint in 2008 working for Nick Donofrio, a well-known tech figure who led IBM’s technology and innovation strategies for a decade before retiring in 2008 after 44 years with Big Blue.

Behind the curtain

Sanchez likens IBM’s storage systems and services to the Wizard of Oz hiding behind his curtain, remaining unseen while making everything happen.

“That is from a back-end infrastructure perspective what IBM provides — we make it easier for these enterprises, because it’s totally easy to consume large amounts of data on these significant systems,” she said.

“Where like right now in our lab, we’re not just talking about petabytes. We’re talking about how to serve exabytes (each 1,000 petabytes), as well as zettabytes (1,000 exabytes).”

“Because we just know in a short period of time, we’re going to have research institutions coming to us and saying, ‘Hey, Calline, we’ve outgrown our two petabytes of research data we have in all U.S. research, universities, we need you to start building based on exabytes or possibly zettabytes.’ And to me, that’s crazy.”

IBM engineers are working to increase data storage and efficiency using artificial intelligence, which essentially programs machines to “think” like humans, but Sanchez doesn’t like that term.

“I like more ‘augmented intelligence,’ for the betterment of humankind, and what is great about working in data storage is you continue to think in that direction,” she said. “Because you’ve got to figure out the physics of how to store an immense amount of data that is being created by people on this Earth and with the devices like this.”",Tucson Tech: IBM innovates tape storage to tame data tsunami - Arizona Daily Star,https://tucson.com/news/local/business/tucson-tech-ibm-innovates-tape-storage-to-tame-data-tsunami/article_98538aa8-5c86-11ed-8e44-5be115ab0ebd.html

This short-term fix to the energy price crisis created by Russia’s war on Ukraine will lock some of the poorest, most climate-affected countries in the world in polluting fossil fuel projects with few economic or energy benefits for the communities whose land, water and heritage will be sacrificed.

It has been called out as “energy colonialism” – a political-corporate alliance on display at Cop27. There, more than 630 industry lobbyists are scattered around the conference centre in Sharm el-Sheikh as deals on climate finance, forests and food systems are being made.

It’s a huge, often insurmountable challenge for grassroots leaders from frontline communities to have their voices heard – let alone offer alternatives to the mostly market-based solutions being pushed.

But the climate justice movement’s message is clear: community-based renewable projects that work for the people, not corporations, are a necessity, according to Dipti Bhatnagar, from Friends of the Earth International in Mozambique. “It’s not just about the energy source, it’s about the whole energy system – who decides, who benefits and who profits.”

Across Africa, an estimated 600 million people still lack access to electricity – in large part because most fossil fuel investment is directed toward infrastructure for export rather than downstream power delivery to Africans. But there’s no guarantee that the transition to solar, wind, hydro and geothermal will be just, warns the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, which tracks abuses and conflicts linked to the green energy sector.

The Lake Turkana windfarm in northern Kenya is built on indigenous territory after 40,000 acres were handed over to a consortium of investors without consulting the Indigenous pastoral communities who have lived and farmed sustainably on the land for hundreds – if not thousands – of years. The wind project, the biggest in Africa, has caused forced migration, conflicts, gender-based violence, water and food insecurity as well as the disruption of cultural and language traditions due to the influx of construction workers.

Farmers have been forced to move further and further away with their goats, cows and camels in search of grazing lands and water, as the region faces the worst drought in decades.

“This is not just transition, this is land grabbing,” said John Tingoi, 47, from the Indigenous Movement for Peace Advancement and Conflict Transformation (Impact) in northern Kenya. “If you violate people’s basic rights and the communities have no benefits, it can never be just.”

Between 2015 and 2021, the Resource Centre recorded 369 attacks linked to renewable energy, including the murder of 98 land and environmental defenders. Most were related to dams, but violence and criminal persecution of activists linked to wind, solar and geothermal projects is rising rapidly.

None of the world’s 15 largest renewable energy companies have policies on respecting land rights despite wind and solar requiring substantial amounts of land; only a quarter have policies recognising the rights of Indigenous peoples.

“The renewable energy sector is at risk of replicating the abuses of the profit driven extractive model. If we’re talking about climate but not talking about inequality and human rights, then we’re not talking about a just and sustainable energy transition,” said Jessie Cato, natural resources programme manager at the Resource Centre.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. In Kenya, after years of campaigning by activists, new legislation in 2016 banned the sale or lease of communally owned land without the consultation and approval of the whole community, in an effort to stop corrupt land deals between investors and local leaders. The communities around Turkana are using the legislation to fight another land grab – of 110,000 acres this time – and so far the court has sided with them.

More than 80% of Kenya’s energy comes from renewables. Tingoni sees a shift in the way energy companies are doing business after a spate of legal battles, community blockades and cancellations.

“For a just transition there must be full transparency so that the community’s benefits reflect the profits,” added Vivian Silole, 29, the gender and resource manager from Impact.

Global greenhouse emissions rose by a staggering 1% last year, even though they need to be nosediving if we have any hope of averting complete catastrophe for the countries that have historically contributed least to the climate emergency.

But the transition to renewables is slowly taking shape. It is dominated by private investors at every part of the supply chain, due to a push by the US and other western economies at Cop27, which is being resisted by developing nations who face mounting debt to solve and adapt to a crisis that is not of their making.

“As we push for a rapid transition, we need think more critically about investment, regulation and ownership, so that energy is less extractive, companies are held accountable and communities benefit through co-ownership or community ownership,” said Thea Riofrancos, associate professor of political science at Providence College and an expert on resource extraction, renewable energy, climate change, and social movements.

The mining sector has an inglorious record of serious human rights violations: land grabs, water contamination, violence and criminalization. This pattern is unsurprisingly being repeated with transitional minerals required for electric vehicles and green technologies such as lithium, copper and cobalt.

The Resource Centre’s transition minerals tracker recorded 495 allegations of human rights abuses related to mineral extraction between 2010 and 2021. Water shortages and contamination were the most common environmental problems. Mining’s water-guzzling nature on top of increasingly intense droughts and erratic rain patterns make this a huge concern.

Lesley Muñoz Rivera, 26, belongs to the Colla Indigenous people from the Atacama in northern Chile, where her community is battling to stop lithium, gold, copper and silver from being mined from an expansive salt flat that they rely upon for water to farm and keep livestock. The communities which will be most affected by a likely shortage of water in this arid mountainous area were not consulted, and the project was suspended by the supreme court two years ago.

Munoz Rivera said: “We do not have alternative water sources, and the rain and snow have declined because of climate change. How can lithium be a just solution to climate change if it means sacrificing my community.”",The west’s ‘dash for gas’ in Africa is nothing more than energy colonialism,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/12/cop27-dash-for-gas-africa-energy-colonialism

We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.

It is obvious to anyone that the rising adoption of the electric vehicle is a trend not likely to wane any time soon. The EV is looking more like the future of personal transportation every day. While there are pros and cons to the proliferation of EVs, choosing to purchase one is a personal decision that everyone has to figure out for themselves ... for now. There is also much disinformation and bad advice going around for any used car. But for those who have already decided that obtaining an EV is right for them, there is a lot to consider. With manufacturers introducing new electric models every year, the options have become broad and varied, offering nearly everyone some model that will work for them. However, EVs are still expensive. Until the technology catches up and significantly lowers the cost, a used electric car is an option.

Since Tesla and others paved the way for broad acceptance of EVs and developed new technologies to make it possible to have an electric car capable enough for everyday use, the used market is good. The Nissan Leaf has been around for more than a decade and Hyundai/Kia and others have been selling EVs for several years now. Most people know what to look for in gas-powered cars, but may need help choosing a used EV. So, for anyone considering the purchase of a used electric car, here are 10 key questions to ask before buying a used one.",10 Key Questions When You're Buying A Used Electric Car,https://www.slashgear.com/1099174/key-questions-when-youre-buying-a-used-electric-car/
141,"After decades of success, the UK risks losing its car industry to more muscular rivals",electric vehicles,13/11/2022,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2022/11/11/TELEMMGLPICT000315906529_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,telegraph.co.uk,"“We recently launched our first home battery, and while we’re excited about the product, we would have preferred to source the battery cells from the UK if that had been an option,” he said.

He estimates that the UK can only produce 50,000 car batteries a year, not even a tenth of what will be needed.

Hawes at the SMMT argues that Britain’s automotive industry has “fundamental strengths” but that changes are needed to make sure it doesn’t fall prey to more agile rivals.

“It can, and will, build back,” he adds. “But the UK Government – like others with whom we compete – must take action to ensure the UK remains a competitive destination for inward investment.”

Extra checks on exports to the EU – the UK car industry’s biggest market – have inevitably added time and pressure.

The UK motor industry has a 0pc tariff deal with the EU, but there is still plenty of paperwork that was not there before the UK’s exit from the union, says Ian Foley, founder of electric bus maker Equipmake. These small differences can mean foreign investors are put off from the UK.

Cracking the gigafactory conundrum

Palmer, who is known as the “godfather of electric vehicles” because of his work launching Nissan’s electric Leaf, can vividly recall being awoken at 3am by former business secretary Lord Mandelson 12 years ago when he was still an executive based in Japan.

Nissan needed to decide where to situate a battery factory for the Leaf – then seen as an ambitious gamble – and Mandelson had caught wind that Palmer was set to choose Portugal over the UK.

“I hear you're going to make the decision to go to Portugal, I want you to change your mind,” the Labour minister told Palmer.

Palmer replied that the Portuguese had won fair and square, offering better incentives to the company, but Mandelson requested that he hold off 24 hours anyway.

“He then came back with the goods – and that is why the battery plant in Sunderland exists today,” Palmer says.

“And once you've got a factory, it's easier to expand it.”

Today, ministers need to be similarly proactive to ensure that Britain gets its share of the electric car market, he says.

“You look across the channel, and the EU has made battery manufacturing a project of strategic priority,” Palmer says.

“It’s a chicken and egg situation. For example, if I wanted to build a battery factory in the UK I probably want to secure Jaguar Land Rover as a customer.

“JLR probably also wants to be close to a battery manufacturer, otherwise it'll decide to go somewhere like Slovakia. That's where you need intervention.”

Palmer, who is chairman of battery producer InoBat, says his own company is currently choosing between Spain and the UK as possible sites for a gigafactory – but Madrid is working harder to woo him.

“From an emotional point of view, I'd love to see the UK win, but I have to represent my shareholders,” he says.

Foley agrees. “One thing that concerns me is if you look at the level of commitment from other countries, regions, to things like battery manufacturing, it's orders of magnitude larger than the UK,” he says.

If the Government will not shell out, some believe rules should be tweaked to allow pension funds to invest in the nascent sector. Even a tiny fraction of the £114.6bn squirrelled away by pension savers last year could make a difference, but current restrictions mean UK funds must be far more cautious than their US counterparts.

“Fundamentally, in the UK, the people who run investment funds are more conservative than in America,” Foley says.

If the UK can crack the gigafactory conundrum, it can harness the great strengths already here.

“The UK is known for having outstanding creativity and innovation,” says Hayaatun Sillemchief, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

Industry figures say this is borne out by the wealth of motorsport companies based here, such as McLaren, Williams, Aston Martin, as well as the racing teams for Mercedes, Alpine and Haas.

But, Sillem adds, the country must get better at taking that innovation and successfully commercialising it into businesses that generate manufacturing, jobs and wealth. She too cites the shyness of investment money and the lack of government help as problems holding back the industry.

“We do need to have that clear partnership between government and business,” she says.

Palmer says Britain still has a chance at turning things around, but adds: “If I’m being honest we’re arriving very late to the party. We’d better get a move on if we think we're going to save the car industry.”

After his 150th phone call, Britishvolt’s Rolton managed to secure a last-minute lifeline for his company from Glencore, the mining and commodities giant.

The cash injection - which is being accompanied by cost-saving measures such as voluntary pay cuts pledged by staff - will keep the business going for now. In the end, Rolton says, either his business succeeds or another one must if the British car industry is to survive.

“Batteries come to cars or cars go to batteries,” Rolton says. “We still don't quite seem to grasp that yet.”

For now, Britisvolt’s dream of powering the electric car revolution is operating on borrowed time. Like the UK’s car industry at large, time is running out to save it.

A government spokesman said: “The UK is one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing and we remain dedicated to securing gigafactories across the country.

“Our success is evidenced by the huge recent investment by Nissan in their new Sunderland site, and we will build on this through a major investment programme to electrify our supply chain and create jobs.

“Support for Britishvolt through the Automotive Transformation Fund was always dependent on the company meeting certain pre-agreed milestones in order to protect taxpayer money.”

As for Thatcher in the 1970s, the task of balancing taxpayer exposure with protecting a vital industry is a challenging one.

To get started, Indonesia Battery Corporation plans to produce 50,000 battery packs for two-wheelers next year, President Director Toto Nugroho said in an interview on the sidelines of the BloombergNEF Summit on Saturday. The prototype already has safety accreditations and output is ready to begin.

“It’s a very good market, and it would be good for our environment to reduce emissions and cut imports of fuels so we will work on that first,” he said.

IBC was formed in 2021 to realize President Joko Widodo’s ambition to have an end-to-end EV supply chain -- from nickel ores to locally made electric cars. The government is under increased pressure to cut oil imports after the soaring global cost of crude forced it to hike gasoline prices, a move that sparked protests and weakened support for Jokowi, as the president is known.

Only 21,000 motorbikes in Indonesia are electric, which means many of their riders had to contend with higher fuel costs.

The government aims to boost domestic use of electric vehicles to 2 million units in 2025, and there are plans to offer an incentive of 7.5 million rupiah ($484) for consumers to swap gas-guzzling motorbikes for electric ones.

Local Minerals

In the next five years, IBC will produce battery materials and cells while recycling used batteries in a project with partners LG Energy Solution and China’s CATL, Nugroho said. The plant will use renewable energy and comply with global standards so it can export products to US and European markets.

Story continues

Antam, one of IBC’s parent companies, will form a joint venture to mine battery materials in the eastern island of Halmahera. IBC is researching how to make batteries using only local natural resources.

“We want to make sure the battery we produce here will not be dependent on imported minerals like lithium, graphite and cobalt,” Nugroho said. “We want a battery that doesn’t use those minerals.”

Lior Tal

Thank you, Carolyne. Good afternoon, everyone. Toward the end of the third quarter ending November, we announced several major developments that brought us further ahead of our go-to-market time line since becoming a public company and closer to scale commercialization of our software offering. The first key development was the signing of a multiphase contract with a significant new customer that has chosen Cyngn as its technology partner to apply DriveMod to electric forklift. The electric forklift will be the customer's first autonomous vehicle as it embarks on its electrification and automation strategy. This partnership marks Cyngn's expansion of DriveMod to its second vehicle platform that is geared towards commercialization.

We're excited to have the opportunity to work with this customer, a multimillion dollar global manufacturer, a variety of building materials used in commercial and residential properties. We work closely with the customers' team to understand the operation, which will allow us to apply our Enterprise Autonomy Suite to create differentiated value propositions for their business.

The second major development was our contracting with a U.S.-based manufacturer that will allow us to scale the production of DriveMod Kits more quickly for autonomous stockchasers, putting the kits in the hands of customers at lower cost. This represents a significant opportunity for Cyngn as we look to leverage DriveMod Kit's ease of installation and scale deployment for a larger base customer and vehicle fit. The ability to retrofit vehicles and operate heterogeneous fleets continues to be a key differentiator of Cyngn versus other companies, and we look forward to additional future opportunities to prove our unique AV technology value proposition to customers.

In October, we announced a contract with HEVI, a manufacturer of electric industrial vehicle under Greenland Holding Corporation, whereby Cyngn will be the exclusive supplier of vehicle tracking systems to HEVI. Our asset tracking device, Infinitracker, will be installed on each purchased heavy vehicle as a value-added item to their customers. We are pleased to be recognized by this industry incumbent for the value brought by key features offered by Infinitracker, such as location tracking using cell tower triangulation and extra long battery life. This contract serves as a validation of the value of Infinitracker and location data for the Cyngn EAS offer.

Through focus on efficient execution and despite the difficult macroeconomic circumstances, we surpassed some of the major milestones for 2022 that we had set forth for Cyngn a year ago when we went public. Our original goal for this year, as communicated with investors during the IPO, was to deploy EAS at a single customer site with 1 vehicle type. We have executed multiple data deployment at multiple sites and has begun expanding DriveMod to our second vehicle type.

In addition, we have made significant progress in recruiting and are close to having the team we need to get us to commercialization at scale. That being said, we do expect to make a few key personal hires in the coming months. From an operational perspective, we recently completed the expansion of our Menlo Park headquarters, which includes an autonomous vehicle development and test facility. We're excited by our achievements this year and look forward to closing out 2022 on a strong note. And with that, I'll turn it over to Don to review our financial results.

Donald Alvarez

Thanks, Lior. I'll quickly go over the financial highlights for the third quarter and 9 months ended September 30, 2022, covering both R&D and G&A expenses, which make up our total OpEx. Additional details can be found in our financial press release that was issued earlier today as well as in the Form 10-Q, which we anticipate filing with the SEC this week.

Total operating expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022 were $5.3 million compared to $2.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $1.6 million increase in R&D expenses related to noncash stock-based compensation, costs incurred for additional engineering staff and contractors, allocated occupancy costs and R&D-related travel costs. We expect these costs to continue to increase as we continue to invest in building our engineering team to further our R&D efforts.

G&A expense also increased by $1.6 million which was largely related to increased noncash stock-based compensation, expenses incurred for additional personnel and professional services to support our status as a public company. We reported a net loss of $5.3 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to a net loss of $2.1 million in the prior year quarter as a result of the increased total expenditures.

Net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis was $0.16 based on approximately 33.6 million weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. This compares to a net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis of $2.17 based on approximately 1 million weighted average shares outstanding in the prior year quarter. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, total operating expenses were $13.7 million compared to $5.8 million in the prior year period. This was due to a $3.7 million increase in R&D expense and a $4.2 million increase in G&A expense.

Net loss was $13.7 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2022 compared to a net loss of $5.7 million in the prior year period. Net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis was $0.45, based on approximately 30.4 million weighted average outstanding, compared to net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis of $5.94 based on approximately 1 million weighted average shares outstanding in the prior year period.

Turning to the balance sheet. We had $27.7 million in cash and short-term investments at September 30, 2022, which compares to $22 million at the end of 2021. Our working capital was $27.3 million compared to $22.1 million at the end of 2021, and total stockholders' equity was $28.8 million compared to $22.2 million at December 31, 2021. I'd now like to turn it back over to Lior. Lior?

Lior Tal

Thank you, Don. It has been a very exciting year for Cyngn so far. We're in a unique position in the industrial autonomy space and are working hard to be the first company to reach scale commercialization with our AV technology. The recent developments we announced are setting the stage for an eventful 2023 and beyond. And we look forward to continuing to work closely with our partners and customers, expanding and leveraging these relationships to get us recurring revenue streams via Software-as-a-Service, robotics-as-a-service model and commercialization at scale. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions and answers.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Theodore O'Neill with Litchfield Research.

Theodore O'Neill

I was wondering, in your prepared remarks here at the beginning, you cited 3 important recent developments in terms of the electric forklift market and scaling production of the DriveMod and the contract with HEVI. And I was wondering if you could give us any milestones that we could look forward to related to these contracts either in the phases they're going through or what other monetary aspects of it or production aspects that we might expect to see over the next 12 months.

Lior Tal

This is Lior. So the 3 are sort of separate topics. With regards to EAS DriveMod, as it's applied to Columbia Stockchasers, the focus so far has been the end-to-end go-to-market in taking the technology with our partners to the hands of the customers and be able to support them throughout the deployment. We actually accelerated the time line and took on several additions to the original one we were planning in order to explore the applicability of these stockchasers to different applications. And we had the opportunity to deploy them in the 3PL facility but also in manufacturing sites.

The next with these are to look at slightly larger deployments and start moving some of those to commercial contract beyond the initial pilot. So that's on the stockchaser application. The HEVI is the first distribution of Infinitracker through a partner distribution channel. So HEVI vehicles are going to come off the factory with the Infinitracker attached. At the beginning, it's going to be a few dozen trackers that's going to expand over time as HEVI starts selling those services to their customers, and we're working on additional channels and direct B2B sales at the company. Anything else that -- to your question?

Theodore O'Neill

What about the forklift side?

Lior Tal

Yes. Okay. It's a good question. So the electric forklift is something that's really ahead of its time in the sense that our plan was really to move forward with the stockchasers and get them to commercial deployment before taking on a second vehicle. However, the specific company presents a very interesting opportunity for us. This project is more an NRE project. This is a bring up of a new vehicle that's specifically needed for their purposes. And once we've completed successfully the R&D, the pilot phase, improve the applicability of DriveMod and EAS over forklift to the operation, then we will discuss continued commercial engagement. So at the moment, we're going to keep the disclosure to what was already published. And once we start clearing more of these milestones, we're going to go back and update on the status of that project.

Theodore O'Neill

Okay. And I was under the impression on the Q2 call that there had been a large increase in R&D employees and I sort of expected that number to go up significantly in the operating expense Q2 to Q3, which it didn't really change very much. Is there any expectation that this number is going to grow significantly before the end of the year, the R&D expense?

Donald Alvarez

Theo, this is Don. The thing is that our R&D expenses will continue to increase, but they will not increase as dramatically as they did between Q1 and Q2. But we definitely anticipate it's going up. And I think that we had a couple of specific positions that are fairly high paying that we had planned for Q3 that did not materialize and will probably split into Q4, maybe even Q1, and that might be a good thing actually, given the market.

Operator

Our next question is from Rommel Dionisio with Aegis Capital.

Rommel Dionisio

Sort of a question on labor R&D, which Don, you just touched on. Obviously, we're seeing pretty big headlines about significant layoffs in the tech sector. Is that any -- providing any sort of ease to the labor cost pressure that you've seen here in that market for the last couple of years? Or is it maybe too early to tell that just yet?

Lior Tal

So it definitely creates a flood of candidates that are relevant to us, especially companies that have people that are experienced in developing AI and people that have worked on robotics and on self-driving. However, it's going to probably take a quarter or 2 until there's really going to be a change in compensation and compensation structure. Immediately, what we're already seeing is a bigger floor of candidate and much easier ability to be selective and hire the right people we need.

So we're already starting to see the benefits of that, but I think the real impact is going to take some time. And of course, as Don said, we're aware to the environment. We're trying to be conservative as much as we can and not in a position like other companies that we will need to consider layoffs later. So we rather slow down recruiting and really bringing the critical roles, and then grow the function of commercial traction as we start seeing customers come in and revenues grow.

Rommel Dionisio

Okay. And maybe just a follow up, if I could. I think you touched on this in the comments, Lior, but the -- you've obviously had some very strong initial success signs, some pretty meaningful customers right off the bat, maybe the initial product here, there. But I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about the opportunity of bringing them into your ecosystem, bringing them with 1 product line with this DriveMod and the forklift. But obviously, that's a $5 billion company. I mean, obviously, there's significant opportunities just with that 1 client alone and with others. I wonder if you could just talk about the evolution of getting on to the customer, but also just building with them over time once they're in your ecosystem.

Lior Tal

Okay. Let me hand this over to Ben, who can answer that.

Ben Landen

Rommel, yes, that's a great question. There's only so much that I can disclose given the early stages. But what you're alluding to is exactly what we have preached about the vehicle-agnostic approach that we have. So we alluded to electric forklifts being the first and most prominent of vehicles that this customer wants to automate and electrify in their new rollout of an automated and electric vehicle strategy. And it is representative though of what we have been preaching, which is that electric forklifts are not the only vehicles in their fleet.

So we do really see it as a first opportunity for meaningful success out of the gates with the most impactful vehicle in the electric forklift. And part of the reason for our selection and what we see as really the long-term vision that grows this from being a customer for a vehicle is that it really does ultimately grow into this being then repeated across other vehicle form factors within their global fleet, which is a substantial vehicle fleet and growing that footprint within the customer and bringing to fruition that sensibility that we have been touting about the way that we've built the technology, which is that automating that second vehicle, that third vehicle becomes a de facto solution with Cyngn as opposed to with a different automation supplier. So it is -- it really is that first meaningful step in what we see being, as long as we continue to be successful, a larger rollout into multiple vehicles with a very meaningful customer.

Rommel Dionisio

And then, just following up on that, to what extent then does that become -- to the extent that you can successfully do that become a barrier to entry with that customer as well as most many others?

Ben Landen

Do you mean for our competitors?

Rommel Dionisio

The competitors, obviously. Right, right, exactly. Yes.

Ben Landen

That is our expectation that once we understand the customer's operation, we've done a first vehicle for them, our marginal costs for rolling out additional vehicles beyond that reduce, whereas the -- any new competitor that would come and try to bid to automate those types of vehicles would incur marginal costs that are higher that we already incurred and are in the process of reducing. So we're seeing firsthand that this strategy that we have been pitching about the ability to automate different types of vehicle form factors by being more software-centric, by being a more software-defined vehicle and vehicle agnostic is really coming to fruition and getting us the most difficult selection of winning that first vehicle and winning the next one becomes iteratively and incrementally easier and easier for us, which means on the flip side, trying to capture those becomes more and more difficult for our competitors.

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from [indiscernible].

Unidentified Analyst

First of all, congratulations on a successful quarter. I'm really happy to see you following through on your plan. The question that I have is in regards to Infinitracker. So right now, it seems like you're doing like in-house sales and you have partnerships with HEVI, et cetera. Have you thought about reaching out to perhaps some MVNOs or maybe primary service providers or -- in general, other sort of providers who already have their own sales teams?

I'm sort of asking, like, could you outsource all that sales and maybe accelerate that revenue generation? And then maybe just to broaden the question to the SaaS space and what you're doing with RaaS and SaaS maybe that as well, like do a lot of SaaS companies, the first $1 million, $2 million, $5 million is very difficult. So maybe just to jump-start that revenue growth, I think you got my question.

Ben Landen

Yes. The simple answer is yes. We are doing a combination of traditional B2B sales, if you will, that is in-house, but we are also looking for leveraged opportunities, whether it be through different distribution channels, value-add resellers that go and allow us to lean on other sales team and other channels that go beyond our own organic efforts and spend in order to grow the reach of Infinitracker. And Infinitracker very much does target an onboarding and familiarization with our tools and by extension and earlier introduction of revenues than the EAS product, which is a larger ticket price, but enough in a longer sales cycle. So Infinitracker certainly does try to create sort of a springboard in that regard, both from a revenue and from a customer engagement and onboarding perspective.

Unidentified Analyst

I appreciate that. And maybe I should just like ask, have you actually reached out -- Verizon obviously doesn't deal with this, but there are service providers that deal in industrial and in that space in the U.S. and internationally. What about reaching out to them directly because you have like -- I mean, 15-year battery life, I'm not going to go through all the specs, but I think you fare very competitively against your competitors. So what about that?

Ben Landen

Yes. Again, the simple answer is yes. We do see the telecoms providers as one of the most meaningful partner opportunities for Infinitracker. And it's one that certainly is in our consideration.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Lior Tal for closing comments.

Lior Tal

According to the company, to achieve this, Volvo will divest 33% of the shares of Aurobay. This is a joint venture with Geely Holding. With this, it will completely withdraw from participation in the development and manufacture of internal combustion engines. The move represents Volvo as the first automaker to completely withdraw from the development and manufacture of internal combustion engines. Volvo claims that by 2025, 50% of its global sales will be pure electric vehicles. The other 50% will be hybrid vehicles. Also, by 2030, the brand will fully switch to the production of pure electric vehicles.

At the moment, electric cars are quite expensive. The pandemic and shortage of chips are some of the reasons for the high prices. Also, the high cost of lithium batteries and high gasoline price increases the demand for electric vehicles. This high demand makes it difficult for electric cars to cut prices.

Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

Electric cars prices keep rising

The prices of some lithium battery materials are rising. Battery-grade lithium carbonate increased by 2,500 yuan ($352)/ton. It has an average price of 590,000 yuan ($83,000)/ton. Also, industrial-grade lithium carbonate increased by 2,500 yuan ($352)/ton. It has an average price of 577,500 yuan ($81,250). These materials continue to hit new record highs.

In this regard, Volvo CEO, Jim Rowan reveals some of the company’s plans. He claims that by 2025, its electric vehicles will be as cheap as gasoline vehicles. He believes that there will be enough technology to reduce battery costs. Rowan claims new technologies will increase range. They will also enable a longer range with smaller batteries while bringing lower costs. Rowan also notes that automakers shouldn’t rely on government subsidies. They must figure out a way to produce EVs “that people want and can afford”. Volvo has a new EX90 three-row, seven-seat mid-size electric SUV.

Next month, it will reveal the all-electric Concept EQT Marco Polo camper, sliding the Marco Polo nameplate down to its smallest van series and creating the first electric Marco Polo to boot. The concept will be a near-production preview of a factory EQT camper van slated to officially join the Marco Polo family in 2023 alongside a soon-to-be-available micro-Marco camper-in-a-box kit. So Mercedes will jump into the smallest segment of the camper van market with both feet, serving up ultra-efficient micro-camping in multiple multifunctional forms.

Mercedes has been building up toward a small van-based Marco Polo micro-camper for years, showing a simple concept camper based on the first-generation Citan back in 2016. It touched upon the possibility again when it teased upcoming motorhome and van plans in early 2021 and followed up later that year by showing the new Citan as a micro-camper at the 2021 Düsseldorf Caravan Salon, just days after the van’s reveal. It highlighted a second Citan camper at the Swiss Caravan Salon two months later.

At this year’s Caravan Salon, Mercedes brought a T-Class passenger van with an all-new Marco Polo Module scheduled to launch by the end of the year. And soon it will make a full-blown factory camper van out of the all-electric EQT, adding a small van to the renowned Marco Polo family of luxurious camper vans currently based solely on midsize V-Class and Vito vans.

Instead of a single micro-camper, we get an instant T-camper family. Each version will be designed to serve as both an everyday passenger vehicle and a recreational tiny camper, with only a relatively quick, simple and painless process separating one form from the other. The cost-efficient multipurpose vehicles will then serve as a gateway into the Mercedes brand, and in the case of the EQT models, into the EQ family of electrics.

You might have mistaken the photo that tops the article as a first look at the Concept EQT Marco Polo. We did, right up until we zoomed in on the sign to the left, which helps clear up that the van is a standard V-Class Marco Polo waiting for its little brother to come and pitch camp in the campsite next door. Besides leaving out a legit teaser photo, Mercedes hasn’t offered any information as to how the Concept EQT Marco Polo will be laid out. So we don’t know a whole lot about it just yet.

It is worth noting that all members of the current Marco Polo family have pop-up sleeper roofs, and the Marco Polo pictured in the photo up top has its roof proudly popped. Hopefully, the EQT will follow in that pop-up roof tradition, allowing for plenty of headroom and sleeping space for four+ people. A pop-top would help distinguish the factory camper van from the Marco Polo Module setup, which packs an indoor bed and available outdoor kitchen below the factory hard roof.

It also remains to be seen if Mercedes will attempt to fit any type of kitchen into the EQT camper van, be it a slide-out exterior unit or an interior setup, or if it makes the EQT Marco Polo a simpler sleeper van in line with the Marco Polo Activity and Horizon. A basic sleeper layout might work better within the small van’s dimensions, but it’s certainly not impossible to squeeze some form of kitchen into a compact van, as the Marco Polo Module and latest Volkswagen Caddy camper both prove.

The Marco Polo Module, which will fit the EQT as well as the ICE T-Class, is a tall trunk-mounted camper box manufactured by Brabus. As shown in Düsseldorf, the box has Brabus’ signature all-black look, complete with Mercedes-Benz three-pointed star badging.

The basic Module kit includes a sliding bed frame that packs behind the rear seats during the ride and extends forward over top the folded seats at camp. It creates a 79 x 45-in (200 x 115-cm) bed complete with an elastic-disc spring platform and 3.9-in (10-cm) fold-out mattress.

The Marco Polo Module also comes standard with black-out window blinds, a ventilation screen with insect mesh, and hanging interior organizers. The slide-out kitchen is available optionally and packages together a series of soft-close drawers housing a simple sink plumbed to a 12-L water canister, a 15-L fridge box and a portable single-burner gas stove. The kitchen package also includes drawer space for utensils and cookware and a matching indoor/outdoor table and two-chair set. Mercedes plans to put the Marco Polo Module up for order before year’s end and said in Düsseldorf it would release pricing at order launch. If that doesn’t happen before the Concept EQT Marco Polo debut, we suspect it will happen during. Unlike the T-Class, which went on sale in May, the EQT van is still under development so we do not know the final specs. In fact, Mercedes did not even hint at preliminary powertrain or performance numbers during the Concept EQT’s 2021 premiere. All we do know is that the concept had a seven-seat layout within a 195-in-long (495-cm) footprint. Expect Mercedes to shine some light on additional EQT details during the Concept EQT Marco Polo premiere. Mercedes will hold the Concept EQT Marco Polo debut on Friday, December 2 ahead of a planned production debut in the second half of 2023. We’ll publish more details once they’re available.

Conference Call Participants

Operator

Thank you very much for attending. This is Honda Motor Company FY '23 Second Quarter Financial Results Announcement Meeting.

First, I'd like to introduce the executives represented Director, Executive Vice President and Representative Executive Officer, CFO, Kohei Takeuchi.

Kohei Takeuchi

This is Takeuchi speaking. Thank you.

Operator

Operating Executive and Head of Accounting, Finance, Supervisory Unit, Eiji Fujimura.

Eiji Fujimura

How do you do? I am Fujimura.

Operator

Would like to ask Kohei Takeuchi to first announce the FY '23 second quarter financial results and FY '23 forecast followed by Fujimura, who will give the details on the above. Mr. Takeuchi, the floor is yours.

Kohei Takeuchi

First of all, I'd like to thank all of you for your support towards Honda products and activities. I'd like to thank our customers and all stakeholders. Thank you. We apologize that the delay in vehicle production is causing inconvenience to our customers who are waiting these products. We are working hard to deliver our products as soon as possible. We hope to gain your understanding.

Now to explain the financial results for the second quarter of FY '23 and give a summary of the forecast for the fiscal year. First, FY '23 results. Amidst a difficult business environment, including the semiconductor shortage, driving down automotive production and unit sales combined with soaring raw material prices, Honda has been making company-wide efforts to improve profitability. In addition, the increase in motorcycle unit sales and the impact of yen depreciation and sales revenue and operating profit for the first six months have increased year-on-year.

In the second quarter, specific semiconductor shortage affected production of main models, mainly in North America. But we made worldwide production allocations, utilized substitute parts and replaced models sold, resulting in a year-on-year increase in group unit sales of automobiles.

In addition, sales revenue, operating profit and profit for the period of -- all increased year-on-year due to price increases commensurate with improved product value and strong Motorcycle business impact of the yen's depreciation. In the FY '23 forecast, group unit sales of automobiles is lowered by 100,000 units to 4.1 million units, taking into account the impact of semiconductor supply shortages.

In addition to the decline in unit sales, we expect to see continued inflationary pressure on costs. However, we have revised upward our previous forecast for sales revenue, operating profit and profit for the period, reflecting profitability improvement efforts, motorcycle unit sales increase and recent weak yen. Despite the challenging business environment, Honda will continue to accelerate initiatives for electrification and new growth in preparation for the future.

Next, the status of our Automobile business in major markets. First half sales decreased from the same period year-on-year due to semiconductor supply shortages and others despite the positive effect of new model launches.

In the second quarter, sales in Japan and China increased year-on-year. But in the U.S., shortage of certain semiconductors drove down production of mainstay models and inventories at dealers. Although demand is expected to be firm, we have revised downward our previous forecast for FY '23.

In the second quarter, Honda announced its initiatives for electrification. In the U.S., Honda has agreed with LG Energy Solutions to establish a joint venture to produce EV batteries and to manufacture them in the State of Ohio. Honda has also decided to evolve the three existing plants in Ohio as home to EV production in North America.

In China, Honda has established a new JV with Dongfeng Motor Group and also Guangzhou Automobile Group to procure EV batteries. In addition, we signed an MOU with CATL to further strengthen our partnership, aiming to establish a long-term stable procurement system in China and further enhance our competitiveness. Honda will continue to accelerate its efforts towards electrification.

Next, the Motorcycle business status. Although there were some effects of semiconductor supply shortages, sales in many countries were higher than in the same period of the previous year due to replacement of models sold and the use of substitute parts, et cetera.

In Vietnam, we recorded record high sales for the month of September. Although sales in Pakistan affected by flooding as well as China and other countries dropped, sales in India, Vietnam and other countries were strong, leading to an upward revision of the previous forecast for consolidated FY '23 unit sales. In September, Honda announced its launch -- it will launch more than 10 electric motorcycle models globally by 2025 and 3.5 million unit sales by 2030 to achieve carbon neutrality.

Here is an overview of the first half of FY '23. And despite a decrease in automobile production and unit sales due to semiconductor shortages and rising raw material prices, operating profit increased ¥11.2 billion, reaching ¥453.4 billion due to price increases commensurate with enhanced product value and reduced incentives as well as increased motorcycle unit sales and currency impact.

Earnings per share attributable to owners of the parent was ¥338.5 billion mainly attributable to share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method of Japanese affiliates. The table shows unit sales and profit and loss.

Next, consolidated FY '23 forecast. Although we expect to see continued pressure on costs in addition to the impact of lower automobile unit sales, we revised upwards the forecast operating income by ¥40 billion to ¥870 billion, reflecting further efforts to improve profitability, including higher motorcycle unit sales in India, Vietnam as well as other countries and currency impact.

Earnings per share attributable to owners of the parent is revised upward by ¥15 billion to ¥725 billion. Exchange rate assumptions are ¥135 and to the dollar for the second half, ¥135 to the dollar for the full year. Unit sales and profit/loss are shown in the table. As for dividends, interim dividend is ¥60 per share.

The annual dividend forecast remains unchanged and is ¥120 per share. Honda will continue to strive for stable and sustainable dividend payments, aiming for a consolidated dividend payout ratio of 30%. Regarding share buyback announced on August 10, as of October 31, the total number of shares repurchased was 50.33 million shares at a total cost of ¥53 billion.

Fujimura, Operating Executive and Head of Accounting of Finance Supervisory Unit, will give the details.

Eiji Fujimura

Let me explain. Honda Group's cumulative unit sales until the second quarter FY 2023 were as follows. Motorcycle business is 9.202 million units sold mainly with the incremental sales in Asian countries year-on-year. And Automobile business is 1.785 million units due to the decline in sales in North America. And Power Products businesses, it was 2.935 million units due to a decline in North America.

Next, let me explain factors behind ups and downs of the profit before income tax for the first two quarters year-on-year. The profit before taxes were ¥515.8 billion, ¥44.5 billion decline year-on-year. Operating profit was ¥453.4 billion, up by ¥11.2 billion year-on-year.

Excluding factors of foreign currency impact, the profit was practically negative by ¥141.9 billion. The breakdowns are as follows. Regarding the impact of sales, profit declined by ¥100.1 billion due to reduction in unit sales, changes in model mix and profit decline in financial businesses.

Regarding impact of retail prices and costs, there were impacts by soaring raw materials prices and product pricing, reflecting product value improvement. However, the profit increased by ¥8.2 billion. Regarding miscellaneous expenses, profit declined by ¥41.9 billion due to quality related cost. Regarding research and development expenditures, profit declined by ¥8.2 billion.

In terms of sales revenues and operating profits in each of the business categories, operating profit in Motorcycle business was at ¥224.7 billion. And of Automotive businesses, OP was at ¥63.5 billion, and of our Financial Services businesses, it was ¥153 billion.

Out of the Automobile and the Financial Service businesses combined, the operating profit associated with automobile sales is estimated to be ¥211.3 billion when aggregated together. Next, operating profit of the Power Products and Other businesses was ¥12 billion, which includes operating losses of aircraft and aircraft engine businesses being ¥12 billion. Next, I will explain about our cash flow situations. Free cash flow of the non-Financial Services businesses was 153.3 billion. Net cash at the end of the second quarter was ¥2,560.9 billion.

Let me talk about our forecast of consolidated business performance for FY 2023. With regard to the Honda Group's unit sales in the Motorcycle business as compared to the previous forecast, the expected unit sales will be 18.43 million mainly reflecting the flood in Pakistan and the demand decline in China and so on. When consolidated, we expect unit sales to be 12.02 million units, up by 360,000 units, reflecting a good sales performance in countries such as India and Vietnam.

Unit sales expected in our Automobile business would be 4.1 million mainly reflecting a decline in North America. For Power Products businesses, we maintained the previous forecast of 5.556 million units.

Next, I'll explain factors behind our [indiscernible] of profit before income tax as compared to the results from last year. We expect the profit before tax to be ¥1,080 billion, up by ¥9.8 billion year-on-year and operating profit to be around the same level from the results of the last fiscal year. Excluding foreign currency impacts, we expect a negative profit of ¥287.2 billion, of which the breakdowns are as follows.

For the impact of the sales, our profit will be increasing by ¥41.8 billion due to unit sales increase of motorcycles and automobiles. Regarding retail price and cost impact, profit declined by ¥110 billion due to soaring raw materials prices and so on.

Regarding miscellaneous expenses area, our profit would decline by ¥152 billion due to incremental sales and quality-related costs. For research and development expenditures category, we expect the profit to drop by ¥67 billion.

Comparing our new expectations to the previous forecast, the differences as well as profit before income taxes will be up revised by ¥40 billion, operating profit to be up revised by ¥40 billion. Excluding foreign currency impact, we expect a negative profit of ¥80 billion for which breakdowns are: regarding the sales impact, down by ¥128 billion mainly due to unit sales decline in automobiles.

And in the area of the retail pricing cost impact, although some cost increase is expected due to inflation impact, we will manage price -- pricing practices to reflect enhanced product values to add profits by ¥36 billion. Regarding research and development expenditures, we expect the profit to go up by ¥16 billion.

Finally, for CapEx, depreciation and amortization as well as R&D spending for FY 2023, we revised the previous expectations to reflect the currency impact. That concludes my explanation. Thank you very much.

Kohei Takeuchi

Thank you very much. Thank you for your attention. And now I would like to proceed to Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'd like to go to [indiscernible], please.

Unidentified Analyst

My name is [indiscernible] from Nikkan Jidosha Shimbun newspaper. Can you hear me?

Kohei Takeuchi

Yes.

Unidentified Analyst

I have two questions. First, currently we're seeing a depreciation of the yen, and this has boosted your profit. But can -- in order to maximize your benefit when it comes to production and procurement, what kind of ideas will come up when Honda localizes its production? But are you making any changes to your approach?

The second question, worldwide, there is a concern of a recession at your major markets, U.S. and China. How do you see the prospect of the economy?

Kohei Takeuchi

Mr. [indiscernible], so first of all, in regards to your exchange rate question, well as you rightly mentioned, we have the policy of producing where the demand exists. This is our basic policy. That is how we have set up our production sites.

And so it's locally produced and locally consumed, meaning that we are -- of course, given the major fluctuation in the currency rate, it does have an impact to a certain extent. But compared to other manufacturers exporting from Japan, compared to those manufacturers, I don't think that our impact is that big.

But, having said that, still, to explain the currency impact, the U.S.-denominated only, if there's ¥1, there is a difference of the current situation, there is a swing of 10 billion, used to be 12 billion, but it's now 10 billion of which half is the export of components or the loyalty received from overseas? So it's mainly cash flow. And also, we generate profit overseas, and we convert this into Japanese yen. In that conversion, we have half of the difference. So that is the impact of currency.

But as for the yearly forecast, we are estimating now ¥135 against the dollar. And so this would be an impact of ¥120 billion in profit. But still, the supply chain. We have suppliers and others relationship. So it's not the case that we can immediately shift our production to Japan.

Basic philosophy is to produce where the demand exists will remain in place. That's in regards to your currency question. And about the U.S. and China's economy, well, the midterm election is -- the vote count is underway right now in the United States. Given the 8% inflation continuing towards the end of the year, as everyone says, there is likely to be an impact on the economy. So we also share that concern.

But if we look at the current situation, our car supply for certain models due to the shortage of semiconductors, we have lost some unit sales, but customers are waiting for our products. So looking at the current situation in regards to our customers, we believe that the cars we produce will be purchased by our customers.

But economically, as is being said, there is the interest rate increase, the inflation occurring. And therefore, there will be some impact to a certain extent. And keeping this in mind, we will continue with our operation.

Likewise, in China, the Chinese GDP compared to a few years ago is declining. But automobiles annually, the passenger car is about 23 million units per annum, in line with that, especially the market electrification. Last month also -- this month, we see 20% or 19% ratio. And therefore, we have this electric -- EV car on the market, and the first one. And we've announced a second. We are focused on electrification, and we want to meet our customers' demands also in China. And this is how we want to market our products in China. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you very much Mr. [indiscernible] So next question, Yomiuri Newspaper, Nakamura, please.

Unidentified Analyst

Nakamura from Yomiuri Shimbun Newspaper. Can you hear me? Two questions. First of all, sales. The price increases are in overseas and also potential price increases in Japan, please share with me the potential. And Japan and Southeast Asia markets are good, and what is reason behind? And how long do you think it would continue on going forward, the Motorcycle business?

Kohei Takeuchi

So thank you for your question, pricing, retail price situations and the pricing reflecting the product values. That's how we call it. And in the U.S., including the inflation situations, we are repricing that to reflect our values of the product.

Of course, raw materials prices soaring, and also safety equipment's are rearranged as well. So including all that, people buy the products. And in the U.S., the stock level is quite low. Including that situation, we try to price the product in an appropriate level for them to buy.

And in Japan, when we have such a soaring raw material prices, of course, that has impact on the revenue. However, we also have a sort of relationship with like competitors, the peer companies in the semi industries. We will look at how they are reacting and then if necessary, we would do repricing, increasing the prices. But at this moment in Japan, we do not have specific information as of today.

And as for the motorcycle situations, thankfully, in the second quarter, the Motorcycle business performance was very good. Specifically, the best area is our Asian markets, specifically Vietnam, Thailand, number of the units sold was very good, which gave us additional revenue.

And how long will that continue? Well, as of now, without any economic or turmoil's or the kind for this term, Thai and the Vietnamese market will continue as it is perhaps -- and also for the Motorcycle businesses, we have an EV, electrification plans for India and the countries toward -- excuse me, in Indonesia from 2030 and '35. And including that, we will try to come up with the appropriate pricing and so forth for the electrification plans with motorcycle. Thank you.

Operator

Next question. Nikkei. Mr. Tanabe, please?

Unidentified Analyst

Can you hear me?

Kohei Takeuchi

Yes.

Unidentified Analyst

Well, about automobile, about the unit sales past forecast. In North America, you said that it's been reduced. Well, I think there might be some differences in the unit semiconductor shortage depending on the region. So what about Japan and North America and Asia? Can you give some regional differences? And do you think that this is likely to continue? What is likely to happen in the next fiscal year? That's the first question.

The second question is about the way of thinking towards the exchange rate. Well, it's contributed to the profit to quite an extent. But if this continues longer, I think there might be some challenges ahead. So can you candidly share with us how you assess the currency forecast?

Kohei Takeuchi

Thank you very much, Tanabe-san. First, about the units, the automobile units. And due to the shortage of semiconductors, we have downward revised by 100,000 units, U.S. And we are trying to catch up here in Japan and Asia. But it's a 100,000-unit downward revision. As I already explained earlier, it is a specific type of semiconductor that has this issue with semiconductor. And it has an impact on our CR-V, Civic. And so for these specific models, we have seen this impact of the shortage.

And this, the second quarter, this was the situation. And in North America in the second half of the year, we think that it will be difficult to increase the production. And therefore, it's difficult for us to catch up. And this is the downward revision for U.S. What about China? When it comes to China, naturally, in the first half, there was an impact. But in the second half, the production system is such that we think that we can catch up. And therefore, we think we can catch up.

Meanwhile, Asia. You mentioned about Asia, Indonesia, et cetera, the numbers are growing. And therefore, as I said, it's not -- well, the cars in Asia are relatively small. So with the smaller cars, there are the semiconductors available. So we can catch up there.

With the supply of semiconductors this fiscal year, we have inconvenienced our customers to quite an extent. We apologize. But there, well, the old semiconductors sometimes experience a shortage. So we have to try to observe carefully, and we need to monitor carefully the situation because there are some abrupt incidents occurring in the supply.

Now about the currency situation, as I've already explained, we believe that we should be producing where the demand exists. Therefore, the currency impact is limited. But given the fluctuation occurring in such a short period of time, this volatility, it does have an impact, and we cannot hedge against this. We need to have a currency where there is long-term stability.

Unidentified Analyst

That is all. Thank you.

Operator

Next question, Newspeak. Newspeak's Mr. [indiscernible], please.

Unidentified Analyst

Thank you very much. Newspeak's [indiscernible] speaking. Thank you. Two questions. First on operating profit of the Automobile businesses. As compared to last year, you already descended a bit lower. And as you said before, of course, do you have any additional explanations on the top of the presentation about this? In what situation can you expect the OP to go up?

And the second question is about electrification. The Ohio plant will be the hub for EV production. And as there are IRA, Inflation Reduction Act there. But how do you take the benefits of the Ohio electrification production hub?

Kohei Takeuchi

So operating profit of automobile was rather lower as compared to last year. And as you said, one is semiconductor supplies. Because of that, a number of the units have to be constrained. That is the big factor. And also OP of automobile have to be improved.

And in the last two, three years, we've been making efforts to push it up, for instance, reducing fixed cost, closure of the plants in Europe and Japan and so forth. And those are materializing as suggested.

We have Honda architecture, specific designs and so on or specification to make a better efficiency. The numbers are reflecting those efforts. However, in terms of the unit sales, it's not yet there because of the semiconductor constraints.

We are still in the process of improvement. The numbers still be restrained. And of course, there are hypothetical situations as well. And we are on track, in fact, towards the unit sales improvement and Ohio electrification hub. You mentioned IRA Act and $7,500 and $3,750 so on according to your [indiscernible]. There are still details to be decided, but we will produce batteries with LG.

And we have two plants, Marysville and it's delivered to other plants and so on in Ohio, and those places will be a hub for the EV products. And of course, the principle is to make a production where the demand exists, and this is working well. And also, we have to take the benefits from the IRA incentive plans. Thank you.

Operator

Next question please. NSK, [indiscernible]?

Unidentified Analyst

This is [indiscernible] from NSK. Can you hear me?

Operator

Yes.

Unidentified Analyst

Thank you. First, I'm looking at the numbers announced. The sales revenue, I thought it was record high. There was a record high, if any. Can you elaborate on which part was the record high in terms of the record sales revenue? And about the profit, upgrading profit, I don't think it's a record high. But what are the reasons cost-wise? What cost was increased? Can you explain? That's the first part.

And second question about support to suppliers. And can you elaborate on what you're thinking about giving support to the suppliers?

Kohei Takeuchi

Mr. [indiscernible] thank you for the question. First, in regards to the sales revenue this time, the FY '23 forecast and the second quarter three months and the first half six months all recorded a record high. But it was mainly attributable to the currency.

And in terms of unit volume, it was not a record high. So we really did not say proudly that this was a record high. And so -- and due to that, the unit sales was not high. It was mainly attributable to the currency. And therefore, the operating profit was not a record high. But in the second quarter, three months, the motorcycle profit margin was 17% or more -- operating margin, 17% or more. So this is a very high number.

About the supplier support, yes. Well, we also in this FY '23 forecast compared to last fiscal year, there is a rise in the raw material price and also the logistics, inflation, et cetera. So the inflation part is having an impact significantly on the cost.

And suppliers, likewise, are experiencing the same pressure. And well, in line with the situation of the different suppliers, we consult with them and think about what needs to be done. So it's not the case where for all the suppliers, we'll be providing the same support, but we have to tailor to the different situations of the suppliers. We consult with them and to provide, if necessary, support or take other measures. So we have to decide for each case.

Unidentified Analyst

That is all. Thank you.

Kohei Takeuchi

Thank you very much.

Operator

Next one, Wall Street Journal, Mr. Davies, please?

Unidentified Analyst

Hello, thank you very much for taking my question. I have one follow-up on semiconductors. We're hearing from some other automakers that they feel like they've made it past the worst of the shortages. Is that similar in Honda's view at the moment?

And my second question is on electrification. A few weeks ago, we heard from General Motors that they're pushing back some of their EV timelines because they're having trouble ramping up battery capacity. Is Honda seeing any impact from that issue, especially with regard to jointly developed vehicles and timelines around those? Thank you.

Kohei Takeuchi

So a semiconductor question, whether or not the worst time has been over. I think from the personal viewpoint, high level, the worst shortage period of the semiconductor at large has been gone -- has gone for general use of our semiconductor.

However, we have different types of semiconductors and different applications in the vehicles and so on. Where the matching are well supported, the worst time has been over. But still in some specific areas, we still have the shortage. I don't think we have passed the worst time for the specific application area of the semiconductor.

So we try to address the situation so that we can make a delivery of the products to the customers as soon as we can, and of course, to optimize our production and delivery situations. We are working on that. And also electrification with GM and EV timeline delays, at this moment, we have a program with GM after 2025. We have two vehicle plans with GM with their supplies. And for that particular one, battery production capacity is not going to affect that. We haven't heard of that yet.

And will all of the GM vehicles be electrified? I don't know if that is the case. They might need batteries as many as those. And then we haven't heard, and I don't know how they're going to say that, but that is our response. Thank you.

Operator

And next, [indiscernible], please?

Unidentified Analyst

[indiscernible], can you hear me?

Operator

Yes.

Unidentified Analyst

About the raw material cost, that's my first question. The raw material cost and inflation you mentioned. Well, what is the outlook? What do you think this situation will be? Is it going to stop, the rise will stop? Or is it likely to continue to rise into next fiscal year? I think this will have an impact on your profitability for automobiles. So what is your outlook forecast for inflation going forward?

And the second about some numbers, a very detailed question. Well, looking at the end of September, I think that you have a positive for the operating profit, but the net profit is negative. So where do -- what is the cause of this negative?

Kohei Takeuchi

Yes. Let me explain about the raw material part and also the logistics cost inflation, what is the outlook. Well, yes. It depends on the material, but for example, the bare metal, et cetera, for the past few years -- a few months, it is not rising. But it's showing a slight downturn. So I think that this is reflected in partially our forecast.

But is it going to dramatically decline? Well, it depends on the material, the raw material you're talking about. But those raw materials for batteries, I think the supply is not sufficient. And I cannot say anything about that, but other raw materials, if the current situation would continue, I think the rise will be more gradual.

But still, will we see a dramatic decrease in the near future? Well, depending on the material. As electrification progresses, I think that some of the production balance, et cetera, the demand and supply balance and prices are determined. So at this point in time, there might be some changes, but we have to capture those changes early on so that we can provide good products to our customers. And that is how we want to address this issue.

About the operating profit, about the first six months, I think you were asking about the first six months about the operating profit. Well, really, it is positive. But the reason for the negative is the nonoperating profit and also for the share profit and investments accounted for using equity method.

Now as for the first, I think the interest rate and exchange rate is volatile and hard to finance. So they are doing the procurement of funding. And so the derivative, we have hedged. And the assessment of the hedge, et cetera, is one of the negative factors. So this is nonoperating profit.

And as for the share profit of investment accounted for using the equity method, well, in China, well, the business -- it's rather than the business per se, positive or negative. Recently, the share prices are declining. And therefore, we have the balance sheet based on the equity method.

But if we could compare this to the share prices, and those that we can say, some using the equity method, if the share price -- if there is a gap, we have to do -- write it off. And therefore, that is the reason why we have a negative for the net profit.

Operator

Next question, Automotive News, Hans-san, please.

Unidentified Analyst

Can you hear me? Hello? Ask a question in English, can I?

Kohei Takeuchi

Sure.

Unidentified Analyst

My question is about the EV strategy in the United States, specifically with regard to the EV partnership with Sony. Can you give us any new guidance on how Honda plans to approach the retailing of those EVs in the United States? Will Honda use its existing retail network to support the sales of those Sony-Honda EVs? Or will it be completely -- or I should say, sales and servicing of those EVs? Or will it need some kind of different and independent servicing network? Thank you very much.

Kohei Takeuchi

So Sony and Honda joint venture has kicked off established in September. And the other day, [indiscernible] made a joint announcement together. And how we're going to sell the products, of course, with that framework, we're going to -- we have established a new joint venture company, Mobility. That will be not Honda, not Sony, but it will be a new Mobility. That is why we established a new company. And how we are going to sell, it is not defined as yet, clearly, so I can't share with you at the moment. And using the existing network may not be the case.

However, service network, we have 1,000 Honda and 300 Acura service network 1,000 Honda and 300 Acura at our service network, of course, U.S. would make use of that. However, the way to sell maybe in line with the new kind of mobility new world, completely new things. So personally, I think it is going to be something new, but all those things are still under contemplation. So I don't think I can refer to that today. But it is going to be nonconventional, no Sony, no Honda, something totally new. And that is how we have started up with this joint venture company. So please expect us for the next one.

Next question, [indiscernible], please.

Unidentified Analyst

Ms. [indiscernible] can you hear me?

Operator

Yes.

Unidentified Analyst

My name is [indiscernible] from Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun newspaper. Now looking at the current situation, you said that you will replace some of the models to be sold. But in what regions? What kind of models did you replace? Can you elaborate on that?

And the second, well, you mentioned that about the operating margin of automobiles but the unit volume, et cetera. But the motorcycles were not that much impacted. And that is the reason why the operating margin for motorcycles is good. Can I interpret it that way?

Kohei Takeuchi

Well, in what regions, what kind of models have been replaced, et cetera, I cannot make any specific reference. But in the first half or the first six months or three months for Civic and CR-V, we had a shortage of semiconductors. And in the second half, we think in the United States, we -- given the current production situation, it will be difficult to catch up.

So instead, the small models in Japan and Asia, we -- these are those for which we do not have a shortage of semiconductors. And therefore, we place them with these models. So -- and on weekly and also a regional basis, we are doing such things so that we can deliver products to our customers as soon as possible. So such replacements are taking place.

About the automobile profit margin, well, yes, we -- because of the shortage of semiconductors, we are not achieving the unit sales that we intended to. So we cannot achieve the margin that we wanted to. Motorcycles, likewise, are impacted by semiconductors. And depending on the country, the market, I believe motorcycles -- which motorcycles sell are different. And therefore, we're able to cover with that difference.

Those which have high margins, in those countries, the unit volume has increased. And therefore, in Thailand and Vietnam, and that is the reason for the positive. So it's not the case that we do not have any problem. But fortunately, those markets which -- where we have a high margin were the areas in which we saw growth in the unit sales. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Next question [indiscernible], please.

Unidentified Analyst

Toyo Keizai. I have two questions. First question is a confirmation. In the PowerPoint, the factors behind the profit before tax, you had [indiscernible] for the ¥6 billion of the retail price factor for the ups and downs. You had raw materials situation plus you had managed repricing successfully to make this number.

Is that how it went? Please share with us your strategy as well. And also you talked about the pricing and also in mini vehicles, Kei cars, they're produced Japan, consumed in Japan. And in fact, the soaring raw prices are directly impacting the mini vehicles. And what is the impact on that because pricing is difficult on that?

Kohei Takeuchi

So let me explain the first part. For the first half, like this time, we say ¥36 billion plus. Despite raw material prices hike, we managed. That was the -- about -- what the question was about.

But throughout the year, annually speaking, for this fiscal year as compared to last one, raw material prices from the previous forecast because of inflation situation, distribution, labor cost and supplier, of course, suffer the same issues. But cost pressure is ¥390 billion, the cost pressure upward total up to that much.

And our approach is to try to provide -- have a pricing that reflects values. And of course, throughout the year, inflation and supplier situation, specifically the price negotiation, and actually, those events happening in the second half, rather. So when we do pricing, we actually take up in first half already, anticipating what's going to happen next. But actually, that is a plus positive impact on the first half. But throughout the year, I don't think we can absorb all of those costs increase factors. And then we have differences of the impact in second half and first half. And that is how those absent factors are allocated over the period.

So pricing in Japan as [indiscernible] said speaking of the domestic market, of course, we are looking at the competitors as well. And those mini cars -- mini vehicles, we have a -- the OEMs for supply that too. And we, of course, watch out the prices of those products of other companies, and it is kind of difficult to reflect the raw material price hike situations to the price of the products directly.

We have to make a decision thinking over the competitor's product. And when we have the new model, new specification, we may pass it on -- the price hike part for the price of the product, but we would try to do that as we go going forward.

Unidentified Analyst

Thank you very much.

The next question will be the last question. [indiscernible] please.

Unidentified Analyst

Can you hear? About motorcycle sales, a detailed question about Indonesia. Compared to others, I think the growth is not that fast. Is the reason -- what is the reason? You talked about EV motorcycles. But in Asia, the competitors -- do you see that there is pressure coming from your competitors to try to push EV motorcycles, electrified motorcycles?

Kohei Takeuchi

[indiscernible], thank you very much. Indonesia is more than 100%, but the growth is slower than other regions. What -- which -- where did this come from? Can you elaborate on your question?

Unidentified Analyst

Excuse me. In the second quarter, the Indonesian sales, it says 101.9%. And in the fourth quarter it's 90%, I think. So that ratio I'm talking about.

Kohei Takeuchi

Sorry. I'll look it up. Well, in regards to Indonesia, there is an impact of the recession, the slowdown of the economy, especially last year. When it comes to Thailand and Vietnam, there was a lockdown in Asia, as you recall. And because of that impact, at that point in time, Vietnam and Thailand grew. So this is in comparison. I hope that you'll understand that to be the case.

And about the electrification of motorcycles in Asia, in India, there is this new manufacturer, who just started up. And they have a very forward-looking plan, sales plan, and it seems to be working. And Indonesia, again, competitors are putting pressure on us in terms of electrified motorcycles.

But we -- also, as I explained the other day, heading towards 2030 and '35, we want to aim for a large unit sales in Asia when it comes to EV motorcycles. It's true that competitors are putting pressure on us because of their growth, but mobile battery pack, we're using battery.

And the rickshaw in India, we installed battery and are doing demonstration tests there. So I think in Asia mainly in the motorcycle sector, we are trying to electrify, put together a strategy in this market going forward. Thank you.

“It’s not good for Putin,” Ryan said.

He was speaking before his trip to the Cop27 summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, where representatives from more than 190 countries are discussing further measures to cut global greenhouse emissions.

Scientists say the rise in global temperatures must be limited to 1.5C by the end of the century to avoid the worst effects, whereas current projections are for an increase of 2.7C.

It is for this reason that the Environment and Transport Minister insists that, notwithstanding the benefits of warmer weather for household energy bills, climate change “is nothing but a bad thing”.

Ryan and all other Green ministers, including the juniors, will stay in their posts after next month’s reshuffle, he confirmed. And he spoke not of short or medium-term political ambitions, but of a much bigger project.

“We have to be in five governments in a row doing this full tilt. This is the biggest change ever, the most important historic change ever,” he said.

Ruling out any future election transfer pacts with Fine Gael — as floated by Leo Varadkar last week — he argued instead for working with any party that commits to drastic cuts in emissions.

He was struck by the words of the US climate envoy John Kerry at Cop27 last week, which he paraphrased: “This is a wartime situation for the next 25 years — to stop our planet burning. This is not small. Therefore, it can’t be stop-start. It has to be consistent. It’s this change of scale that people don’t realise yet, I think.”

It’s not just the current weather that brings home the effects of climate change. Last week, Ryan was in Tipperary, where the first item on the council’s agenda was roads washed away outside Cahir and sewage coming up through manholes in Thurles because of storm surges.

How close are we to having climate migrants in Ireland, moving from their uninhabitable homes?

“We’re starting to see it already in some locations, like along the Shannon, areas that have been subject to flooding in recent years. There are areas that can’t take another flood.”

By the end of the century, Ryan suggested, the country’s five cities — Galway, Cork, Limerick, Dublin and Waterford — could become uninhabitable.

“It creates an insecurity for our children and their future, that if you go beyond a certain tipping point it’s irreversible and then it becomes really damaging and really catastrophic,” he said. “Maybe people my age will be able to manage this. But their world and their future won’t be manageable — and it’s not fair for us to leave them that, and they want to play their part.”

For all his good intentions, Ryan is viewed by the public as the worst-performing cabinet minister, according to last weekend’s Ireland Thinks/Sunday Independent poll. He said he does not know why this is the case.

Rather than suggesting it is because the public believe he is not doing enough on climate action — the poll also found 50pc of voters do not believe enough is being done — Ryan suspects the sorts of changes he is pushing for, such as in agriculture, mean he is losing support.

To the annoyance of some in the Green Party who believe their leader should be radical and perhaps militant when it comes to pursuing their agenda, Ryan prefers a more consultative approach to persuade people of the benefits.

“If we just try to do this guilt-tripping, making people feel guilty, pointing the finger, it won’t work,” he said. “The changes we need to make in energy, in transport, in agriculture, in industry are going to be good for us.”

He believes it would be “insane” not to move away from reliance on imported fossil fuels to a cleaner, more sustainable energy supply. But he does not see congestion charges as a solution to the gridlock in cities.

“I think what it will be is reallocating road space so that the bus gets through and making it safe to walk and cycle — and that will be challenging, trust me, in terms of the political challenge,” he said. “But the problem is that the current traffic system doesn’t work and we need to change. I think road space reallocation — giving priority to walking, cycling and buses — is the best way to go about it.”

Next month, he will publish a revised Climate Action Plan (Cap) for 2023 that will effectively drop the previous headline-grabbing target of having one million electric vehicles on Irish roads by 2030.

“I think a lesser number, it hasn’t been finalised yet,” Ryan said, adding that the focus will be on reducing people’s need to travel and making a “radical shift” towards public transport, walking and cycling.

“I think one of the biggest changes is probably going to be in transport, recognising that it isn’t just about switching to electric vehicles. It is also about reducing the amount of transport we do. One million EVs is not the key metric.

“There are three key metrics — reducing the amount of transport we do; switching to active travel and public transport; and switching technology [to EVs]. All three together are needed.”

A spokesperson later said the Department of Transport is no longer focused on delivering one million EVs, but instead wants to create the infrastructure to encourage people to use public transport or cycle and walk instead. Consequently, this is likely to reduce the number of internal combustion engine vehicles on Irish roads. Cap 2023 will have an ambition that just over 30pc of the national fleet will be EVs by 2030.

There will, however, be €100m allocated over three years for more EV charging infrastructure, including, €15m for charging points in sports clubs.

“At the moment, everything is designed around the presumption that people are going to use a car — we’re not providing the alternative infrastructure to allow people not to use it,” Ryan said. “People want to use public transport, they don’t want to be stuck in traffic.”

In this vein, he is anxious to roll out as many rural bus services as possible over the next two years.

He complained that the rollout of BusConnects in Dublin and other cities is taking too long, and has told the National Transport Authority to speed up the overhaul of the real-time information system.

“We’ve said there is no shortage of funding and we’ll provide whatever support we can,” he said.

Cap 2023, Ryan said, will also be the first government climate plan that will be “presented with the strength of the law behind it, in the sense that you have to deliver — and if you’re not delivering, as minister you have to adjust”.

Any citizen or any interested party will be able to take ministers to court if they fail to meet legally binding targets.

“We would see citizens taking action,” he said.

So is he actually telling the public to take ministers to court if they are breaching their targets?

“The law says that already — we’ve a very strong law,” he said.","‘We would see citizens taking action’ – Eamon Ryan on the public being able to sue if climate targets are missed, and how all Irish cities could be uninhabitable by 2100",https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/we-would-see-citizens-taking-action-eamon-ryan-on-the-public-suing-if-climate-targets-are-missed-and-how-irish-cities-could-be-uninhabitable-by-2100-42140002.html

Annamalai Jayaraj

Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to Bosch Limited 2Q FY '22, '23 post-results conference call hosted by B&K Securities. I also take this opportunity to welcome the senior management team of Bosch Limited. We have with us today Mr. Soumitra Bhattacharya, Managing Director; Mr. Guruprasad Mudlapur, Joint Managing Director and Chief Technology Officer; and Ms. Karin Gilges, our Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions].

Also may remind you of the safe harbor. The company may be making some forward-looking statements that have to be understood in conjunction with the uncertainty and the risk that the company faces. Over to you, sir.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Thank you very much Mr. Annamalai Jayaraj. Good afternoon, colleagues, and thank you for being part of this call. At the outset, I would like to thank all of you for the excellent in-person interaction that we had in August at Mumbai for our annual investor meet. Today, I will start with a brief on the macroeconomic policy followed by an automotive market update, and then I would like to walk you through our financials. Finally, I will end with the highlights of the quarter affecting our business.

Next slide, please. The global economy is facing a significant downside risk to growth with persistent high inflation. In relation to the Indian economy, the IMF released its latest forecast on the world economy this week in which India's FY '23 real GDP growth was revised downwardly to 6.8% from the 7.4% projected in July '22. Having said that, the domestic demand continues to be quite robust in India.

Next slide. Overall, automotive market production has increased by plus 28% year-on-year in the current quarter. This excludes 2-wheelers. However, on a low base of the quarter 2 of fiscal year '22, the production volumes in quarter 2 fiscal '23 stood robust across the segments aided by the inventory getting filled for the festive season. The passenger car segment outperformed other segments growing at plus 35% year-on-year volume growth supported by the somewhat easing of chip supplies or semiconductors and the pent-up festive season demand. By the way, colleagues, you must know that October had the highest sales for fast cars due to the festival demand.

Serving this already healthy order book and thereby mitigating longer waiting periods. The 2-wheeler segment also witnessed a healthy plus 8% year-on-year growth, largely supported by the festive season and premiumization trend. The LCV segment continues to witness growth and which was plus 30% on year-on-year, while the heavy commercial variables or HCV segment saw plus 37% year-on-year on albeit a low base. However, on the ground situation is steady as fleet utilization levels are healthy and have led by an increased economic and infrastructural activities.

The [indiscernible] segment also grew marginally by around minus 2% year-on-year, of course, to very high base with the OEMs building up delayed inventory in anticipation of the strong demand, which was there for the festive season. The 3-wheeler is on a recovery path with shared mobility slowly picking up. Overall, automotive market production has increased by plus 30% quarter-on-quarter in the current quarter. This, of course, excludes 2-wheelers.

Let's have a look at the automotive market outlook for '22. In this slide, each row represents a particular segment, for instance, the first row represents the pass car, followed by LCV factor 2-wheeler, 3-wheeler segments respectively. The first column represents the 2018 production volumes, which is considered as one of the best years in the Indian automotive industry, which was at its peak. So by the way, we have shown here 2018, but you can also tendentially read it as 2018 [indiscernible] but the numbers here indicated are the calendar year.

Second column represents 2020 production volumes and the third column represents '21 production volume and the fourth column gives you an outlook for the 2022 calendar year volumes. Basis these numbers, we are expecting a solid year for pass car, LCV segment, and very likely, they will reach the 2018 peak. Example, you can see in pass cars, we've set 4.3 million for the pass cars current forecast of '22 as against the 4.07 million in the year in 2018.

The tractors peaked. The -- in case of heavy commercial vehicles, 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers recovery continues, however, and we can see based on differentiated situations, they are still far away from the 2018 peak. Tractors peaked already last year, and we are expecting a minor degrowth albeit on a very high basis.

Let's look at how the company has performed in the July, September 2022 quarter as compared to the July, September '21, amidst all these aforementioned factors. Our overall revenue from operations for July, September in 2022 stood at INRor INR3,662 crores, which is an increase of 25.5% as compared to the July-September '21. Here, the automotive sales have grown by approximately 31%, largely driven by the Powertrain Solutions, while nonautomotive sales have increased by 7.5% largely led by the Energy and Building Technology division.

Overall product sales have increased by 27%, primarily on account of a low base in the July, September 2021, owing to the impact of COVID-19. Income from services, mainly comprised of R&D services provided to OEMs as also our parent Bosch in Germany. While billing for R&D services was at a healthy level for the quarter, income recognized in the books based on customer SOP dates was INR648 million or INR64.8 crores. Balance income would get recognized in subsequent quarters based on project location completion days of customers.

Other operating income mainly includes income from lease rentals, miscellaneous income and export incentives. In July, September quarter of the previous financial year, we have received an installment of claim for refund of taxes under the mega project scheme of the government of Maharashtra pertaining to our top Nashik Plant. However, other operating income for the current quarter was comparatively slightly lower.

The material cost as a percentage of total revenue from operations has increased from 62.8% in July, September '21 to 64.9% in July, September '22. Increase is mainly due to 2 reasons: one, change in product mix towards traded goods over the same quarter of the previous year. And second, what's happening internationally, which is raw material price increase, including increases in the prices of electronic components.

Employee cost for July, September '21 included reversal of employee-related provisions. On a like-to-like basis, without the reversal of provisions employee cost in July, September '22 would have remained the same as compared to the previous year.

Other expenses stood at INR5,781 million or INR578 crores, which is 15.8% of the total revenue in July, September '22 as compared to INR4,757 million or INR476 crores, 16.3% of total revenue in July, September '21. Increase is in line with the increase of sales and also higher spending on new business areas and onetime technical access fee paid for localization of new products.

Our depreciation for the current quarter is at INR919 million 2.5% of the total revenue as compared to INR829 million 2.8% of total revenue in July, September '21. The increase in depreciation is on account of capitalization of our new Spark.NXT campus and the plant initially for localization of our new products in the current quarter.

With this, the operating profit stood at . In July, September 2022 as compared to in July, September 2021, which is an increase of 23.5%.

Other income primarily consists of interest on fixed deposits and changes in the market value of our mutual funds, which are debt-based. Other income has also increased from in July 2021 to in July, September 2022, mainly on account of increase in interest income of fixed deposits and dividend received from equity shares.

For the quarter ended July, September 2022, the company has posted a profit before tax or PBT of , as suspected to in July, September 2021 as a percentage of total revenue from operations profit before tax stood at 13.3% of total revenue in the current quarter.

PAT or profit after tax. For the quarter ended September 2022 stood at , which is 10.2% of the total revenue from operations. Profit after tax in July, September 2021 was , which included tax adjustments, which is a credit amounting to INR765 million pertaining to previous years.

We, in Bosch believe that by 2030, approximately 1 in 3 new vehicles across the globe is likely to be an EV. Bosch is already gearing up for this change and hence, offers comprehensive offers and solutions from PC to CV at hybrids to BEV as well as FCEV or battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles.

On [indiscernible], our Powertrain Solutions division in India located inside is a deep engagement with key energy sector players and OEMs for hydrogen engine business, and you will be glad to know that we have also received our first hydrogen pilot project. This includes the conversion of ICE engine BS-IV to hydrogen ICE and the details of this will be shared with you later at the time of SOP by our OEMs.

The sustainable analytics or global ESG ratings agency. ESG stands for environment, social and governance, has again rated Bosch Limited. And our scores have improved from 13.2 in 2021 to 12.8 in 2022. The lower the scores, the better. Bosch Limited currently ranks at 11 out of 208 within the automotive components, industries, and on 734 out of 14,794 within the global universe. We would like to thank you for your contribution as well as for your patient listening throughout this call.

We will now address your queries. And thank you for your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

A - Annamalai Jayaraj

Thank you, sir. We shall now begin with the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Mr. Jinesh Gandhi.

Jinesh Gandhi

Yes. My first question pertains to the CapEx. So first half CapEx was close to about INR3.1 billion. Any indication of what kind of investments we expect in second half or for the full year FY '23? And in which areas are we investing for future growth?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Yes. So as I said, Jinesh that we are investing in the future, both for our plant and machinery as also we have invested for our smart campus, which the Prime Minister inaugurated, which is called Spark.NXT campus. So we have also, based on this quarterly since we have catalyzed it, this has also come into the books and therefore, it shows in the [indiscernible]

In relation to the CapEx plan for 2022, we have approximately anywhere between INR520 crores to INR560 crores, is that bandwidth. As you know, Bosch Limited for over the last many, many years, does between INR400 crores to INR600 crores and Bosch India does anywhere between INR600 crores to

Jinesh Gandhi

Right. And this INR520 crores to INR560 crores will also include investment towards PLI scheme related CapEx, right?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Actually we have applied for Bosch Limited as also our other sister companies. And we plan to, of course, apply and also go ahead for the PLI.

Jinesh Gandhi

Okay. Okay. And second question pertains to the hydrogen engine business award, which we have got in India. So as you indicated this is conversion from ICE to hydrogen. Any indication of whether it is pilot or it's actually for commercial application and when do we expect this to get commercialized?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

So as I mentioned, 2 things, and then I'll request our CTO to talk about it, who's also handling this portfolio. We have got the pilot conversion project. The pilot conversion project will be done based on our [indiscernible] at our Adugodi campus only on SOP by our OEMs, which is our standard practice, we will give further details. But over to you, Guru.

Guruprasad Mudlapur

Thank you, Soumitra. The project itself is a pilot right now. So the first engine conversions have happened and there is proof both in terms of engine conversion and those engines being fitted on the vehicle that hydrogen conversion of current engines is possible. So that this is what has been done right now.

And based on that, we have acquired a CVs project. And we will now support the OEM to build additional vehicles before December. And from then on, the CV project will start. And the time line is about 1.5 years for CVs project.

Annamalai Jayaraj

Next will be from Pramod Amthe.

Pramod Amthe

Sir, first is with regard to the currency movement. If I had to look at your annual report, almost 38% is our ForEx as -- ForEx usage as a proportion of net sales. Would you give a breakup in terms of what is the dollar exposure and euro exposure because both these currencies are moving in a different direction this time. So hence, to understand the volatility impact of currency.

And second, how these are passed on to the clients? Do they come through easily or they are tough negotiations?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Thank you, Pramod for a very insightful and interesting question. You'll be happy to know that our company over decades has a very robust a treasury management system and b a very robust hedging system. And we have been doing it consistently. And of course, we follow the market trends and then do it.

So in summary, for Bosch Limited, we are pretty well secure against huge currency fluctuations. While the exchange rate changes have been, I won't say massive, but it has been there. For example, the quarter July rate, the changes were approximately 8.5% or this is compared to the sequential what about 3% or YTD at 7%. We have both at USD and at euro thanks to our hedging policy, had a pretty stable situation. And this is handled by our CFO, who's also participating.

The second point of yours was how is our contractual obligations. So we have systemic contracts with different OEMs in relation to different elements. So these are both based on the past as well as in the future. So we do put in some of these clauses, but naturally, as you would understand, they are not uniform across all.

So in summary, I would say, 3 sentences. One, India's exchange rate fluctuations have been thanks to our financials not massive. Two, we have a very solid hedging policy, which has allowed us not to have any major impacts. And 3, our contracting with OEMs are pretty good. And yes, they are slightly differentiated depending on different OEMs including the timing.

Pramod Amthe

Sure. And second 1 is with regard to the alternative technologies. Congrats on winning this pilot project on hydrogen. And considering that EVs have taken a big spike in the festivals in recent months, any update in terms of wins or what product offerings have been accepted by the OEMs in the recent times...

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Nothing compared to the past that we declared, Pramod.

Annamalai Jayaraj

Next question is from -- next caller will be Ashish. Abhishek, sorry. Abhishek, your line is unmuted. You can go ahead. Abhishek?

Unidentified Analyst

Am I audible?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Yes, Abhishek, go ahead.

Unidentified Analyst

In the beginning of your narration, you said that there were some one-off kind of localization expenses included in other expenses. So can you please quantify and explain the nature of the expenses?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Which one are you referring to?

Unidentified Analyst

Sir, there were some -- is there some one-off expenses included in other expenses in this quarter, sir?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Look, Abhishek, we have -- which we have explained multiple few times. We have technical access fee at arm's length based on when we take in new technology from our parent. So unlike royalty which is a regular payment again, which is at an arm's length that's very reasonable our onetime technical access fee was paid for a localization of a few new products. And that was the one time at this time.

Unidentified Analyst

Can you please quantify that?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

It's around INR35 crores.

Unidentified Analyst

35, okay. And sir, can you please elaborate something on about your BS-VI order book, which you said that last time it was the highest ever. So have you seen further increase in that and your outlook on the [Technical Difficulty].

Soumitra Bhattacharya

At the time of the Auto Expo before the COVID. And at that time, I have declared if I correctly recall, around INR23,000 crores on the lifetime of the acquisition of the BS-VI. This is, by the way, the definition of lifetime is between 5 and 6 years.

I also mentioned later that after the COVID, the same value based on the changed demand for vehicles at the COVID had come to approximately 18,000. So you can imagine, again, that 18,000 will move up because the demand has been doubled. So a couple of years have also gone by.

So in summary, we had already shared the BS-VI Stage 1 -- it's not stage 2 in the last Auto Expo, which happened physically before the COVID. That was in 2020 sometime in January or February.

Now coming to what I mentioned in the last quarter was something different. Having acquired the BS-VI stage 1, you are aware that there has been several government announcements based on which OEMs have actually started investing, whether it is [indiscernible] other efficient law legislations for which in the Powertrain Systems, we've had 1 of the highest acquisitions in the year 2022. And therefore, based on the current legislations, which have been announced and started to be acted upon by the OEMs, we are having a good order book. So I hope I've clarified between BS-VI stage 1 and the current acquisition.

Annamalai Jayaraj

Next question will be from Mr. Priya Ranjan. I have unmuted your line. Priya Ranjan, you can unmute and ask your question?

Priya Ranjan

Yes. So just on the commodity cost outlook. Even this quarter, you have highlighted that the commodity cost has been on the higher side, while we are seeing the commodity and the pure commodity like steel, aluminum, et cetera, is coming down. So what's your thought on going forward, the commodity cost?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

So I will request our CFO to briefly speak about it, having said a sentence or 2. So the first sentence Priya Ranjan is that yes, there is a slight easing of commodity costs compared to the peak. Yes, there is a slight easing also, as I mentioned, on the availability of semiconductor. But please remember that those same costs on materials are nowhere near the base of when it started. So having said that, a little bit more from our CFO, Ms. Karin Gilges.

Karin Gilges

Thank you very much. As mentioned already Soumitra that the RMI what we currently see is, of course, based on the past and on the past increases. So we are expecting an ease in the high RMIs. But nevertheless, we will see also in the upcoming months that we will not come to the base we have before.

In addition, if we look at our material costs, we also see that in the traded goods, we have an increase in the last quarter of the trading goods, which is also an influencing of our material cost. So both effects together, you can see reflected in our material costs of the current quarter.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Having -- Priya Ranjan, you must also realize that in a very systemic way we are approaching our customers for these increases, which are unusual. And as we know that OEMs have also on several locations this year had to increase the prices of their end product, the cars. And therefore, we, from our side, are also systematically approaching.

Priya Ranjan

Understood. And in your press release, you have mentioned about the injector, the common rail injector being localized. So in this quarter, have we seen some kind of supply from that? Or we are expecting localization of that to benefit in the subsequent quarters or years?

Karin Gilges

Yes. I suppose you are [indiscernible] the localization of the injector and the commercial vehicle injector, yes. We just had the SOP of this. So we are step by step now going to the production but it is not a onetime launch. So the overall localization needs a little bit longer. So we have started the production, the assembly line is already capitalized and step by step, we are ramping up now the production. And back to your questions in the current quarter, we do not see this influence. We expect it now in the upcoming months.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

So if I can add a sentence. The key point Priya Ranjan, to note is that we have actually got the line up and running in midyear. This also coincided with the Nashik Plant, 50 years of being in India. So, a, we have committed to the localization. It will happen step by step. The line is up and running as our CFO mentioned, already in our plan. And like what we did in the past decades, now that the line is committed in India, it's not been imported, the part components will have a step by step...

Priya Ranjan

Understood. And 1 thing on the consumer products goods. So I guess -- in your annual report, you have also mentioned as in from the related party transaction, there was a lot of traded goods in that segment. So -- and the margin for that segment has been lower compared to the automotive products segment. So I think the first phase of localization was started from that product line. So when can we expect the benefit coming from that line?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Which line are you referring to?

Priya Ranjan

So the power tools, the consumer goods segment because that was the first project, which I think in the last couple of years where we have undertaken more localization because they were doing a lot of traded goods out there.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

I got it. I got it. So Priya Ranjan, there are 2, 3 points on the power tools that we must note. The power tools production line, which was at a very nascent stage, was shifted around 4.5 years from Bangalore -- 4.5 to 5 years around from Bangalore to Chennai to the automotive area. This power tools plant for 3 times have been selected as the best power tools plant overall rating out of 18 power tools plant is the word. From a very low base, we are nearly at 40% localization of our power tools, and we are committed to increase the localization where we have now shifted to our own premise at a larger premise.

In power tools, we are the market leader in a very fragmented market and our commitment towards further localization is there. And our commitment also is to have a very clear commitment on Cordless Matlab Bosch, which means Cordless means Bosch. And along with this, we will share in the future further and deeper commitments on power tools.

Priya Ranjan

Understood. And just last question is on the electrification and your way of participating in the electrification. So are you looking 2-wheeler, 3-wheeler electrification also as a key driver for Bosch or you are more inclined towards commercial vehicle and the passenger vehicle side in the future? What's your thought on that?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

So already in the 2-wheeler, 3-wheeler Bosch has clearly participated with respect to what we discussed earlier on OEMs, when they announced, example, TVS, example, Bajaj, we had already mentioned it. And as we speak, our 2-wheeler division, which is located inside RBEI, but caters -- Bosch Limited -- sorry, located with Bosch Limited, but also works with Bosch Limited as well as other divisions is having various electrification projects at a system and a component level with various 2-wheelers greatly and also 3-wheelers. As you know, 3-wheelers in India today pre-COVID and post-COVID as a different scenario.

Guruprasad Mudlapur

Just to add to that, in terms of your question. Bosch has a complete portfolio right from e-bikes. So these are cycles which are electrified all the way up to trucks and heavy commercial vehicles in terms of our electrification portfolio. And we are discussing with various Indian OEMs on the complete portfolio to offer in India.

Two-wheelers, as Soumitra already explained, we have acquisitions and we are fighting for from projects here. Passenger cars, we are discussing with key Indian OEMs, and then you will, over the coming months, also here, we focus there.

On commercial vehicles, there is not much action on electrification which means battery electric vehicles. But hydrogen has taken off, and you've already heard our pilot acquisition.

Annamalai Jayaraj

Next, I'll read a question from the question box. Are we expecting a shift in manufacturing from Europe to India in the coming years in our automotive segment and what are all the benefits that we can reap out of it.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Who had asked this question, Annamalai?

Annamalai Jayaraj

One minute sir. Tejas Shah.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Thank you, Tejas. It's a very generic question, so I can give you a generic answer. We have mainly a strategy called Local for Local, which we have shared with you, because India is a huge domestic market. However, our export percentage of our total sales is hovering between 7% and 8%, as you are aware from our annual report. This in a strategic way, over the next years, we want to increase it to double-digit and then attain the double digit. So this is a part.

In summary, Bosch Limited will always remain focused towards our big Indian market, which gives huge opportunities while seizing opportunities for export based on our products, components or systems, which are available, which can be given to designated markets with a focus on increasing the current value and percentage to a healthy double digit in the near future.

Next question will be from Mr. Sonal Gupta.

Sonal Gupta

Good evening to everyone. Sorry, I have a little bit of bad cold. What I really wanted to understand was we have the OBD2 norms for the BS-VI coming in. So what sort of an implication do you see of that? Do we see any major shifts like we've already seen a significant shift away from diesel. Now there's a lot of speculation on the passenger vehicle side that this could further raise significantly the cost of diesel engines. So I just wanted to understand that -- I mean, is the technology still valid or everybody needs to move to SCR for OBD 2? If you could just shed some light on that? And also, for your other key categories like medium and heavy commercial vehicles, do we see a major change in content for you?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

So first of all, Sonal, if I come with your second question and then come back to the legislation. On the heavy commercial vehicle, as I mentioned before, both on heavy commercial and light commercial Bosch has a lot of content, especially after BS-VI Stage 1 and also as and when stage 2 takes on and also on the various other emission-related legislations for which we have also acquired projects, yes, including [indiscernible].

So in summary, we see that to be healthy. I had also mentioned to you that the light commercial vehicles at 670,000 which was a peak has already reached in the year 2022, heavy commercial vehicles the peak in '18 was around 480,000 and it will take a little time to reach up to that. But even at 360,000, we are sitting pretty on our higher than 10 per vehicle.

Coming to the OBD, we had already mentioned last time that the slight delay in OBD, which has happened, industry-wide phenomenon, but we are prepared to delever even after the revised OBD days, OBD2 days. I think that should be answering your question?

Sonal Gupta

Sorry. So do we see a significant change in cost for the OEM as a result of this transition to OBD2 from OBD 1?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Look, Sonal, let's take the matter of cost of material, including cost of upgrading based on emission. Every emission change, including BS-IV to BS-VI, including [indiscernible], including OBD has certain cost changes. However, unlike what was discussed the 2019 and 2020 that would -- numbers take off, the numbers have taken off. In the year '22, we see no change or let up on pass car sales. And if I look at the data, the value per car, the price per car has increased significantly, but the demand has not come down.

So in summary to your question, we do not see a change in the demand based on the improvement, which is legislated, either at the component level or at the overall vehicle.

Guruprasad Mudlapur

Just to add another perspective for the OEMs, in either emission norms or safety norms, which have also greatly improved in the Indian context, keep growing continuously to the next levels. For the OEMs, this also opens up an opportunity to take the vehicles globally, which has not been the case earlier when we lag behind all regulations and standards. And so our vehicles would not really fit many markets other than maybe Africa or some places like that.

So this also is a significant opportunity for OEMs to have a level playing field towards having global markets which are opening up. And this should also be seen as a stepping stone towards electric vehicles when many of these things simply disappear. There are no emission laws. So everything becomes open and an electric vehicle in India is also and equally capable of operating in any other region provided it meets all other norms.

There are different advantages while the cost may go up a little bit and premiumization continuously happens in terms of features or addition of technology into the vehicles. This also opens up a much bigger opportunity for Indians. And also for us as a Tier 1 to export to other regions.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Thank you for that. And if I could add to what Guru mentioned, today the inventory for pass cars, which is around 460,000 at the end of October is the normalized inventory and the only area of this inventory, which is lower is on the high-end cars and definition of high-end cars if I pay indicators around 12 lakhs plus for India. So that's slightly higher income.

So the sales in October, retail sales has been 380,000 this festive season. As compared to the last 4 years, where the festive season, we have sold between 320,000 and 330,000. So significant decrease number one. Number two, our annual sales will be at INR4.3 billion or INR4.4 billion against INR4.07 billion or INR4.1 billion. And number three, the sales for lower end cars for India are having good enough inventory, but not so for the high-end cars where the demand has been higher. So you can actually make out from this Sonal, what the trend is.

Annamalai Jayaraj

Next I'll read out a question from the question box. It is from Mr. Ajit Motwani. What's our exposure to USD and euro? And how does the movement impact us with our plans, is Forex impact the pass through.

Karin Gilges

So as mentioned before, regarding the Forex, we have a very good hedging start achieving credits. As Soumitra Bhattacharya already explained. And therefore, we see a change in the U.S. on a negative way and the euro on a positive way, we are importing for both of the markets, of course, mainly on the euro base. But based on our hedging policy, which we have in place for a very long time, we do not see an influence, which is significant based on our stable policy.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Yes. I mean, thanks, Karin. I think track to ask us that I'll be buying in U.S. and selling in euro. The answer is no Satish, a as our CFO said, for years, we have had a strong hedge policy. And we do this for both U.S. as well as for Europe, number one. Number two, we are not 1 of those companies who are in the slightly unfortunate situation of having that on matters USD and then selling attention. Does that answer your question, Satish?

Annamalai Jayaraj

Ajit Motwani. I think it's clear sir. Thanks sir. Next question will be from Mr. Pramod Kumar.

Pramod Kumar

Sir, my first question -- for 2-wheeler segment because that is something which is still being debated, whether it will come through or not, and given the demand in this category is already pretty weak. So any sort on that on as to what do you see the cost implication there, whether you expect it to be a minor 1 or a meaningful one. And when I say meaningful, around like 4% to 5% kind of a cost implication for the category...

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Can you repeat that last sentence, please. What will be...

Pramod Kumar

What will be the cost implication for the category, sir? Because this is in context of the kind of demand what this category has seen as well as transition to BS-VI and to the new safety norms. So just wanted color -- the OBD norm impact on the 2-wheeler cost curve.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

So again, I repeat, Pramod, you must understand in 2018, '19 or the calendar year 2018, which the 2-wheeler peaked at 25 million. I showed you that graph where the calendar of '22, we would be at 19/20 million. So first of all, the Indian industry is not reaching up to the 25 million, number one.

Number two, in the '18, '19, we are talking of apples and oranges between '18, '19 and 2018 and '22, why? Because at that time there was a carburetor. Today, we have fuel injection system. Number three, the OBD2 will come. Number four, very important, the base models during that period, you must remember were between INR65,000 to INR80,000. Today, the base models are between INR1 lakh and INR120,000. So when you take a standard 100 cc vehicle or 125 and so on. So we are actually comparing apples with oranges.

Having said that, I would say, at 19 million, 20 million vehicles, it is not a bad size in India. And of course, we hope that it will further pick up and go towards the peak, but we are confident that India has seen a very clear growth curve on value-added by making vehicles both at 4-wheelers or 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers safer by bringing in technology, the cost naturally will go up, both from inflation as well as value-added products being brought into make in the contemporary and still are relatively affordable in the Indian context. So I've already shared the other details on a OBD2, so I won't repeat that.

Pramod Kumar

Yes. And just a follow-up to that, sir. Given the increased [indiscernible] electronic carburetors still be relevant? Or would you expect the 2-wheeler market to [indiscernible] projection with the OBD2 norms?

Soumitra Bhattacharya

So OBD2 norms have been made very clear by the government. On matters of , Bosch has very clearly said that we are believing in the technology, which is there, not only in the West, but also declared by the government. And I would not like to comment on the e-carb because different people do it and I would not like to indicate that.

Pramod Kumar

I understand. I appreciate that. Final question on the [indiscernible] how do you see this kind of impacting the current battery procurement in India, which is heavily dependent on a lot of Chinese imports, including the [indiscernible] Does Bosch as a large EV players see a big opportunity there where you expect incrementally a lot of these smaller electric vehicles and OEMs approaching you because the government is clearly up the ante there in terms of the kind of safety standards they need and the kind of even the kind of [indiscernible] or the battery assembly. So do you see this as a big opportunity for Bosch to ramp up its EV wallet share?

Guruprasad Mudlapur

Yes. So I'll take this question. Thank you. I think the tighter regulation was going to happen anyway. So the government, I think, initially let this a little bit free for market to get established and then use the opportunity of battery fires and other things to send a message to all the OEMs and all the players in the market. So that's what has happened.

This is a very good move in our view, this tightens technological preparedness in this area in terms of safety and significantly to make the batteries safer, the vehicles safer. This is something that we are always believing in. So all our batteries, which we design and offer to the market have very high levels of safety and standards compliance, including diesel level compliance built in. So we are able to offer this already now into the market, and we have also worked closely with the government to help them refine these standards over the past year or so. So overall, I think this is a very good move, and we certainly hope to benefit from this in the coming years.

Pramod Kumar

And sir, any cost implication which you can share because we are getting closer to the deadline for the first stage, right, because -- entail cost inflation, right, for the battery for the electrical vehicles in general.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Cost implications due to the as norms being introduced?

Pramod Kumar

Yes, sir.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Okay. I think it's going to be very difficult to quantify this because there is no baseline we are comparing against. See, there are a lot of batteries today in the market without even basic battery management systems. So they just wire that to deliver 48 volts or 12 volts or whatever is the voltage system without any basic requirements in terms of voltage of battery management system to manage the batteries, both for thermal performance and our cell level degradation or protection.

So it's very, very hard to compare any, I mean, Western system or systems offered in the West, which are compliant as [indiscernible] standards always have had these things built in. So in that sense, this will not -- from a good, well-designed battery, a lot of these protection mechanisms in the BMS are already there, so that the new norms should not add any further prior costs.

Annamalai Jayaraj

Next question is from

Guruprasad Mudlapur

We need to close at 5:30...

Annamalai Jayaraj

This is the last caller.

Unidentified Analyst

I just wanted to check on the gross margins, if you had commented in this quarter, we've seen some further pressure. So just wanted to understand, is it largely commodity? Or is it also a product mix effect out there?

Karin Gilges

Yes, it is mix effect, but we see the product mix effect mainly out of -- between the manufactured goods and the traded goods, which have implication. And if you look at the P&L, you can see that the material cost especially increased, and this is based on the product mix on the 1 side, but also and is partly based on the increase of the raw material and on the electronic components.

And as Soumitra Bhattacharya already mentioned, we are in discussion with our customers regarding the recovery of especially this raw material increases. But overall, if you look for 1 quarter last year to this quarter, then you see an [indiscernible] in the margin especially due to the raw material increases and the product mix.

Unidentified Analyst

Understood. And just on this common rail localization that we've spoken about. I just wanted to get a sense as to once this is fully productionized, where will it take our localizations level up to?

Karin Gilges

It will take up our localization level from roughly 73% up to 76%. And this is -- but besides the pure percentage in the localization and the strategic objective of the localization of this injector on the commercial vehicle is much more important because if you look on the midterm and of the long term, this was a very strategic step to localize this line here in India for the Indian market. So I would not go rather for the fuel percentage. But please look from the strategic point of view, this is a very important step for Bosch here in India.

Unidentified Analyst

Got it. And just 1 last one, if I can try. I just wanted to get a sense if we could share any thoughts on where our EV order book stands at currently, just to understand our progress in this space.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Yes. We do not -- we are working actively. We do not make statements, as you know, Navin, until the SOPs, which happened from our customers. So while we are working, as we mentioned and also as CTO mentioned, further statements would come only when the SOPs happen, which is consistent to our practice of declaration also.

Annamalai Jayaraj

We thank all the participants. We thank Bosch management for taking time out for the call and also providing us the opportunity to host the call. Have a good day.

Soumitra Bhattacharya

Thank you.

Operator

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Linamar Q3 2022 Earnings Call Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].

I would now like to turn the conference over to Linda Hasenfratz, Executive Chair and CEO. Please go ahead.

Linda Hasenfratz

Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Joining me this afternoon are members of my executive team, Jim Jarrell, Dale Schneider, Roger Fulton, and some members of our corporate IR, marketing, finance, and legal teams. Before I begin, I'll draw your attention to the disclaimer that is currently being broadcast.

I'll start off with a review of sales, earnings and content. Sales for the quarter were $2.1 billion, up 27.5% to last year on recovering markets and market share growth. Normalized net earnings were $121 million. Earnings are up 15.5% over last year on stronger sales despite massively higher costs, a lack of subsidies in comparison to prior year, and higher SG&A and fixed costs supporting our growth strategies.

Our Industrial segment had a good quarter on the top line with sales up at both MacDon and Skyjack on stronger markets, market share growth, or better pricing, or in some cases, all of the above. We also had the benefit of a full quarter of our new agricultural business Salford. That said, higher costs related to materials, labor, freight and utilities had a major negative impact to the bottom line in the Industrial business in comparison to prior year, basically wiping out earnings growth from those stronger sales.

The Mobility business had a strong quarter thanks to strong market growth, launches and increased pricing related to cost recovery, partially offsetting associated increases in material, utility and freight costs. We continue to work with our customers globally to try to recover some of these massive cost increases, which are really dampening our earnings growth. We also felt the impact of our Mills River foundry acquisition from our JV partner, which moved this loss-making facility into operations versus it being below the line last year. We have a plan in place for steadily executing on to bring the facility to profitability inside of the next 12 to 18 months. It is good to see margins steadily improving from the low point that we saw late last year.

We saw strong growth in content per vehicle in our core North American and European regions, reaching the highest content to date in both regions, which is great to see. Launches are a big part of that, as our vehicles that we have high content on being selectively prioritized for builds by our customers. North American sales growth was particularly notable, up 44.4% over prior year and a market up 24.1%.

Commercial and Industrial sales were up 18.6% with growth at both Skyjack and MacDon on market growth or market share growth in key products. We also had our first full quarter results for Salford, helping to grow our agricultural sales.

CapEx continues to run at a higher level than last year's supporting global launches. 2022 will be up significantly from 2021, though just under our normal range of 6% to 8% of sales. 2023 will see a big tick up again from this year and will be back in our normal range.

Free cash flow was up $37 million in the quarter on strong earnings. We still expect to see solidly positive free cash flow for the full year this year on a strong back half. 2023 will also see solidly positive free cash flow. We have a very strong track record of generating free cash flow and free cash flow yield has been in the double-digit range for the last several years, which we are very proud of.

We have $1.3 billion of liquidity available to us, which is also excellent. With an active NCIB program, we increased our net debt position in comparison to last quarter despite seeing that positive free cash flow. Leverage remains very strong at just 0.46x net debt to EBITDA.

We purchased 1.8 million shares back under the NCIB in the third quarter for a year-to-date total of 3.5 million before entering Q3 blackout in early October. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity mean that we have the ability to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as they arrive in a dynamic market and drive even more growth.

Let's turn to a quick update on some of the headwinds we're facing at the moment around supply chain, energy costs, logistics and labor shortages. This slide gives you a good high-level summary of the issues and their current status. We're seeing improvement in several areas. For instance, chip shortage shutdowns are becoming less frequent, shipping costs are leveling or normalizing, commodity prices are declining, and supply chain availability improving in some areas, but it's still a challenge in others. Labor availability continues to be a challenge primarily in North America and Europe and most acutely in the U.S. Energy costs continue well above normal levels, mainly in Europe.

Looking more closely at a few of these areas, you can see on the chip impact, the predictability of volume loss has really improved. 380,000 less vehicles were built in Q3 due to chip shortages than planned at the beginning of the quarter compared to much higher figures in earlier quarters and huge impacts in Q3 of last year. That doesn't mean everyone has the chips they want. It just means they're planning less builds and getting surprised less, which is a good thing for volatility which is very disruptive. Chip availability is improving somewhat with additional capacity that has come online and more meaningful capacity will come online next year to further augment vehicle build levels impacted by the deep backlog and need to refill the pipeline of inventory on dealer lots.

You can see here trends for the commodities that most impact us here at Linamar. We're seeing good improvements in all key commodity areas such as steel and aluminum, which is a positive as well. We continue to see issues in the ability of suppliers to meet demand, notably on the industrial side, which impacts not just cost, but our ability to meet production needs for a rebounding market. It's also very disruptive on the productivity side, which is part of what is driving labor costs up. The issues are starting to improve on the MacDon side of the business as illustrated by these charts, with assembly line shortages down and header production up.

Skyjack is also seeing in general a positive trend. The problem is, for both MacDon, Skyjack and Salford, even with overall less issues, we continue to see some chronic issues repeat. And the bottom line is, if you're missing anything, you don't have a product you can ship, which is frustrating to the teams. Ocean freight costs are still well above normal levels, but we have seen costs level off in Europe, and they are definitely normalizing in Asia, where some lanes are starting to get close to early 2020 levels again.

Energy costs are still a major issue for us, notably in Europe, and have become more as an issue globally as well. We've seen a bit of softening in gas prices in Europe over the past couple of months, but are quite concerned that won't last as we head into the winter months. Regardless of the improvement, natural gas prices in Europe are still massively up over normal levels seen over the last decade. We're certainly feeling the impact of that in our European plants. Natural gas prices in the U.S. have increased as well over the past few months, which we're keeping an eye on.

On the positive side, energy costs for us are typically 1% to 2% of sales in most of our plants, but much higher of course in our foundries. In general, not a massive bleeding in our cost structure, but even something small can have a big impact if the change is substantial, which is exactly what we're seeing. It is certainly a meaningful impact for our casting and forging plants, and we are actively engaging our plants in energy conservation and operate energy projects to reduce our dependence and our costs. This is a key focus over the next 12 months.

Finally, we're continuing to see a real shortage in the availability of labor. Acceleration of retirement, insufficient immigration, and lingering effects of COVID on the number of workers is the issue. This puts pressure on costs of course, both in terms of wage inflation, but also in terms of higher recruiting and retraining costs. Unfortunately, wage inflation is not something that is transitory. To summarize on the challenges, higher labor and energy costs here, likely to stay. Shipping costs in commodities tapering back, better supply of chips, helping to enable higher and more consistent levels of vehicle builds. Obviously, the fact that some of these higher costs are not transitory means we must seek cost recoveries from our customers, and we continue to diligently pursue such. We have had some success in recent months to offset at least a portion of the cost, and we continue to pursue added relief.

I'll now turn to market outlook. Market demand is strong pretty much across the board at the moment, which is great news, and expected to be strong next year as well. Unfortunately, supply chain issues are constraining industry's ability to deliver that demand, notably on the industrial side. With strong underlying demand, I believe we'll be looking at a sustained period of strong performance for some time after these issues get resolved.

Turning to the specific markets, industry experts are predicting growing light vehicle volumes globally this year to reach 14.5 million, 46.6 million vehicles in North America and Asia, respectively, and they're expecting a slight decline in Europe to 15.6 million. This represents double-digit growth in North America, single-digit growth in Asia, and as noted, a small decline in Europe. 2023 should see mid-single-digit growth in all regions.

Semiconductor chip supply, other supply chain issues and sporadic China lockdowns continue to create volatility in customer schedules, which does put predictive volumes at risk. Industry experts are predicting on-highway medium heavy truck volumes to be up in North America this year, but down in the EU and Asia. Next year, we'll see growth in all regions, muted in North America but stronger in Europe and most robust in Asia. Industry experts predict double-digit growth in the access market globally this year in all 3 regions of North America, Europe and Asia and growth globally again next year.

Lastly, the agricultural industry is predicting 5% to 10% growth in most regions globally this year, except Europe where the outlook is flat. Most regions should see some growth next year, but likely at a bit of a slower rate for this year.

Looking at a little more detail on the auto side, you can see inventory levels in North America has picked up a little to 32 days, but are still well below the store level. Refilling the pipeline with vehicles will still be a major priority to the automakers and will take some time to get done. And looking at production levels compared to what was forecast at our last conference call, you can see a slightly stronger Q3, but basically all running out of Asia as China tries to catch up on lost production. Europe was notably softer than expected by 300,000 vehicles. Q3 ended at 21.2 million vehicles, up dramatically from last year's 16.6 million, which if you recall, was the peak impact of lost builds thanks to lack of semiconductor chips. Q4 is forecast to be similar in production to Q3, which is a little down from what was predicted last quarter, again, mainly due to Europe. For the full year 2022, it is still expected to be up now 6% up from 2021.

Looking at the access market in more detail, you can see first that both the North American and European markets showed strong double-digit growth over prior year in Q3. And as noted, expect strong double-digit growth this year globally. Asia is also growing but at a more muted level than North America and Europe in the quarter and for 2022. Next year is expected to also see double-digit growth globally but at a more muted level than 2022. Utilization in North America slowed a little during Q3 compared to 2019 levels, but are staying still plus or minus 2% at 2021 levels. Utilization levels in Europe continued to trend well about 2019 levels this year, although the gap to 2021 narrowed a little in Q3.

Our backlog at Skyjack is up meaningfully from prior year at nearly 2.5x, thanks to robust market demand. Delivery of orders is being impacted by supply chain challenges, however. As we work through these issues, we feel confident we can grow Skyjack in double digits this year and next year based on this very strong backlog. We are of course keeping a close eye on potentially shifting market conditions for 2023 in the event of an economic slowdown.

In the agricultural business, Q3 combine retails in North America are up 13% over prior year, so picking up in growth compared to earlier in the year. Experts are predicting growth in the combine header market this year in mid-single digits globally, with Europe being the only exception with a flat outlook for this year. The windrower market will also see mid-single-digit growth globally this year, driving out of strong growth in Europe and Australia, and mid-single-digit growth in North America. Other regions are flat for windrowers.

The order book at MacDon is up over last year, but meeting demand is a continued challenge for MacDon regarding supply chain and logistics issues and is a limiting factor to growth as opposed to demand. That said, our current forecast is for double-digit growth this year and next year for MacDon.

North American high horsepower tractor retails were up 12% in Q3, which is a good indicator for Salford's market segment. North American high horsepower tractor retails are expected to be up 10% this year, and the rest of the world up 5%. Europe is expected to be flat compared to last year. Overall market growth for tillage and crop nutrition equipment in North America is expected to be up 6% to 10% this year and expected to continue growing next year as well, although perhaps at a little more muted level.

Salford is seeing a strong backlog in all products, well up over prior year and a positive outlook for continued growth in 2023 based on continued market demand.

Turning to an update on growth and our outlook, you'll be pleased to know that we had another outstanding quarter in new business wins, and once again, a very strong quarter for wins in the electrified space. I will highlight a few of our more strategic wins in a moment. Electrified vehicles continue to provide great opportunities for us. We had a huge quarter in terms of business wins for battery electric and hybrid electric vehicles. In fact, in just 3 quarters this year, our new business wins for electric vehicles are well over 3x what they were for all of 2021. Momentum is clearly building in our portfolio of these important vehicles in the future. At this point, 51% of booked sales in 2026 in our mobility business is for non-ICE powertrains. That's a huge shift from less than 25% in that category last year.

With respect to launches, we're seeing ramping volumes on launching programs, which are predicted to reach 30% to 40% of mature levels this year, generating incremental sales of $500 million to $600 million. Next year, we'll see incremental sales growth of $800 million to $900 million. These programs will peak at more than $5 billion in sales. We saw a shift of nearly $330 million of programs moving from launch to production last quarter, more than offset by very strong business wins seen in the quarter.

As usual, we're summarizing all of these expectations on our outlook slide now being displayed. With strong markets and market share growth, we are expecting to see double-digit growth on the top line in 2022. We continue to expect a strong back half of the year with double-digit earnings growth as well, but not enough to drive EPS growth for the full year, which will stay overall flat to 2021. We do expect to see double-digit top and bottom-line growth next year. This drove double-digit growth at both Skyjack and MacDon this year, coupled with solid launches in a growing market on the Mobility side. Next year, we will see continued growth in both segments as well. Net margins will contract somewhat compared to last year on the back of higher material, energy, freight, and labor costs. Next year, net margins will see expansion as some of these issues resolve. We will also see continued positive free cash flow this year and next year, leaving us in an excellent position from which to drive further growth.

Looking specifically at Q4, you should expect sales down compared to Q3 of this year but meaningfully up from Q4 of last year. The mobility segment will see sales at best flat to Q3 2022 but meaningfully up from last year's Q4. The Industrial segment similarly will see sales -- while they'll see sales seasonally down from Q3 2022, but also significantly up from prior year. On the net earnings side, you can expect Q4 to be down compared to Q3 but significantly up from prior year based on these sales changes. Similarly, net margins will be down from Q3 of this year, but up from prior year. Industrial margins are the driver on declines from Q3 as they will be seasonally down and mobility margins flat. Similarly, industrial margins are driving the comparison to prior year as they will be significantly better in Q4 than the loss that we saw in Q4 last year, offsetting mobility margins which will be down in comparison to last year.

Roger would like me to remind you that the situation is very dynamic and the impact is not fully determinable in terms of their impact at this point. Notable risk areas are supply chain, labor shortages, lockdowns in China, and geopolitical risk.

Moving on to new business wins on the mobility side, I'll highlight a few of our more interesting wins this quarter. First up, we won several different programs in shafts and differential cases for transmission programs worth in aggregate more than $55 million a year in revenue. These programs are launching in a variety of facilities in Canada, in Hungary, and in Germany over the next year. Secondly, we have a full series of different wins for a variety of battery electric vehicle programs, which we will be launching in Canada, China, and Mexico, representing close to $130 million in annual sales.

Finally, we won a very a significant program for a large structural component for a battery electric vehicle. This program is quite meaningful in both size and sales potential and will necessitate the building of a new facility to house it. We are in the process of finalizing the planning for this facility, and we'll have more information for you on our next call. This is an exciting new area of expansion for us with great growth potential.

Turning to an innovation update, I'm excited to share some exciting progress on our Flexform Hydrogen Storage Tank. The conformable tank, which is currently in an R&D phase, offers distinct packaging advantages for fuel cell electrified vehicle applications, and it remains a significant long-term opportunity for us in the electrified fuel cell vehicle space. Progress continues with the product certification roadmap as well as the development of the manufacturing process. Currently, we're targeting a production-ready solution to take to the market by the end of next year. The tank was recently displayed at the IAA Transportation Show for commercial trucks in Germany. It, along with all of our eLIN product portfolio, is gaining attention from our customers.

Next, the Skyjack team continues to expand their customer-focused technology offering by building on their reputation of simple, reliable engineered solutions for the AWD market. We've outlined in the past how our ELEVATE telematic solution helps equipment operators better manage their fleet. Now the Sky360 video tech support feature gets added as another customer focused technology meant to improve efficiency within their operations. Tech support expertise is available remotely via the Sky360 video feed, enabling quicker equipment troubleshooting. Sky360 is currently being rolled out on a global basis.

And lastly, MacDon's work on advanced technologies continues with the introduction of 2 Trimble-based GPS guidance systems. The 2 systems, one a value application, and the second a high-performance option, are being introduced on the Model Year 2023 M1 self-propelled windrowers. The new guidance system accessory option aids operators with improved efficiency in the field and helps to reduce operational fatigue in the cab. Another great example of precision technologies in the ag sector.

Finally, we continue to execute on our global digitization journey with more and more connected machines, data connections, and robots being commissioned in our global plants every day.

With that, I'm going to turn it over to our CFO, Dale Schneider, to lead us through a more in-depth financial review. Over to you, Dale.

Dale Schneider

Thank you, Linda, and good afternoon, everyone. As Linda noted, Q3 was a great quarter for sales and earnings despite the continuation of the supply issues that are impacting both the sales and other costs for earnings net of any recoveries we received in the quarter from our customers. Q3 was another positive quarter for cash generation as well. And as a result, we were able to maintain a strong level of liquidity at $1.3 billion.

For the quarter, sales increased 27.5% to $2.1 billion. Earnings are normalized for any FX gains or losses related to the revaluation of the balance sheet and any potential other items that may have occurred. In the quarter, earnings were normalized for FX gains related to the revaluation of the balance sheet, which impacted EPS by $0.19 per share.

Normalized operating earnings for the quarter were $168.4 million. This compares to $150.7 million in Q3 '21, an increase of $17.7 million or 11.7%. Normalized net earnings increased $16.2 million or 15.5% in the quarter to $121 million. Fully diluted normalized EPS increased $0.31 or 19.4% to $1.91.

Included in earnings for the quarter was a foreign exchange gain of $16.3 million, which is a result of a $17 million gain for the revaluation of operating balances and a $700,000 loss on the revaluation of financing balances. As I mentioned, the FX gain impacted the quarter by $0.19 per EPS.

From a business segment perspective, the Q3 gain of $17 million related to the revaluation of operating balances was a result of a $10.4 million gain in Industrial and a $6.6 million gain in Mobility.

Further looking at the segments, Industrial sales increased by 22.9% or $99.5 million to $533.4 million in the quarter. The sales increase in the quarter was primarily due to the acquisition of Salford, which we had our first full quarter of sales. The higher sales achieved to help relieve the -- sorry, the higher sales prices achieved to help relieve the current supply cost pressures, higher agricultural sales driven by both market and market share gains. And finally, stronger volumes on the access equipment sales.

Normalized Industrial operating earnings in the quarter increased $1.4 million or 1.9% over last year to $74.3 million. The primary drivers impacting Industrial sales was the increased contribution from strong agricultural equipment volumes, the sales from the Salford acquisition, the increased contribution of the higher access equipment volumes, which these are partially offset by the ongoing supply issues impacting raw materials, freight and utilities, the lack of government support this year for COVID-19 and an increase in costs from Skyjack manufacturing expanding into Mexico and China.

Turning to Mobility, sales increased $353.6 million or 29.2% over last year to $1.6 billion. The sales increase in the third quarter was driven by the stronger volumes on the improving customer supply chain situation, cost recoveries achieved from our customer negotiations, the increased volumes on launching programs, and other certain high-volume mature programs. The sales impact of the fully consolidated Mills River location, but now it's 100% owned. And these were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in FX rates last year.

Q3 normalized earnings for Mobility were higher by $16.3 million or 21% over last year. In the quarter, Mobility earnings were impacted by the increased contribution on the improving supply chain issues. The increased contribution on the higher launch and mature volumes, the positive impact from changes in FX rates since last year, and these were partially offset by the lack of government support for COVID-19 this year. The operating earnings impact of fully consolidating our Mills River facility, increased SG&A costs that are supporting our growth, and the increased raw material, utilities and freight costs net of our customer recoveries.

Returning to the overall Linamar results, the company's gross margin was $277.9 million, an increase of $42.4 million compared to last year, mainly due to the same factors that drove the segment results. Cost of goods sold amortization expense for the third quarter increased slightly to $110 million. COGS amortization as a percent of sales though did decrease to 5.2%. Selling and general administration costs increased in the quarter to $108.7 million from $85 million last year. This is primarily the result of the incremental SG&A costs from both our Salford and our Mills River acquisitions. The increased costs related to the management and sales costs that are supporting our growth, increased travel as the global restrictions continue to relax, and the fact that we had no government support for COVID-19 this year.

Financing expenses increased $7 million since last year, mainly due to the additional interest expense related to the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Fed rate hikes, the increased debt due to acquisitions and the share buyback program this year, and the negative impact of changes in FX rates on our debt since last year. The consolidated effective interest rate for Q3 was 2.8%. The effective tax rate for the third quarter decreased to 24.5% compared to last year, primarily due to the decrease in nondeductible expenses in the quarter, a decrease in tax expense now that GFL is fully owned, and these are partially offset by an unfavorable mix of foreign tax rates. We are expecting the 2022 full year effective tax rate to also be in the range of 24% to 26% and consistent with our full year rate of last year.

Linamar's cash position was $856 million on September 30, an increase of $50 million compared to last year. The third quarter generated $118.3 million in cash from operating activities, along with proceeds from debt being used to fund CapEx and the share buybacks. As a result, net debt to EBITDA increased to 0.46x in the quarter from negative 0.01x a year ago, mainly due to the acquisitions in Q2 and the activity on the non-course issuer bid this year. Based on our current estimates, we are expecting 2022 to maintain our strong balance sheet and leverage should remain low.

The non-available credit on our credit facilities is $435 million at the end of the quarter. Our liquidity at the end of Q3 does remain strong at $1.3 billion. As a result, we do currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our financial obligations for this year.

To recap, sales and earnings for the quarter was a story of improving markets and increasing market share in both segments. The supply shortages that have been hampering the OEM production requirements have started to see improvements, adding additional Mobility sales and earnings. The supply-related cost increase continued to impact both segment's earnings. The good news is that the cost increases started to temper with the price increases that we've achieved in Industrial and the cost recoveries we've achieved in Mobility. Despite these challenges and with the 2 acquisitions in Q2, we were still able to maintain a strong level of liquidity at $1.3 billion. That concludes my commentary, and I'd now like to open up the call for questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Mark Neville with Scotiabank.

Mark Neville

Good results. Maybe if I start with -- maybe start with Industrial. There was a pretty significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in the margin. Sales were up a bit, but maybe can you just speak to sort of the main drivers behind and beyond that, again sequentially?

Linda Hasenfratz

Yes. I mean sales were up -- a big part of it was really the sales growth. Yes, normalized margins are up, but when you have a big pop in sales, a lot of that falls to the bottom line. Secondly, we saw a stronger mix in our agricultural business compared to the Skyjack business where the margins are better. I'd say those 2 things would be really the key factors.

Mark Neville

Okay. Got it. And then, again, maybe the same question for auto. But the margins I think were down sequentially. Sales were basically flat. I think you had some cost recoveries. Again, I'm just maybe just curious to some of the headwinds sequentially. I'm guessing energy, but just curious to hear your thoughts.

Linda Hasenfratz

Yes, you exactly identified it. It's really just a reflection of continued cost escalation, notably in Europe on the energy side. Energy cost up in Europe, that's definitely a key factor. Material cost increases from suppliers in a variety of areas would also be a factor. It's just a reflection of the continued cost escalation.

Mark Neville

Okay. And maybe just one last one, just on the guidance. For 2022, I think it's flat normalized earnings I think for the year, versus last year, you're still down about $1. I guess just my sort of back of the envelope math, it would put Q4 around $1.90, which would be flat quarter-over-quarter. But you're suggesting down. So just -- again, I don't know if I've got some of my numbers are off, but I'm just sort of curious if you could speak to that.

Linda Hasenfratz

Yes. I mean, we're looking at normalized EPS that we believe can be flat to prior year. I think there is a lot of pressure on Q4 so I'm taking a little bit of a conservative outlook on it, notably in Europe where we're already seeing a little bit of softening in terms of customer schedules and I'm a little bit worried about where that's going to go.

Operator

Your next question comes from Peter Sklar with BMO Capital Markets.

Peter Sklar

In terms, on the Mobility segment, in terms of commercial recoveries, how do you think that impacted your quarter in Q3 versus Q2? Did you get a bit of a bump? Just the cadence of recoveries was more in Q3 versus Q2? Or it's about the same? Or it's really hard to tell?

Linda Hasenfratz

I would say it was pretty similar in terms of the cost recoveries.

Jim Jarrell

Yes. I would think it's -- yes, that's accurate. Very, very similar.

Peter Sklar

Okay. I think on the last call, you said pricing, you took some price on Skyjack products in May. And I'm just wondering if there's been any further price taken since that May price increase?

Jim Jarrell

No. Basically, we reset some of those, Peter, in May, as you just correctly said. So that has not changed since then. There is some refresh going into '23, which would be across sort of all the industrial businesses that we have. That would be coming into effect, but nothing more at Skyjack as of after May.

Linda Hasenfratz

Normally, those increases happen on an annual basis in January. You know, it's pretty unusual that we had a price increase midyear.

Peter Sklar

This year, there would have been the normal January increase plus May?

Jim Jarrell

Yes.

Peter Sklar

Okay. And similarly in Ag, when do you put through price on the agricultural equipment side, typically?

Jim Jarrell

Typically, at the start of the year.

Peter Sklar

And was there anything additional taken in May on the Ag side?

Jim Jarrell

No.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Krista Friesen with CIBC.

Krista Friesen

Congrats on a great quarter. I was just wondering on the CPV, obviously quite strong. Is this a new normal that we could expect going forward? Or was it just early beneficial mix this quarter? Or what can we -- how can we think about that?

Linda Hasenfratz

Yes. I mean it does pop around a little bit depending on what customers are building. As we've been seeing, frankly, for a while, really since the chip issue struck, our customers are preferring to build the vehicles that we have more content on. That has shifted our content up, cost recoveries have shifted our content up. It can shift if those vehicles are no longer selectively being built, so that's obviously a potential downside to it. But I mean, we do have the cost recoveries, which continue to flow through.

Krista Friesen

Okay. That's great. And then I was also just wondering on the labor front, obviously that's a bit of a headwind. Are you having issues actually getting labor and is that capping any sort of production? Or is it just the fact that you have the labor, but to keep it you need to pay higher wages?

Linda Hasenfratz

I'd say it's a combination. I mean there's definitely a shortage of people in the workforce, particularly in the U.S. most notably I would say, but in Canada as well. And we're seeing shortages in Europe as well. It's an ongoing issue, which is definitely a frustration.

Jim Jarrell

Yes. I would just add that it's -- we need to keep the people too. When some of the supply chain issues happen or releases that customers change because of semiconductor or their supply chain, the people you have to keep, you can no longer use that as a variable. It's more of a fixed situation just because we have to retain them and recruit. I would say, for us, North America, Europe are definitely having that labor concern. Asia is a little insulated from it though.

Dale Schneider

Yes. And I would add that with the shortage of -- our inability to recruit people to hire, it just means we're working extra overtime, so that's adding to the cost as well.

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Brian Morrison with TD Securities.

Brian Morrison

I might have missed this at the beginning of the call, but it looks to me like Mills River had about a 150-basis point impact upon the operating margin of Mobility. And I'm just curious, when will Mills River get to profitability? And is the target operating margin to be in line with the Mobility segment?

Linda Hasenfratz

Yes. We have a solid plan in place for getting Mills River into a profitable position. I mentioned in my comments that we're expecting that to happen in the next 12 to 18 months. There's a lot of work to do and we're clicking away at it, but we do expect that we're going to get there.

Jim Jarrell

Yes. I think, Brian, just a couple of things. It has a really solid book of business there. It's got great assets that we can market. These are bigger sort of structural-type presses that we can use for the marketplace. It's just really restructuring the business from a cost side and from a pricing side in the market. And that -- it just takes time to do that. And I think, again, the 12 to 18 months, as Linda said, is a pretty good timeframe.

Brian Morrison

And should we see a gradual improvement from current to…

Jim Jarrell

Yes.

Brian Morrison

Okay, so it would be a tailwind as we go forward is what I'm getting at?

Jim Jarrell

Yes.

Brian Morrison

Okay. I guess the next question is, in terms of your outlook for energy, European energy prices, it's nice to see them come down. What is baked into your assumptions for Q4 and 2023? Are we going to see them -- are you assuming that they essentially get passed through?

Linda Hasenfratz

We're assuming that the existing energy prices stay, so we're not forecasting in a reduction. In fact, I think there's more risk that they come back up. We're still working with customers to try to come to agreements around pass-throughs on cost recovery. Some we've been able to negotiate energy pass-throughs and others we're still working on.

Jim Jarrell

It's a real tricky one to be perfectly blunt about it. Because we are predicting to pass through, I mean, what we get in increases. However, nobody knows what those increases are. Customers are sort of thinking this is going to get worked out with government intervention and things like that. We've been very factual and given all the data to the customers in saying, look, here's where our base is. And from there, let's have it index or flex. And we're working with every customer on this today because it's really unknown. It's not really predictable, Brian, what's going on. There is outlooks, and then as Linda said, it went down a little bit, which was interesting because we thought it was going to go up. It's not really predictable. But our plan is to pass on. And then also, as Linda said, mitigate with our own energy conservation ideas, solar, other ways of creating energy, so we're on that as well.

Linda Hasenfratz

And to be clear, in terms of forecasting, if we have an agreement, we forecast that we're passing it on, but we don't have agreements everywhere.

Brian Morrison

Okay. And then last question, just housekeeping. I jumped on the call just a bit late, so I missed the beginning introductory remarks. But just last question is, can you just remind me of the entry into service of your Skyjack facilities in China and Mexico? And maybe provide an update on the time to ramp those to maturity?

Jim Jarrell

Yes. China, we are actually -- we've had our first unit come off the line in our LTJ plant in Tianjin. We're ramping that up probably through Q1. And that's just on one scissor product line. And then we have in China as well an adjacent site that we're building a facility, and that will take us through to '24 to get all the product lines going there. And then in Mexico, we basically will be starting up probably let's say mid next year with telehandlers. And then, again, by the end of '24, have all the product lines down in place in Mexico.

Linda Hasenfratz

The build in China, it's like the new plant build is still underway. Like where these original, or these initial products, we are going to -- we're running out of our existing facility.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. Please proceed.

Linda Hasenfratz

Okay. Great. Well, to conclude this evening, I'd like to leave you, as always, with 3 key messages. First, we are thrilled to once again be delivering double-digit top and bottom-line growth this quarter. Secondly, we continue to execute very successfully on our strategy to grow our electrified vehicle content with over $1 billion in new business wins secured already this year and more than half of our booked sales in 2026 already, not ICE powertrain. Finally, we are proud of the market share growth we are seeing in our businesses, notably the record levels of content per vehicle were seeing in our automotive business. Thanks very much and have a great evening.

Peter Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co.

Peter Arment

Welcome, everyone. Thanks for joining us here this morning. My name is Peter Arment. I'm the Senior Aerospace Defence Analyst here at Baird. We are delighted to have Honeywell International here with us. And with -- from Honeywell, we have the President and CEO of Honeywell Building Technologies Doug Wright. Doug is a long-time industry veteran, 16 years. I think in so ran half a dozen years at UTC and another other bunch of other companies around the industry and he spent 8 years in China. So he is a wealth of knowledge, and we are absolutely delighted that here. So we're Doug, welcome.

Douglas Wright

Thank you, Peter. Like to see everyone.

Question-and-Answer Session

Q - Peter Arment

Thanks again. So I want to start high level, just kind of talk first kind of end markets, if you don't mind. Maybe just what you're seeing from a demand standpoint in the commercial building space. And if you want to like think about it from just a regional or global, breaking them around the globe, that would be great. I think helpful to level set up.

Douglas Wright

Sure. I would say, in general, demand in -- with the exception of Europe, demand in the world is kind of pretty stable in the high-growth regions, which we define as kind of India, Middle East, China, kind of Southeast Asia, we're still seeing mid-teens organic order growth across our entire Honeywell buildings Enterprise. Europe is going through some challenges, particularly with the energy transition there and some of the impact of the situation there. Nothing really falling off of a cliff, but there's clearly some softening there.

North America is still quite solid. In our -- I mean, talking about our order growth rates, we're -- we have to factor in that our backlogs are coming up such a high peak from a couple of quarters ago that sometimes it's hard to see in the order trends because we printed 3% organic growth as an enterprise in Q3, but still mid-teens for the year. So what really happened was is that there was a lot of -- it wasn't really a channel inventory provisioning. It was really, I think customers are giving us less lead time now because they know that the supply chain is getting a little bit better. So -- so overall, I think Europe is kind of our -- kind of our yellow flag that we're kind of monitoring the rest of the world is still quite strong.

Peter Arment

That's excellent. You mentioned the high-growth regions. Just how should we think about just -- Honeywell has always kind of had this focus in the high-growth regions and it's really kind of continued to grow exceptionally over the years. But just how do you think about it in your framework?

Douglas Wright

So first of all, Honeywell has a pretty long history of being in a, call it, challenging parts of the world to operate for decades. And so we have -- we're driving a little bit almost 1/3 of our growth out of high-growth regions. And it's really, I think, a differentiator for Honeywell. And I'd say that as someone who competed with Honeywell in these regions in a good part of my career. We play a long game. We invest in talent. We invest in local production capabilities in most of those places. China, we're almost completely localized in our product portfolio. India, we're manufacturing a substantial portion of what we do there. Even in the Middle East, we're building -- we're provisioning now to start having local products there. So it's part of our nature that we are -- we go local for local, probably earlier than some of our counterparts. And that really benefits us when we go through these cycles where there's still really strong demand available to us to go tap into those markets. And when developed markets slow down, it gives us a bit of a buffer to balance the portfolio out.

Peter Arment

And is most of the growth in those regions just new product adoption? Or how do you think about that one.

Douglas Wright

Well, I mean, I mean, we said the normal trends that have been secular for a long time, urbanization, whether it's in the Middle East, we've been very active in Egypt recently. They're doing a lot of new city development.

China has been on that trend for a long time. I think what's really probably the most interesting right now in high-growth regions and maybe it's not well understood is that -- they are -- all of them are just as active in green -- the greening of their built environment, the commercial buildings as is in the West. I mean, China is probably the most aggressive at provisioning for putting technology in the buildings to manage their carbon commitments, even in the Middle East, which is -- which surprised me over the last couple of years is that they become very focused on greening of their building.

And so sustainability, which we started the new business unit earlier this year, that was really an intentional investment to prioritize sustainable buildings and the HGRs are actually -- the high-growth regions are actually, in some ways, leading that charge because they have a little bit more bias towards new construction. So the adoption of new technology is a little more straightforward than in more of an aftermarket situation that we have in Western Europe, as an example.

Peter Arment

Do you expect just kind of staying within -- just thinking about private institutional kind of nonresidential end markets. How do you think the differences are between like, say, private versus nonresidential end markets when we're kind of thinking about a potential economic slowdown as we get into next year?

Douglas Wright

Yes. We've been having this discussion quite a lot internally that -- so we look at the macro data in places like Europe that's starting to flash some yellow signals or the private investment, whether it's commercial real estate, residential particularly, we're not really -- we don't have an exposure to residential, but in privately owned real estate, corporate call the CRE market, they'll be affected by interest rate policy and by the economy just like you would expect them to.

But institutional demand is actually accelerating. And part of the reason is that the institutional buildings are generally owner-operated and they are quite concerned about their energy cost and their sustainability objective that you're getting from the whatever government -- all the regional governments are driving codes and standards around energy consumption and buildings as an example.

So I think there's -- institutional demand is quite strong. And then just because of the policy, so you have Fit for 55 in Europe, you have the IRA in the U.S. you have China green building standards. There's a lot of, I'd say, prioritization within the regulators. But then you have this unique situation where a lot of stimulus came into the economies before we had any recession signals with -- because of the pandemic policies.

So there's a huge amount of investment in the pipeline for K-12 schools in the U.S. or hospitals in Italy, and we're seeing pockets where the institutional demand is still quite robust. A big part of our business is institutional building. So we feel like that will buffer us a bit from some of what we're going to probably see in the the private side of the construction economy.

Peter Arment

That's super helpful. Let's talk -- it's -- so you competed against Honeywell and now you're with Honeywell. So let's -- how do we think about HBT is kind of how they differentiate from just, say, other HVAC players or other power equipment players? How do you frame it up?

Douglas Wright

So we're not an HVAC business. We don't -- we sell -- we install and maintain HVAC equipment in our service business, which is, I mean, our direct service business is $1.5 billion enterprise. So we certainly service HVAC and we provide. But our differentiation is a work controls company. We do automation and controls and whether that's through traditional controls or through now more software and artificial intelligence-based controls, that's really our value add to our customers because if you think about the sustainability problem in a building, we have 2 issues. First is the efficiency of the equipment and the other is how much you use that equipment. So one is sort of I need a better -- I want to put in a variable speed drive or a more efficient chiller or better lighting system to take out the thermodynamic efficiency benefits that we can get from those things, and we benefit from those, and we provide those to our customers, but we don't -- that's not our kind of engineering edge.

Our technology edge is the controls. So for every building that doesn't have the right level of controls in it, it's wasting a lot of energy, overcooling, overheating, overfiltering, overlighting. And we -- through controls, we can differentiate. So our heritages is in controls. And one of the advantages that gives us with our customers is no matter what investments they've made in their built environment, our job is to come and make it better. And we do that through controls.

We have our opinion about which equipment is best, and we have different partnerships in different parts of the world. But we have to be -- we're agnostic to those choices. So it gives us a little bit of a -- probably a more position of trust with our customers. It allows us to be a little bit different than the traditional players.

Peter Arment

Right. And maybe just in this era of cloud and SaaS and your kind of SaaS capabilities, maybe how does that allow you to kind of really differentiate?

Douglas Wright

Well, I think it's really a couple of things. Number one, we were able to use SaaS or software technology really in 2 ways to really create a lot of productivity for the customer. One is that we can automate things to -- there are 2 big issues that most of our customers are dealing with.

One is the sustainability problem we've already talked about, but the other is labor shortages. Technician labor for buildings in any service industry, but particularly in building service initiative pretty highly technical jobs for service technicians to have. So we can use software to automate, we can use more remote, we have technology to allow us to remotely diagnose and change set points and we've proven with technology that we can reduce our truck rolls. We have service technicians all over the world. And we have -- sometimes we have to do traditional service, rolling a truck and repairing something.

We've been able to reduce our truck rolls by nearly 60% by having automation and remote management capability. And then the second real advantage that we bring to the table as a country is that artificial intelligence. And if you have -- once you get the architecture of your system so that you can talk to everything in a building, you can apply AI, ML capabilities. And what that allows us to do is introduce new controls that don't exist today.

So I can now optimize between air quality sensors, lighting controls, motion sensors and HVAC. I couldn't do that with -- in the traditional where each system was independent with its own kind of what we call deterministic linear algorithm running, high-low kind of set points. Now with better software, we can now solve problems that we couldn't solve today -- before.

We can now optimize between air quality set points, which are really important in schools as an example right now and energy. And there's a -- traditionally, we would just open the window or change the luber or change the thermostat. Now we can automate that and we can actually deliver better value with software.

Peter Arment

Right. Right. Thinking about my old school, I think he was never right here all that. This is a big audience here. So maybe some may not be familiar with some of your wins, some of the recent developments that you've had. Maybe you could highlight a few of those just I think, as you have such a broad exposure here.

Douglas Wright

Yes. I think probably the one -- the area that we're most engaged in with sustainability is we're doing a lot of work with schools. So an example would be -- I think one we're using is the Phoenix Union School District, where this is a legacy customer. We've been servicing their HVAC and their lighting and their buildings and their security systems for many years. And with the pandemic, we had a new problem we had to solve and that was that the air quality standards have been raised by the regulators. We're measuring -- we're having to now measure things like PM2.5 and VOCs in the air that we didn't have to do before. We were just managing CO2 for basically for efficiency performance.

So we had introduced -- we've introduced new technology that allows the customer to optimize their air quality set points and their energy consumption and let them have visibility to -- and make better choices about which playbook they want to run. If kids are in the school and they want to meet all of the current , air quality standards, which are a lot stricter than they were before the pandemic, then they can set that -- they can choose that set point.

But when the kids go out to recess out of the room, they can now -- the system will automatically ramp down that air flow and, therefore, that energy consumption that's cleaning that air. So we're able to now give them a -- help them square the circle, which is how do I not have my energy bill double when thermodynamically if I want to -- I want to have twice as clean air, I need to, but I can use controls to now balance that equation better.

So that's one example of -- and we're dealing with school systems all over the country and a number in Europe where we're deploying this new kind of AI software capabilities to optimize their system. So we're pretty proud of our work there with the Phoenix Union and there's a number of other school systems that many of you probably send your school -- your kids to that we're also actively working with the same type of technology.

I think the other area that maybe outside of the sustainability equation is, I think we also are -- I mean a very significant part of our business is actually like safety. And we're a leader in the fire protection business and we take a lot of pride in the fact that a lot of the work that our team members do helps protect our families and our communities from fire risk. And we made an investment recently in a company that is allowing us to now take the technology that we have in the building and connect it to the first responders in an automated way.

So now we believe that we can, through technology and software, we can now get a first responder to a scene of an incident faster in a matter -- in this industry, seconds count, if a house is on fire or if someone is having a heart attack, the faster we can get first responders to the -- and what we -- the way I would sort of articulate it is, is that we look at these ecosystems as an opportunity to use automation and controls and software to solve a problem.

So whether I'm solving -- it's actually the same concept that we use to reduce the energy consumption in the building and balancing air quality. We do use the same concepts from a software and a digitization standpoint to actually allow that system in the building to give information to a first responder on their way to the route. So -- in fact, I'm going to be meeting tomorrow with some folks, some fire department here in Chicago and talking about technology with them.

So this is an area that I'm pretty proud of that the team has done. And while we talk a lot about sustainability appropriately, I think we also recognize that we're an important -- we bring a lot of digitization to our life safety technologies as well.

Peter Arment

So your last stat I saw was that roughly 10 million buildings roughly. I think is a number that I've seen historically kind of an installed base in general for HBT. So how do you think about the differences and just sort of like those examples like retrofitting versus kind of new building disruption?

Douglas Wright

Well, of course, the majority of our work is in existing buildings. In the high-growth regions, it's more biased towards new construction. And it's -- frankly, new construction is easier to deploy new technology in. And I think what art form is to be able to bring the benefits of the technology that we have into, let's say, a hotel like we're standing in today, to be able to bring the benefits without breaking the bank because you can't just go rewire everything and put in new systems, the cost is too high.

So majority of our work is in legacy buildings and we go into a typical school system, they'll have 400 buildings, use places like Miami, Dade, 400 buildings. They've got 7 or 8 generations of technology in those buildings. And we have to come in, figure out a way to attach to that and control that because we can't just say we're going to be sustainable buildings for the new kind of big corporate headquarters like we have in Charlotte. We also have to go to the 1960s construction elementary school down the street here and also help them solve their.

Now realistically, we can't do the same carbon mitigation because there's limitations to what the base building can -- how the base building can perform, but we have to figure out a way to do that. And most of our work is actually in dealing with retrofitting existing buildings, not the new construction.

Peter Arment

That's helpful. Maybe we could talk about some of HBT's kind of breakthrough initiatives that's allowing you to kind of impact your -- and drive growth? I know you've got a number of different initiatives going on with that.

Douglas Wright

Yes. So we use -- we have this concept of Honeywell called breakthrough initiatives, where we we -- it's really an organizational model. We try to -- how do you -- in a large enterprise with 20,000 employees, how do you create an incubation capability to protect new ideas from the bureaucracy and systems of a big organization.

So we use -- we call the BTI teams and our sustainable buildings group that's now going to be a $1 billion business in a few years, that started out of a breakthrough initiative. It was, ""Hey, how can we take -- we had some technology over here. We have to go learn about a new way to apply it into this new value proposition."" So we form a team and it started out with literally like 3 or 4 people, and now it's a big organization that's now being instrumented into the main army.

The one we're working on now is, we have another active BTI where we are actually trying to -- the example I talked about with the life safety, where we can basically provide technology to first responders, letting them know where people are in a building. So our systems can actually -- we can tell with some sensor array in this building, we can see which buildings -- which rooms are occupied, that's useful information to a first responder before they arrive. So we've got a BTI working on that.

And we have another one that is working on a new technology. So these -- everybody has -- we promoted these plug outlets in buildings today. Well, everything that's plugged into 1 of these outlets is actually consuming power, even when it's not being used, it's called parasitic power loss. In some buildings, that's actually a fairly significant portion of the carbon or the electrical consumption. In a school, particularly, there's always a lot of things plugged in and the rooms unoccupied.

So we actually have a new BTI we just kicked off recently where we now actually control that. So we can connect that system to our control system and know that, okay, this room is unoccupied. So turn off the music amplifier in the music room of the school, which is only occupied for 2 hours a day, but that equipment is always plugged in. So that's an example. That's actually a -- so we have a legacy business that just makes electrical equipment plugs that go into buildings.

It's actually a big business in Europe. It's not so big here in the U.S. And our team basically has come up with an idea that they can now turn that off remotely through controls to save -- and we've demonstrated that we can reduce the electric consumption in some of these locations by 20% just by -- with no change to the performance of the building, just by turning things off because the kids leave them plugged in.

Peter Arment

It's incredible. So you mentioned that $1 billion -- I was going to ask you about that, the $1 billion business. How do we think about that growth outlook when you think about it over the next few years, yes?

Douglas Wright

It will -- we -- I think in our growth in our Investor Day, we talked about this. We anticipate that, that will be a $1 billion business within the next, I guess, probably 2 years now, 3 years of that when we said at that time. So we've got about 2 years to go, we'll definitely be above a bit. Our pipeline is in excess of that now.

We learned a lot through the healthy -- if you think about what sustainable build -- we call sustainable buildings today, you go back during the early stages of the pandemic, we called it healthy buildings. That was our original focus was making the building healthy. And then we've now learned that actually building health and energy consumption are interconnected. So we've created sustainable buildings.

So it will definitely be -- it's -- maybe we'll get a little bit early, but I think our call right now is within 2 years, will be $1 billion business and that we will call HBT.

Peter Arment

Right. Well, given that it's election day, I feel like I should ask about the Inflation Reduction Act, something on actual bill that got passed in Congress. Do you think you have any impact on your business? Or how should we think about that?

Douglas Wright

Every -- I think it's a positive for our industry. I mean the establishing clarity of the investment and whether it's electric vehicles which are becoming -- which are definitely coming into the building technologies and the upgrade funds that are being made available. There's a lot of -- you talked about the built environment. There's a lot of buildings in need of upgrade in the U.S.

And so IRA will definitely -- I think it also establishes some policy clarity around things like -- EV is going to really get the right number of chargers to enable the electrification of the vehicle fleet. That's now for our industry now going to drive -- we believe that EVs will become a part of the building system because the whole -- our whole vehicle economy has got to shift from fueling in between work and home and now either fueling at home or at work.

So we're -- as employers, we're going to have to provision for this in our buildings, and it's actually a really complicated control problem. When you talk -- when you think about the amount of energy that now you've got to pull into the building to provision for these vehicles. So that's something that back to the IRA. That's something that -- now that there's investments being made available for those types of systems, I expect we'll see that as a benefit. So it's all upside for us.

Peter Arment

Okay. Let's move. That's helpful. On pricing, just maybe just broadly, how is pricing faring across your businesses? Just with the backdrop of inflation. I think that's always helpful for everyone.

Douglas Wright

So over the last -- we learned a lot about pricing mechanics over the last couple of years as we went through this supply chain crisis and inflation went along with it. We've been -- we've been fortunate. Our teams have been pretty on the ball in terms of, first of all, understanding where the inflation was coming from and when because it wasn't trivial. It wasn't like that all the suppliers just called up and say, we're raising your prices by 10%. It was some of that as well as some suppliers saying, I don't have anything. So now we have to go to the broker market and buy -- we buy chips on the open market.

So it's sort of that understanding inflation, and that's where our digital investments within Honeywell for internal capabilities allowed us to have maybe a little bit more presence than some of our counterparts in the industry. So we actually went -- we knew the inflation was coming. I think we've demonstrated that our technology is -- because we're a leader in our technologies, we were able to have pretty good pricing power and we were able to stay ahead of the curve.

I think as we go forward, we'll run the same playbook. I think inflation will -- we expect it to be moderate this next year. So we won't have -- we won't be driving -- needed to drive the price levers as hard. But if we're wrong and the inflation continues to grow, then we'll run the same playbook.

So it's been a good story, I think, for us. And across Honeywell, I think we've demonstrated our ability to kind of stay ahead of the inflation curve and we'll continue to do that.

Peter Arment

Yes. You guys have been, across the board, have been leading on the pricing side. Maybe it's just in our remaining couple of minutes just talk margins, just you're a leading margin player in the industry. Maybe just talk about kind of your systems in place to allow you to continue to have strong margins and just any kind of long-term goals that you think about?

Douglas Wright

Well, I think the Honeywell operating system, it's really just -- it's about simple processes applied with rigor. I mean we focus diligently on making sure we have the right technology and then we manufacture it in the right place at the right cost. And I know I've been in this electronic manufacturing initiative for quite a long time. Our operations people are just really good at driving their costs out of the product. And I think the -- we run very rigorous plan.

My CFO, who's here, we just had our annual operating plan first pass review with my boss yesterday as it is. And we're talking about, hey, are we -- we're now looking at our demand profile in some regions where we're looking -- some potential softness and we're building contingency plans for what cost actions we have to take to do that. And we have a very rigorous repositioning process that we -- playbook that we run when that -- when we start seeing those storm clouds.

So I think we have -- I mean the foundation of why our margins are high is that our technology is better, I think, but we're also, as part of Honeywell, we have an operating system that gives us a bit of an additional edge that we just -- we are -- this company is run by general managers and we drive those margins up. And I think we've been fortunate that we've been able to sustain over the last several years that sort of steady march toward our sort of our commit that we made at the beginning of the year, mid-20s, sustained operating margins, and we'll hit that.

Peter Arment

And then just lastly -- last minute here, may just any last minute kind of your kind of takeaway from a wrap-up of Q3, just kind of where you -- how you see the year kind of trending and I think that would be helpful.

Douglas Wright

So I think we -- I think we're in pretty good shape to deliver really solid organic sales growth this year. And I think as I look across the industry, I think we've -- whether it's through innovation or our commercial acumen, I think we've kind of led the market.

I think we are starting to see, as we've talked about, some softening in demand in a couple of places that we'll keep an eye on. I don't think there's going to be anything dramatic, but I think we have to be thoughtful. We can't predict what's going to happen in Europe politically and et cetera. So we have to be cautious about how we run our playbook.

I think the main dynamic in terms of our planning exercise for next year is we have -- we still -- even though we're starting to see a little bit of softening in the order profile, that's in the backdrop of a backlog that's like more than 3x what it was 2 years ago. So a lot of what we're seeing in headline -- so we went from, let's say, high teens order growth in Q2 to 3% in Q3, that would normally be kind of an alarming number.

But if we actually look at the backlog mechanics, it's actually quite natural because we had huge spike in the beginning of the year. And it's just the customer -- it's like some -- it's like an inventory of order backlog that our customers are basically don't -- aren't giving us -- don't need the places -- because the supply chain is getting a little bit smoother from us and our peers, they're not giving -- our customers are not giving us 9 months or a year visibility to orders to going back to what it would be a normal pattern of sort of 3 to 6 months.

So that's just going to be a natural roll-off in order of velocity. So -- that's -- it's a little bit -- it's not a linear equation. We've got to -- we can stay on top of it, but I'm not that concerned about the short-term order -- year-over-year order mechanics. I'm more concerned about making sure that we -- we actually want -- we need our backlog to come down. We're running too high right now, and we want to get that product out into the marketplace, and that's probably our main focus.

Peter Arment

Terrific. Well, let's leave it there. That's a great way to end. So Doug, thank you so much for joining us. I appreciate it. And thanks again, everyone. Thank you.

Douglas Wright

Ministers are facing a demand for London-style congestion and ultra-low-emission zones in towns and cities across the UK, in a bid to slash the 36,000 premature deaths caused by poor air quality each year.

Medical experts have joined forces with the capital’s Labour mayor Sadiq Khan and Conservative environmentalist Ben Goldsmith to issue an appeal to environment secretary Therese Coffey for action.

The letter came after Ms Coffey’s Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) missed a legally binding deadline of 31 October to set new targets for air and water quality, biodiversity and tackling waste.

Signatories representing Cancer Research UK, Asthma + Lung UK, Alzheimer’s Research and the British Heart Foundation joined Khan and Goldsmith in warning that the delay “puts the health and well-being of millions of people at risk”.

Mr Goldsmith’s position as a Tory donor and chair of the Conservative Environment Network, which counts dozens of MPs as members, will make it all the more difficult for Ms Coffey to ignore their appeal.

They warned of a “health emergency” in many parts of the UK due to “toxic” air pollution levels, which leave communities across the country breathing air at standards well below World Health Organisation guidelines.

And they said that schemes such as London’s congestion charge, introduced in 2003, and the ultra-low-emission zone (ULEZ), dating back to 2019, have been shown to be the most effective means of improving the air and should be “embraced” throughout the UK.

The £15 daily congestion charge is paid daily by all except electric and some hybrid vehicles in central London, while the ultra-low-emission zone (ULEZ) bars from a much larger area of the capital any diesel or petrol motors failing to meet modern standards.

Together they make the capital one of the largest controlled zones for vehicle emissions in the world and are more stringent than clean air and low-emission zones introduced in cities such as Manchester, Edinburgh and Bath.

“We are all aware of the growing pressures on the National Health Service and so it is ever more vital that where possible we look to tackle the causes of illnesses,” the letter said.

“The mounting evidence shows that air pollution is having a serious and significant impact on all of our health from the moment we’re born through to old age and therefore needs to be urgently addressed.

“Tolerating this health emergency should never be politically acceptable and we know that the most effective tools we have to hand are schemes like ultra-low-emission zones and road user charging. Policies like these should be embraced.”

Air pollution is known to reduce life expectancy by increasing the chances of cardiovascular disease and stunted lung growth in children. It causes thousands of cases of lung cancer in non-smokers each year.

And further evidence of harm is emerging, with a review of research finding last month that the risk of dementia could increase significantly with long-term exposure to fine particulate matter pollution.

“This deeply concerning report is the latest in a long line of research to show that toxic air is a likely contributor to one of the fastest rising health conditions facing the UK, with the numbers of those diagnosed with dementia set to increase to over 1.6 million by 2050 unless we take action to reduce risks,” wrote the letter’s signatories, including Samantha Benham-Hermetz of Alzheimer’s Research UK, Cancer Research UK chief clinician Prof Charles Swanton, the CEO of Asthma + Lung UK Sarah Woolnough and John Maingay, director of policy at the British Heart Foundation.

They told Ms Coffey: “With more ambition and with a willingness to tackle this issue head-on, we know that this can be different.

“We call on you to ensure that drastically reducing air pollution is seen as a priority for this government and that new, bold targets are set in law as quickly as possible. We wish to work closely with you to achieve this.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “While air quality has improved significantly since 2010, we remain committed to continuing to drive improvements.

“We are not waiting for new targets to take action. We have already committed close to £900m to tackle air pollution and improve public health. We are working closely with local authorities to implement their air quality plans and we will bring forward the Environment Act targets as soon as possible.""",Call for car control zones across UK to reduce air pollution deaths,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/air-pollution-khan-goldsmith-coffey-b2223310.html

The U.S. Department of Energy awarded OSU $3 million to explore the development of a new rechargeable battery technology that would accelerate the clean energy transition without relying on rare finite minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel. OSU chemistry professor Xiulei “David” Ji, who will lead a battery research team, said it could be a game-changer.

“It’s a new paradigm,” he told Oregon Public Broadcasting. “We are very excited and very grateful to have this opportunity to work on this project.”

As the world transitions from fossil fuels to clean energy to reduce contributions to climate change, there is a growing need for batteries to store renewable energy and power electric vehicles. The resulting battery boom has generated environmental concerns because of the impacts of mining battery materials such as lithium, and it has driven up prices and demand for the minerals used to make batteries.

According to the International Energy Agency, an organization that provides data analysis for global energy policies, the world could face lithium shortages by 2025. The price of lithium has soared, tripling in 2021. Nickel, a mineral used for lithium-ion batteries, has also grown in demand and seen price hikes.

Ji, who will lead a team of researchers from Howard University, the University of Maryland and Vanderbilt University, said depending on these minerals is unsustainable and expensive. He said meeting clean energy goals soon will require a move away from relatively rare, finite minerals.

His plan is to explore anion batteries that provide the necessary components without using limited minerals like the ones lithium batteries use and that could potentially increase how much energy a battery can hold.

“The new battery chemistry does not have to rely on these elements,” Ji said. “That’s the benefit of the new chemistry. It’s a game changer.”

Ji said the primary market for these batteries would be electric vehicles, but he doesn’t rule out the possibility of anion batteries being used by large-scale utilities, like Portland General Electric’s solar, wind and battery facility. He also said they could be commercialized soon and be used in homes.

That’s something Meredith Connolly, executive director of the environmental nonprofit Climate Solutions, is looking forward to.

She said powering the economy with 100% clean electricity from wind and solar is a key part of reducing fossil fuels, and batteries are a critical part of achieving a clean energy transition.

“Part of the technological magic that batteries provide is the ability to store wind energy when the wind is blowing and solar energy when the sun is shining, and then deploy that renewable energy when there’s no wind or the sun goes down,” she said.

As EV production is ramping up, Connolly said, batteries need to be sustainably sourced and recycled to reuse the raw materials.

Oregon is one of many states providing generous incentives and rebates to switch from gas-powered vehicles to electric. Recently, the state started offering qualified residents up to $7,500 for a new EV. So far, more than 50,000 EVs are registered in the state. Oregon is also investing $100 million in building out charging infrastructure on major roadways and in rural areas to meet the demand of electric vehicles on the road.

Company Participants

Garrett Holland - Baird

Conference Call Participants

Sean Pelkey - EVP and CFO

Sean Pelkey

We'll get started with our next session here. Hello. My name is Garrett Holland senior analyst covering transportation and logistics here at Baird. We're very pleased to have CSX Corporation participate at the Industrials Conference this year. From the company, we have Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And we're going to head right into Q&A. But if you have any questions, feel free to submit them through the portal or raise your hand and we'll be happy to field them.

Question-and-Answer Session

Q - Garrett Holland

So Sean, thanks for being with us. Maybe for the folks that aren't quite as familiar with the CSX story. Talk to us about some of the differentiating factors about the network about the execution that position the company for better relative growth and performance in the years ahead.

Sean Pelkey

Yes. Thanks, Garrett, and glad to be here in Chicago with everybody. It's a great conference. So CSX. Well, I'd like to say, if you like to play Monopoly growing up, you know the B&O railroad, and that is CSX. We were founded in 1826. So we are the longest standing U.S. Class I railroad as far as I know. We also happen to serve two thirds of the country's population. We're in the eastern half of the United States. We've got over 20,000 miles of track, 21,000 employees. We just recently acquired the Pan Am railroads and extended our reach up into New England. So we've got a phenomenal network.

We've spent a lot of capital into that network to make sure that it's ready for growth that we've got significant capacity. And I think we've got the best run railroad in North America. We've got an operating team that is out there every day executing against a scheduled railroading plan. The majority of our trains are scheduled. And as long as we have enough crews to run those trains, we can run to that schedule. And I think you've been seeing that in the numbers that we report every week, certainly over the last month or 2, heading in the right direction again.

Garrett Holland

Yes, that's very good. But also an exciting leadership change top of the house at CSX new CEO, Joe Hinrichs. What changes did investors expect under Joe's leadership. Help us understand how the strategy changes, if at all. He brings a lot of operational expertise. How is that new leadership going?

Sean Pelkey

Yes. Great question. I think Joe has really brought a renewed level of energy to the employee base. He's coming in from the outside, but he's not new to rail because he was a customer of rail at Ford for a very long period of time. And I think being on the other side of the table gives you a very unique perspective on the advantages of rail as well as some of the things that drive you crazy in terms of rail service performance.

I think that gives him a really unique perspective to come in and say, ""Hey, look, we've got an operating model that works, how can we do a better job of engaging with our employees to get them to come to work excited and motivated every day and communicating with our customers, so they have clear expectations of what the service product is going to look like and if we're not meeting those expectations, we know what to do. ""

There are 5 principles of scheduled railroading in the Hunter Harrison book. The 3 of them that we execute very, very well on is working safely, controlling costs and optimizing asset utilization. Those are things that have sort of become the hallmark of CSX. The last couple of years have been a bit of a blip in that story because we've struggled to get enough crews to run the railroad, but we are back.

The two things -- I wouldn't say that we've deemphasized, but the 2 areas that we -- that Joe sees very clear opportunity is customer service and valuing and developing employees. And so those have been the areas where he's been spending a lot of his time. He's been out in the field, meeting with employees. He's actually got this video series that he does with employees every week. It's called On Track with Joe. He's out in the field interacting with folks. And it's really just, again, brought this new energy and life to the company that I think people are really excited about.

Garrett Holland

That's great. When we think about demand and the volume trends you're seeing, help us understand how volumes are tracking in Q4 relative to plan. What's tracking a little bit better or behind?

Sean Pelkey

Yes. It's funny how you asked the question relative to plan. it's difficult to plan in this environment. But when we look at the business sort of broadly, there are some areas we're up strength. Automotive, clearly, production is up on the automotive side. We've got a lot of finished vehicles that are sitting on the ground ready to move, and production is expected to be up going into next year. So that makes us feel very confident about our ability to serve it.

When we look across the rest of the merchandise markets, Ag & Food has been an area of strength here in the fourth quarter. That's partially driven by demand for the product and partially driven by the fact that our service levels are better. So we're cycling trains faster. When you cycle trains faster, you can move more volume.

Some areas of softness within in the merchandise segments, metals, forest products, things that are related to housing, phosphates has been down, especially with the storm down in the Bone Valley area of Southwest Florida. When we look at the coal business, that's actually been up for us here in the fourth quarter, and we feel good about the underlying demand for both domestic and export coal going into next year. Part of the reason it's up is because we now have the crews that we need in order to serve the demand that's out there that's been a struggle for us most of the year.

We've been, I would argue, underserving what the customers have wanted us to move. So that's been a good news story. Intermodal has been kind of flat. And I would say, down a little bit sequentially from the third quarter. I think what you're starting to see there is a little bit of customer demand that's waning, you're starting to see a little bit of buildup of inventories, and you've heard it from some of the large international steamship lines that they see some storm clouds on the horizon. So I think that could be a little bit bumpy going forward.

Garrett Holland

Yes, there's been a lot of focus on the storm clouds potentially rolling in as we think about next year. Help us understand the demand visibility. There's been disruptions this year across supply chains, I think industrial markets, auto markets, there's got to be pent-up demand there, but you're seeing weaker consumer demand, perhaps help us understand how CSX views that demand occur into '23.

Sean Pelkey

Yes. So just to sort of take you behind the curtain in terms of how we do financial planning at the railroad. The first thing that we do is we look at what are the key economic indicators within each of our markets. And that sort of forms the baseline for, okay, are we going to grow above or below that level? I think as we go forward, what we can't control is what the economy and what the consumer is going to do and what the Fed is going to do.

Those projections for IDP have been coming down in the last couple of months. And so we're going to probably ride along with that. But what gives us a lot of confidence about our ability to actually do better than that is the fact that, a, we struggle to meet the demand that was out there for most of this year. We were running at order fill rates in the 60% range in many markets, in some cases, 70% on a good day.

So if you see the order rate come down just a little bit, our order -- the absolute number of orders come down a little bit, our order fill rate goes up, we're able to serve the customer better, some of that traffic this year that diverted over to truck, comes back to rail. And I think there really is an opportunity for us to offset any kind of economic headwinds that might be out there on the merchandise side of the business going into next year.

Garrett Holland

That's great. And I know you've been working hard to restore the service product, maybe not being able to meet all the customer demand that was out there today. Is the sales team being empowered just to go out and ask for more volume now that you're in a better position to deliver it? Are we at that turning point yet?

Sean Pelkey

Well -- I think it's hard to sit across the customer and say, ""Hey, for the last 6 weeks, we've been operating really well, give us more volume. "" But the good news is, Joe, and all the conversations he's had early on with customers and certainly what we hear from Kevin and his team is our customers want to give us more freight. We need to be able to deliver a consistent and reliable service product for them to be able to trust us. There are markets where having better service and having more crews translates immediately to more volume, that's going to be your unit train business.

The grain business we talked about, the coal business we talked about. But it's kind of a show-me story on the merchandise side. And so I think there's 2 things there. One is, as we're able to do this more consistently, you start to see some of those loads shift back. It's probably gradual, not immediate. And then the second really is building that pipeline of industrial development opportunities as you see new manufacturing that's coming online in the Eastern half of the United States. They're looking for rail-served options, and we happen to have a very strong industrial development program where we partner with state and local governments. We get select sites that are build ready.

They've got utilities, environmental, everything is taken care of. They've got roads, and they also have rail access. So this is what customers are looking for. and they look across that landscape. They see the location that's located with -- on CSX. And they also look at the metrics, and they look at how well run the railroads are. And I think the good news is, we've been winning a lot of those opportunities.

That sets us up really well longer term. It sort of builds the foundation of that pipeline of growth. A lot of that is not going to come in 2023. We'll see a little bit in the back half of next year. But we've got opportunities for new plants that are going to open up in '24, '25, '26. And so regardless of what the economic environment is, you're going to see growth coming out of those development opportunities?

Garrett Holland

Yes. I think those are maybe underappreciated they're a bit out of model since longer term, but really nice benefits. I wonder if you could size those for us a little bit. But also the debate for rails is -- can they grow? PSR has been about efficiency, taking costs out. But how does that model really enable growth longer term?

Sean Pelkey

Yes. So I think when you look at what's our goal, our goal is to outgrow the economy, right? And if you look at how have we done over the last 5 years. We did it once, and that was in 2021. And our service product actually wasn't that great in 2021, but we were -- we took advantage of a growing economy. As we look forward, our goal is to do that each and every year.

And how do we do that? It's by rebuilding trust with the customer. It's by investments in technology that give the customer a greater visibility to where their freight is. Even things like investing in a brand-new dispatch system, which will allow us to make better decisions, the computer will help to tell us which train goes first, not because that train needs to get there next, but because it's going to have a downstream network impact by that train getting dispatched first. So ultimately, you get better, faster, reliable transit times and you do that over a long period of time. And you're able to manage that through a cycle, you regain the trust of the customer.

You also have, frankly, the benefit of emerging trends around a focus on ESG. You've got customers of ours and of truck. We're looking at the alternatives, and they're hearing more and more about the efficiency of rail. The fact that we're three to four times more fuel efficient than truck. And they're thinking about how can I get rail to be a broader part of my supply chain.

We have 1 customer who is still a very small customer of ours. Today, they move about 80% of their business via truck, and they told us over the next 5 years, they would like that to be 80% rail. I think you're hearing a lot of stories like that, maybe not quite to that extreme, but there's -- the demand is there. It's just a function of can we serve it, do we have the right resources? And do we have the right operating model. I think the answer is yes, but we've got to prove it over an extended period of time.

Garrett Holland

In those conversations with shippers, are you hearing more focus on near-shoring activity Obviously, the East Coast ports have attracted a lot of volume, still working through some of that congestion. If you could speak on those topics, when do you expect that congestion to clear, but also our shippers bringing more production back to your footprint?

Sean Pelkey

Yes. it's a good question. I think a lot of companies were scarred by what happened with all the supply chain disruptions in 2021 and then the Russia-Ukraine situation. So there's a lot of talk and a lot of thought about do we move some of these manufacturing facilities back to the United States. You also have automation that's come a long way at manufacturing facilities. The vast majority of those facilities are still very labor heavy. But as you see additional advancements in automation, the labor cost issue starts to become less and less of a problem.

So we're optimistic about the ability to see more plants locate. And when they want to locate in the United States, there's a lot of them that want to locate on our network in the eastern half of the United States because that's where the population is, particularly in the Southeast. Those are areas that are very friendly for business development and growth.

And that's where we're seeing a lot of the announcements. We've got the new Ford F-150 electric vehicle plant, that's on CSX. A couple of other EV manufacturing plants. We've got Nucor and Novelis that are -- have announced new plants on CSX in the next couple of years. So, you're starting to see that some of that momentum, how much does it pick up and how many new facilities do we see in the future? Our goal is to try to be positioned for it if and when it happens.

Garrett Holland

In the dialogue with shippers, obviously, pricing is an important topic. Inflationary pressures continued. You've got to earn a return on the investments you're making here. Help us understand the pricing conversation. You didn't participate like some other transportation modes on the upside. How do you recover pricing now?

Sean Pelkey

Yes, Garrett. In terms of participating on the upside, you're right, we don't most of our business doesn't move spot. It moves contract. And the way the contract cycles work, we've got about 2/3, about 60% to 70% of that business that renews in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So we're in that renewal cycle right now, and the inflationary pressures are real. There's no doubt about that.

If you have read the headlines you've seen about the rail union labor issues and the recommendations that came out of the Presidential Emergency Board which call for a 14% increase in wages upon ratification of those agreements and 24% over a 5-year period in addition to $1,000 bonuses. We've also got headwinds on the nonlabor cost side. We've talked about this before, but a lot of those nonlabor costs that we have, whether it's third-party contractors or outside labor tends to be based on lagging indicators.

So even if we see a decline in inflation next year across the U.S. economy, we may not be the beneficiary of that on our nonlabor costs until we get into 2024. So we've got visibility into some higher inflation next year. Those are all things that come into play in those pricing conversations with customers. Service is also important.

So it's critically important that we continue on this trajectory of improved service and improving service and remain dedicated to having the right number of crews out there in the right locations. So we can look across the table with the customer and with a straight face say, yes, you're getting the service that we told you, you were going to get. We're facing inflationary pressures and here are the rates that we think we need to charge.

Garrett Holland

Yes, that's great. Encouraging to stay on the right side of the price/cost spread. Also interested if you could talk a little bit more about the mix shift dynamics you're seeing in the book of business, both in Q4 and '23 and some of the yield and profitability implications.

Sean Pelkey

Sure. In terms of mix as we get into next year, on the merchandise side, you're going to see the impact of the consumer economy show up, housing. We talked about that earlier. So there will be some specific headwinds. You're also going to see the benefit of growing automotive business more than likely with production expected to be up 5% to 10% next year.

We feel good about aggregates as well. You've got the infrastructure bill, you've got rebuilds going on in Florida and hopefully, this next hurricane isn't too bad. But at the same time, when these things happen, there's rebuilding efforts that need to occur and that's traffic that we can move.

As we think about coal going into next year. I talked about us missing some of the demand that was out there this year. We have reason to believe that there's still going to be strong demand for domestic coal going into next year. Inventories are quite low.

Natural gas prices are still high. So even if we're in the middle of a recession next year as long as those commodity prices stay high, we feel good about the demand for domestic coal next year and export coal, it's been a very strong year for us, particularly on the pricing side. As we go into next year, we might see a little bit of moderation on the pricing side, probably higher than it was historically. But not as high as the record levels that we saw for the majority of this year. But we should be able to still move a fair amount of export coal next year.

Garrett Holland

I had a couple of questions on the OR trajectory as we think about Q4 and next year. Clearly, this quarter, you've got some dynamics with seasonality, fuel costs. We talked about volume trends, inflationary pressures, some pricing power as well. Help us understand those moving parts as you put together the '23 plan.

Sean Pelkey

Yes. Well, you hit on all the Q4 factors there. Yes, as we think about '23, our goal is to grow above the economy. If we can do that on a sustainable basis, margins will take care of themselves, right? So our #1 goal is not necessarily to drive down the operating ratio. That's a small part of our incentive compensation. The biggest part is to actually drive growth in the business, drive profitable growth in the business.

As we go into next year, we're going to have inflationary headwinds. We already have a pretty good inkling of what those labor headwinds are going to be, and we talked about those on the third quarter call. I just talked about the headwinds in non-labor inflation. So those are going to be working against us. We're going to have higher depreciation and some other structural costs.

We have some locomotive rebuilds. On the flip side of that, as the business runs more fluidly, we'll be able to take some cost out. We've been running with more locomotives than we need. We are going to continue to hire crews for the foreseeable future to make sure that we're adequately resourced everywhere across the network.

So there'll be some puts and takes on the cost side to factor in for next year. I would say 2 big variables that will sort of drive the OR trajectory going into next year are going to be export coal pricing. And then the other piece of that is intermodal supplemental revenue or other revenue. That's been a big driver of revenue gains this year for us as we've had a lot of containers that have been sitting on terminal or at container yards off terminal.

And we charge a daily usage fee for that as the supply chain clears up as inventory starts to come down, we expect that to work its way down. There are some costs associated with that, but that would be a net headwind to operating ratio as well.

Garrett Holland

Yes, on the timing for those -- the burn off of the storage and premises and use charges, are they starting to fade? When do you expect those completely flushed out and the timing of the offset, the $40 million quarterly P&L drag you're seeing from an inefficiency perspective, help net those out for us.

Sean Pelkey

Yes. So on the storage fees, I would say there's glimmers of things starting to get a little bit better, but we still have a lot of containers that are dwelling on the terminal and at container yards. So our expectation as we work our way through the fourth quarter here and get towards the end of the year, you'll see that step down a little bit. And then as we get into next year, it will step down even further. And more than likely, if we see a slight downturn in consumer demand, you're probably going to be getting closer to more normalized levels as you go through the year on the intermodal storage side.

Garrett is talking about the congestion-related costs that we've talked about over the course of this year, roughly $40 million a quarter. What I talked about on the third quarter call is that some of those costs are going to be a little bit sticky. The network is already beginning to run faster. So things that naturally fall out are things like freight car rents, as your cycle times improve, you've got fewer cars that are on your network, you're able to push more of that off-line.

And so that has a positive benefit. Some of the costs will be a little bit stickier though, included in that $40 million in -- are hiring and training costs for T&E employees. We're going to continue to hire and train. And once we get the right number of conductors in the right location, we're going to switch over to engineer training. You've got the conductor and the engineer on board, the engineer drives the train. And there is a real need to train engineers in a lot of different areas of the network. So that will continue into next year.

There are costs associated with moving those intermodal boxes around and storing them at our facilities. So that will go generally speaking, hand-in-hand as the intermodal supplemental revenues work their way down.

Garrett Holland

I think CSX was out in front as much as possible of this labor challenge you got after the problem earlier. I think you're in a better position now the training pipeline, the additions of the training pipeline puts you well on your way to meeting your target. How has your staffing model changed? I know you're trying to deliver a resilient service product.

You talked about continuing to hire not that you keep a buffer, but has the approach to staffing change potentially in a downturn? I know you have attrition that could help manage the network if things get really bad. But talk about the change in the staffing model.

Sean Pelkey

So the historical wisdom in the railroad industry was if you have someone that's furloughed and just the way it works, if you have a conductor engineer, you're in the middle of a business downturn. You can furlough that employee at any time. They'll have their health benefits for a period of time, but there's no wages that get paid. So you're in the middle of a downturn, you would typically furlough your employees. And then if you brought them back within 6 months, the conventional wisdom was 90% of them would come back.

That is not what we saw in 2020. Within 6 months, we called them back because demand cratered and then came back very quickly. And I would say we probably had about 50% of them if that, that showed back up. And so that -- and I don't think that, that dynamic has changed, especially with the struggles that we as an industry have had in attracting talent to 6-figure jobs in a sector where there is the education requirement is quite flexible.

But as we think about how do we manage that going forward, I think the first lever is not going to be furlough, the first lever is slowing down the hiring in areas where we're doing okay, where we probably have a little bit of buffer. And then letting attrition take care of itself. If we have too many active employees, one of the things that we can do is move them into engineer training to set us up for growth coming out of a potential downturn.

Garrett Holland

a couple of questions. You've done a good job on the intermodal trip plan compliance. How quickly do you expect to restore the carload side of the business. And then the labor agreement, the ratification process, help us understand the time line as you see it today.

Sean Pelkey

Okay. So in terms of trip plan compliance performance, and this is probably the closest that we have today to a real customer-facing metric. I think Joe is really pushing the team to think about even new and better ways to give us a sense of how well we're serving the customer. But trip plan compliance tells us, did we meet the trip plan. It's just exactly what it says. We've been running 90% to 95% in the intermodal service product. In fact, we had 2 days in the last couple of weeks that were at 98%. So we're there.

On the carload side, that's the one that's been lagging most of the year. Happy to say that we're now consistently running over the last 3 weeks, above 70% in that 70% to 75% range, which is good, not great. Just to give you some context, back in 2019 when we were operating probably at our best in the company's history. Our average for that year was 77%. We have seen some days that have hit 80%. That's kind of our internal target for now. It's not the destination, but it's where we would like to be. And it's good news to see that we're actually hitting up against that. And I don't see any reason to believe that we're going to go backwards on those measures we've got the right number of crews now.

We probably still have a few locations where we're short, but that's where the intense focus is. You also asked about the union labor negotiations. We got some good news yesterday the BMWE had until November 19, and that got pushed back into early December. So it will line up. We've got 2 more big votes outstanding with the conductor and engineer unions. Those will come out next week. And depending on the outcome of those, that will sort of determine the course from there. We're optimistic we'll get to a good solution, be able to pay people much more than what they're taking home today.

And that really -- once that's out of the way, that really gives us the line of sight to figure out how do we drive a better employee experience on the whole. Joe has been gathering a tremendous amount of good feedback from both the employees and the union leaders. And he's talked about interest-based bargaining which is something that we are already doing at CSX, but we'll continue. Trying to get cut through all of the noise of what are the current agreements and what are all the things that get in our way in terms of getting a better employee experience. And let's actually look at what the employee needs and what the company can offer and figure out where those interests align and then work from there.

Garrett Holland

That's very helpful. Just a question on some of the investments you're making. You talked about technology on the M&A side, some interesting deals with Quality and Pan Am. How do those investments organically and selectively with M&A help you to achieve these growth ambitions consistently.

Sean Pelkey

Yes. I would say, as we were going through the scheduled railroading transformation, the first couple of years was really focused on let's make sure that we're shoring up the network and there was a decreased emphasis on growth investments as we tried to just get the service product to where it needed to be. As we now make our way out of that and especially as we see a reacceleration in the service product, we're trying to think about how can we innovate? How can we do things differently? Because we -- you look at 40 years of railroading history since deregulation. The industry has not been able to sustainably outperform IDP outside of the Intermodal business.

And that is our goal going forward. So how do we do that? There are places where you're going to need to make investments. The good news is across the network when you think about the rail, we're in very good shape. There are some places where we're investing in siding capacity and terminal capacity. But on the whole, we've got room to add trains to add cars to existing trains.

And so it's really a matter of how do we think differently about ways to grow. I think technology plays into that, as I talked about some of the customer-facing tools that we're developing. And then some of the smaller acquisitions that we've made, the footprint up in the Northeast gives us access to new ports, new customers and the initial conversations that Kevin and the team have had with those customers indicate that when we get the railroad up to the right standard, there's a lot of opportunity to grow.

And you talked about Quality Carriers, CSX buying a trucking company on the face of it doesn't make a ton of sense. But Quality is an extremely well-run specialty trucking -- specialty chemicals trucking company. And they are excited about all the opportunities that they're hearing about with their customers to convert some of that freight from truck from over-the-road truck to rail and actually grow the freight pie as well. So a lot of different opportunities there that we'll be able to build on in the coming years.

Garrett Holland

Running up on time, but just to pull up and think a little bit beyond some of the cyclical factors that are weighing on investors. What's the right way to think about the growth algorithm for CSX -- Growth fast with volume faster than economic activity, you're trying to deliver attractive incremental margins, earning returns on these investments. How do you bottoms-up make that build for growth potential at CSX long term?

Sean Pelkey

Yes. I think all the elements are there. It's delivering the service product, communicating better with the customer and having the right technology and tools in place to ultimately drive that growth, I talked about the baseline of industrial development activity that sort of forms the -- we don't have to worry about the economy if we have new plants that are coming online because we know we've got a piece of the business that's going to grow no matter what.

And then on top of that, it's having those conversations with the customer about, hey, today, we're serving 20% of your demand in and out of the plant. How do we move that to 30% to 40% to 50%. And that's really the key to unlocking the growth.

Garrett Holland

Fantastic with that, we're running up on time, but I want to thank Sean for being here.Thanks CSX, and hope everyone has a great rest of the conference.

154,"When it comes to dependency on coal power plants, South Africa is in a class of its own: 85% of its electricity is produced in coal power plants.",electric vehicles,13/11/2022,https://images.theconversation.com/files/494630/original/file-20221110-15-uw9p98.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,the conversation africa,"South Africa has experienced power shortages with rolling blackouts on an unprecedented scale in 2022. This state of affairs is largely due to technical failures at its ageing fleet of coal power plants.

The present power generation shortage is due to the power utility Eskom’s failure to add sufficient new electricity generation to the grid. This meant that it had to keep ailing old power stations going beyond their projected life span. The coal plants are prone to frequent renewed breakdown. In addition, their maintenance and parts replacements are becoming prohibitively expensive.

Given the major contribution that the burning of coal makes to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, electricity generation from coal is in any case globally viewed as extremely problematic, with major pressure and incentives to scale this down.

South Africa is currently ranked eighth in the world in terms of the total amount of coal used for electricity generation. This is based on country-by-country global statistics on coal power generation. The statistics are produced on an annual basis and are widely available. The largest coal user by far is China, followed by India, though these are also the world’s most populous nations.

In terms of energy consumption from coal per capita, South Africa also ranks among the highest in the world with just under 16,500 kWh per person per annum This is in line with other highly coal dependent countries. It is roughly on par with China, South Korea and Australia and slightly lower than the top three – Estonia, Kazakhstan and Taiwan.

When it comes to dependency on coal power plants, South Africa is in a class of its own – 85% of its electricity is produced in coal power plants. This is way higher than all countries – bar two. Only Mongolia and Kosovo have a higher dependency. They have tiny populations – Mongolia has just over 3 million people, Kosovo just under 2 million. South Africa’s population is over 60 million.

South Africa’s percentage of electricity from coal has decreased only marginally – by 9 percentage points – since 1985. This is in contrast to other previously coal dependent countries that have made much more dramatic moves to carbon-free power. For example, the UK got 58% of its electricity from coal in 1985. Today this is down to 2%, partly thanks to massive investments in wind power.

South Africa has climatic conditions suitable for solar and wind power, and should in theory similarly be able to reduce its coal dependence. A drive towards low-carbon electricity generation however requires governmental support, which has mostly not been forthcoming in the last decade.

The history

As it’s a country with rich coal deposits, South Africa’s proliferation of coal plants was to be expected in the 1970s and 1980s. Because it’s also a water scarce country, possibilities for hydropower plants were always limited. And while one nuclear plant was constructed, the increasing isolation of apartheid-era South Africa made it difficult to access international expertise needed for further nuclear developments.

Renewable technologies are relatively new. They only became commercially competitive about 10 years ago, and were not considered a viable alternative to fossil fuels before then.

When the need for more power generation in South Africa became apparent in the first years of the millennium, a time when the electrification of previously unconnected communities was booming, the choice was made to construct two further coal plants, Medupi and Kusile.

These builds have, however, proved technologically flawed, way over budget and badly behind schedule.

When the first series of rolling power cuts had to be implemented in 2007, it became clear that energy security planning and implementation had gone wrong. The subsequent electricity plan from 2010 recommended major developments in nuclear and renewable energy.

In 2015 the government stalled the construction of planned new solar and wind plants in favour of a highly controversial and ultimately blocked nuclear deal with Russia. Since the resumption of the renewables electricity programme in 2018 some wind and solar plants have been built, but at nowhere near the rate needed to dent the dominant role of coal.

A lack of unity of purpose

Despite the electricity crisis having now become urgent and obvious, with several hours of power cuts during as many as half of the days in 2022, there has been no unity in purpose to tackle the issue.

There are loud calls, also supported by influential individuals within the ruling African National Congress party, to maintain South Africa’s coal-intensive trajectory. The proponents argue that the coal power stations can simply be managed better, and that any new power generation should mainly be focused on nuclear and gas.

The opposing view is that South Africa should align with the global trends to massively develop new solar and wind power plants. Its advocates justify this option by pointing to the lower cost of these technologies, short project completion times and environmental considerations.

Despite enjoying weather conditions that are superbly suited for wind and solar farms, South Africa has been extremely slow to kickstart its renewable energy generating infrastructure.

South Africa could have followed the example of China. Although the largest user of coal in the world, it is already making major moves towards a far lower carbon footprint. Over the five year period 2021-2025, China plans to add solar and wind plants producing 570 GW of electricity.

To put this figure into perspective, this is roughly ten times South Africa’s present total power capacity.

Next steps

The office of the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, comes across as sympathetic to mass renewable energy developments. It has aligned itself with the recently published Just Energy Transition Investment Plan.

The plan envisages accelerated building of more wind and solar farms to replace decommissioned coal power stations. It also tries to mitigate lowered economic activity and job losses in the coal fields and adjacent coal plants. It goes further in exploring energy exports in the form of green hydrogen, an energy storage medium fed by renewables, and the current global move towards electric vehicles.

If supported and implemented, the plan will result in better power supply in only three to five years from now. This however presupposes that the government will rally behind this initiative and work together rather than sending contradictory messages.

In the interim, power shortages will persist in South Africa.",South Africa is hooked on fossil fuels: how it got here and how it can get out,https://theconversation.com/south-africa-is-hooked-on-fossil-fuels-how-it-got-here-and-how-it-can-get-out-193750

Jakarta (ANTARA) - The UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) 2022 can inspire the global community and all parties to increase contribution to tackling climate change, according to Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investment of Pertamina Daniel Purba.""Sometimes when we work only focusing on our own sector, we never think about a global point of view. So I'm sure this COP27 will inspire and encourage everyone to think globally in order to accelerate contributions in dealing with climate change through industries that we each work on,"" Purba said during a discussion organized on the sidelines of COP27, at the Indonesian Pavilion in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on Friday (November 11) .Reducing carbon emissions is one of the ways to tackle climate change, Purba added.Through the COP27 event, he continued, all nations around the world are reminded that there is still a lot of work to do to save planet Earth from the impacts of climate change, and it is not only for the benefit of future generations, but also for the sustainability of the business environment.""I hope that after the implementation of COP27, everyone will realize that they have to play a role in saving the Earth. And that effort is not just a jargon, but must become a reality, our mindset and lifestyle that encourage us to save our planet,"" Purba said.As a concrete step to tackle climate change, Indonesia is committed to achieving net zero emissions (NZE) by 2060, and Pertamina is supporting the realization of that commitment by decarbonizing its existing businesses and developing green businesses.""Currently Indonesia has committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2060 so that Pertamina, as a state-owned company, supports this commitment and we have also prepared various work programs to achieve this national (NZE) target,"" he pointed out.The decarbonization measures taken by the company include encouraging energy efficiency, zero-flare oil and gas activities, as well as carbon capture and utilization.Apart from that, Pertamina has also developed a number of green business initiatives, including those related to biofuels, renewable energy, batteries and electric vehicles, hydrogen as well as carbon businesses.""Of course, we also view the energy transition period as a very good opportunity for us to build some green businesses,"" Purba said.In addition, Pertamina is also committed to allocating 14 percent of the projected capital expenditure for the 2022-2060 period, which is worth US$70-80 billion, for the development of clean, new and renewable energy.",COP27 inspires global community to tackle climate change: Pertamina,https://en.antaranews.com/news/259989/cop27-inspires-global-community-to-tackle-climate-change-pertamina
