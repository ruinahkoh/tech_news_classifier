Today, the tech giant claims to have generated the first artificial intelligence to translate Hokkien, which is a language primarily spoken and not written.



Hokkien is a language that is spoken by approximately 49 million people in countries like China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Phillippines. Typically, training an AI to understand human speech—and in Meta’s case, translation—researchers will feed the computer a large dataset of written transcripts. But Meta says that Hokkien is once of nearly 3,500 languages that are primarily spoken, meaning Hokkien does not have a large enough dataset to train the artificial intelligence since the language does not have a unified writing system.

As such, Meta focused on a speech-to-speech approach, as explained in the company’s press release. Without going into too much detail, Meta explained that the input speech was translated into a sequence of acoustic sounds, which was then used to create waveforms of the language. Those waveforms were then coupled with Mandarin, which Meta identifies as a “related language.”

Meta says that the Hokkien translator is still a work in progress as the artificial intelligence can only translate one sentence at a time, but is being released as open-source so other researchers can build upon its work. The company is also releasing SpeechMatrix which is a “large collection of speech-to-speech translations developed through our innovative natural language processing toolkit. ”

Zoë Jewell had a problem.

She had stumbled upon a better way to track the black rhinos she and her colleague were monitoring in Zimbabwe, but there wasn't an easy way to scale the solution.

Jewell and her partner discovered that the Indigenous guides they'd hired to locate the endangered animals could study a rhino's tracks and learn details about the creature's sex, often its age, and even what plants it had been eating.

The trackers' expertise proved superior to radio collars, which required that the rhinos be regularly immobilized so researchers could make adjustments. That process reduced female rhinos' fertility — the last thing Jewell, a veterinarian, wanted.

But the observational skills expert trackers wielded took years to develop. So Jewell, a cofounder of the US nonprofit WildTrack, turned to artificial intelligence to help identify animal tracks using photos.

""Everything is there if we know how to read it,"" Jewell told Insider.

Reading those signs is something AI can help humans do. This kind of heavy-duty data crunching is happening more often across conservation programs globally. These efforts are making it easier to monitor, understand, and even predict conservation challenges.

Already, AI can listen to forests for the sounds of chainsaws or gunshots, which indicate illegal logging or hunting, respectively. And AI can forecast what might happen to fish populations years later based on factors like how regulators tweak catch limits today.

Lily Xu, a researcher at Harvard University developing AI to aid conservation, said use of the technology was becoming essential because it could help those working on preservation projects best deploy limited resources across vast and complicated landscapes.

""Where can we get the most bang for our buck?"" Xu said. ""Where should we be designating a new place as a protected area? Where should we be building new patrol posts for rangers?""

Being smarter about where to identify a breeding site for a tiger population or where to ban fishing is important, in part, because poachers often operate as international criminal organizations. It's become big business. The illicit transfer of wildlife and resources — everything from fish to timber — ranks as the world's fourth-largest illegal trade, behind narcotics, human trafficking, and counterfeit goods. Horns from rhinos like the type Jewell has studied in the field can fetch higher prices than cocaine, heroin, and gold.

Xu said AI could help in the arms race against those acting illegally.

""Poachers are becoming more sophisticated,"" she said. ""They are changing the locations of where they're poaching. They're becoming more coordinated.""

AI can't solve all of conservationists' problems, of course. AI engines are only as good as the datasets they can amass. Yet the AI system Jewell and her collaborators developed can so far identify dozens of animal species with more than 90% accuracy. And combining that with human expertise makes for a powerful tool.

""The things that limit AI can be augmented with that human input,"" Jewell said, ""the AI can definitely learn from the skills of the trackers.""",artificial intelligence,business insider

Summary Law firms Stephen Thaler argues his artificial intelligence system should be considered an inventor

Computer scientist's attorney says he will take case to Supreme Court















(Reuters) - A U.S. computer scientist on Thursday lost his latest bid to have an artificial intelligence program he created be named ""inventor"" on a pair of patents he is seeking to obtain.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied a request for a rehearing in the case brought by plaintiff Stephen Thaler, whose lawyer said he would now appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Thaler had argued that his AI system, called DABUS, should be considered an ""individual"" that can legally be named as an inventor. The court ruled in August that an inventor must be a natural person.

The Federal Circuit rejected Thaler's rehearing petition Thursday without comment. Thaler's attorney Ryan Abbott of Brown Neri Smith & Khan told Reuters in an email that they will now petition the Supreme Court to take up the case.

""We believe our interpretation is the most consistent with the Patent Act, and that it is the interpretation that promotes innovation,"" Abbott said.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office declined to comment on the ruling.

Thaler said his DABUS system, short for Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience, generated prototypes for a novel beverage holder and light beacon without any input from him. The PTO and a Virginia federal court rejected patent applications for the inventions on the grounds that DABUS is not a person.

Thaler challenged the decisions at the Federal Circuit, which hears patent appeals. Circuit Judge Leonard Stark wrote for a three-judge panel in August that the Patent Act unambiguously requires inventors to be human beings.

In his request for a rehearing, Thaler said the decision contradicted Supreme Court precedent and dictionary definitions of ""individual."" He also said the Federal Circuit should have at least ""wrestled with the ambiguity created by technological evolution"" and ""the results that flow from prohibiting patents on AI-generated inventions.""

Thaler has undertaken a global effort to win DABUS patents. He has lost other bids for patents naming DABUS as their inventor in the European Union and Australia.

The case is Thaler v. Vidal, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 21-2347.

For Thaler: Ryan Abbott of Brown Neri Smith & Khan

3,AI can't hold patents to U.S. inventions (for now) - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/N4Lp7g4kueV4j8nzMbPVB8klKgA=/800x419/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/GKONL26ZTNLUFKP7JOJSGX7OY4.jpg,20/10/2022,"Three years ago, Stephen Thaler filed two patent applications naming a single inventor, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) program.

October 20, 2022 - Three years ago, Stephen Thaler filed two patent applications naming a single inventor, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) program. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), following Director review, found the applications to be incomplete for lacking a valid inventor on the ground that a machine cannot be an inventor. Thaler appealed the USPTO's final decisions to the District Court, which similarly concluded that an ""inventor"" must be a natural person.

Thaler then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, with the sole issue being whether AI qualifies as an ""inventor"" under U.S. patent law. The answer (for now) is no. (Thaler v. Vidal, No. 21-2347, *2 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 5, 2022)).

Federal Circuit’s rationale

The Court first looked to the definition of ""inventor"" in the Patent Act, which has defined the term as an ""individual"" since 2011. (Id. at *6). While the Patent Act does not further define ""individual,"" the Court was guided by both the ordinary meaning of the term and related case law. (Id. at *6-7). The Court cited to the Supreme Court's explanation that the noun ""individual"" ordinarily means a human being. (Id. at *6).

This explanation was also consistent with how the term is used in ""everyday parlance"" and dictionary definitions of the term. (Id). The Court also referred to Supreme Court precedent holding that the word ""individual"" in statutes refers to human beings unless there is some evidence that Congress intended otherwise. (Id. at *7). Looking to the rest of the Patent Act, the Court found no such evidence. (Id).

While Thaler relied on other provisions of the Patent Act, the Court found no need to turn to these provisions when the Act included an explicit provision addressing who may be an inventor — an individual. (Id. at *7-9). Responding to Thaler's insistence that the Court should consider the ""broader context of the statute as a whole,"" the Court found that the Patent Act as a whole points to an ""inventor"" being a human being. (Id. at *9).

Mixed holdings on permissibility of AI as an inventor internationally

The U.S. is not the only country that does not allow AI to be an inventor. A general appellate court in the United Kingdom also recently decided against AI inventorship for Thaler's patents. The U.K. Court of Appeal (Civil Division) similarly looked to the country's patent statute, under which an ""inventor"" must be a ""person"" to be an actual deviser as required in the statute.

However, in Australia, the Full Court of the Federal Court, which is a general court whose appeals can only be heard at the High Court, found that AI could be an ""inventor"" because Australian law did not preclude such an interpretation, and the court recognized ""the evolving nature of patentable inventions and their creators."" The South African Patent Office, which has no substantive patent examination system, has granted Thaler's patent naming AI as the inventor.

Implications of this decision

So what happens next? For now, Thaler has requested a rehearing of the case at the Federal Circuit. (Thaler v. Vidal, No. 21-2347, Paper No. 62 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 5, 2022)). In his request, Thaler argues that (1) the dictionary definition of ""individual"" encompasses AI; (2) denying patent protection for AI's inventions contravenes Supreme Court precedent against denying patents based on how inventions are made; and (3) the decision contradicted the Supreme Court's statutory interpretation approach in view of evolving technology. (Id. at 10-11).

The Federal Circuit's nominal bright line rule requiring an ""inventor"" to be a human provides clarity on the front end, supporting the USPTO's decision to reject patent applications where the inventor is declared to be AI. The record on appeal allowed the Court to resolve a pure question of law. That is because the applicant was declared to be AI. The Court never reached the more complex question of what level of reliance on AI in the invention process would deprive a human from claiming inventorship.

Put another way, if AI is used as a tool to invent, then, like traditional inventions, the use of tools to carry out an invention does not bar an applicant's claim of inventorship. But, under the current Federal Circuit ruling, if the role of AI in the inventive process rises to the level of an inventor, then the invention is ineligible for patent protection. This is a factual question with perhaps some very difficult line drawing that was avoided by the Thaler case.

Note that this type of line drawing is not unprecedented. Our analysis of inventorship under U.S. law routinely requires consideration of whether the contributions of human collaborators make them an inventor. If so, the humans are named on the patent application as inventors and prosecution of the patent moves forward. Under Thaler, however, if the same inventorship analysis concludes that AI is an inventor, the AI claims cannot be patented.

Design patent drafters may face similar issues, because the same inventorship statute applies to design and utility patent applications. As with utility inventions, designers have regularly used computer programs (such as CAD) as tools to aid in reducing their designs to practice. But increasingly AI is being used to optimize existing designs (for a variety of reasons, but at least one is to reduce the weight of material needed to make a product).

When these changes affect the appearance of the design, the AI may be seen as taking on a co-designer role. We may soon reach a time when the design is completely created by AI, with humans making only the final design selection.

Similar issues exist in copyright law. Earlier this year, the Copyright Office again found that a copyright could not be issued for art generated by AI, because such a work lacked ""human authorship."" (Notably, this case also involved Thaler.) While Thaler argued that this holding was unconstitutional, the Copyright Office refused to ""depart from a century of copyright jurisprudence"" on this point, including a decision from 2018 concluding that a monkey could not sue for copyright infringement for a photograph it took after stealing a photographer's camera.

Possible ways forward

To address this potential AI patentability bar, there are several strategies available to innovators to protect IP. When drafting a utility patent specification directed to AI-related technology, the disclosure should clearly describe the AI technology as a tool used by humans to implement the invention. The claims in patent applications, the touchstone for the inventorship analysis, should be drafted such that each of the elements are directed to human contributions.

If it is not possible or desirable to disclose and claim the invention in a way that relegates AI to a tool and focuses on human invention, other forms of IP protection are available. One option is trade secret protection. The obligation barring public disclosure to maintain trade secret status means that inventors do not have to comply with the disclosure and claiming obligations of the patent statute. This can have particular benefits when it comes to the challenges of meeting those obligations posed by AI inventions.

Furthermore, there is no inventorship determination required to protect trade secrets. So, it is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether or not an invention qualifies for trade secret protection whether it originates from human or non-human contributions. Accordingly, because the statutory framework particular to patent protection that resulted in the Thaler test does not exist, the Thaler bar does not apply to trade secret protection.

For designs, it may still be possible to register for trade dress rights in the design, provided that the design meets the non-functionality requirement and has developed secondary meaning. Trade dress is a type of trademark that does not require identification of a human designer.

While we wait for further guidance from the Supreme Court, this case may act as motivation for Congress to consider the Patent Act (and perhaps the Copyright Act) in light of evolving technology. This task is not without its challenges. Congress would also have to modify the requirement to declare that an inventor believes they are the original inventor.

Also, the written description requirement may change if it is geared towards a disclosure sufficient for a machine to understand instead of (or in addition to) a human. Still, allowing AI inventorship may help avoid a bias towards trade secret protection for AI that could unnecessarily reduce the knowledge placed in the public domain. And if Congress later changed the statute, there could be a ""bubble"" of AI-created inventions that are no longer eligible for patenting (due to, for example, the on-sale bar).

But cutting against all these considerations is the question of whether AI even needs the protection of inventorship. AI inventions may be relatively cheap to generate, cutting against the incentive to invest that might be driven by the availability of patent rights. But these inventions could potentially be quite valuable and thus vulnerable to infringement by competitors.

Finally, the question of property rights for machines adds an additional layer of uncertainty to these rights. So it seems that Thaler may be the first case in a long road considering the many aspects of this multifaceted issue.

Register here.

Recent years have seen a growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) acceleration hardware. IBM has taken note.

In the earliest days of AI, commercial CPU and GPU technologies were enough to handle the technology’s data sizes and computational parameters. But with the emergence of larger datasets and deep learning models, there is now a clear need for purpose-built AI hardware acceleration.

IBM is now throwing its hat into the hardware acceleration ring with its announcement this week of the IBM Artificial Intelligence Unit (AIU). The AIU is a full system-on-chip board that can plug into servers via an industry-standard PCIe interface.

The AIU is based on the same AI core that is built into IBM’s Tellum chip, which powers the IBM z16 series mainframes, including the LinuxOne Emperor 4. Each AIU has 32 cores, developed with a 5nm (nanometer) process, while the AI cores on the Tellum processor are 7nm.

“Here at IBM Research, we have a very strong microarchitecture and circuit design team that has focused on high-performance designs primarily for HPC [high-performance computing] and servers for many decades,” Jeff Burns, director at IBM Research AI Hardware Center, told VentureBeat. “So the same folks started thinking about deep learning acceleration.”

Accelerating AI with IBM’s Artificial Intelligence Unit (AIU)

The basic ideas behind IBM’s AI accelerator started to be developed in 2017 and have been expanded upon in the years since.

The AI acceleration work was picked up by the IBM Systems Group, which integrated the technology into processors running in mainframes. Burns said that his team also wanted to design a complete system-on-chip along with a PCIe card to create a pluggable AI acceleration device that could go into IBM’s x86-based cloud, IBM’s Power-based enterprise servers, or servers that IBM’s partners might build.

The AIU is not a CPU or a GPU, but rather an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Burns explained that instead of taking GPU technology and optimizing it for AI, the IBM approach has been designed from the ground up for AI. As such, the AIU has certain capabilities that aren’t always part of common AI accelerators. One is the ability to virtualize the AI acceleration services the AIU can enable.

In any cloud or enterprise environment, there are multiple workloads running on hardware that need access to AI acceleration resources. The way that an operator is able to distribute access to the hardware is with virtualization.

“GPUs were not virtualized at all in the beginning, and that is one place where a legacy design and a new design end up being starkly different,” Burns said. “If you take something that was not designed to be virtualized, and then try to modify it to support virtualization well, that can be a long journey and quite difficult.”

Burns explained that the IBM AIU has been designed to support enterprise virtualization, which includes the ability to be reliably multi-user and multi-tenant to ensure that workloads are isolated from one another.

IBM has also designed the AIU to be as compatible as possible with the vast majority of the software stack that modern data scientists use, including common tools such as the open-source PyTorch and TensorFlow technologies.

Approximate computing is the secret sauce of the IBM AIU

A key innovation that IBM is integrating with its AIU is a technique for AI acceleration called approximate computing, to help improve performance.

“Approximate computing is really the recognition that AI is not 100% correct,” Leland Chang, principal research staff member and senior manager, AI hardware, at IBM Research, told VentureBeat.

Chang explained that AI often works by recognizing a pattern and could well be just 99% accurate, meaning that 1% of results are incorrect. The concept of approximate computing is the recognition that within the AI algorithm it is possible to cut some corners. While Chang admitted that this can reduce precision, he explained that if information is lost in the right places, it doesn’t affect the result — which, more often than not, will still be 99% correct.

“Approximate computing, to some extent, is a phrase and a nice-sounding name, but it is simply recognizing that it doesn’t have to be 100% exact,” Chang said. “You’re losing some information, but you’re losing in places where it doesn’t matter.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

MILAN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Premium brakes maker Brembo (BRBI.MI) said on Wednesday it had set up an internal venture capital unit, called Brembo Ventures, to accelerate the development of technologic solutions to be applied to the automotive industry.

The move of the Italian group mirrors similar initiatives by other companies including Stellantis (STLA.MI) and CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI) with the common purpose to spur innovation in a fast changing environment as the automotive industry moves towards electrification and autonomous driving.

A spokesman for the group said Brembo Ventures was a unit and not set up as a proper venture capital fund with an initial financial endowment. Investments and funds needed will be assessed as opportunities arise, the spokesman added.

Brembo Ventures will invest in startups globally, focusing on artificial intelligence, big data, sensors, mechatronics, energy efficiency and sustainability, it said in a statement.

""With Brembo Ventures, we are even more structured to seize the market opportunities that can contribute to our goal of redefining future of braking systems and mobility,"" Brembo's Chief Business Development Officer Roberto Grazioli said.

Brembo Ventures' portfolio already includes a recently acquired 6.8% stake in PhotonPath, a company developing integrated photonics-based products, and a 20% stake in integrated photonic systems company Infibra Technologies which the brakes maker bought in 2020.

Even if you don’t understand this at first, it’s worth a second to understand it.

Moore’s Law, now nearly sixty years old, describes a simple engineering fact that has changed the life of everyone on the planet. The number of transistors that can be put on a chip doubles every two years. This doesn’t sound like much, but if you double even a number as small as 2 thirty times, it increases to more than a billion.

If the price of a house followed Moore’s Law, you could buy a mansion for a few pennies. Moore’s law describes the tech path that gives us artificial intelligence, smart phones and the internet.

And ever since he described the law, experts have been pointing out that it won’t continue, it can’t continue and we’ve exhausted any chance for more progress.

Artificial speech translation is a rapidly emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Initially created to aid communication among people who speak different languages, this speech-to-speech translation technology (S2ST) has found its way into several domains. For example, global tech conglomerates are now using S2ST for directly translating shared documents and audio conversations in the metaverse.

At Cloud Next ’22 last week, Google announced its own speech-to-speech AI translation model, “Translation Hub,” using cloud translation APIs and AutoML translation. Now, Meta isn’t far behind.

Meta AI today announced the launch of the universal speech translator (UST) project, which aims to create AI systems that enable real-time speech-to-speech translation across all languages, even those that are spoken but not commonly written.

“Meta AI built the first speech translator that works for languages that are primarily spoken rather than written. We’re open-sourcing this so people can use it for more languages,” said Mark Zuckerberg, cofounder and CEO of Meta.

According to Meta, the model is the first AI-powered speech translation system for the unwritten language Hokkien, a Chinese language spoken in southeastern China and Taiwan and by many in the Chinese diaspora around the world. The system allows Hokkien speakers to hold conversations with English speakers, a significant step toward breaking down the global language barrier and bringing people together wherever they are located — even in the metaverse.

This is a difficult task since, unlike Mandarin, English, and Spanish, which are both written and oral, Hokkien is predominantly verbal.

How AI can tackle speech-to-speech translation

Meta says that today’s AI translation models are focused on widely-spoken written languages, and that more than 40% of primarily oral languages are not covered by such translation technologies. The UST project builds upon the progress Zuckerberg shared during the company’s AI Inside the Lab event held back in February, about Meta AI’s universal speech-to-speech translation research for languages that are uncommon online. That event focused on using such immersive AI technologies for building the metaverse.

To build UST, Meta AI focused on overcoming three critical translation system challenges. It addressed data scarcity by acquiring more training data in more languages and finding new ways to leverage the data already available. It addressed the modeling challenges that arise as models grow to serve many more languages. And it sought new ways to evaluate and improve on its results.

Meta AI’s research team worked on Hokkien as a case study for an end-to-end solution, from training data collection and modeling choices to benchmarking datasets. The team focused on creating human-annotated data, automatically mining data from large unlabeled speech datasets, and adopting pseudo-labeling to produce weakly supervised data.

“Our team first translated English or Hokkien speech to Mandarin text, and then translated it to Hokkien or English,” said Juan Pino, researcher at Meta. “They then added the paired sentences to the data used to train the AI model.”

Meta AI’s Mark Zuckerberg demonstrates the company’s speech-to-speech AI translation model.

For the modeling, Meta AI applied recent advances in using self-supervised discrete representations as targets for prediction in speech-to-speech translation, and demonstrated the effectiveness of leveraging additional text supervision from Mandarin, a language similar to Hokkien, in model training. Meta AI says it will also release a speech-to-speech translation benchmark set to facilitate future research in this field.

William Falcon, AI researcher and CEO/cofounder of Lightning AI, said that artificial speech translation could play a significant role in the metaverse as it helps stimulate interactions and content creation.

“For interactions, it will enable people from around the world to communicate with each other more fluidly, making the social graph more interconnected. In addition, using artificial speech translation for content allows you to easily localize content for consumption in multiple languages,” Falcon told VentureBeat.

Falcon believes that a confluence of factors, such as the pandemic having massively increased the amount of remote work, as well as reliance on remote working tools, have led to growth in this area. These tools can benefit significantly from speech translation capabilities.

“Soon, we can look forward to hosting podcasts, Reddit AMA, or Clubhouse-like experiences within the metaverse. Enabling those to be multicast in multiple languages expands the potential audience on a massive scale,” he said.

How Meta’s universal speech translator (UST) works

The model uses S2UT to convert input speech to a sequence of acoustic units directly in the path, an implementation Meta previously pioneered. The generated output consists of waveforms from the input units. In addition, Meta AI adopted UnitY for a two-pass decoding mechanism where the first-pass decoder generates text in a related language (Mandarin), and the second-pass decoder creates units.

To enable automatic evaluation for Hokkien, Meta AI developed a system that transcribes Hokkien speech into a standardized phonetic notation called “Tâi-lô.” This allowed the data science team to compute BLEU scores (a standard machine translation metric) at the syllable level and quickly compare the translation quality of different approaches.

In addition to developing a method for evaluating Hokkien-English speech translations, the team created the first Hokkien-English bidirectional speech-to-speech translation benchmark dataset, based on a Hokkien speech corpus called Taiwanese Across Taiwan.

Meta AI claims that the techniques it pioneered with Hokkien can be extended to many other unwritten languages — and eventually work in real time. For this purpose, Meta is releasing the Speech Matrix, a large corpus of speech-to-speech translations mined with Meta’s innovative data mining technique called LASER. This will enable other research teams to create their own S2ST systems.

LASER converts sentences of various languages into a single multimodal and multilingual representation. The model uses a large-scale multilingual similarity search to identify similar sentences in the semantic space, i.e., ones that are likely to have the same meaning in different languages.

The mined data from the Speech Matrix provides 418,000-hour parallel speech to train the translation model, covering 272 language directions. So far, more than 8,000 hours of Hokkien speech have been mined together with the corresponding English translations.

A future of opportunities and challenges in speech translation

Meta AI’s current focus is developing a speech-to-speech translation system that does not rely on generating an intermediate textual representation during inference. This approach has been demonstrated to be faster than a traditional cascaded system that combines separate speech recognition, machine translation and speech synthesis models.

Yashar Behzadi, CEO and founder of Synthesis AI, believes that technology needs to enable more immersive and natural experiences if the metaverse is to succeed.

He said that one of the current challenges for UST models is the computationally expensive training that’s needed because of the breadth, complexity and nuance of languages.

“To train robust AI models requires vast amounts of representative data. A significant bottleneck to building these AI models in the near future will be the privacy-compliant collection, curation and labeling of training data,” he said. “The inability to capture sufficiently diverse data may lead to bias, differentially impacting groups of people. Emerging synthetic voice and NLP technologies may play an important role in enabling more capable models.”

According to Meta, with improved efficiency and simpler architectures, direct speech-to-speech could unlock near-human-quality real-time translation for future devices like AR glasses. In addition, the company’s recent advances in unsupervised speech recognition (wav2vec-U) and unsupervised machine translation (mBART) will aid the future work of translating more spoken languages within the metaverse.

With such progress in unsupervised learning, Meta aims to break down language barriers both in the real world and in the metaverse for all languages, whether written or unwritten.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

CHILOE ISLAND, Chile, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A smart buoy that can ""hear"" the ocean and monitor climate change is part of a new effort to help endangered whales avoid ship collisions on their journey from Antarctica to the equator.

The buoy was installed in the Gulf of Corcovado, some 1,100 kilometers (684 miles) south of Chile's capital, in early October and is the first of many planned by the Blue Boat Initiative, a project designed to protect whales and monitor marine ecosystems.

The area is teeming with marine life and has a large number of blue whales as well as Sei and Southern right whales during the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere.

""This is the beginning of a longer road,"" said Sonia Espanol, director of the Blue Boat Initiative, adding their hope is to cover the gulf with at least six buoys.

""From there, there are no limits, the idea is to be able to cover the entire migratory route of the whales from Antarctica to the equator.""

The area, brimming with fjords and islands, deals with a large volume of marine traffic responsible for sound pollution and a threat to sea mammals that depend on sound for navigation and hunting.

The buoy works by using software called Listening to the Deep Ocean Environment (LIDO), which monitors sounds and uses artificial intelligence to identify sea mammals, their type and location in real time. It then alerts nearby vessels so they can reduce noise and avoid collisions.

The device also contains sensors for water temperature, oxygen levels and more to monitor ocean health and the impact of climate change, which is expected to help guide public policy.

A mechanical neural network built from beams of variable stiffness Lee et al., Sci. Robot. 7, eabq7278 (2022)

A mechanical neural network composed of beams, motors and sensors can learn to carry out several different tasks, just like its software equivalent, and could lead to aircraft wings that morph during flight to maintain efficiency or minimise turbulence.

The basis of modern AI research is the artificial neural network (ANN), which mimics the structure of the human brain by creating large grids of artificial neurons connected by synapses. Just as the human brain learns new behaviours by strengthening synaptic connections, ANNs learn by adjusting the digital values stored to represent them.

Ryan Lee at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his colleagues have borrowed that concept to create a mechanical neural network in which the strength of connections between neurons is replaced by beams of variable stiffness.

Instead of processing digital data, the mechanical neural network processes forces applied to it, twisting and morphing its shape depending on the stiffness of its beams. For instance, an even force applied across one side of the network can be directed by many beams to immediately create force in a wave shape at the opposite end, while an even force applied upwards could produce the inverse wave.

The team built a network of 21 beams, each 15 centimetres long and arranged in a triangular grid. Every beam is equipped with a small linear motor, which can alter its stiffness, and sensors that measure how far each “neuron”, or beam joint, is out of position. This allows a computer to train the network by tweaking the beam stiffness. Once this is done, the structure requires no external computation and the various beam stiffnesses are locked in.

Lee says that an aircraft wing made of a mechanical neural network could automatically morph in response to situations, changing its profile in reaction to higher or lower speeds to maintain efficiency or to prevent undesirable flight characteristics.

“You could do something neat like turbulence interference, where the wing gets hit by something and it locally deforms and morphs to try and keep the energy spread out in a way that the cabin feels nice and smooth,” he says. “Right now, wings are designed to do big motions, flex, distribute that across the wing, and that results in jerkiness in the cabin.”

Future versions of the network could be scaled up to a much larger grid, with each beam possibly miniaturised using advanced 3D printing techniques, says Lee. Once a network was trained, either physically or in a simulation, it could be printed with set beam stiffnesses and require no electronics to function from that point on, he says.

As usual, the music industry group lists various torrent sites, cyberlockers and stream-ripping services as familiar suspects. In addition, several 'AI-based' music mixers and extractors are added as an emerging threat.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a buzzword that’s frequently used by startups and established businesses in the tech industry.

In some cases, it refers to little more than advanced algorithms, but complex self-learning computer systems with human-like traits are actively being developed as well.

From a copyright perspective, AI can bring up some interesting questions. For example, can content created by an AI be copyrighted like any other work? Or perhaps AI can infringe copyrights held by others?

AI Piracy

While legal experts scratch their heads over similar questions, the RIAA has already made up its mind about a selection of services claiming to offer AI music extractors and mixers.

Responding to a request from the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR), the music group highlighted several of these sites in its annual overview of ‘notorious’ piracy markets.

“There are online services that, purportedly using artificial intelligence (AI), extract, or rather, copy, the vocals, instrumentals, or some portion of the instrumentals from a sound recording, and/or generate, master or remix a recording to be very similar to or almost as good as reference tracks by selected, well known sound recording artists,” RIAA writes.

Songmastr

Songmastr is one of the platforms that’s mentioned. The service promises to “master” any song based on the style of well-known music artists such as Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Coltrane, Bob Dylan, James Brown and many others.

The site’s underlying technology is powered by the open-source Matchering 2.0 code, which is freely available on GitHub. And indeed, its purported AI capabilities are prominently in the site’s tagline.

“This service uses artificial intelligence and is based on the open source library Matchering. The algorithm masters your track with the same RMS, FR, peak amplitude and stereo width as the reference song you choose,” Songmastr explains.

Where Artificial Intelligence comes into play isn’t quite clear to us. The same can be said for the Acapella-Extractor and Remove-Vocals websites, which the RIAA lists in the same category. The names of these services are pretty much self-explanatory; they can separate the vocals from the rest of a track.

The RIAA logically doesn’t want third parties to strip music or vocals from copyrighted tracks, particularly when these derivative works are further shared with others.

Unauthorized Copies and Derivatives

While Songmastr’s service is a bit more advanced, the RIAA sees it as clearly infringing. After all, the original copyrighted tracks are used by the site to create derivative works, without the necessary permission.

“To the extent these services, or their partners, are training their AI models using our members’ music, that use is unauthorized and infringes our members’ rights by making unauthorized copies of our members works.

“In any event, the files these services disseminate are either unauthorized copies or unauthorized derivative works of our members’ music,” the RIAA’s submission adds.

Thus far, Songmastr doesn’t appear to be a major threat in terms of traffic. With less than 200 visits per day over the past 12 months, it hasn’t really caught on. Acapella-Extractor and Remove-Vocals are more popular, with a few hundred thousand monthly visits.

The RIAA is clearly worried about these services. Interestingly, however, the operator of Songmastr and Acapella-Extractor informs us that the music group hasn’t reached out with any complaints. But perhaps they’re still in the pipeline.

Aside from the emerging AI threats, the RIAA lists various torrent sites, download sites, streamrippers, and bulletproof ISPs in its overview. The popular video app likee.video is also included, as it reportedly failed to obtain proper licenses for the tracks it uses.

The RIAA’s full list of “notorious” pirate sites can be found below, and the full report is available here (pdf).

Oregon State University today announced that Jen-Hsun (Jensen) Huang, CEO of Nvidia, and Lori Huang donated $50 million to the school to build a new innovation complex on campus.

The university has also raised a total of $100 million in gifts to launch what will ultimately be a $200 million research and education center with one of the nation’s most powerful supercomputers.

The center will do research in artificial intelligence, materials science and robotics to solve global challenges in areas such as climate science, oceanography, sustainability and water resources.

The complex also will underpin OSU’s research and teaching supporting the semiconductor and broader technology industry in Oregon and beyond. Jensen Huang is founder and CEO of Nvidia, and both he and his wife Lori are Oregon State University graduates.

“We are thrilled by this extraordinary philanthropy and commitment to advancing research discovery and problem-solving,” said OSU President Jayathi Murthy, in a statement.

Artist’s rendering of a new innovation center at OSU.

Murthy said the three-story, 150,000 square-foot center is being designed and is anticipated to open at the school in Corvallis, Oregon, in 2025.

Murthy said the center is part of Oregon State’s efforts to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM education and research. The Huangs graduated from Oregon high schools and met while undergraduates in OSU’s College of Engineering.

“We discovered our love for computer science and engineering at OSU. We hope this gift will help inspire future generations of students also to fall in love with technology and its capacity to change the world,” said the Huangs in a statement.

“AI is the most transformative technology of our time,” they added. “To harness this force, engineering students need access to a supercomputer, a time machine, to accelerate their research. This new AI supercomputer will enable OSU students and researchers to make very important advances in climate science, oceanography, materials science, robotics, and other fields.”

The center will have an Nvidia supercomputer to support faculty in addressing highly complex and challenging computational problems. The OSU supercomputer – powered by next-generation Nvidia CPUs, GPUs and networking – is expected to be among the world’s fastest university supercomputers, powerful enough to train the largest AI models and perform complex digital twin simulations. The complex will also have a state-of-the-art clean room and other specialized research facilities.

During the 2023 Oregon legislative session, OSU will request $75 million in state-paid bonding to match philanthropic and university contributions for the collaborative innovation complex.

The complex will feature a state-of-the art supercomputer incorporating NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and OVX SuperPOD systems. Water used to cool it will help heat more than 500,000 square feet of building space on OSU’s Corvallis campus.

OSU Foundation CEO and President Shawn Scoville praised the Huangs’ philanthropy.

“Lori and Jen-Hsun are exceptional Oregon State alumni and truly visionary philanthropists,” said Scoville. “They bring so much to the table. Every project they are involved in is improved because of their input, and OSU is the great beneficiary of their experience and active engagement. It is a joy and an honor to work with them.”

The Huangs’ gift was announced as the OSU Foundation launched the university’s second university-wide fundraising and engagement campaign.

Nvidia is funding a new supercomputer at OSU.

The university has received four gifts of $25 million or more for the campaign to date. In 2021, the OSU Foundation announced an anonymous $50 million gift supporting the completion of Reser Stadium. In 2018, the university received its first $50 million gift, a contribution from alumnus Gary Carlson to name the Gary R. Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine.

Lori Huang is the president of the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation, supporting higher education, public health, and STEM initiatives across the U.S., alongside local community organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The Huang Foundation previously gave $5 million to build a laboratory for cancer research at Oregon State University, and $30 million for the Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center at Stanford University. The Huangs joined Melinda Gates in supporting AI4ALL, a national nonprofit working to increase diversity and inclusion in AI. They have also made major educational grants to Johns Hopkins University and City Year San Jose. Lori graduated from Oregon State University in 1985 with a BSEE. The Huangs have two children.

Register here.

Deloitte released the fifth edition of its State of AI in the Enterprise research report today, which surveyed more than 2,600 global executives on how businesses and industries are deploying and scaling artificial intelligence (AI) projects.

Most notably, the Deloitte report found that while AI continues to move tantalizingly closer to the core of the enterprise – 94% of business leaders agree that AI is critical to success over the next five years – for some, outcomes seem to be lagging.

For example, 79% percent of respondents reported achieving full-scale deployment for three or more types of AI applications, which is up from 62% last year. But the percentage of organizations in the “underachiever” category – those who have deployed a high number of AI projects but have low outcomes – rose from 17% last year to 22% this year.

That may seem to be a contradiction, but according to Beena Ammanath, executive director of the Global Deloitte AI Institute, it’s not a surprise. What is a surprise, she added, is how quickly the AI landscape is changing – to the point that what began as an every-other-year Deloitte report is now created annually.

“The AI space is evolving so fast and the technology is growing so rapidly,” she said. The fact that many companies are underachieving with the outcomes of their AI investments “tells you how fast the technology is being deployed.” The investment in AI is there, she explained, but there is so much happening in AI research and applications that many are unable to keep pace as far as gaining value.

Deloitte suggests 4 AI action steps

To fully fuel the AI transformation in the enterprise, Deloitte’s report focuses on four key actions that can power widespread value from AI, right away.

First, investing in culture and leadership is essential. “AI is not something that can be relegated to your IT or back-end teams,” said Ammanath. “This can have a real impact on your core business, it can create new revenue opportunities, new product ideas that just didn’t exist before.”

Instead, you need the business leadership to buy in, not just to get the technology into the company, but to drive the culture change and bring in the right talent.

“The entire organization needs to be on board with the technology, whether it’s the AI team deploying and building the tool or you have an AI team actually creating the models,” she said.

That hasn’t happened in most organizations yet. According to the report, while 43% of respondents report appointing a leader responsible for effective human and AI collaboration, concrete actions are lagging.

Transforming operations is key

According to the Deloitte report, high-outcome organizations are “significantly more likely to adopt additional operational leading practices.”

These include tracking the ROI of deployed models and applications. Eighty-six percent of high-outcome enterprises do, compared to only 71% of low-outcome organizations.

High-outcome organizations are also more likely to have a documented process for governance and quality of data put into AI models, follow documented MLops procedures and a documented AI model life cycle publication strategy, leverage a common and consistent platform for AI model and application development, and use an AI quality and risk management process and framework to assess AI model bias and other risks before models go into production.

The results are especially relevant, the report pointed out, given that a clear majority (60%) of respondents viewed AI solutions as strategically “very important” for their organizations’ success, including more than 55% of respondents from low-outcome organizations.

Orchestrating tech and talent together

The Deloitte report found that organizations need to plan AI technology and talent investments in tandem, understanding that both human talent and AI-driven technology have specific skill sets.

The ability for an organization to achieve differentiated tools and applications with AI still hinges in large part on the talent it is able to bring in-house, the report said, but Ammanath also emphasized the importance of making sure that everyone in the organization understands basic AI.

“You [may not] need to know what a diffusion model is, for example, but you need to have a high-level understanding of what AI is … that basic foundational training should be something that you provide to every employee,” she said. Then, organizations need to provide role-based training, so that a data scientist that supports a marketing team, for example, understands the specific questions needed to evaluate a vendor.

Finally, organizations need to provide governance mechanisms, so employees aren’t expected to know everything about every kind of AI tool. “There are tactical things you can do to actually start addressing these issues and make this less complicated for your employees right now,” said Ammanath.

Select the right AI use cases

Finally, the Deloitte report cautioned that as companies increase their AI investments, they eventually address a larger and wider range of use cases. Organizations should be choosy about selecting which business processes to start with, since the choices they make now may set the course for how quickly they will achieve successful outcomes and gain momentum.

“Doing AI for the sake of AI is never a good idea,” said Ammanath. “You know, you start buying some of these tools or setting up a Data Science Center of Excellence without having a clear pathway towards the value – whether it’s not deploying it in the right function, or not putting the right level of thought into it – it can actually create a false start and impact the end goal.”

Deloitte’s Ammanath remains optimistic

Ammanath says she is an “AI optimist” who sees a lot of potential among organizations that are currently underachieving in their AI project outcomes.

“I do hope that underachievers are able to tap into the ecosystem, learn from these best practices and get more value,” she said. “I honestly believe that AI can bring a lot of value, and we can address the risks, but we also need to focus on the value creation.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Nvidia and Oracle plan to make an upcoming release of Nvidia AI Enterprise available on OCI, offering customers access to Nvidia’s accelerated, secure and scalable platform for end-to-end AI development and deployment.

Oracle is also now offering early access to Nvidia RAPIDS acceleration for Apache Spark data processing on the OCI Data Flow fully managed Apache Spark service. Data processing is one of the top cloud computing workloads. To support this demand, OCI Data Science plans to offer support for OCI bare-metal shapes, including BM.GPU.GM4.8 with Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPUs, across managed notebook sessions, jobs and model deployment.

The announcement also noted that Nvidia Clara, a healthcare AI and HPC application framework for medical imaging, genomics, natural language processing and drug discovery, will be coming soon. Oracle and Nvidia are also collaborating on new AI-accelerated Oracle Cerner offerings for healthcare, which span areas such as analytics, clinical solutions, operations and patient management systems.

‘Supercomputer’ in the cloud

Leo Leung, vice president of OCI and Oracle technology, said that customers have already been using Oracle and Nvidia technologies together since 2017. “Customers are basically leveraging our technologies like a supercomputer in the cloud, so we’re going to expand the investment there,” he said in a press briefing in advance of the announcement.

There’s also a great deal of opportunity within specific industries, he added, as well as new efforts to develop new capabilities throughout the full stack. “So, not just the GPUs and infrastructure, but getting into the software and service layer,” he said.

Pat Lee, head of strategic enterprise partnerships at Nvidia, said that OCI adding tens of thousands of additional GPUs enables customers with large, accelerated computing demands.

One customer recently announced joint work with Oracle and Nvidia to take advantage of the large amount of GPU infrastructure required to deliver large language models to solve their business needs. “This is why customers and partners really need this large amount of capacity,” he said.

The cloud AI ‘narrative’

“Everyone is trying to bring that whole AI narrative into their offerings and adding more and more capabilities,” Sid Nag, vice president in the technology and service provider group at Gartner, told VentureBeat.

The announcements fall into three broad categories, he explained. “One is taking the advantages of Nvidia AI software and layering it on to their whole AI strategy,” he said.

Then, Oracle has focused on an Nvidia GPU solution that essentially allows them to train AI models at scale, he added. “AI models can get pretty hairy because they’re computer-intensive,” he said. “If you’re doing heavy-duty algorithm training, they’re basically using the Nvidia A100 V2 GPU functionality for that.”

Lastly, Oracle is focusing on a real-time GPU, using the Nvidia MPI technology. “They fall into borrowing the Nvidia technology from the Nvidia AI software perspective, then they’ve got the real-time aspect.”

Combined with the training and scaling AI models at scale from a performance perspective, this allows Oracle to create an entire AI narrative, Nag explained: “Oracle is getting the benefit of using the Nvidia AI functionality.”

Overall, he said, 2022 clearly seems to be the year of AI when it comes to enterprise cloud. “It’s the coming-out party for AI,” he said.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat
18,New Amex ML model helps reduce account login fraud,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1328368618.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,19/10/2022,Amex recently developed an end-to-end ML modeling solution which can predict if an account login is from a genuine customer.,https://venturebeat.com/ai/new-amex-ml-model-helps-reduce-account-login-fraud/,"Join us on November 9 to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit. Register here.

For American Express (Amex), using AI and machine learning (ML) to address credit card fraud is nothing new. The company has been using artificial intelligence to automate billions of fraud risk decisions for years, while hundreds of Amex data scientists work on AI and ML models related to fraud risk.

“It is certainly a key focus for us,” James Lee, VP of global fraud risk at Amex, told VentureBeat. “We’re totally vigilant to make sure that we defend against those risks.”

However, account login fraud is a particularly thorny challenge that is only rising in importance. With the advent of chip-pin cards and online one-time passwords, fraudsters are looking at more unconventional ways of committing credit card fraud.

Amex ML model pinpoints account login fraud

One way they do that is to log into a customer’s online account to change key demographic info, order replacement cards, get access to OTPs or disable spend/fraud alerts — and then make fraudulent transactions on the customer’s card. They may even access membership rewards currencies and try to redeem them for digital gift cards.

To sniff out login fraud, Amex recently developed an end-to-end ML modeling solution which, at an account login level, can predict if the login is from a genuine customer. Logins with high-risk scores are required to add incremental authentication, while low-risk logins get a seamless online experience. This ensures bad logins are captured in real time while good customers are minimally impacted.

Next-step-up authentication is high in friction for genuine customers, Lee explained. “There was a strong push from our leadership team to make sure that we evaluate the risk of the individual logging in, leveraging the vast amount of data and history we have on that customer’s activities,” he said.

Now, with the iteration of the ML model for real-time prediction of account login risk, fraud rates have been decreasing over time. “With the first iteration versus now, the model is stronger-performing than most other models in the marketplace provided by third-party vendors,” he said.

Stopping login fraudsters in real time

Abhinav Jain, VP of global fraud decision science at Amex, leads a 60-person fraud machine-learning team working globally for Amex on projects related to all kinds of fraud. He says building an ML model to address login fraud risk has been a key project goal over the last few years.

Traditionally, he explained, Amex developed machine learning models that analyze fraud risks at the point-of-sale transaction — when a customer is using a credit card in a store, for example.

But as login fraud activity ramped up with online takeovers and account hacking, Amex saw the need to prevent fraud at the login level, “so that we can stop the bad actors upfront and not wait for them to transact,” he explained.

The first challenge Jain’s team was able to solve was integrating logins into an ML platform which had trained the model on historical customer data. “Each login needs to get scored by the model in real time,” he said.

A second challenge was figuring out how to identify fraudulent logins. “When we build a transaction or point-of-sale model, we reach out to customers, or customers reach out to us, so we know which transactions are fraud or not,” he said. But with account login fraud, “it becomes tricky, because we don’t go back and ask customers.”

Instead, Amex had to develop a logic for the ML model to learn. It uses the customer’s past online login behavior to identify which logins are fraudulent, which are good and which are uncertain.

Amex ML model offers a feedback loop

“It’s really about that feedback loop,” said Lee, who explained that the machine learning model incorporates new information and determines whether certain signals and characteristics translate into false positives or are actually accurate predictions of future fraud behavior.

“There was always a rules-based structure to determine the low versus moderate versus high risk,” he said. But that was more of a static output, whereas the new ML model can assess all of the most recent information in real time and then factor that into the most recent performance as the model calibrates itself.

“That has allowed us to strengthen the hit rate for high-risk prediction,” he added. “It is what enables us to have the industry’s leading fraud reduction rates relative to any networks or competitor issuers in the marketplace.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Register here.

Synthetic data will be a huge industry in five to 10 years. For instance, Gartner estimates that by 2024, 60% of data for AI applications will be synthetic. This type of data and the tools used to create it have significant untapped investment potential. Here’s why.

Synthetic data can feed data-hungry AI/ML

We are effectively on the cusp of a revolution in how machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can grow and have even more applications across sectors and industries.

We live in an era of skyrocketing demand for ML algorithms in every aspect of our lives, from fun face-masking applications such as filters on Instagram or Snapchat to deeply useful applications designed to improve our work and living experiences, such as assisting in diagnosing illness or recommending treatment. Among the prime opportunities are emotion and engagement recognition, better homeland security features and better anomaly detections in industrial contexts.

At the same time, while people and businesses are hungry for ML/AI-based products, algorithms are hungry for data to train on. All of that means we will inevitably see more and more different data needs, and entirely manufactured data is the key.

From Grand Theft Auto to Google

Heard about self-driving cars learning the rules of the road by playing games like Grand Theft Auto V to study virtual traffic? That was an early version of ML through synthetic data. Similarly, many in tech may have come across synthetic “scanned documents,” which have been used to train text recognition and data extraction models.

Banking and finance is one sector that already leans heavily on synthetic data for certain processes, while tech giants like Google and Facebook are also using it, drawn by the extraordinary efficiency it can bring to the work of project managers and data scientists.

In fact, we expect to see the number of synthetic images and data points increasing tenfold over the next year and by many hundred-fold in the next few years.

Constraints of real-world data

Those at the cutting edge of ML are increasingly turning to synthetic data to circumvent the numerous constraints of original or real-world data. For instance, company Synthesis AI offers a cloud-based generation platform that delivers millions of perfectly labeled and diverse images of artificial people. Synthesis AI has been able to accomplish many challenges that come with the messy reality of original data. For a start, the company makes the data cheaper. It can be too expensive for an organization to generate the quantity and diversity of data it needs.

For example, could you get photos of someone from every conceivable angle, wearing every possible combination of clothing in every possible light condition? It would be an unimaginable amount of work to do that in real life, but synthetic data can be designed to account for endless variations.

That also means much easier labeling of data. Imagine trying to pinpoint the source of light, its brightness, and its distance from an object in photos to train a shadow development algorithm. It would be pretty much impossible. With synthetic data, you have that data by default, because it was generated with such parameters.

Furthermore, companies must also contend with stringent restrictions on the use of real-world data. In the past, companies have shared data without the layers of cybersecurity expected now. GDPR and other data regulations make it complex and challenging, and sometimes illegal, for companies to share real-world data with partners and vendors.

In other cases, it may not be even possible or safe to generate the data. The real-time 3D engine producer Unigine counts as a client Daedalean, which is working on urban flying mobility. Daedalean has started to train its autonomous flying cars in Unigine virtual worlds. This makes complete sense — it doesn’t yet have a safe real-world environment in which to test its products extensively and generate the deep datasets it needs. A similar case is CarMaker software by IPG Automotive. Its 10.0 release introduced upgraded 3D visualization powered by UNIGINE 2 Sim, featuring physically-based rendering and real-world camera parameters.

Synthetic people and synthetic objects have been much more widely used by tech giants recently. Amazon used synthetic data to train Alexa, Facebook acquired synthetic data generator AI.Reverie, and Nvidia realized NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator, a powerful synthetic-data-generation engine that produces physically simulated synthetic data for training deep neural networks.

Combating bias in data

The challenges of real-world data don’t end there. In some fields, huge historical bias pollutes data sets. This is how we end up with global tech behemoths running into hot water because their algorithms don’t recognize black faces properly. Even now, with ML technology experts acutely aware of the bias issue, it can be challenging to collate a real-world dataset entirely free of bias.

Even if a real-world dataset can account for all of the above challenges, which in reality is hard to imagine, data models need to be improved and tweaked constantly to stay unbiased and avoid degradation over time. That means a constant need for fresh data.

Understanding the opportunity

Synthetic data is in the relatively early stages of growth and it’s not a panacea for every use case. It continues to face technical challenges and limitations, and the tools and standards for it have not yet been standardized.

Nonetheless, synthetic data is definitely an accelerator for ML/AI-based products as they continue to expand into every industry and sector, and we’ll certainly see a lot of new companies and deals in the area.

Register here.

Foundation models are at the vanguard of innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) today, providing new opportunities that were simply not possible even a few years ago. At Oracle CloudWorld 2022, Adept AI Labs, discussed a new foundation model the startup recently developed for enabling actions on computer systems.

With a foundation model, there is a core model — the ‘foundation’ that is trained on a massive scale and then becomes the basis for additional expansion and applications. Among the best known foundation models are OpenAI’s GPT-3 and DALL-E as well as Stability AI’s stable diffusion. Those models have enabled development of language and image applications, and now Adept shared details about its new foundation model called ACT-1.

“We started Adept in January with a team from Google, DeepMind and OpenAI and we’ve all been struck by this paradigm shift we’ve seen in the industry,” said Kelsey Szot cofounder and product lead for Adept.

The foundation model paradigm shift

Prior to the emergence of the foundation model, the primary method for building out machine learning (ML) involved training organizations and then fine-tuning models for each different use case.

Szot explained that with the help of transformers, which is a type of neural network, it’s possible for an organization to train a vast amount of unlabeled data that are not specific to any task. By giving the transformer-powered network a few thousand examples of specific tasks, the model can be more capable than past models that an organization spent years building with millions of training examples.

“You end up with what we call foundation models, which are these large-scale generally capable models that both outperform the task-specific models we built in the past, and also unlock capabilities that have never before been possible,” Szot said.

What Adept is building with its foundation model

Adept’s foundation model effort focuses on different capabilities than other existing efforts.

“Instead of being used for text or images or protein folding, Adept’s foundation model is for actions,” Szot said. “We’re training a model on how to use every piece of software on your computer so that you can interact with your computer just by using human language.”

The challenge of how to actually communicate with a computer and get it to do what the user wants has been around for as long as computers have existed. Szot said this effort started in the earliest days of computing, with punch cards and programming languages. In the modern era, the use of graphical user interfaces make operations much easier, though she argued that humans still do a surprising amount of translating when using computing tools.

“Whether it’s clicking, dragging or dropping, finding a menu or typing a formula, there’s a lot we have to do to get these tools to work for us,” Szot said. “What we’re working on at Adept is building an overlay to the tools that you use today – that allow you to skip this translation step to just express in human language what you’re looking for, and have that software do that for you.”

How Adept is using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

As a startup, Szot noted that her organization could start with a clean sheet when it comes to thinking about whom to partner with and what technology should be used. Building a foundation model requires a large amount of computing power, which is where Adept is leaning on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

“We’ve worked really closely with OCI to build this cluster of thousands of interconnected GPUs that allow us to train these extremely large-scale models efficiently and effectively,” Szot said.

Szot stressed that the scale and power of OCI is paramount to the future success of Adept and its foundation model. She noted that foundation models get better with more scale, in terms of both data and also compute.

“In terms of what these models will be able to do in the future, I think we’re just scratching the surface of the impact this can have on the enterprise,” Szot said. “I think it’s really going to change the way that we interact with computers in every part of our lives, it’s going to make us more efficient, more creative and more capable.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

BENGALURU, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Indian telecom service provider Reliance Jio has chosen Nokia (NOKIA.HE) as a major supplier, the Finnish telecom equipment maker said on Monday, as India's biggest mobile carrier gears up to expand next-generation wireless services across the country.

Nokia will supply Reliance Jio, which has more than 420 million customers, with 5G radio access network (RAN) equipment in a multi-year deal, the company said in a statement.

""Nokia will supply equipment from its AirScale portfolio, including base stations, high-capacity 5G Massive MIMO antennas, and Remote Radio Heads to support different spectrum bands, and self-organizing network software,"" it said.

5G data speeds in India are expected to be about 10 times faster than those of 4G, with the network seen as vital for emerging technologies like self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.

Reliance (RELI.NS) snapped up airwaves worth $11 billion in a $19 billion 5G spectrum auction in August and had launched 5G services in select cities. It is also working with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to launch a budget 5G smartphone.

As India's telecom service providers roll out 5G services, the government is also pushing top mobile phone manufacturers, like Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung (005930.KS) and others, to prioritise rolling out software upgrades to support 5G, amid concerns that many of their models are not ready for the high-speed service. read more

The Reliance-Nokia deal comes at a time when some governments, including India, have either banned or discouraged the use of China's Huawei in national networks.

""Jio is committed to continuously investing in the latest network technologies to enhance the experience of all of its customers,"" Akash Ambani, chairman of Reliance Jio, said.

Meanwhile, Reliance Jio is planning to raise an additional $1.5 billion via external commercial borrowings to fund its 5G capital expenditure plans, the Economic Times newspaper reported, citing sources.

This is part education, part rebellion, and part warning for what’s to come.

We have been invited to a town hall meeting held by Scott Price, Sarah Mainwaring and Simon Laherty. A charismatic and argumentative trio, they play themselves and co-author the script alongside Michael Chan, Mark Deans, Sonia Teuben and director Bruce Gladwin. Holding the stage with ease, they want to change the way disabled people are treated. By explaining what people with learning disabilities have been subjected to through time, they hope to raise awareness, create a community, and stop the future from echoing the past.

The team discuss the stark reality of violence and ignorance with no-nonsense honesty

Favouring conversation over plot, much of the meeting is derailed by questions of ethics, language and philosophy. Ideas of consent and hypocrisy are woven throughout, discussing the rules of behaviour and challenging intentions of empowerment. When Sarah panics about leading the meeting, Scott pressures her to continue, saying it’ll be good for her. Simon pushes back, asking how you can ever possibly know what’s good for another person.

These are morally complex topics and the team discuss the stark reality of violence and ignorance with no-nonsense honesty. With a simple stack of chairs, the minimalism of Gladwin’s direction allows the performers to carve out their own space in each argument. Simon is a calm mediator while Scott loses his temper at Sarah, who takes it until she tires, snapping back when he goes too far.

Then their focus takes a surprising step sideways, as they draw us into the imminent domination of artificial intelligence. Its inclusion is not subtle, but smartly drawn, suggesting that people without learning disabilities will be treated in the future by AI in the same way people with learning disabilities are treated today. Sarah’s furious interaction with the auto captioning screen behind her is a brilliant moment of creativity, more of which would increase the impact of their argument.

Humour and rage are twisted together with a current of playfulness running under the script. But this is more debate than drama, platforming a frank discussion of the complexity of terminologies for and attitudes towards disability, and the structures of support we all, perhaps unadvisedly, put our trust in.",artificial intelligence,the guardian

Greg Rutkowski is an artist with a distinctive style: He's known for creating fantasy scenes of dragons and epic battles that fantasy games like Dungeons and Dragons have used.

He said it used to be ""really rare to see a similar style to mine on the internet.""

Yet if you search for his name on Twitter, you'll see plenty of images in his exact style — that he didn't make.

Rutkowski has become one of the most popular names in AI art, despite never having used the technology himself.

People are creating thousands of artworks that look like his using programs called AI-image generators, which use artificial intelligence to create original artwork in minutes or even seconds after a user types in a few words as directions.

Rutkowski's name has been used to generate around 93,000 AI images on one image generator, Stable Diffusion — making him a far more popular search term than Picasso, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Vincent van Gogh in the program.

""I feel like something's happening that I can't control,"" Rutkowski, who is based in Poland, told Insider. ""My name is being used a lot to generate AI images, along with the names of other working artists.""

""Dragon Cage"" by Greg Rutkowski. Greg Rutkowski

Images created when Insider typed ""Dragon battle with a man at night in the style of Greg Rutkowski"" into Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion

AI-image generators create images that are unique, rather than collages pulled from stock images.

A user simply types words describing what they'd like to see, referred to as ""prompts,"" into a search bar. It's a bit like searching Google Images, except the results are brand-new artworks created using the text in the user's search terms as instructions.

One of the most common prompts is to use the name of an artist to create something mimicking their style.

""People are pretending to be me,"" Rutkowski said. ""I'm very concerned about it; it seems unethical.""

Simon Stålenhag, an artist and designer based in Sweden, told Insider that although he isn't against AI-generated art in principle, he does take issue with how some people are using the new technology.

""People are selling prints made by AI that have my name in the title,"" he said. ""Something like — 'Rusty Robot in a field in the style of Simon Stålenhag' — which is a super aggressive way of using this technology.""

He's seen people be hostile when they share an AI image in his style on social media. ""People have tagged me and said that they're gonna make me lose my job or something like that, they're really harsh and aggressive,"" he said.

He believes AI-image generators are ""not in the hands of artists right now. It's in the hands of early adopters of tech.""

Rutkowski, who uses both digital tools and classic oil on canvas for his work, is worried that this explosion in imitation art means his style — which has seen him land deals with Sony and Ubisoft — might lose its value.

""We work for years on our portfolio,"" Rutkowski said. ""Now suddenly someone can produce tons of images with these generators and sign them with our name.""

""The generators are being commercialized right now, so you don't know exactly what the final output will be of your name being used over the years,"" he said.

""Maybe you and your style will be excluded from the industry because there'll be so many artworks in that style that yours won't be interesting anymore.""

An explosion in imitation

More and more consumers are using AI-image generators.

OpenAI, which Elon Musk cofounded in 2015, made its DALL-E image generator open to the public in September. Before lifting the waitlist, OpenAI said the program already had more than 1.5 million users.

Liz DiFiore, the president of the Graphic Artist Guild, an organization that supports designers, illustrators, and photographers across the US, said the ease with which AI can copy styles could cause financial fallout for artists.

""Artists spend a lot of time throughout their career, and make a lot of income, on being able to license their images and being sought after specifically for their style,"" she said.

""So if an AI is copying an artist's style and a company can just get an image generated that's similar to a popular artist's style without actually going to artists to pay them for that work, that could become an issue.""

US copyright law only protects artists against the reproduction of their actual artworks — not from someone else mimicking their style.

Some of the most popular AI-image generators — which include DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion — have policies in place to prevent consumers from using their products in certain ways. OpenAI, for example, prohibits the use of images of celebrities or politicians.

All three programs block users from creating ""harmful content"" by filtering things like nudity and gore.

Insider asked representatives from DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion if they have any measures in place to prevent images being created that mimic the style of working artists.

A representative for Stable Diffusion said the company was working on an opt-out system for artists who don't want AI programs to be trained on their work.

The spokesperson added that an artist's name ""is only one component of a diverse set of instructions to the AI model that creates a unique style that is different from an individual artist's style.""

Representatives for Open AI did not specify any measures in place to protect living artists but said the company would seek artists' perspectives as it expanded access to DALL-E.

Midjourney didn't respond to Insider's questions.

AI data training

AI-image generators ""train"" by learning from large sets of images and captions. Representatives from OpenAI said both publicly available sources and images licensed by the company make up DALL-E's training data.

Representatives for Stable Diffusion said the program uses web crawls to gather information and images.

Rutkowski thinks living artists should have been excluded from the databases that train the generators.

""I'm not against the AI overall, I think it's a good technology. But I think they should have excluded artists' names from the program,"" he said.

Another designer and illustrator, RJ Palmer, dubbed the generators actively ""anti-artist"" on Twitter because he said they are ""explicitly trained on current working artists.""

Artists can check if their work has been used to train AI programs on a website called Have I Been Trained, which the German artist Mat Dryhurst and the American sound artist Holly Herndon created.

The pair have been working on tools to help artists opt-out of AI data-training sets. The website filters through around 5.8 billion images that are in the dataset Stable Diffusion and Midjourney use to train their programs.

Other artists feel they should have been asked for consent for their images to be scraped for the data used to train AI generators.

Stålenhag said it would have been nice to be asked if he could be included in the training data, but said it was an inevitable consequence of putting art on the internet.

""I see it as being very similar to how artists already work,"" he told Insider.

""We do copy other people's ideas and styles and designs, and we take stuff,"" he said, noting that he also doesn't think AI art is good enough quality to be a ""threat"" at present.

""There's a hype around AI that I think is weird because I just don't think that it's very good,"" he said. ""I don't see it as a threat because the visuals are not as good as what artists can create.""

Copyright laws around AI images are murky

It's unclear whether copyright laws will protect the new artwork that AI programs generate.

""Copyright issues around AI is probably one of the biggest areas that we are focused on,"" DiFiore said, adding that it is still ""a very gray area.""

Some stock-image libraries, such as Getty Images, have refused to carry AI-generated artwork due to the uncertainty around copyright and commercial use.

A spokesperson for the US Copyright Office told Insider that works generated only by artificial intelligence lacked the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim.

They said the office would not ""knowingly grant registration to a work that was claimed to have been created solely by machine with artificial intelligence.""

But it's unclear whether a person entering search prompts into a program to create an AI artwork counts as a human-AI collaboration.

Representatives for Stable Diffusion said while images created can be used for commercial offerings, the company wasn't able to say whether the images would be copyrightable. They added this decision was up to individual nations at the legislative level.

Representatives for OpenAI said they think images generated by their programs can be copyrighted for commercial reasons.

A spokesperson from OpenAI said: ""When DALL-E is used as a tool that assists human creativity, we believe that the images are copyrightable. DALL-E users have full rights to commercialize and distribute the images they create as long as they comply with our content policy.""

They added that ""copyright law has adapted to new technology in the past and will need to do the same with AI-generated content.""

Despite reservations, the technology's potential also excites many artists.

Giles Christopher, a London-based commercial photographer specializing in food and drink, uses DALL-E and other AI-image generators to experiment with portraits and create artificial backgrounds for some of his commercial shots.

""I've come out with images that you wouldn't question are photographs,"" he said. ""Some of the arguments I've had from photographers are that the images are looking too good.""

He thinks the genie is out of the bottle when it comes to AI, and that artists should look for ways to include it into their work.

""I have friends in the industry who will storm out of the room if I even bring up using AI,"" he said.

But he's keeping an open mind. ""I'm still on the fence. It's like keeping your enemies close,"" Christopher said.",artificial intelligence,business insider

Coverage of Google’s latest innovations and leading predictions dominated news coverage this week as the tech giant touted new strides in artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, open source, cloud and the future of passwords — or lack thereof with its new rollout of passkey authentication.

At its Google Next 2022 event, the company debuted several tools and technologies to help enterprises navigate a rapidly evolving technological world, including its new Vertex AI Vision service, OpenXLA Project and support for unstructured data and Apache Spark on BigQuery, to name a few.



The company predicts that low-code, no-code solutions will continue to power innovations across sectors, detailed the impact of multicloud across the enterprise, advocated for increased automation in workflows and even hinted at a future with a four-day workweek, thanks to AI.

In further news on the cloud front, a new report published findings that 81% of IT teams have been asked by C-level executives to slow or halt their cloud spending as financial markets continue to be volatile.

As the economy continues to take a turn, creativity across enterprise tech stacks may be one key to keeping innovation flowing when budgets are not. JetBlue is one player that is currently demonstrating the effectiveness of this concept. The commercial airline detailed how it uses a unique combination of features from Snowflake and Fivetran to customize its management of structured and unstructured data.

Here’s more from our top five tech stories of the week:

Report: 81% of IT teams directed to reduce or halt cloud spending by C-suite



According to a new study from Wanclouds, 81% of IT leaders say their C-suite has directed them to reduce or take on no additional cloud spending as costs skyrocket and market headwinds worsen.



As organizations move forward with digital transformations they set out on at the beginning of the pandemic, multicloud usage is becoming increasingly unwieldy, and costs are difficult to manage across hybrid environments.



Visibility and tracking of cloud spending is also being challenged by the industry’s embrace of hybrid and multicloud infrastructure, which can be complex to manage.

Google introduces passwordless authentication to Chrome and Android with passkeys



Google announced that it is bringing passkeys to Chrome and Android, enabling users to create and use passkeys to log into Android devices. Users can store passkeys on their phones and computers, and use them to log in password-free.



The announcement comes after Apple, Google and Microsoft committed to expand support for the passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium in March of this year.

How JetBlue’s integrated use of Snowflake and Fivetran is a model for the modern data stack



Commercial airline company, JetBlue, is using the integrated Snowflake data stack to power insights into its customer services and operational activities.



The company’s a tight grip on the vast amounts of data it holds is crucial for the airline. Its data team turns information into insight by using a combination of Snowflake’s Data Cloud and Fivetran’s data integration service.



This combination represents the modern data stack. Data management is a complex challenge, and information comes from multiple directions and myriad sources. So, any attempt to turn both structured and unstructured data into useful insight requires a broad collection of techniques and technologies.

Top 10 cloud technology predictions from Google



At its Cloud Next event, Google unveiled a range of solutions and updates across its product and services suite to empower all levels of developers and technical decision-makers. The focus was on providing the most open, extensible and powerful data cloud, but the company didn’t just showcase its product innovations. It also gave a glimpse at where we’re headed.



Among some top announcements, a few predictions emerged, including about widespread adoption of open source and neuro-inclsuive design.

Google reveals what’s next for Cloud AI



Google made it clear that it wants to be enterprises’ deployment target of choice for AI and machine learning (ML) workloads.



It announced a series of services this week, including its new Vertex AI Vision service, which is a computer-vision-as-a-service capability. Google also hopes to make it easier for enterprises to build specific types of applications that benefit from AI, which is where the new AI Agents service fits in.

There’s no shortage of groundbreaking technology underpinning generative AI, but one key innovation is is diffusion models. Inspired by thermodynamic concepts, diffusion models have piqued the public interest, quickly displacing generative adversarial networks (GANs) as the go-to method for AI-based image generation.

These models learn by corrupting their training data with incrementally added noise and then determining how to reverse this noising process in order to recover the original image. After being trained, diffusion models can use these denoising methods to generate new “clean” data from random input. Popular text-to-image generators such as DALL-E 2, Imagen and Midjourney all use diffusion models. Another key entrant in this category is Stability AI, the startup behind the Stable Diffusion model, a powerful, free and open-source text-to-image generator that launched in August 2022.

Founded in 2020 by Emad Mostaque, Stability AI claims to be the world’s first community-driven, open-source artificial intelligence (AI) company that aims to solve the lack of “organization” within the open-source AI community.

“AI promises to solve some of humanity’s biggest challenges. But we will only realize this potential if the technology is open and accessible to all,” said Mostaque. “Stability AI puts the power back into the hands of developer communities and opens the door for groundbreaking new applications. An independent entity in this space supporting these communities can create real value and change.”

The company recently announced $101 million in funding. The oversubscribed round was led by Coatue, Lightspeed Venture Partners and O’Shaughnessy Ventures LLC. In a statement, Stability AI said that it will use the funding to accelerate the development of open-source AI models for image, language, audio, video, 3D and more, for consumer and enterprise use cases globally.

Stable diffusion is truly ‘open’

Much like most of its counterparts, Stable Diffusion aims to enable billions of people to instantly create stunning art. The model itself is based on the work of the CompVis and Runway teams in their widely used latent diffusion model, as well as insights from Stability AI’s lead generative AI developer Katherine Crowson’s conditional diffusion models, Dall-E 2 by OpenAI, Imagen by Google Brain, and many others.

The core dataset was trained on LAION-Aesthetics, a subset of LAION-5B, which was created using a new CLIP-based model that filtered LAION-5B based on how “beautiful” an image was, based on ratings from Stable Diffusion’s alpha testers. On consumer GPUs, Stable Diffusion uses less than 10 GB of VRAM to generate images with 512 x 512 pixels in a matter of seconds. This enables researchers and, eventually, the general public, to run the program under a variety of conditions, democratizing image generation.

The model was trained on Stability AI’s 4,000 A100 Ezra-1 AI ultracluster. The company has been testing the model at scale with more than 10,000 beta testers creating 1.7 million images a day.

The emphasis on open source distinguishes Stable Diffusion from other AI art generators. Stability AI has made public all of the details of its AI model, including the model’s weights, which anyone can access and use. Stable Diffusion, unlike DALL-E or Midjourney, has no filters or limitations on what it can generate, including violent, pornographic, racist or otherwise harmful content.

“The open way that Stable Diffusion’s image generation model was released — allowing users to run it on their own machines, not just via API — has made it a landmark event for AI,” said Andrew Ng, Ph.D., a globally recognized leader in AI. He is founder and CEO of DeepLearning AI, and founder and CEO of Landing AI.

Since launching, Stable Diffusion has been downloaded and licensed by more than 200,000 developers globally.

Turning imagination into reality with DreamStudio

Stability AI also offers a consumer-facing product, DreamStudio, which the company describes as “a new suite of generative media tools engineered to grant everyone the power of limitless imagination and the effortless ease of visual expression through a combination of natural language processing and revolutionary input controls for accelerated creativity.” The product currently has a million registered users from more than 50 countries who have collectively created more than 170 million images.

While the Stable Diffusion model has been made open source by Stability AI, the DreamStudio website is a service designed to enable anyone to access such creative tools without the need for software installation, coding knowledge, or a heavy-duty local GPU — but it does come with a cost. All new users will get a one-time bonus of 200 free DreamStudio credits. At default settings, users will be charged one credit per image. Depending on the image resolution and step count users choose (size, Cfg scale, seed, steps, and image count), the cost-per-image at non-default settings can go as low as 0.2 credits per image or as high as 28.2 credits per image. Once the free credits run out, users will need to buy more. Generated images are always saved in history, and you can integrate them with your existing applications using the API.

The fuzzy future

While Stability AI’s business strategy still remains fuzzy, in a recent interview with ML enthusiast and YouTuber Yannic Kilcher, Mostaque said that he is already in talks with “governments and large organizations” to offer Stable Diffusion’s tech. “We’ve negotiated a large number of deals, so we’ll be profitable at the door, compared to large corporations that lose most of their money,” he added.

“At Coatue, we believe that open-source AI technologies have the power to unlock human creativity and achieve a broader good,” explained Sri Viswanath, general partner at Coatue. “Stability AI is a big idea that dreams beyond the immediate applications of AI. We are excited to be part of Stability AI’s journey, and we look forward to seeing what the world creates with Stability AI’s technology.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Register here.

We’re putting another year of exciting developments in artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning behind us – one filled with remarkable progress, controversies and, of course, disputes. As we wrap up 2022 and prepare to embrace what 2023 has in store, here are some of the most notable overarching trends that marked this year in deep learning.

1. Scale continues to be an important factor

One theme that has remained constant in deep learning over the past few years is the drive to create bigger neural networks. The availability of computer resources makes scaling neural networks possible, as well as specialized AI hardware, large datasets, and the development of scale-friendly architectures like the transformer model.

For the moment, companies are obtaining better results by scaling neural networks to larger sizes. In the past year, DeepMind announced Gopher, a 280-billion parameter large language model (LLM); Google announced Pathways Language Model (PaLM), with 540 billion parameters, and Generalist Language Model (GLaM), with up to 1.2 trillion parameters; and Microsoft and Nvidia released the Megatron-Turing NLG, a 530-billion-parameter LLM.

One of the interesting aspects of scale is emergent abilities, where larger models succeed at accomplishing tasks that were impossible with smaller ones. This phenomenon has been especially intriguing in LLMs, where models show promising results on a wider range of tasks and benchmarks as they grow in size.

It is worth noting, however, that some of deep learning’s fundamental problems remain unsolved, even in the largest models (more on this in a bit).

2. Unsupervised learning continues to deliver

Many successful deep learning applications require humans to label training examples, also known as supervised learning. But most data available on the internet does not come with the clean labels needed for supervised learning. And data annotation is expensive and slow, creating bottlenecks. This is why researchers have long sought advances in unsupervised learning, where deep learning models are trained without the need for human-annotated data.

There has been tremendous progress in this field, in recent years, especially in LLMs, which are mostly trained on large sets of raw data gathered from around the internet. While LLMs continued to make progress in 2022, we also saw other trends in unsupervised learning techniques gaining traction.

For example, there were phenomenal advances in text-to-image models this year. Models like OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, Google’s Imagen, and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion have displayed the power of unsupervised learning. Unlike older text-to-image models, which required well-annotated pairs of images and descriptions, these models use large datasets of loosely captioned images that already exist on the internet. The sheer size of their training datasets (which is only possible because there’s no need for manual labeling) and variability of the captioning schemes enables these models to find all kinds of intricate patterns between textual and visual information. As a result, they are much more flexible in generating images for various descriptions.

3. Multimodality takes big strides

Text-to-image generators have another interesting characteristic: they combine multiple data types in a single model. Being able to process multiple modalities enables deep learning models to take on much more complicated tasks.

Multimodality is very important to the kind of intelligence found in humans and animals. For instance, when you see a tree and hear the rustling of the wind in its branches, your mind can quickly associate them together. Likewise, when you see the word “tree,” you can quickly conjure the image of a tree, remember the smell of pine after a rainfall, or recall other experiences you’ve previously had.

Evidently, multimodality has played an important role in making deep learning systems more flexible. This was perhaps best displayed by DeepMind’s Gato, a deep learning model trained on a variety of data types, including images, text and proprioception data. Gato showed decent performance in multiple tasks, including image captioning, interactive dialogues, controlling a robotic arm and playing games. This is in contrast to classic deep learning models, which are designed to perform a single task.

Some researchers have taken the notion as far as proposing that a system like Gato is all we need to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). While many scientists disagree with this opinion, what is for sure is that multimodality has brought important achievements for deep learning.

4. Fundamental deep learning problems remain

Despite the impressive achievements of deep learning, some of the field’s problems remain unsolved. Among them are causality, compositionality, common sense, reasoning, planning, intuitive physics, and abstraction and analogy-making.

These are some of the mysteries of intelligence that are still being studied by scientists in different fields. Pure scale- and data-based deep learning approaches have helped make incremental progress on some of these problems while failing to provide a definitive solution.

For example, larger LLMs can maintain coherence and consistency over longer stretches of text. But they fail on tasks that require meticulous step-by-step reasoning and planning.

Likewise, text-to-image generators create stunning graphics but make basic mistakes when asked to draw images that require compositionality or have complex descriptions.

These challenges are being discussed and explored by different scientists, including some of the pioneers of deep learning. Prominent among them is Yann LeCun, the Turing Award–winning inventor of convolutional neural networks (CNN), who recently wrote a long essay on the limits of LLMs that learn from text alone. LeCun is doing research on a deep learning architecture that learns world models and can tackle some of the challenges that the field currently suffers from.

Deep learning has come a long way. But the more progress we make, the more we become aware of the challenges of creating truly intelligent systems. Next year will surely be just as exciting as this one.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat
30,AI could guide doctors to protect teen privacy,https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/teen_privacy_doctors_1600.jpg,19/10/2022,Artificial intelligence could help doctors protect a teenager's privacy while also giving the parents info they need.,https://www.futurity.org/teen-privacy-pediatricians-doctors-ai-2816792-2/,"Share this

Natural language processing could help pediatricians draw the fine line between a teen’s right to privacy and a parent’s right to know.

Two laws, one new, the other on the books since the 1980s, have complicated the lives of pediatricians. The federal government’s 21st Century Cures Act, among its many mandates, requires physicians nationwide make available to patients their complete electronic medical records. With the click of a mouse, all personal health information, test results, prescribed medications, and clinical notes must be accessible digitally for patient review.

Meanwhile, a confidentiality law in California simultaneously demands that pediatricians protect the privacy of their adolescent patients. That is, by law they must not divulge to parents certain details about their dependent child’s mental health, sexual history, drug use, and other confidential information.

“Most states in the country have some form of confidentiality laws, so there is a conflict between the full disclosure in the federal law and the privacy protections of the state laws,” says Keith Morse, a pediatrician who leads the Translational Data Science at Packard (TDaP) program. TDaP is specifically charged with exploring the rapidly emerging applications of machine learning to clinical care at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital.

What qualifies as confidential for a given patient is left up to the doctor’s interpretation and therein lies a problem. Doctors often disagree about such matters and now those subtle distinctions are weighted not only with medical consequence but with legal consequence, as well.

Into that maw have leapt Morse and a team of medical doctors, bioinformatics experts, and computer scientists from Stanford University who have tapped artificial intelligence to help pediatricians flag potentially confidential information in their clinical notes for closer review to ensure compliance with both laws. The authors introduced their algorithm in a peer-reviewed paper that has been submitted for publication, and it is already in use by pediatricians in the Stanford Children’s Health community.

The fundamental issue is trust.

“We want the patients, in this case teens, to feel that they can be fully open and honest with their doctors without worrying that their parents might learn personal details they would rather their parents not know,” Morse says. “But the parents have an interest in their child’s medical history, too.”

The algorithm does not redact confidential information from the medical record, but rather uses natural language processing to compare clinical note content against a database to “flag” phrases, sentences, and paragraphs that it thinks might be at risk of violating confidentiality laws. The algorithm then calculates a “risk score” to help physicians make their confidentiality determinations, improve compliance with the applicable laws, and expedite the manual review process.

“It’s a very fine needle we have to thread here,” adds Naveed Rabbani, an engineer turned pediatrician at Stanford Medicine and lead author of the study. “Artificial intelligence can help make that key determination between what is confidential and what is necessary to provide the patient the very best medical care we can offer.”

Doctors’ notes and teen privacy

To build their algorithm and dataset, the researchers enlisted a team of five physicians to evaluate a randomly selected trove of clinical notes from 1,200 adolescent patients ages 12 through 17. The physicians who had been specifically trained in the nuances of California’s adolescent confidentiality laws annotated the dataset based on that knowledge. In their analysis the researchers estimate that slightly more than 20% of clinical notes for adolescents contain confidential information, indicating the issue is worthy of concern.

The 1,200 records were disbursed evenly among the five doctors, with some overlap. Not all doctors agree on what constitutes “confidential” information, and the overlap helped the AI research team identify the interpretive gray areas.

The algorithm then evaluated new, never-before-seen clinical notes for potential concerns, where it calculated the risk score and flagged content for the doctor’s review.

“The biggest surprise to me in this research was just how hard it is to determine confidentiality,” Rabbani says. “The best care and patient disclosure are sometimes contradictory goals. That’s where AI really helps.”

Real-time analysis

The researchers anticipate that such an algorithm, if it was to achieve wider use, would work in real time as the doctor is entering notes—flagging content for immediate categorization as the notes are being transcribed.

With potential conflicts flagged and graded by confidentiality risk, the physician can quickly make an informed determination and either leave the note open to both parent and child or isolate confidential information in special note type that appears only when the minor patient reviews the electronic health record.

At this point however, the resulting algorithm is a proof-of-concept prototype that demonstrates both AI’s skill at discerning nuances in written language and its ability to expedite the physician’s annotation process while helping to abide by legal confidentiality requirements.

One impediment to wider use is that the dataset was based on clinical notes culled from the Stanford medical community. To be reliable universally, the researchers anticipate that future versions would need to be trained on notes from many other institutions, as note-taking style varies hospital to hospital as do confidentiality laws state to state.

On the upside, they believe that their results indicate their AI methods might be transferrable to other areas of medicine, notably reproductive health in light of the recent ruling overturning abortion protections, but also adult histories of HIV infection, sickle cell anemia, and substance use, among others.

31,5 Ways Businesses Benefit From Having a Tech-Savvy CEO,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1665693007-GettyImages-981599652.jpg,18/10/2022,"In today's world, a tech-savvy CEO significantly gives the company an upper hand in the market. Here's how.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-ways-businesses-benefit-from-having-a-tech-savvy-ceo/436173,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

In the digital age, you are either moving along with technology or being left behind by an entire industry. As everything is taking on a technological advancement approach, the best decision a board of directors can make for a company is to ensure the leadership is -savvy, or at the very least, can grasp these concepts quickly. The essence of a cutting-edge idea or innovation is its ability to solve existing problems that present a challenge for a large population. However, today, whatever innovative and people-conscious a company attempts to be, the cream of the crop is set apart based on its technical components.

Looking at it from the other end, a CEO whose only focus is on technology and coding cannot successfully run a business because while it has fresh technical concepts, it lacks other equally vital aspects of running a business. For instance, without marketing, well-coordinated and balanced finance and customer service, even with the best tech, a company will innovate only to maximize storage space. The bottom line is that a CEO needs to be well-versed in many different factions of business. However, in today's world, a tech-savvy CEO significantly gives the company an upper hand in the market.

Since we have already established that technical know-how is a crucial component for visionary companies, our natural next step is to analyze any benefits a company enjoys by having a tech-savvy CEO:

1. Bridging generational gaps

A lack of the foundational skills that younger employees have learned might lead to a significant gap between management and staff, which could be problematic for the CEO and the direction of the business. According to Jay Leonard of Business 2 Community, millennials are stepping into employment with high expectations of how technology should be utilized. They can incorporate consumer app stores in their work to compensate for where older technology leaves a gap. With a tech-savvy CEO, the importance of such advancement is not lost. Communicating and understanding each other is more accessible when these tools are readily available.

2. Understanding what matters and what doesn't

Technology continues to evolve every day. This can present a challenge for a CEO who is not tech-savvy. How? First, they will struggle to sift through what is available and necessary for their business. You cannot use everything available, and knowing what you require might be difficult when you don't understand what each has to offer or what your company needs.

Secondly, the employment front might also suffer. You will need to know how to separate academics from fundamental skills and technical know-how. If the CEO's technical skills are somewhat lacking, they will need an effective team in the tech department. This aspect of your business will be left for co-workers and employees to run. Essentially, even with their advice, it takes away the CEO's decision-making capacity. While there is no problem relying on employees, the company's future needs a CEO who knows the basics and can make unbiased decisions.

3. Incorporating tech-based solutions

Technology can improve whatever it is — from your sales statistics to efficiency and productivity. When the phenomenon was examined, researchers discovered that many companies grow incredibly after incorporating tech-based solutions into their businesses. The tools required for this step are relatively accessible, but before you get to them, you will need a CEO with tech knowledge to give directives and choose to incorporate them into the organization. If a CEO lacks the expertise, the company suffers as well. For instance, accomplishing the company's KPI will become more expensive if the CEO makes the wrong decision about which technical components to implement.

4. Creating sustainability

In this case, sustainability refers to a company that can stand the test of time and remains relevant for many years. Look at a company like Microsoft, which started in the 20th century, and how it managed to stay pertinent as one of the most successful software companies today. Almost every year, Microsoft unveils new technology. They have expanded their reach from software to include hardware, and while exploring their limits, they have kept up with developments in the tech world to maintain relevance. When cloud storage came about, OneDrive, Microsoft's cloud storage, was brought into play.

The most sustainable companies that will continue to dominate the industry have technologically advanced CEOs. As times change and technology develops, they can make decisions for the business to usher it into the new era.

5. Gaining a competitive advantage through the use of artificial intelligence

Machine learning algorithms will bear the immense task of sorting through terabytes of information every minute. Massive amounts of data collection will be meaningless without artificial intelligence-powered computational models. The CEO can therefore redirect the human resources to deal with more pressing and urgent issues.

Ilya Lipovich, Forbes Councils Member, believes that with this cutting-edge technology, firms can develop a long-lasting competitive edge that their rivals are unaware of. This feat alone could give a business a long-term strategic advantage that gives it a leg up over competitors.

While assuming that tech savviness is the only determinant for a good company CEO, it is also presumptuous and reductive since the many factions of the company also need governance and direction. At the same time, the digital age makes technological know-how an essential skill for the development, sustainability and rational decision-making that give a company its competitive edge.",artificial intelligence,entrepreneur

Questions like “can this moldy cheese cure disease” or “can this rock perform math if we give it some electricity.” Among the more recent of this list is the question of whether or not the video game Factorio, in which the player constructs an elaborate factory, can be used as the basis for other academic work. As [Kenneth Reid] discusses in this talk, it most certainly can.

If you haven’t played the game, it’s a sort of real-time strategy (RTS) game where the player gathers materials to construct a factory while defending it from enemies. On the surface it might seem similar to Age of Empires or Starcraft, but its complexity is taken to extremes not found in other RTS games. The complexity hides nuance, and [Kenneth] points out that it’s an excellent simulator to study real-world problems such as vehicle routing problems, decision making, artificial intelligence, bin packing problems, and production planning, among a whole slew of other interesting areas of potential research.

[Kenneth] and his partners on this project also developed some software tools with interacting with a Factorio game without having to actually play it directly. The game includes an API which the team used to develop tools so that other researchers can use it as a basis for simulations and studies. There was a research paper published as well for more in-depth reading on the topic. We shouldn’t be too surprised that a game can be used in incredibly productive ways like this, either. Here’s another example of a toy being used to train engineers working in industrial automation.",artificial intelligence,hackaday
33,AI is changing scientists’ understanding of language learning,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/parent-child-760x380.jpg,19/10/2022,And it is also raising questions about innate grammar.,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/ai-is-changing-scientists-understanding-of-language-learning/,"Unlike the carefully scripted dialogue found in most books and movies, the language of everyday interaction tends to be messy and incomplete, full of false starts, interruptions, and people talking over each other. From casual conversations between friends, to bickering between siblings, to formal discussions in a boardroom, authentic conversation is chaotic. It seems miraculous that anyone can learn language at all given the haphazard nature of the linguistic experience.

For this reason, many language scientists—including Noam Chomsky, a founder of modern linguistics—believe that language learners require a kind of glue to rein in the unruly nature of everyday language. And that glue is grammar: a system of rules for generating grammatical sentences.

Children must have a grammar template wired into their brains to help them overcome the limitations of their language experience—or so the thinking goes.

This template, for example, might contain a “super-rule” that dictates how new pieces are added to existing phrases. Children then only need to learn whether their native language is one, like English, where the verb goes before the object (as in “I eat sushi”), or one like Japanese, where the verb goes after the object (in Japanese, the same sentence is structured as “I sushi eat”).

But new insights into language learning are coming from an unlikely source: artificial intelligence. A new breed of large AI language models can write newspaper articles, poetry, and computer code and answer questions truthfully after being exposed to vast amounts of language input. And even more astonishingly, they all do it without the help of grammar.

Grammatical language without a grammar

Even if their choice of words is sometimes strange, nonsensical, or contains racist, sexist, and other harmful biases, one thing is very clear: The overwhelming majority of the output of these AI language models is grammatically correct. And yet, there are no grammar templates or rules hardwired into them—they rely on linguistic experience alone, messy as it may be.

GPT-3, arguably the most well-known of these models, is a gigantic deep-learning neural network with 175 billion parameters. It was trained to predict the next word in a sentence given what came before across hundreds of billions of words from the Internet, books, and Wikipedia. When it made a wrong prediction, its parameters were adjusted using an automatic learning algorithm.

Remarkably, GPT-3 can generate believable text reacting to prompts such as “A summary of the last Fast and Furious movie is…” or “Write a poem in the style of Emily Dickinson.” Moreover, GPT-3 can respond to SAT-level analogies, reading comprehension questions, and even solve simple arithmetic problems—all from learning how to predict the next word.

Comparing AI models and human brains

The similarity with human language doesn’t stop here, however. Research published in Nature Neuroscience demonstrated that these artificial deep-learning networks seem to use the same computational principles as the human brain. The research group, led by neuroscientist Uri Hasson, first compared how well GPT-2—a “little brother” of GPT-3—and humans could predict the next word in a story taken from the podcast “This American Life”: People and the AI predicted the exact same word nearly 50 percent of the time.

The researchers recorded volunteers’ brain activity while listening to the story. The best explanation for the patterns of activation they observed was that people’s brains—like GPT-2—were not just using the preceding one or two words when making predictions but relied on the accumulated context of up to 100 previous words. Altogether, the authors conclude: “Our finding of spontaneous predictive neural signals as participants listen to natural speech suggests that active prediction may underlie humans’ lifelong language learning.”

A possible concern is that these new AI language models are fed a lot of input: GPT-3 was trained on linguistic experience equivalent to 20,000 human years. But a preliminary study that has not yet been peer-reviewed found that GPT-2 can still model human next-word predictions and brain activations even when trained on just 100 million words. That’s well within the amount of linguistic input that an average child might hear during the first 10 years of life.

We are not suggesting that GPT-3 or GPT-2 learn language exactly like children do. Indeed, these AI models do not appear to comprehend much, if anything, of what they are saying, whereas understanding is fundamental to human language use. Still, what these models prove is that a learner—albeit a silicon one—can learn language well enough from mere exposure to produce perfectly good grammatical sentences and do so in a way that resembles human brain processing.

Rethinking language learning

For years, many linguists have believed that learning language is impossible without a built-in grammar template. The new AI models prove otherwise. They demonstrate that the ability to produce grammatical language can be learned from linguistic experience alone. Likewise, we suggest that children do not need an innate grammar to learn language.

“Children should be seen, not heard” goes the old saying, but the latest AI language models suggest that nothing could be further from the truth. Instead, children need to be engaged in the back-and-forth of conversation as much as possible to help them develop their language skills. Linguistic experience—not grammar—is key to becoming a competent language user.

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/10/20/ai-photo-restoration-brings-victorian-portraits-to-life/,"A fascinating video made by Mystery Scoop has brought to life old Victorian-era portraits by using the latest technology in artificial intelligence (AI).

The video scrolls through portraits taken in the 19th century and the photos come to life with color and movement as they go.

“After receiving such good feedback on two of our earlier videos on Victorian portraits, we wanted to bring you something even more unique today,” says the voiceover.

“We’ve gathered a collection of 19th-century portraits that appear to come to life as they glide across your screen.”

The portraits were given a “quick restoration, colorization, and some facial motion.” Mystery Scoop says they used some of the latest tools in AI technology. “It was a labor of love to create,” they add.

The photos are mainly daguerreotypes and tintypes, techniques used during the early photography era that produced remarkably high-quality, detailed images.

Lorenzo Foli and Olga Shirnina are behind the YouTube channel Mystery Scoop. They are both photo restorers and colorizers, posting fascinating images on their respective Instagram channels.

The World’s First Selfie

One of the photos that the team brought to life was the first-ever selfie taken by photography pioneer Robert Cornelius in 1839, just a few months after the invention of the daguerreotype.

Cornelius learned about the new medium while working at his father’s lamp shop, where he specialized in silver plating, among other tasks. A client hired him to produce a silver plate for a daguerreotype, and Cornelius became curious about the process.

He worked on experiments to improve the process, and one of the first fruits of his research was his self-portrait, taken outside to ensure adequate light and with a “camera” that basically consisted of a box outfitted with a lens from an opera glasses.

The image helped disprove Daguerre critics who said the process was too cumbersome to ever work for portraits. And it encouraged Cornelius enough to open one of the first photographic studios in the U.S., which he ran for a couple of years before deciding the family business promised steadier income.

The daguerreotype now resides at the Library of Congress, complete with Cornelius’ scribbled note on the back describing it as “The first light picture ever taken.”

Vertigo Releasing/YouTube/CNET Screenshot Vivarium (2019) Vivarium is an interesting one. It might frustrate a lot of viewers with its surreal aspects, but it's still a compelling film. A young couple becomes trapped in a labyrinthine suburban neighborhood of identical houses. While trying to escape, they find themselves taking care of a mysterious baby.

Sunset Boulevard/Getty Images Robocop (1987) Haven't seen RoboCop yet? The '80s classic has been referenced in everything from Ready Player One to Community to Sailor Moon. It centers on a police officer who's brutally murdered, only to come back as a cyborg on a crime-stopping rampage.

Monsters (2010) This British sci-fi comes from Gareth Edwards, who went on to direct Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and 2014's Godzilla. His mastery of atmosphere, wonder and beauty is on show here, all on a shoestring budget. Monsters follows a couple attempting to cross an ""Infected Zone"" teeming with giant tentacled monsters.

Mr. Nobody (2009) Mr. Nobody is the kind of movie that nails the ending, making the entire journey well worth it. It helps to know that this story explores the consequences of choices and why you shouldn't worry about making the perfect one. By the end, it leaves you on a wonderfully thoughtful note to ponder.

Warner Bros/Screenshot by CNET A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) For a solid, well-made Steven Spielberg movie, check out Artificial Intelligence. Set in a futuristic society, A.I. Artificial Intelligence follows an android programmed with the ability to love. Intriguingly, the film was initially developed by Stanley Kubrick, before Spielberg took over. Check it out for the curio of the two directors' touches.

Magnolia Pictures Europa Report (2013) This little-known sci-fi thriller takes its science aspects seriously, using a found footage format to dial up the realism. Europa Report recounts the fictional story of a crew's mission to Europa, a moon of Jupiter.

Black Box follows a father who tries to piece his life back together after a car accident. He agrees to an experimental procedure that leads him to the darkest recesses of his mind.

Vertical Entertainment/YouTube/CNET Screenshot Archive (2020) For a well-made, thoughtful sci-fi that makes sure not to let its meditations overtake entertainment value, Archive is a great shout. The British directorial debut from Gavin Rothery stars Theo James as a scientist working on making an AI as human as possible. His reasons are hidden, personal and sure to put a spanner in the works. Drawing comparisons to Ex Machina, Archive is assured storytelling with an astute focus on character.

Oscilloscope Laboratories/YouTube/CNET Screenshot Coherence (2013) Coherence doesn't need an Avatar-size budget to craft a compelling story. The low-budget indie film follows friends at a dinner party who start noticing bizarre occurrences after a comet passes.

Alameda Entertainment/YouTube/CNET Screenshot Infinity Chamber (2016) Intriguing premise? Check. Low budget? Check. Twist in the end? Check. This indie sci-fi mystery from Travis Milloy solidifies its place in the Google Search quest for ""best indie sci-fi gems."" Infinity Chamber's complex story focuses on a man held in an automated detention facility. He must fight superior technology to escape, an immensely tricky feat.

Universal Pictures Firestarter (2022) The '80s adaptation of Stephen King's sci-fi horror didn't draw rave reviews, so this 2022 reboot from horror movie factory Blumhouse took another stab. The results? Not good. Firestarter scored even worse than the original, but it does offer the intrigue of seeing Zac Efron take the lead in a horror flick. He plays a father who attempts to keep his daughter -- who can use pyrokinesis -- out of the hands of a shadowy federal agency.

Tollywood Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes (2020) How cool and intriguing is that title? Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes is a low-budget time travel comedy from Japanese filmmaker Junta Yamaguchi. The wild premise: A café worker discovers his TV can show him what happens 2 minutes into the future. There's obviously a lot more to that and the results are as creative and trippy as you can expect under the constraints of indie filmmaking. A gem.

Paramount Love and Monsters (2020) Just watched Prey and looking for another sci-fi flick starring a heroic pup? Love and Monsters lives up to its name, centered on Joel (Dylan O'Brien), a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world where mutated monsters roam the Earth.

Catch this enjoyable monsterpocalypse adventure, which will leap out at you with a few surprises and hit all the right emotional beats.

Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images The Terminator (1984) Not much needs to be said about the first in the Terminator franchise. Apparently born of a fever dream, James Cameron's story gives us a cyborg assassin sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor, whose unborn son is destined to save mankind from the robot apocalypse.",artificial intelligence,cnet
36,Dune subreddit group bans AI-generated art for being ‘low effort’,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a39425c97c439fcebc7751ec530442bfaac9cedf/697_0_2958_1777/master/2958.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=55b465335d725cac0148679653fdbe38,16/10/2022,"Moderators of community devoted to sci-fi films and novels made decision after being flooded with automatically generated contentIn the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune, the “Butlerian Jihad” led to the destruction of “thinking machines” across the known univers…",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/16/dune-subreddit-group-bans-ai-generated-art-for-being-low-effort,"In the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune, the “Butlerian Jihad” led to the destruction of “thinking machines” across the known universe, and the birth of a civilisation that focused on enhancing human intellect.

In the online community on the subreddit of r/Dune, the birth of AI art has led to a similar, albeit smaller, war on technology.

There, users who number almost a quarter of a million fans of the novel series, as well as its two film adaptations, moved to ban AI-generated art this week, after a wave of automatically generated content flooded the boards.

The ban “applies to images created using services such as DALL-E, Midjourney, StarryAI, WOMBO Dream, and others,” the moderators wrote in a post announcing the decision. “Our team has been removing said content for a number of months on a post-by-post basis, but given its continued popularity across Reddit we felt that a public announcement was justified.

“We acknowledge that many of these pieces are neat to look at, and the technology sure is fascinating, but it does technically qualify as low-effort content – especially when compared to original, ‘human-made’ art, which we would like to prioritize going forward.”

In the Dune series, the destruction of thinking machines led to the rise of the “navigators”, humans specifically bred and raised to perform the complex calculations required for interstellar travel. In the r/Dune community, the ban has led to similar proposals. “We just need to do some freaky genetics that create an animal whose sole purpose and feature is to make Dune fan art,” one user proposed.

The growth of AI-generated art has caused disruption other communities as well. In August, a painting created by the AI tool Midjourney, titled Théâtre D’opéra Spatial, took first prize in the digital art category at the Colorado State Fair. In a post announcing the victory, Midjourney user Jason Allen said: “I have created hundreds of images using it, and after many weeks of fine tuning and curating my [generations], I chose my top 3 and had them printed on canvas after upscaling with Gigapixel AI … I set out to make a statement using Midjourney in a competitive manner and wow!”

In a follow-up interview with Vice Magazine, Allen defended his decision to enter without explicitly labelling the artwork as AI generated. “What if we looked at it from the other extreme, what if an artist made a wildly difficult and complicated series of restraints in order to create a piece, say, they made their art while hanging upside-down and being whipped while painting,” he said. “Should this artist’s work be evaluated differently than another artist that created the same piece ‘normally’?

Fortunately, the AI didn't predict a deadly apocalypse or a robot takeover.

1 AI has been making accurate predictions about itself Credit: Getty

Instead, researchers at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Germany asked the artificially intelligent software to predict how AI progressed.

They did this by feeding the AI information from academic papers dating all the way back to 1994.

A total of 143,000 papers were used in the experiment.

The AI was then asked to make predictions about how artificial intelligence has developed over the years based on the scientific studies it knew about it.

The software was almost 100 per cent right with its predictions, leading scientists to want to ask it more questions about the actual future.

Mario Krenn led the research along with colleagues from all over the world.

Their paper says the AI research ""indicates a great potential that can be unleashed.""

Instead of asking AI to predict the end of the world, the researchers hope to ask it questions about science that could aid future studies.

The paper states: ""A tool that could suggest new personalized research directions and ideas by taking insights from the scientific literature could significantly accelerate the progress of science.

""A field that might benefit from such an approach is artificial intelligence (AI) research.""

The hope is that AI will be able to aid human scientists in research in the future.

The researchers concluded: ""Ultimately, better predictions of new future research directions will be a crucial component of more advanced research suggestion tools.""",artificial intelligence,the-sun.com

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/10/20/adobe-can-use-ai-to-extend-photos-well-beyond-their-original-boundaries/,"Adobe has previewed a couple of examples of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools that make it possible to push a photo well beyond its original boundaries, both literally and from the perspective of its continued usability.

The Silicon Valley software company has been adding more features to its image editing platforms that are powered by AI for some time, but the company’s engineers have grander ideas for what is possible with the technology. Demonstrated during the annual “Sneaks” presentation at Adobe MAX, two ideas show how AI is able to make photos far more useful than they perhaps were ever intended to be.

The first is called “Project Beyond the Seen,” and it allows for the creation of immersive 360-degree visual experiences from a single small 2D image. While virtual reality (VR) and 360-degree content do exist, there are loads of photos that exist that weren’t captured in a format that is conducive to VR. Adobe Senior Engineer and Research Scientist Yannick Hold-Geoffroy presents a solution.

“Pushing the limits of immersive virtual reality, Project Beyond the Seen enables you to do just that, using Adobe’s AI to easily generate full 360-degree panoramas from a single image,” Adobe explains.

“Depth estimation methods allow users to extend a panoramic image, creating realistic and fully immersive 3D environments. Since AI is able to generate content behind, above, below, and to the sides of the image, users can easily and quickly add objects, including AI-generated reflections — and more.”

The video linked below is time-stamped to the Project Beyond the Seen’s presentation:

The other proposed technology is called “Project All of Me” by Qing Liu, a Research Engineer and Scientist at Adobe, which combines a few ideas that already exist in Adobe products but repackages them into a more approachable format.

“While cropping images down to smaller sizes can be easy, extending images for un-cropping to larger sizes can be challenging — or even seem downright impossible,” Adobe explains.

“With Project All of Me, anyone — a fashion designer who needs to update their website models with new clothing designs or a student hoping to create a school event flyer — can create new content and larger images with just a few clicks. This smart portrait photo editor leverages AI to generate un-cropped components of photos and edit out unwanted distractions — it can even provide recommendations and modify the photo subject’s apparel.”

The video linked below is time-stamped to the Project All of Me presentation:

Sneaks let Adobe present its most promising new ideas to the public and field input on whether they are features that might actually be useful if deployed to consumer-facing software. Sometimes this happens quickly, while other times the software never sees the light of day. These two projects join Project Clever Composites in this software limbo where users might eventually get to try them out… or they might not.",artificial intelligence,petapixel

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/10/17/companies-are-using-photos-of-fake-staff-who-dont-exist/,"Companies are using photos of fake staff that are generated by artificial intelligence (AI) programs. The pictures are published under the “About Us” section of a company’s website to give a false impression of a larger workforce.

The shocking revelations are a result of an investigation by journalist Evan Ratliff for Business Insider who found companies are using AI-image generators to create a staff to look more impressive online.

Ratliff spoke to a company that confirmed it had been using photos of people that don’t exist on its website, passing them off as staff.

“It conveys the right message that it’s a big company working with professionals,” says Lukas, who runs an Austrian test-prep company called takeIELTS.

Ratliff says that he noticed several anomalies among the “employees.” One AI-generated person was only wearing one earring, while another had one side of his face shaved closer than the other.

The journalist also notes that some companies want to “project a level of diversity,” as well as pretend that the company has more staff than they really do.

Ratliff, who appears on the Wondery Podcast, says that when he checked in on takeIELTS months later, Lukas had removed all the fake images and changed the company’s name.

More Fake Staff

AI-image generation relies upon neural network programs that are fed by millions of real-life photos used to inform the software, such as DALL-E, which the user can control via text prompts.

“They aren’t meant to impersonate anyone, or steal an identity. They’re meant to impersonate everyone, to mimic the fundamentals of human appearance with increasing fidelity,” Ratliff writes.

The latest video for the track ""Quest for Nothing"" may look reminiscent of the band's distinctive art, done by drummer Away (aka Michel Langevin), but it isn't. The video was created by the band's webmaster, Luc Leclerc, using AI art.

Michel Langevin writes:

""When AI art started appearing online a few months ago, my jaw dropped to the floor. When Luc Leclerc, webmaster for Voïvod, showed me what he could do with AI animation, my jaw dropped to the basement! His video perfectly captures the dystopian side of the music and lyrics for ""Quest For Nothing."" Hold on tight to your seat and enjoy!""

The video also perfectly captures the look and feel of Away's art and the sci-fi mythology that underlies much of the band's music. Away's illustrations are such an inextricable part of the band's artistic statement, it's almost as if the art itself is a bandmember. One amazing feature of this Away-inspired, AI-based video is that every frame is a different piece of art. Go through and pause it to reveal more cool and arresting bio-mech imagery.



Now, thanks to their artificial intelligence assistants, the Waster, Korgull, and the irradiated minions of planet Morgoth have finally hacked their way into the electronic nervous systems of our world. Voïvod help us all!



Voïvod also has a new EP, Ultraman, coming out on Nov. 4. It is a tribute to the theme music for the ""Ultraman"" Japanese TV series.

The post Technology to recycle flat screen TVs appeared first on Springwise.",https://www.springwise.com/innovation/computing-tech/new-technology-to-recycle-flat-screen-tvs/,"Spotted: As society increasingly relies on electronic devices, there is a growing need for more efficient and safer methods of recycling outdated or broken electronics. Flat panel displays (FPDs) are found in many common devices such as televisions and computer monitors. When these devices reach the end of their life cycle, they often contain valuable commodities that can be recycled and reused. However, recovering these materials is a complex and dangerous process that requires specialised equipment and trained personnel.

Now, eLoop, a leading provider of electronics recycling services, has developed the first fully automated system for safely recovering commodities from FPDs. A crucial element of the FPD PRO Technology is artificial intelligence (AI). This identifies rare earth metals and other precious materials that can then be removed from discarded devices. The technology is faster, safer, and more efficient than traditional methods, making it an important innovation in the field of electronic waste recycling.

The automated process is also more environmentally friendly than previous methods, cleanly recovering components that can be reused in the circular economy, keeping them out of landfills. In addition, eLoop’s methodology reduces the costs of recycling.

eLoop estimates that its new process will save 7,900 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year when it reaches full production. The company hopes this will help the state of Pennsylvania, where it is headquartered, reach its net zero goals.

As companies look for ways to support a circular economy, Springwise is seeing a rise in methods for recycling all sorts of material – from disposable chopsticks turned into furniture and homeware to a new type of turbine blade made of a composite material that can be recycled and reused.

Every year, we get a new map of the most popular Halloween candy in each state. But fictional candy is even more fun. Janelle Shane of AI Weirdness gave a prompt for each state to an algorithm, such as ""Product photo of the most popular halloween candy in Alabama"" and snagged a picture of what machine learning has learned.



Shane soon found out that Halloween candy always seemed to mean some form of candy corn. So she changed some of the prompts to mention ""candy bar"" and in some she made the state more prominent. That made some states (Tennessee and Wyoming stand out) seem to generate their own individual candy. In fact, it appears that all states did, since no candy was the most popular in more than one state.



Otherwise, we can assume that the algorithm learned that candy titles are usually random words or nonsense words. Which makes for some funny, if unappetizing, candy. Just like in the real world. Check out all the Halloween candies for 50 states and some territories at AI Weirdness. It's a bonus post attached to a previous post about Halloween candy, in which the generated candies are more familiar clones of existing sweets. -via Nag on the Lake",artificial intelligence,neatorama.com

""Sound is life in the ocean. If we pollute this channel of communication … we are condemning the ocean to irreversible change."" — French bioacoustics expert Michel André

In the documentary The Year Earth Changed, directed by Tom Beard, David Attenborough narrates a joyous and hopeful film about what happened when people changed their social habits as a result of COVID-19, and animals were able to have unfettered access to their habitats. You can check out the trailer here.

""From hearing birdsong in deserted cities and seeing whales in Glacier Bay, to meeting capybara in suburbs across South America, people worldwide have had the chance to engage with nature like never before. In this documentary special, viewers will witness how the smallest changes in human behavior—reducing cruise ship traffic, closing beaches a few days a year, identifying more harmonious ways for humans and wildlife to coexist—can have a profound impact on nature.""

Particularly for whales and other marine animals that navigate their worlds using sonar, the increased noise pollution from commercial ships, explosions due to gas exploration, and military sonar traffic have seriously limited their capacity to communicate with each other. This has impacted migration patterns, species regeneration, and ocean ecologies, as well as causing permanent hearing damage. This clip for The Year Earth Changed focuses on the stress that humpback whales have been experiencing.

The whales in Glacier Bay, AK, are also familiar with the coastline of Chile, which runs along the western edge of South America. The Gulf of Coronado is a 50-kilometer area between Chiloé Island and the mainland that attracts nine different species of whales. This is the sight of this experiment with a new technology.

New technology developed as part of the Blue Boat Initiative , a research project organized by the MERI Foundation in Chile, may help reduce the negative impacts on marine life and ecologies.

""Technology that uses acoustics to detect the presence of whales in shipping lanes could help to avert these collisions. André and his team at the Laboratory of Applied Bioacoustics in Barcelona have developed software called Listen to the Deep Ocean Environment (LIDO), which monitors acoustic sources in real-time and uses artificial intelligence to identify them.

In October, a two-meter-long buoy equipped with this technology and other sensors will be dropped into the Gulf of Corcovado, off the coast of Chile, an area busy with both whales and ships. Using LIDO, it will be able to detect whales within at least a 10-kilometer radius and automatically send an alert to Chile's navy, which will, in turn send a message to nearby vessels, encouraging them to change course or reduce their speed. Ship engines make less noise at lower speeds, which makes it easier for whales to home in on their location.""

French bioacoustics expert Michel André: ""We (humans) ignored this acoustic dimension. We contaminated the ocean with sound, without even having the first idea that this could have damaged it.""

REUTERS/Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy















LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Since President Vladimir Putin shifted tactics last week to mount air strikes on infrastructure targets across Ukraine, Moscow has ramped up its use of two main weapons: long-range cruise missiles and so-called ""suicide drones"".

Both are types of aircraft that fly to a target and explode when they get there, but they pose different threats.

Missiles, each costing hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, fly fast, are hard to shoot down and carry a huge explosive payload. But for now the bigger threat may come from the drones - small, slow, cheap and easy to shoot down, but so plentiful that they come in swarms.

Here are some of the differences.

MISSILES

Russia may have used munitions worth hundreds of millions of dollars in a single day on Oct. 10 when Putin signalled his new tactic with the biggest air strikes since the start of the war, firing more than 80 cruise missiles at targets across Ukraine.

Russia's Kalibr missiles are believed to be able to fly up to 2,000 km, descend on their targets at several times the speed of sound, and carry warheads that weigh more than 400 kg, potentially including nuclear weapons.

They are designed to destroy well-protected, high value military targets such as enemy warships or command centres. Shooting them down requires sophisticated air defences, which are best suited to defending specific, important targets rather than protecting a wide area.

Kyiv claims to have shot down more than half of the missiles fired by Russia in the past weeks. But in the initial huge volley on Oct. 10, Russia killed at least 19 people and knocked out power supplies across swathes of Ukraine.

Though Western analysts do not know exactly how many missiles Moscow still has left, its supply is limited, making continued strikes on such a large scale unsustainable.

Western countries have promised additional advanced missile defence systems, such as the U.S. NASAMS system, due to be delivered in coming months and which Washington says it is now expediting. Germany sent the first of four IRIS-T air defence systems to Ukraine last week.

DRONES

Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, can be used for surveillance or as a platform to fire munitions at the ground. But the simplest way to use a drone as a weapon is to fly it straight at a target and blow it up.

So-called ""kamikaze drones"", such as Iran's Shahed, can individually cost as little as a small car. Russia has already used hundreds of them against Ukraine in just the past few weeks, and is believed to have acquired as many as 2,000 from Iran.

Each drone flies slowly enough to be shot out of the sky with a well-aimed rifle, and carries only a small explosive payload equivalent to an artillery shell. But they can travel hundreds of kilometers.

Kyiv claims to have shot down the vast majority of them - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday Ukraine had shot down as many as 233 Shahed drones over the past month.

But because of their low cost, they can be sent in swarms, making it difficult to prevent one or two from getting through, killing civilians in residential buildings or damaging scattered targets such as electricity sub-stations.

The advanced air defences used to protect high-value targets from missiles are not ideally suited to stopping cheap drones: an entire swarm of drones can cost less than a surface-to-air missile used to take out just one of them.

Instead, specialised anti-drone defensive systems use sensors that can ""hear"" them coming and shoot them down from the ground, with artificial intelligence software to help detect and track them.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said this week that the Western alliance was sending anti-drone defences to Ukraine in coming days, though he did not give details.

When Emily replies that she simply put pen to paper, Charlotte is unassuaged, insisting that “there is something…”. Only later, when the literary torch is passed on and she can make peace with her own ghosts, does Charlotte start to realise what that “something” is…

Punctuated with fades-to-black that accentuate its fairytale fever-dream quality, Emily flashes back to the days when the young Brontë sisters delighted in the stories they told each other. While Charlotte is set to be a teacher, Emily (known in the village as “the strange one”) romps across moorland, caressing trees and moss, rolling and falling in green with her beloved Byronic brother Branwell (Fionn Whitehead). Her widowed father (Adrian Dunbar) preaches judgment from the pulpit, but new curate William Weightman (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) talks wistfully about communing with God while walking in the rain, to the eye-rolling delight of his congregation.

Emily and Branwell peer in through windows in the dead of night, fleshly precursors of Cathy and Heathcliff

Popular legend has it that the real-life Weightman was romantically involved with youngest sister Anne Brontë, but British-Australian actor turned writer-director Frances O’Connor’s thrillingly confident feature debut imagines him being torn between the attraction and repulsion that Emily inspires. Emily feels the sharp cut of that dual-edged sword too, although initially she appears more smitten with her brother, who lands and then squanders a place at the Royal College of Art and has the words “Freedom of Thought” scrawled on his forearm. Drink and opium will lead Branwell off the rails, and the film’s subdued palette turns to lush, oversaturated hues when Emily first shares his pupil-dilating vices in a grassy paradise. Later, they will peer in through windows in the dead of night, fleshly precursors of Cathy and Heathcliff.

These outdoor scenes, filmed with sensuous, hand-held grit by Nanu Segal, who shot Hope Dickson Leach’s The Levelling, recall the passionate landscapes of Francis Lee’s awards-winner God’s Own Country. Meanwhile, the sonic juxtapositions of inner and outer worlds (plaudits to sound designer Niv Adiri) put me in mind of William Oldroyd’s north-east England psychodrama Lady Macbeth, the film that made a star of Florence Pugh.

More unexpected is the shadow that Kaneto Shindô’s Japanese chiller Onibaba casts over a startling scene in which a mask turns a parlour game into a ghostly seance. With remarkable elan, O’Connor conjures a spine-tingling vision of an unquiet maternal spirit who seems to sweep in with the wind to possess her daughter. Is Emily really speaking with the voice of Mother (Nature), or are we all simply caught in the overwhelming power of her imagination?

Having starred in Patricia Rozema’s revisionist screen adaptation of Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park, and worked emotional wonders in Spielberg’s heartbreaking sci-fi epic AI: Artificial Intelligence (one of the most ambitious retellings of Carlo Collodi’s Pinocchio), O’Connor clearly isn’t afraid of rattling cages when approaching sacred texts. There’s something refreshingly untethered about the gusto with which she reimagines Emily, tossing aside the image of a shy, sickly recluse, replacing it with an antiheroine whose inability to fit in with the ordered world is a source of strength rather than weakness. Yes, Emily, into whom Mackey breathes intensely tangible life, suffers panic attacks when away from Haworth, but are these not simply the anguished cries of one separated from her first love? And while Emily’s angsty passions may fix upon Weightman, isn’t he simply in the right place at the right time – a convenient piece of garden furniture amid the rugged scenery that is her heart’s true desire?

Abel Korzeniowski’s score ramps up the gothic romance and adds a note of thunderous horror to otherwise demure scenes of cloistered walls closing in. Elsewhere, O’Connor makes pointed use of a vacuum-like silence to portray shock and bereavement – a momentary absence of life in a film that otherwise thrums with full-blooded vivacity.",artificial intelligence,the guardian

UT researchers received a $3.6 million grant from the National Science Foundation to support creating a robot delivery network on campus, according to a UT media release. The team plans to study how robots and a community can co-exist and how to create, safely operate and maintain a robot network among humans.

“Robotic systems are becoming more ubiquitous,” said Luis Sentis, an engineering professor and leader of the project. “In addition to programming robots to perform a realistic task such as delivering supplies, we will be able to gather observations to help develop standards for safety, communication and behavior to allow these future systems to be useful and safe in our community.”

UT community members will be able to order supplies such as wipes and hand sanitizer through an app on their phone, and the robots, about the size of a medium-sized dog, will deliver them door to door on campus. The robots will go out in pairs and will be monitored by chaperones and people remotely – allowing them to stop the robots if needed.

The researchers aim to understand what people expect of the robots when they encounter them, ensure the robots’ tasks are successfully completed, and find ways to improve oversight of the fleet of robots, according to the media release. They plan to use two separate robot models made by Boston Dynamics and Unitree.

The grant will allow researchers to expand on their six-year project known as Living and Working with Robots, which began in September 2021. They are studying human-artificial intelligence partnerships as part of the “Good Systems” research grand challenge, which UT launched in 2019 as part of an effort to design responsible AI technologies.

My Best Artificial Intelligence Stock To Buy and Hold.,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/705046/worker-analyzes-data-in-war-room.jpg,20/10/2022,Palantir depends heavily on AI to deliver insights.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/20/missed-out-alphabet-best-ai-stock-buy-hold/,"Alphabet (GOOGL -3.87%) (GOOG -3.79%), the parent company of Google, continues to rely heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. AI supercharged Google's self-proclaimed mission to ""organize the world's information and make it universally acceptable and usable,"" keeping it ahead of the competition. Hence, the technology deserves some credit for its $1.3 trillion market cap.

And investors can still find AI-driven opportunities in smaller growth stocks with huge potential. For those who feel they missed out on the Alphabet growth story, they might want to take a closer look at Palantir Technologies (PLTR -4.97%).

Palantir and AI

Palantir is a company geared not so much toward data but toward delivering insights. Its most famous insight came with helping the CIA find Osama bin Laden. Big data companies such as Alteryx, which emphasizes data presentation, or Snowflake, which manages and stores data, don't offer this.

Its core technology is Palantir Apollo, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application that helps build, deploy, and secure software platforms in one or many environments. It also supports two Palantir operating systems: Palantir Gotham, which delivers insights on military and law enforcement-related challenges, while Palantir Foundry applies this knowledge to opportunities in the commercial sector.

Palantir describes AI as ""technology in search of a problem,"" but it still manages to find applications for this capability. One application involves applying its models to an end-to-end infrastructure. It can create what it calls micro models to resolve smaller issues and link its models to determine larger-scale solutions. This allows Palantir to perform analyses on one part of a system without compromising an overall work flow.

Furthermore, AI can build models on a secure data foundation. That approach ensures both data integrity and the ability to relate and apply data to the problem at hand.

Palantir's stock and financials

But despite this potential, the SaaS stock has fallen by more than 80% from its early 2021 high. It is not just the technology bear market and the uncertain path to profitability that weighed on the stock. The limited potential clientele in the military and law enforcement area led to an increased emphasis on commercial customers.

But cost sensitivity could become a more significant issue. A Foundry subscription costs $1 million per month plus additional fees on Amazon's AWS Marketplace. This massive cost could lead many business clients to minimize their use of the software, bringing uncertainty to its commercial revenue streams.

The stock decline took its market cap down to $17 billion. This makes it less than 2% of Alphabet's size, giving investors a chance to buy while the stock is barely in large-cap territory.

Also, the $919 million revenue for the first half of 2022 was a 28% increase year over year. While that slightly lags the 41% revenue increase in 2021, it keeps it in line with the company goal of 30% annual revenue growth through 2025.

Moreover, commercial revenue was up 46% in the second quarter, and its commercial customer count surged 250% during that time. This could mean the cost of Foundry could be less of an issue than many fear.

And it supports a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9. Although it is still well above Alphabet's P/S of 5, Palantir's sales multiple is near all-time lows. Assuming revenue growth stays on target, this valuation could signal a buying opportunity.

Palantir is a likely second chance at AI-driven growth

Palantir's focus on delivering insight means AI plays a crucial role in producing results for its customers. Admittedly, the need to switch its emphasis from government to commercial customers brings uncertainty, and investors might not regard its continuing losses positively in a bear market.

It also remains unclear whether the stock has finally bottomed out. But the revenue growth on its commercial side shows the company gaining traction with its business customers. With Palantir on track to maintain ambitious revenue goals, a position in this company could deliver outsize returns as economic conditions improve.",artificial intelligence,motley fool

1. How Amazon reshaped the warehousing industry. Amazon didn't invent the modern warehouse, but it did supercharge it. The hallmark of its Prime membership, free two-day shipping, made efficiency top priority, and forced the rest of the retail industry to try to keep up.

Unionization has long been dwindling in the industrial sector, but unions see Amazon and its warehouses as a prime opportunity to organize thanks to constant pressure to hit performance targets that result in deteriorating working conditions.

Amazon's pace leads to increased injury risk, workplace inspection data indicates, and some Amazon workers told Insider that their minor aches and pains have turned into lifelong injuries. ""Me and my veteran buddies always say, the military was hard, but it was nothing compared to Amazon,"" said Mark Takakura, a former fulfillment center employee.

Now, Amazon appears to be polling Americans via text, gauging public sentiment about the e-commerce giant's warehouse conditions amid its very public tug-of-war with labor groups.

Here's how companies like Amazon created a warehouse empire.

The options were exercised just over a week before House leadership unveiled a bill that would ban members and their spouses from trading individual stocks.

Pelosi's husband also sold call options in NVIDIA and Micron Technology for a loss over a month after Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 into law.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, exercised seven-figures worth of Alphabet stock call options days before House leadership unveiled a bill that would ban members of Congress and their spouses from trading individual stocks.

The value of the stock purchase was between $1 million and $5 million, according to a certified congressional disclosure made by Nancy Pelosi on October 14. Members of Congress are only required to report the values of such trades in broad ranges.

Paul Pelosi exercised the Alphabet call options, which he purchased in December 2021, on September 16 — the day they were set to expire. (Alphabet is the parent company of Google.)

That date fell just a week before House leadership introduced a Nancy Pelosi-backed bill that would ban members of Congress and their spouses from trading individual stocks.

The disclosure also notes that Paul Pelosi sold call options in NVIDIA and Micron Technology for a loss about a month after President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 into law.

On September 16, Paul Pelosi sold 50 call options (5,000 shares) of NVIDIA at a strike price of $26.86 per share, for a loss of $361,476.

That same day, he also sold 100 call options (10,000 shares) of Micron Technology at a price of $1.84 per share and a total loss of $392,575.

The disclosure of a financial loss is notable as Nancy Pelosi — or any member of Congress — rarely volunteers that level of detail about stock trades by themselves or their spouses. The last time Nancy Pelosi disclosed that her husband traded for a loss was in July, when Paul Pelosi sold $25,000 shares of NVIDIA stock for a loss of $341,365.

Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 with a goal of strengthening ""American manufacturing, supply chains, and national security, and invest in research and development, science and technology, and the workforce of the future to keep the United States the leader in the industries of tomorrow, including nanotechnology, clean energy, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence.""

According to the White House, Micron Technology already announced a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing that was spurred by the passage of the act.

NVIDIA, a producer of graphics processing units and developer of integrated circuits, was one of many companies to sign an open letter in June asking leaders of Congress to pass the bill.

Speaker Pelosi herself does not trade stocks, but her husband is a frequent investor.

Pelosi's congressional office acknowledged last week receiving several questions from Insider about Paul Pelosi's stock-trading habits, but representatives for Pelosi did not respond with answers.

Asked in July whether Paul Pelosi stock trades based on information she's given him, Nancy Pelosi replied: ""Absolutely not.""

Insider collected each of the trades that the speaker reported in 2021 and 2022. Many of Paul Pelosi's trades are worth millions — a previous analysis from Insider found in late 2021 that the speaker is ranked as the 14th wealthiest member of Congress with an estimated net worth of at least $46,123,051.

A conflicted Congress

Paul Pelosi's trades come at a time when Congress is debating whether its members and their spouses should even be allowed to buy, hold, or sell individual stocks in the first place.

In December 2021, the speaker said she opposed such a ban.

""We are a free-market economy,"" she said, ""They should be allowed to participate in that.""

Nancy Pelosi ultimately backtracked on her position following criticism from both Republicans and Democrats in office.

""I've said to the House Administration Committee, review all the bills that are coming in and see which ones — where the support is in our caucus,"" Pelosi said. ""If members want to do that, I'm okay with that.""

After nearly a year of waiting, House leaders finally introduced their own congressional stock trading ban in September.

Some Democrats and good-government advocates, however, criticized it as too broad to garner Republican support — it proposes a stock ban for the Supreme Court and key executive branch officials — and fatally flawed by what they describe as a loophole allowing ""fake"" blind trusts.

Congress has effectively paused progress on the bill until after November's midterm elections.

Since 2021, Insider's ""Conflicted Congress"" project has identified 72 members of Congress who've violated disclosure provisions of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 — a law Congress passed for itself to defend against conflicts of interest and enhance public transparency.

Insider — along with news organizations such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Sludge — have also found numerous financial conflicts among elected and appointed officials across the government.",artificial intelligence,business insider
57,How to Make a Boring Industry Sexy and Appealing,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1665696061-GettyImages-1203756345.jpg,18/10/2022,"A ""boring"" company with a purposeful and consistent personality will bring about a positive emotional response from its target audience.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/your-industry-may-be-boring-but-your-marketing-has-to-be/436067,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Some industries are tougher to market than others. Industries like hospitality, real estate, development, construction and the list continues. If you find yourself at the helm of a business in any of these fields —don't fret — because you're in good company. You just need to think more outside the box regarding digital marketing strategy.

The label of a ""boring"" company is subjective and doesn't mean one iota that your business is that or unmarketable. It means that a cookie-cutter action plan won't work for you, and that's perfectly okay. Taking a ""dull"" or, dare to say, ""unsexy"" enterprise to the masses (or at the very least your target audience) means that creativity and looking at what you do with fresh eyes is going to be the thing that gets you noticed. When you look like everyone else, there's no way to stand out from the crowd.

Introduce yourself

The best way to start the conversation is to introduce yourself. Have you ever met someone who starts telling you about their work yet somehow missed that vital step of telling you who they are or the backstory about how they got started? Even when communicating with your target audience, they still want and need to get to know you. How else will you build trust and show expertise in your field?

Humanized marketing focuses on the personal side of the consumer-business relationship, and it's essential in the age of automation and artificial intelligence. All businesses have brand personality, or a set of human characteristics that shape how people feel about their mission, services or products. It pays to take the time to figure these out or revisit what you already know before tackling any future marketing campaigns.

A ""boring"" company with a purposeful and consistent personality will bring about a positive emotional response from its target audience. When an audience can get to know these companies, they start to see how they differ from similar companies in the area. This makes your company more likely to be chosen to work with when the time comes to use your services or products.

Not everyone will like your content

All businesses want to create content that appeals to a broader audience. It's how they continue to build and attract attention beyond their usual customer base. While ""boring"" businesses might want to try all the latest marketing trends and be on popular platforms, they still need to create content that matches their company's personality, targets the base they can best serve, and do it in a way that feels authentic. While that sounds like a lot, consider the opposite: pursuing anyone and everyone in a marketing free-for-all that leaves you overwhelmed with tough-to-carry-out content ideas and very little return on time investment.

Many businesses underestimate how interesting they are, so ditch the worries about the content being too humdrum to make an impact. A veterinary clinic might have more cute and furry faces to include in its marketing. Still, ""boring"" industries have many opportunities for eye-catching visuals and community connections. Get nerdy about your work, aim to educate people who might be curious, and use photos and videos. Need help doing it? Hire a digital marketer who understands your field and is well-versed in what works. Try the trendy stuff when it fits into your overall strategy. Let your company show off its expertise, and that weekly blog post or clever TikTok or Instagram Reels series might be what makes it all come together.

Become an expert

Businesses in the quieter industries might be concerned that they're giving away too many details in their marketing. Sharing a day in the life of a real estate agent or common mistakes a contractor fixes when re-tiling a bathroom won't necessarily inspire competition or make someone drive to a big box store in search of their next DIY project. Instead, it will provide value and position your business as one that helps earn trust and establish you as an expert.

The competition is still going to do business. Focusing too much on others, the digital marketing content they're putting out and their follower counts only leads to losing focus on the goals of your business. Growing an audience takes time, and a dedicated following who knows and understands what you do will ultimately convert to revenue. Ask what people want to learn more about, focus your content on serving their needs and help people understand how a job in your industry gets done. Chances are there's an audience for you who will appreciate it and turn to your business when they need support.

Your industry knowledge might seem mundane to you, but it's exclusive insider information for an audience of potential customers. When your digital marketing content has a purpose, someone is bound to find it interesting. Think of all the times you've interacted with marketing focused on sales pitches and lead generation. People are likelier to stick around when a business offers way more than concern over its bottom line.

Know what you need

No matter the industry, an effective digital marketing strategy comes down to finding balance. It is not difficult to underestimate the time needed to plan social media posts, create newsletter content and engage with the community a business owner hopes to build. They are there to help business owners focus on what they do best to get where they want to go. Remember, there are marketing professionals who work with companies in industries that need a little more sparkle and shine to stand out. They will help your business share your skills and successes, so it can attract the attention it deserves.

58,What is Web3 and How Will it Impact My Business?,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1666207258-GettyImages-1384625992.jpg,21/10/2022,"Web3 may seem too new for usability, but here are five ways it can transform your business.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-web3-will-transform-small-business/436351,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Technological developments have always had profound effects on the way businesses operate. The proliferation of the internet led to the introduction of digital marketing. The development of artificial intelligence changed how businesses interact with their customers. And now, Web3 is set to revamp how the internet works as a whole.

Web3 is touted as the turning point of the modern internet and is expected to rehaul cyberspace as we know it. What should a business expect from the successor of Web2.0, the internet we have grown accustomed to?

Related: Web3.0: The Next Big Thing?

What is Web3?

Before we dive into how Web3 is expected to influence small businesses, let's first talk about what Web3 really is. It is a blockchain-driven internet that offers a decentralized alternative to the web as we know it.

While still in the early stages of development, Web3 solves what seems to be the most difficult problem with the internet today. It offers better data privacy by eliminating central organizations and allowing users to keep their data stored in their personal crypto wallets.

So, while Web3 may not entirely replace today's internet, it may offer a safer alternative and may trigger an exodus of users from the second to the third generation of the internet.

Benefits of Web3

Web3 is still in the making. So all its benefits are currently rooted in theories and the potential of blockchain technology. If the technology develops like Big Techs have assumed it would, these benefits might be realized, leading to a massive shift in business processes.

1. No-third party involvement

Small businesses rarely have the resources to collect their own data, hence resort to third-party data mining companies.

Such third-party data is costly and rarely accurate. 86% of the companies using third-party data think it is inaccurate. And inaccuracy of data adds to the cost of data-driven operations. This is why ""dirty"" data is said to impact 88% of a company's bottom line and lead to an average company losing 12% of its revenue.

Blockchain eliminates third-party involvement, just like how cryptocurrencies have largely eliminated banks' participation in monetary transactions. Similarly, Web3 is expected to eradicate third-party data brokers by enabling P2P connections and decentralized systems that allow businesses to connect with their customers directly.

In this way, businesses might be able to collect data directly from the source, either free or at a smaller price compared to what data brokers demand. The accuracy of data, that too at a lower price, may lead to better strategies, which may eventually reflect in a business's bottom line.

2. Reinforce cyber security

Cyber security is a menace in the online shopping arena. People are skeptical of sharing their information lest malicious actors steal them. And businesses are at risk of hefty fines due to failure to comply with regulations.

British Airways faced a whopping $26 million fine in 2018 for its failure to protect sensitive consumer data. Proponents of Web3 claim that this next generation of the internet will eliminate this problem.

Since the entire infrastructure is decentralized, Web3 does not have a single point of weakness that hackers can exploit and get their hands on critical information. Blockchain technology makes it difficult for cybercriminals to penetrate networks and tamper with or steal sensitive information.

3. Well-built customer trust

Web3 will eliminate third-party data brokers who rarely regard consumer privacy. These companies often mine data without informing the users and then monetize it. Businesses that buy this data then leave their customers skeptical of trusting them.

Web3 solves this issue by removing data brokers from the equation. If everything goes as theorized, businesses can collect data from the customers themselves and practice better operational transparency.

94% of shoppers remain loyal to companies that operate with transparency, while 73% are willing to pay a higher price to businesses that stay transparent. Therefore, Web3 may enable businesses to build and retain consumer trust, which is a significant revenue driver in every era.

4. Better customer experience

Customer experience has and will always remain among the key variables in a business's success equation.

Regardless of how critical it is, 63% of digital marketers struggle with developing a good customer experience, even with the easy availability of data. With browser cookies crumbling, data acquisition is expected to become much harder than it is today, which may make personalizing the customer experience even more of a challenge.

Web3 may solve this problem with its easy availability of data. It can help marketers acquire critical customer data without offending them. And if used right, this data can then help deliver a more personalized experience that the users crave.

Since 48% of buyers are more inclined towards businesses that personalize their communications, this may lead to improved customer acquisition and, eventually, more profit.

5. Enhanced supply chain

57% of businesses have poor visibility across their supply chain.

Blockchain technology, the backbone of web3.0, distributes data across all the nodes present within a network. This eliminates informational siloes and enhances data transparency across the supply chain.

Once the supply chains are more transparent, businesses may experience a dip in relevant costs and a hike in supply chain efficiency due to increased traceability.

Final words

The next generation of the internet is on the horizon, ready to rise and trigger a new era of business operation.

Small businesses need to keep up with the latest trends and learn about blockchain technology as best as possible. Additionally, they must try and innovate their processes according to the available technologies so they might be better positioned to adopt newer technologies that may arrive in the future.

This might help them avoid being left behind by the big tech companies that are already investing massive amounts in these futuristic technologies.",artificial intelligence,entrepreneur

As first reported by TorrentFreak, the Recording Industry Association of America listed AI-powered music websites that make remixes, improve homemade tracks, or strip songs of vocals or instrumentals harm artists, in a response to a request from the Office of the US Trade Representative.

Artists working within all kinds of media have raised concerns in recent years—and increasingly, with the rising popularity of text-to-image generators like DALL-E—about whether AI-generated art infringes on individuals’ copyright. Most AI content generators depend on datasets that are filled with original artworks, texts, or audio, and use those original works without the owners’ permission.

“There are online services that, purportedly using artificial intelligence (AI), extract, or rather, copy, the vocals, instrumentals, or some portion of the instrumentals (a music stem) from a sound recording, and/or generate, master or remix a recording to be very similar to or almost as good as reference tracks by selected, well known sound recording artists,” the RIAA wrote in its submission. “To the extent these services, or their partners, are training their AI models using our members’ music, that use is unauthorized and infringes our members’ rights by making unauthorized copies of our members works. In any event, the files these services disseminate are either unauthorized copies or unauthorized derivative works of our members’ music.”

The RIAA specifically names Acapella-extractor and Remove-Vocals, which remove the instrumentals or the vocals from songs, respectively, and Songmastr, which claims to “make your songs (almost) as good as” something made by a professional artist, by using their music as a reference.

The RIAA has a long history of aggressively pursuing legal action for copyright infringement, music piracy, and peer-to-peer file sharing. Most recently, it went after NFT platform HitPiece with a demand letter, claiming that selling music as NFTs without the artists’ approval infringed on their rights.",artificial intelligence,vice news

Matheny is one of Vox’s Future Perfect 50.",https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23393262/future-perfect-50-jason-matheny-rand-corporation,"Jason Matheny has been described as an “apocaloptimist” — which, according to Matheny, means he sees “that we’re on a really good trajectory, if we can just avoid any threats to our existence.” The blend of hope for a better future alongside an intense focus on potential threats and barriers to that future is a hallmark of his work for the last decade.

Matheny started out with the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI), a research center at Oxford University that studies existential threats to humanity, whether from artificial intelligence, bio-engineered pandemics, or more bizarre dangers. Studying the future, naturally, has made Matheny’s work ahead of the curve, and it has some serious staying power. Matheny’s 2007 paper on reducing the risk of human extinction, where he argues that investing in nearer-term problems like world hunger could indirectly reduce the risk of catastrophic global threats, is still being cited to this day.

Because of his unique understanding of existential risk, Matheny joined the US intelligence community to modernize its perspective on what risk could be. In 2009, Matheny left FHI for the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), the US intelligence community’s version of DARPA. IARPA invests in a wide range of cutting-edge speculative research projects in areas like AI and synthetic biology, including a tournament on geopolitical forecasting for national intelligence, which Matheny helped run from 2010 to 2015.

In 2018, he moved to the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a US government agency that advises Congress on how AI impacts national security. Around the same time, he founded, with Georgetown University, the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), an organization also aimed at providing data-based recommendations to US policymakers on changes related to progress in artificial intelligence.

“There are a range of challenges related to AI, but national security is a critical area of focus,” Matheny said of his work at CSET, citing “cybersecurity, intelligence, and systems for analysis and collection, as well as AI that is embedded in weapon systems of competing nations” as particularly key issues.

In July, Matheny became CEO of the Rand Corporation, the venerable California-based policy think tank that funds research on technology, infrastructure, health care, energy, climate, and many other areas. He’s especially focused on preventing “truth decay” — the decreasing trust in facts and data within the American political debate — and how, across the board, this decay could hold back efforts to improve policy. He still prioritizes preventing technological catastrophe while remaining hopeful that technology can, if used cautiously, solve rather than cause more problems.

“We now have a moment where we need to think about what will define the next 75 years,” Matheny says. “If you could read a history book in the year 2098, what are going to be the key themes, the highlights?” He adds that he hopes the histories will include Rand “reducing the risk of human extinction by .00000001 percent or greater. Hopefully greater.”",artificial intelligence,vox

A recent Skift webinar, How Artificial Intelligence Is Reshaping the Travel Business, discussed how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models are emerging as a means to keep up with customer demand, improve operational efficiencies, and drive more revenue in an increasingly volatile and unpredictable travel business.

In this webinar:

AI is a trillion-dollar opportunity in travel. Travel stands to benefit from AI-powered analytics more than any other sector, and most of the applications for this technology affect customer-facing channels.

Travel stands to benefit from AI-powered analytics more than any other sector, and most of the applications for this technology affect customer-facing channels. The catalyst for innovation. AI will enable travel companies to optimize revenue across their entire commercial functions — from seats, ancillaries, and cargo for airlines, to hotel rooms, guest amenities, and destination tours for hotels.

AI will enable travel companies to optimize revenue across their entire commercial functions — from seats, ancillaries, and cargo for airlines, to hotel rooms, guest amenities, and destination tours for hotels. “Tried and true” approaches are failing to solve for today’s challenges. AI has advanced more quickly in the past six years than it had in the previous 40, and the acceleration continues. The travel industry has been struggling to respond quickly and accurately to continuously changing demand conditions, trying to project old solutions onto new problems. This is leaving hundreds of billions of dollars in trapped potential.

AI has advanced more quickly in the past six years than it had in the previous 40, and the acceleration continues. The travel industry has been struggling to respond quickly and accurately to continuously changing demand conditions, trying to project old solutions onto new problems. This is leaving hundreds of billions of dollars in trapped potential. Advancement requires an organization-wide effort. Moving the industry forward requires innovation across technology, commercial structures, and engagement models. The industry will continue to evolve, and the adoption of AI is critical to maximize revenue, improve commercial performance, and — arguably most importantly — improve the customer experience.

As travel brands aim to connect the traveler journey from end to end, they are seeking more seamless ways to incorporate and integrate data to support operations, revenue management, marketing, ancillary offers, and other commercial decisions across their organizations.

In this recent webinar, FLYR Labs and Pace Revenue joined Skift to explain how travel companies can put AI-driven insights at the core of their business and technology ecosystems. With the recent acquisition of Pace, a cutting-edge revenue and decision intelligence platform for hotels, FLYR is accelerating its ability to support new travel and transportation sectors beyond its core expertise in aviation.

The panel explored how AI is not limited to any travel vertical or specific commercial function; what to expect from a technical and tactical perspective as AI is still evolving; and how travel organizations can navigate these changes holistically in this ever-shifting environment.",artificial intelligence,skift
64,"Warehouse giants like Amazon and others are desperate for more robots, but human workers worry they make the job more dangerous",https://i.insider.com/63457b6bd2050f0011d3c0bc?width=1200&format=jpeg,19/10/2022,"The automated warehouse is here — and with it come questions about how well, and how safely, machines and humans can work side by side.",https://www.businessinsider.com/robots-warehouses-human-workers-startups-investors-amr-fetch-robotics-2022-10,"As a new workday dawns in the warehouse, workers take their places around the floor to start their shifts. So, too, do their mechanical counterparts: Robots roll away from the charging docks where they've been sleeping all night, receive their first instructions about the day's responsibilities, and get to work.

These machines, which look and act like self-driving shelves, are called autonomous mobile robots. The FlexShelf by Fetch Robotics, for instance, is a bot on wheels that can be equipped with up to three customizable baskets meant to accommodate whatever needs to be carried. It receives orders from a software system that tells humans and bots alike which items to grab in whatever order makes the process more efficient. A worker may spend their day in a small section of the warehouse picking items off warehouse shelves and loading them onto the robot assistant, which carts those items to the area where they'll be packaged and shipped to customers or stores.

This model is a far cry from the typical image of a 21st-century warehouse, staffed by humans who walk 9 miles or more a day to fulfill the endless orders generated by the e-commerce economy.

Amazon, the industry juggernaut, began bringing robots into its warehouses after purchasing the robotics company Kiva Systems in 2012. This year, it launched a billion-dollar fund focused on logistics and supply-chain robotics companies, the biggest splash in a sea of warehouse robotics investments and acquisitions. Zebra Technologies, which made one of those moves by buying Fetch Robotics in 2021, put out a white paper in May 2022 that estimated 27% of warehouse operators had already deployed robots like AMRs.

Zebra projected that in the next five years nearly all warehouses would employ some form of robot automation to keep from being swallowed by a tidal wave of online orders. And with all that automation comes questions about whether the robots actually save workers time or just put them under more pressure, in addition to more injury risk.

Jim Lawton, Zebra's vice president and general manager of robotics automation, told Insider some of his company's clients wanted to skip a pilot program and just get the robots into their buildings. ""I've had somebody say to me, 'I don't even care about the return on investment anymore,'"" he said, adding that customers said they couldn't meet orders and needed help.

RightHand Robotics' RightPick systems are free-roaming machines. Their autonomy owes to understanding the warehouse's layout and having enough on-board artificial intelligence to know not only where they're going but also how to navigate around unexpected obstacles. Hans Hebbink

Warehouses were slow to adopt robots. But recent technological innovations have jump-started the trend.

The first wave of industrial robots began to revolutionize manufacturing in the 1960s, Louis Hyman, a Cornell University historian of labor, told Insider. Since then, the process of building a car or a plane, for example, has grown more and more mechanized. Yet over the same period, a warehouse employee's workday has hardly changed. ""You basically hand a human a pick list and say, 'Go get this stuff,'"" Lawton said.

Warehousing was slower and more cautious in adopting robotics. The first large robots that began to work in warehouses were automated guided vehicles. To keep them from getting lost, and from interfering with or harming workers, AGVs were restricted to one path, like a train or a slot car. If an obstacle blocked their way, they simply stopped in their tracks.

But the new breed of AMR robots are free-roaming machines that find their own way. Their autonomy owes to understanding the layout of the warehouse and having enough on-board artificial intelligence to know not only where they're going but also how to navigate around unexpected obstacles. This represents a major technological leap forward, and AMRs like Fetch's FlexShelf need to see and understand their physical environment to navigate the warehouse floor safely and effectively.

As automation rises, so does the number of reported warehouse injuries

You might think that with robots fulfilling more of the manual labor, especially carrying heavy loads, humans would get injured less often. Though correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation, multiple reports have found that injury rates in Amazon warehouses have increased as more of its warehouses have become automated.

""Because the health and safety of our employees is our top priority, we're constantly investing and innovating to keep employees safe,"" said Amazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson. ""We dive deep into our data to look at new ways to solve both emerging and persistent safety risks.""

Bobby Gosvener went to work in fall 2020 at age 52 at a partially automated Amazon warehouse in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He told Insider he remembered the horde of ""Roombas"" (what he nicknamed Amazon's AGVs) and recalled days when he saw managers frazzled because most of the machines were busted.

One day, during the holiday rush, he said, he returned from a quick lunch break to his workstation on the warehouse mezzanine, where he made sure bins full of items coming down a conveyor belt were correctly loaded and oriented. Something had gone wrong with the machine — the bins got stuck and those backed up behind them fell off onto the floor.

If you're going to go to the bathroom, you better make it quick, because time off task could mean your job is going to be threatened.

Gosvener said he raced into action to get these heavy bins back on the belt while others fell off, spending sweat-soaked hours in perpetual motion. (Amazon, he said, had no intention of slowing or stopping the line during the Christmastime rush). Waking in agony the following day and unable to lift one arm, Gosvener was reassigned to light duty, such as performing COVID-19 checks on fellow employees, but he said he couldn't even do that without experiencing pain. Later, he'd discover he suffered a deep strain of the trapezius muscle. After a prolonged worker's-compensation battle to secure healthcare, he said, he's now on the road to recovery, a process he expects to take two years.

Looking back, Gosvener says it's clear why the rates of automation and warehouse injuries appear to be rising hand in hand. It's not so much that robots are running into humans and causing mayhem, he said, but rather a consequence of what the robots' arrival portends: an accelerating, ever-more-unforgiving pace of work and workplace culture.

""We have what's called 'time off task.' Your time is being measured, right down to the very minute,"" he said of Amazon's controversial time-tracking policy, in which workers have slivers of time a week to use the restroom or do other personal tasks. In the kind of partially automated warehouses that are becoming so common, Gosvener said, the tasks left to human workers are the ones that slow down the operations, which puts extra pressure on people to use every second productively. ""And if you're going to go to the bathroom, you better make it quick, because time off task could mean your job is going to be threatened,"" he added.



""Employees can take short breaks at any time to use the restroom, grab water or a snack, or speak to their coworkers, manager or other support staff, such as HR,"" said Amazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson. ""Like most companies, we have performance expectations for every team member.""

But workers agree any help is better than none, especially knowing the tech can only get better

In the heyday of brick-and-mortar stores, shoppers provided the free labor of walking the aisles, picking the items they wanted, and carrying that stuff to the front for checkout. But online shopping shifts that work onto warehouses employees. ""That rapid jump in how easy and convenient it is to order anything, anywhere, anytime — the supply chain and execution just was not ready,"" Vince Martinelli, the head of product and marketing at RightHand Robotics, told Insider. ""It is still catching up.""

In that environment, there's evidence workers are open to some help. A Harvard Business Review survey of 77 warehouse workers in 2022 found that they viewed automation in warehouses slightly more positively than negatively. While workers worried about job loss and dealing with tech malfunctions, they were optimistic that robots could make their work safer and more productive.



To the Cornell historian Hyman, this checks out. ""It's a question of whether or not these kinds of tools are complements or substitutes,"" he said. In other words, warehouse robots are desirable as long as they're good enough to work alongside humans and shoulder some of the hard labor — but not good enough to replace us.

What robots still struggle with, for now

Robots are adept at tasks humans aren't built for, Hyman said, namely hauling heavy loads and instantly analyzing big data sets to make a warehouse work more efficiently. Yet they often struggle at tasks we find easy, especially seeing things and grabbing them.

Consider a box of 100 paper clips, Lawton said. This box of 100 is just one of many such boxes inside a medium-size box of boxes, and that box of boxes may be packed within an even larger container. A human warehouse worker asked to retrieve a box or two of 100 clips knows what to do: Our hands are adept and grasping, and if we need to open a new box of boxes to fulfill the order, that's simple, too.

Not so for a robot. Each part of the seemingly simple operation — seeing how many items are left in a box, knowing how to manipulate and open a box with a knife, and picking something up with enough force not to drop it, but not so much to crush it — is a wildly complex job for a robot, owing to how limited computerized vision and movement are compared with the human eye and hand.

In a warehouse set up for their success — with the contents of each box predictable and put in the same place — the RightHand robots can out-pick a person. Hans Hebbink

Yet a complex job is not an impossible one. RightHand Robotics is one of the firms building robotic arms that can, thanks to ample training, machine learning, and computer vision, do the warehouse job of picking items and boxes out of bins. These stationary RightPick arms aren't equipped to handle large items or sort through a box of various items, Martinelli said.



Still, in a warehouse set up for their success, where the contents of each box are predictable and always put in the same place, the RightHand robots can out-pick a person, Martinelli said. After all, they never get tired. But creating that environment would force companies to remake the warehouse once again.



If robots can see and grab individual items, could they, someday soon, perform every task in the warehouse, essentially removing humans from the process? Lawton, for one, doesn't believe we're on the cusp of what people in the industry call ""dark warehouses,"" populated only by machines that don't need light to work. He argues that humans will need to drive the forklifts that move large crates and oversize items, and that they're better at the ""Tetris""-like game of packing and shipping items.

And, of course, they'll need to be around to fix the robots.

Twelve years ago, companies didn't hire social media talent — they didn't think they needed it. But now? Businesses need social media directors and entire social media teams. The same is true for playing in the metaverse.

It is my belief that within the next three to five years, a minimum of 30% of business is going to come from a blend of metaverse experiences and implementations of Web3 technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, virtual reality and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs). It is essential for creative agencies (e.g. advertising agencies, agencies, etc.) to prepare how they will play a role in the metaverse now so their customers will be able to find them.

Related: What You Need To Know About How the Metaverse Will Affect Business

The big three

The first step in preparing for the metaverse is for creative agencies to decide which of the three roles they will play — either the expert experimenter, the contributor or the activator. Making this decision now will help companies get ready for when their customers arrive in the metaverse, and it's only a matter of time before they do.

Expert experimenters. These are businesses that have an understanding of the metaverse already. To find out whether they are in this group, business leaders can ask themselves if their business strives to be the deep subject matter expert on all things in the digital universe, or whether it's an early adopter at the vanguard of new technologies. In that case, they need to understand the technologies involved within the metaverse and how Web3 is speeding up evolutions and revolutions.

These are businesses that are still in their infancy in terms of embracing this new wave of technology and deep subject matter expertise is not required. Creative agencies in this group can introduce their client partner brands to the metaverse and converge their physical and digital presence in a way that is profitable and meets customer needs.

Creative agencies in this group can introduce their client partner brands to the metaverse and converge their physical and digital presence in a way that is profitable and meets customer needs. Activators. This last group is made of businesses that focus on seeking ways to offer holistic experiences for businesses and audiences to have within the metaverse. Businesses in this group are like a hybrid between the expert experimenters and the contributors.

Nevertheless, whether you know a little or a lot about Web3, you can't afford to be left out completely; defining your role is an essential first step in preparing for the integration of the metaverse. People are investing in the metaverse heavily. It's expected to reach $5 trillion in value by 2030, and this number is exponentially growing each and every month.

Next steps

After leadership at creative agencies decide which role they want to play, they need to develop a strategy and strengthen their online presence. To do this, they will want to hire people whose job it is to prepare the company to implement itself into the metaverse, in whichever role the company has chosen to take. Doing this will help them strengthen their brand identity — and thus, brand loyalty — before the metaverse fully arrives (and it's coming sooner than we think).

Additionally, leaders and creatives should focus on user experience. What kind of experience do they want their customers to have with their business in the metaverse? This is essential for brands getting established in the metaverse because if they can think one or two steps ahead of what their customers will want when they emerge into the metaverse, brands will be there waiting, ready to give customers what they're looking for.

Finally, it's critical for creative agency leaders to remain adaptable as they learn more about the metaverse while it's still unfolding. Staying adaptable and remaining at-the-ready for change will help agencies stay ahead and prepared to meet customers when they find them in the metaverse.

The importance of Web3

Even if your agency isn't embracing extended reality and other metaverse projects, experiences and communities quite yet, many of your client partners' customers are. And arguably, meeting customers where they are is the single most important piece to building brands and businesses that grow and transform.

The metaverse isn't just a probability — it's inevitable. Throughout the evolution of the internet, waves of advancement emerged because of technological advancement. The internet went from simply being a new technology to sharing the world of information through web browsers to developing social media. Underneath all that were advancements in the programming language, faster internet speeds and, of course, the smartphone.

Now, we are in a new wave: the wave of augmented reality (AR), VR and mixed-reality experiences with the technologies to make them work even more soundly and profoundly. If you haven't begun exploring immersive platforms and how you can approach conversations and tactics related to the metaverse with your client partners, the time has come.

The natural progression

If trends in technology really do repeat history, then it won't be long before hanging out in the metaverse becomes more mainstream. We must watch where people go. An immersive virtual world in which customers socialize, shop, relax, work and play isn't so far-fetched anymore.

Given there was a time when people thought the idea of online dating, smartphones, social media and real human connection online was scary and too futuristic, it makes sense that agencies might be facing those same fears about the metaverse. The popular movie Her may have seemed sad and dystopian, but there were some interesting predictive themes being provoked in that film. Concepts like love, connection, relationships, identity and community will evolve as they always have over time.

However, knowing what we know now, we understand that embracing new technologies is far better than avoiding them. And for creative agencies, it's much more profitable.

Some of its main applications are language processing and speech recognition, and now, through play.ht and podcast.ai we’re actually able to see how far the technology has come by experiencing a conversation with someone who is not even on Earth anymore.

In an entirely AI-generated podcast, podcast.ai has created a full interview between Joe Rogan and Steve Jobs. While the first bit of the podcast is clunky with weird pauses and awkward laughing, it does start to move into real conversation touching on faith, tech companies, drugs, and at one point the AI-generated Jobs uses the analogy of a car where you have to buy all four wheels separately to Adobe’s services.

The crazy thing is some parts begin to sound believable, and actually keep you listening as you start to make a connection to what they are saying. This could be enforced by the prevalence of Joe Rogan in the current podcast sphere, and the general curiosity of witnessing what Steve Jobs would have said if the two ever did meet. Have a listen below to experience the AI podcast for yourself.

I immediately began reading it and couldn't put it down. I spend many hours outdoors and love being immersed in the sounds I can hear and those that I imagine are ""out there.""

Here's what Karen had to say about her fascinating and forward-looking book.

Marc Bekoff: What is The Sounds of Life about?

Karen Bakker: Western scientists and philosophers have long assumed that sonic communication—and, hence, language—was limited to relatively few species. But we can now—thanks to advances in bioacoustics, artificial intelligence (AI), and other digital technologies—listen to and decipher the intricate communication of plants and animals, much of which occurs at frequencies imperceptible to the naked human ear. These enthralling, uncanny breakthroughs give us remarkable new ways of observing life on planet Earth and put us on the cusp of an entirely new realm of scientific knowledge.

MB: Why did you write The Sounds of Life?

KB: I’m a scientist and a teacher. My students and some of my colleagues feel a tremendous sense of climate anxiety and environmental grief. I understand their feelings. Over the three decades that I have spent working on these issues, environmental crises—such as biodiversity and climate change—have accelerated. For some, this can feel like an existential threat and an intergenerational betrayal.1

The Sounds of Life offers a hopeful message about how we can use digital technology to become closer to nature. It reveals the hidden world of nature’s sounds, the unsuspected capacities of other species for complex communication, and our newfound potential for interspecies communication.

MB: What are some of the topics and arguments of the book?

KB: In the past two decades, scientists have started using digital technologies—some of them similar to those found in your smartphone—to listen to nature in new ways. What are they learning?

First, a much broader range of species than previously understood can detect, respond, and make sound: moles and manatees, coral and starfish, from the humble pea to marine seagrass. Many creatures make sound in infrasound and ultrasound, beyond human hearing range. Digital bioacoustics and ecoacoustics help us hear these sounds. Imagine digital technology functioning like a planetary-scale hearing aid, enabling humans to record and decode nature’s sounds, from the Arctic to the Amazon.

Our newfound ability to listen to nature leads to astounding new insights into nonhuman behavior. We are now realizing that many more nonhumans are using sound to communicate with one another, in much more complex ways than previously understood. This enables insights into nonhuman acoustic communication both within and between species, providing new evidence of complexity in nonhuman communication and social organization. Digital technologies reveal the vast, unsuspected, and often truly surprising sonic landscape of plants and animals: Dolphins call each other by individual names, and, in response to the buzz of bees, flowers flood themselves with nectar. Turtle embryos, still in their shells, coordinate the timing of their births through sound. Coral larvae find their way home by sensing the symphony emanating from a reef’s aquatic life.

Third, scientists are using AI to decode patterns in nonhuman sound, which enables new insights into how nonhumans communicate while also enabling rudimentary attempts at two-way communication, mediated by robotics. In other words, we are using digital bioacoustics to create the basis for interspecies communication. Research teams are working on dictionaries in East African Elephant and Sperm Whale. They believe that we will one day soon invent a zoological version of Google Translate.

Digital technologies, in short, offer new ways of engaging with nonhuman agency and voice. The book sounds a cautionary note about the possible misuses of technology but ultimately argues that, with caveats and safeguards, bioacoustics offers humanity a powerful new window into the nonhuman world.

At this same time, we are discovering a new threat to nature: noise pollution. Experiments have demonstrated that many species are exquisitely sensitive to industrial and machine noise. The rapid increase in noise pollution over the past few decades—particularly in marine environments—is a major threat to environmental health. The book sounds a warning about the noise pollution threat. The silver lining: The benefits of reducing noise pollution are significant and immediate. And this helps humans, too, as we are also vulnerable to noise pollution, which causes increased stress and raises the risk of cardiovascular incidents, developmental delays, and even dementia.

MB: How does your book differ from other books on similar topics?

KB: The Sounds of Life focuses on how digital technology fundamentally changes and extends the human ability to listen to nature. I also explore cutting-edge research on the use of bioacoustics to better monitor, protect, and regenerate endangered species and ecosystems, from the Silicon Valley to the Great Barrier Reef, to the Arctic and the Amazon. The Sounds of Life makes an impassioned call to use digital bioacoustics to make a positive difference for environmental conservation.

MB: Who is your intended audience?

KB: The Sounds of Life is a popular science book that will, I hope, fundamentally change the public conversation about humanity’s relationship to the environment. The book is written in an accessible style and features a cast of characters ranging from scientists and conservationists to digital tech entrepreneurs. It offers readers electrifying stories of scientific discovery and unique journeys through the natural world.2

MB: Are you hopeful that as people come to appreciate nature’s soundscapes, they will care more about protecting the environment?

KB: Learning to listen to someone else is one of the first acts of love. As we listen to nonhumans communicate with one another and learn more about their worlds, we deepen our understanding. The communicative worlds of other species are truly astonishing. From this grows a sense of greater respect, about—and also delight in—the natural world. My hope is that people will start to listen wherever they live—downloading some of the apps mentioned in the book, or going on soundwalks. And, as they listen, I hope they will find their way to taking steps to protect and cherish the environment, wherever they are and however they can.",artificial intelligence,psychology today

Notably, the computer software company shared new partnerships with two industry leaders in camera manufacturing, Nikon and Leica. The announcement comes as Adobe looks to make major strides in establishing the legitimacy of photographs by implementing new authentication at the point of capture.

Several years ago, Adobe shared the launching of the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) at Adobe MAX 2019. Focused on combating misinformation and disinformation, the CAI looks to differentiate authentic imagery from those created digitally and/or aided by artificial intelligence. Now, the partnerships with Nikon and Leica provide the opportunity for implementing provenance technology at the point of capture to create a chain of authenticity. In addition to this, Adobe introduced new content credentials features in Photoshop, Verify and open-source tools.

The integration of provenance technology into Leica and Nikon cameras will take time. However, Leica has already shared that its first cameras to adhere to the new C2PA standard are planned to ship in 2023 while Nikon is developing functionality for future camera models. Stay tuned for more information as Adobe continues to usher in new measures ensuring the authenticity of images.

Simply put, AI is a method of making software “think” intelligently like the human mind. It can make decisions using real-time data, learning and adapting as it compiles new information. Netflix’s algorithm, for example, stores and analyzes your viewing history to predict what you may be most interested in watching next. Every time Netflix suggests a movie, it uses the data it receives based on whether or not you click play to improve the next time. Soon enough, it might know your preferences better than you do. Discussions over the ethics of technology have been going on since long before virtually everyone had a smartphone in their pocket. Some argue that technology itself is value neutral—essentially, that a given technology is only as bad or good as the intentions of the person using it. Others argue that values are built into technologies by the people who design them. The ethics of AI is a hot topic these days. Will it make the world better for people, or create more problems than it solves? Nobody knows for sure. But technology affects nonhuman animals as well, and we would be remiss to leave them out of our considerations.

On the other hand, AI is also being used by certain opponents of factory farming. For example, in an effort to reduce animal welfare violations, closed-circuit television cameras have been installed in slaughterhouses around the world. (This is driven primarily by legal requirements, such as in England and Israel, and handshake agreements between industry and the government, such as in the Netherlands.) Continuously monitoring the footage produced by many cameras in many slaughterhouses is not practical, so most of the footage is not viewed. That’s obviously a problem. But increasingly, the footage is monitored not by a human but by AI. This was the motivation behind the AI4Animals system, developed jointly for use in the Netherlands by animal welfare organizations, a meat company (Vion), and Deloitte, a consulting firm. AI4Animals uses an algorithm to detect video segments that may contain animal welfare violations and flags them for review by humans. For example, AI4Animals detects when one or more animals stay behind while others continue, which might indicate exhaustion or an injury, as well as signs of consciousness when the animals should not be alive. Then there are AI-backed alternative food-tech companies. Since realistic, plant-based meat analogues like Beyond Burgers and Impossible Nuggets hit the mainstream and became mildly popular with nonvegetarians over the last decade, companies with AI know-how around the world have joined the race to come up with sustainable, cruelty-free, tasty food offerings that can adequately replace traditional animal products.

Israel-based food-tech company Equinom is deploying AI to search for seeds that will grow plants with specific desired textures and nutritional values; Switzerland-based fragrance and flavoring giant Firmenich is leveraging the technology to test out flavor combinations; and the unicorn startup NotCo relies on AI to compare the molecular structure of meat or dairy products to plant sources. In the world of cell-cultured meat—meat grown from cells rather than slaughtered animals—companies like Because Animals and Animal Alternative are using AI to monitor and guide animal cell growth in an effort to replicate their products at a commercial scale. Right now, much of this technology is still in its infancy, and pretty far from wide commercial application. But while many AI systems require significant innovation, chances are that some of them will scale up enough to become common, if not ubiquitous, in their respective industries. And for any technology to reach that point of development, it’s going to need time, talent, and, most importantly, funding. In a way, it’s a technological arms race between big ag and the many companies looking to replace or remake it for the sake of animal and environmental well-being. Programmers and investors looking to get into the food-tech industry need to first ask themselves which side they want to be on. If technology is a reflection of a society’s values, we need to think long and hard about the innovations we invest time, money, ingenuity, and esteem into. If we consider ourselves an ethical society, it’s a moral imperative that we end factory farming. We’re at a crossroads with AI: It could be the thing that fortifies some of our ugliest, least humane practices, or it could be used to help eradicate those practices. Let’s aim for the latter—the lives of billions upon billions of animals depend on it.",artificial intelligence,fast company

The experiment is part of a larger effort to understand how the brain learns, and possibly apply that knowledge to the field of artificial intelligence.

""We've made huge strides with silicon computing, but they're still rigid and inflexible,"" Brett Kagan, an author of the study, told NPR. Kagan further stated that brain cells are able to adapt to novel tasks in unfamiliar environments in a way that computers simply can't--at least with today's technology. For example, while a person can make a cup of tea in a friend's house, a computer would struggle to locate and prepare the items, because the computer doesn't recognize the geography of the kitchen.

In the experiment, Cortical Labs hooked the dish up to a simplified Pong game and sent signals to the brain cells to indicate the location of the ball. Then the scientists tried to ""motivate"" the cells by using electrical stimulation--an ""organized burst"" for a hit, and a ""chaotic stream of white noise"" for a miss. This follows the ""free energy principle,"" which says that brain cells prefer organization.

Eventually, the dish was able to strike the ball more often than it missed, doing significantly better than the same experiment performed with mouse brain cells. Though the rallies were never that long, Kagan notes that the dish contained fewer brain cells than that of a cockroach. It's not a pleasant mental image, but I am somewhat confident that I could beat a cockroach at Pong.

They’re all obsessed by the one thing they can’t defeat,” says the 52-year-old writer and director, who has neatly embodied this question in a woman called Kath, who has reincarnated herself as a cyborg.

She has done so by spending years downloading her thoughts, memories and feelings, in a process that doesn’t seem so far removed from an intensive course of psychoanalysis. Like all good speculative fiction, Farr’s new play A Dead Body in Taos – which recently began a four-city tour in Bristol – is not just about an imagined future but about the quirks and paradoxes of society today.

The play hops between Kath’s 1960s teenage years of consumerist TV adverts aimed at stay-at-home housewives, and the New Mexico town where – to the horror of her estranged daughter – she is found both dead and undead many decades later. She had followed in the footsteps of the cult abstract expressionist artist Agnes Martin who, in search of silence and inwardness, ended up in Taos, home to the famed art colony. Farr is best known today for his screenwriting, including an award-winning TV adaptation of John le Carré’s The Night Manager and the miniseries Troy: Fall of a City. But theatre was his first love, and A Dead Body in Taos is the culmination of something he has been mulling over ever since seeing the groundbreaking Adam Curtis documentary series, Century of the Self, in 2002.

“It argued something really scary,” he says, “That the social rebellion and experimentation of the 1960s, which were meant to be fighting against the patriarchal, corporate and governmental control of the 1950s, particularly in America, but also here in the UK, suddenly shifted from a collective movement into this very strangely individual thing of self-enlightenment and sexual freedom. And ironically, that generation created the most selfish, individualistic age that there has ever been, which is the age that I was brought up in.”

He ponders these questions at a desk that he shares with a framed letter from Harold Pinter, congratulating him for his 50th-anniversary revival of The Birthday Party in 2008, and a fuzzy childhood photograph of his Jewish forebears. He’s endearingly proud of both. Two guitars stand by a wall in the wood-panelled flat, high above the rumbling traffic of one of north London’s busier quarters, where he lives with his partner.

Unfortunately, he says, he has hurt his hand – badly enough to stop him strumming the guitars, although it does not impede his longtime routine of spending every morning writing. He has several film scripts in the works, and has just completed the second in a series of children’s books inspired by stories told to him by the great-aunt and great-uncle in the photograph, who escaped with his grandmother from Germany in 1938.

Children’s fiction is a new departure, upon which he embarked during the pandemic, though his debut novel, The Book of Stolen Dreams, is nothing like many of the hobbyist works tossed out by underemployed celebrities. It’s a quaintly written but genuinely transporting fable of a brother and sister trying to rescue their father in a world destroyed by a terrifying dictatorship. He bats away compliments with the quip: “Well, for a start, I’m not a celebrity.”

“I love telling stories, sometimes through directing.” David Farr. Photograph: Manuel Vazquez/The Guardian

While this is true, it’s also a misrepresentation of a left-field but very productive 30-year career. Farr grew up in the commuter-belt town of Guildford, the son of a surveyor father and a mother who worked as a school support teacher. “It was just the most weirdly materialistic, individualistic world in terms of anything else that might be of any interest to anybody. The biggest problem was boredom,” he says. Fortunately, at grammar school in his late teens, he had “the classic English teacher who just changed everything”, introducing him and a small group of like-minded friends to the plays of Beckett, the novels of Kafka and the films of Fellini and Godard, often out of school hours. So while Cambridge, where he went to university, “was quite a shock in terms of meeting lots of Londoners, and how confident they were, I didn’t have a problem in terms of ideas. I knew my Ionesco, and suddenly Kafka was A Thing.”

One of his college contemporaries was the actor Rachel Weisz – “a highly confident, very clever, albeit quite complicated north London girl, from a very intellectual Jewish family”. Together they started making “these extraordinarily weird plays, which we’re still very proud of, actually”. They set up a theatre company, Talking Tongues, and won a Guardian student drama award at the Edinburgh fringe. Farr emerged from university with a double first and was given his first professional directing job by Stephen Daldry at the Gate theatre in London. At 32, he became artistic director at Bristol Old Vic, followed by four years running the Lyric Hammersmith and a stint as an associate director at the RSC.

Then he parachuted off a career cliff. “I decided about 10 years ago that I wouldn’t have a plan of any kind because I suddenly realised that I just don’t really fit in,” he says. “I don’t have just one thing that I want to do. If someone asked me to sum myself up in a single word, I’d say I’m a storyteller, because they don’t do anything. I’m not a painter or a photographer, but I love telling stories, sometimes through directing.”

He still loves theatre, he says, “but I have very particular taste, and that’s OK. I don’t enjoy the middlebrow. I have no problem with the populist, but there’s stuff in the middle that I find polite, with a lot of false consciousness going on. People are just pleased to get a ticket to watch a famous actor; there’s a complete lack of serious engagement.”

This feeds into a bigger objection. “What I feel about British culture is that we’re basically very comfortable in upper-class nostalgia slash romanticism, and we have an interesting sentimental attachment to the working-class underdog, but we’re uncomfortable in that middle space where the French, for example, have no problem. There’s also something about our empiricism which means that we don’t see the idea of our world – we just see ourselves living our life.”

When he was young he read thrillers rather than science fiction, and it is this that links the retro-fantasy world of his new novels with the espionage one of John le Carré, a writer he takes very seriously indeed. “One minute you’re a dentist who plays the violin, living in a city that [your family has] lived in for 150 years, and the next minute everything changes. Nothing is solid, and in our world today I think that’s more and more true. The espionage thriller shows that everything is fragile. It goes back to politeness: how polite community truths are shown to be untrue.”

A Dead Body in Taos is more akin to John Wyndham’s mid 20th-century speculative novel The Midwich Cuckoos, about alien babies, which Farr also recently adapted for television. “Wyndham speculates on a very specific thing and asks: ‘What if this happens, what would that do, and where would it take you?’ If John Wyndham were alive today, he would be all over artificial intelligence.”

The questions Farr’s own play addresses are simultaneously cutting-edge – “What if Kath is actually a pioneer? What if she is heading somewhere genuinely revolutionary?” – and hundreds of years old, harking back to the 17th-century philosophy of John Locke, who first recognised the centrality of consciousness and memory to human life. “What I love about AI,” Farr says, “is that it really taps into age-old philosophical questions around who we are.”

AI images from text prompts in programs like DALL-E and Midjourney are everywhere these days and are constantly improving. The existence of an artificially intelligent robot named Ai-da also means we have to ask what constitutes an artist. Ai-da exhibited a series of self-portraits at London’s Design Museum last year, which you can see in the video below. She continues to create art so us mere mortals must confront how technology and creativity intersect.

We learned about Ai-da on Boing Boing. She is named after Ada Lovelace, the 19th century mathematician widely regarded as the first computer programmer. Ai-da’s metal hand can hold a pencil and she draws what her camera eyes see. Her programming dictates that she never sketches the same thing twice. She has a silicone head and torso and rocks several different hairstyles. Via a computerized voice, Ai-da has even given a TEDx Talk about herself and what her art means for humanity and the future of artificial intelligence.

Season four’s villain, and one of the best of the entire series, A.I.D.A. began as an artificial intelligent digital assistant. She desires to be real and transforms herself and then the world around her to suit her selfish purposes. She even declares herself Madame Hydra and eventually gains human emotions and inhuman powers. What could possibly go wrong? Hopefully this real-life Ai-da won’t get her robot hands on the Darkhold and head down a dark path.

A growing area to focus on is what AI can do for content origination. AI is usually thought of as a tool to tackle mundane tasks like transcription or data-intensive work. Wholly machine-generated content, on the other hand, has long been thought of as a parlor trick. With advancements in AI, we are starting to see signs of where AI could compete with human creativity. AI is about to bring on a creative revolution.

Automated journalism isn’t new, but it has been limited to sports stories and earnings reports. Stories where a specific variable, like a score, are integral to the nature of the final article are ripe for this genre of journalism. Companies like Automated Insights and Narrative Science have helped “offshore” this work to robots. It still often lacks the drama of a human-written story, but it can get the job done.

There are certain things machines are better at than humans and vice versa. Machines are fast, efficient, predictable and amazing at calculations. Humans are more intuitive, creative, adaptable and, most importantly, have a better understanding of general context and how the world works.

But we’re starting to see a tipping point where machines are entering the creative and generative process. We’re seeing it in image creation first, but we can expect this trend to continue into things like the creation of PowerPoint presentations, business plans, movies and text editing. Some applications of AI to the creative process could surge into a dynamic shift in the world of journalism.

Dall-E the machine, not the artist.

You might be familiar with Dall-E, an AI that interprets text into unique and original works of art. When I type in the phrase “A journalist working on a story for a newspaper in the style of Picasso” an AI called “MidJourney” (A cheaper version of Dalle-E) produced this image for me.

An advancement in Dall-E recently allows the human user to type in edits to the image. They can, through natural language, say something like “change the color of the reporter’s hat to green.” I actually find this editing functionality to be more interesting than the initial image generation itself and you’ll see why when it comes to video.

But first, a word for those in fear of being replaced by robots. AI augments and enhances human creativity, it won’t replace it. This is, of course, up for debate, but I fall squarely into this camp. What follows is exciting and revolutionary rather than apocalyptic, so let’s run with the assumption that there won’t be robot overlords just yet.

Let’s take the breakthroughs we’ve seen from Dall-E and apply them to a field like video. Today, even the most creative writer can’t make a film without skills in an entirely non-overlapping magisteria. The gap between natural language and video production is too great. But perhaps that won’t always be the case. We’re already seeing video editing through natural language. A startup called Runway ML allows you to change the background of a scene just by typing.

https://twitter.com/kevinbparry/status/1557878947270086658

Perhaps there’s a future where this is supercharged to the point where I can produce a movie just by typing — “change camera angle” or “change scenery” or take I can edit old movies and swap actors or wardrobes.

This brings us to text articles, the staple of journalistic production. Perhaps AI can’t produce more than sports and business stories today, but I can imagine a world where an AI will be able to edit first drafts into polished pieces ready to publish. Its training data would be a mix of previous articles, the reporter’s notebook and feedback written in natural language by the original author: “Edit this piece to have a politically neutral tone, in the style of Hunter S. Thomson, and take the anecdote from the sixth paragraph and use it as a kicker.”

Skeptical? Keep in mind that what’s described above is a big leap, but built off the foundation of what we have now. Today it’s Stylebot (highly recommended) but tomorrow it could be “Editbot.”

The Applications Will Be There

Like most things, journalism won’t necessarily be the front lines of where progress is made. I expect creative multimedia content for fictional storytelling like images and videos to capture the lion’s share of AI momentum. Recently Microsoft announced they’re packaging Dalle-E 2 into its Microsoft Designer app and Image Creator tool. But this will hit other facets.

Imagine being able to describe, in natural language, the Excel calculation you want and have an AI interpret that into an Excel native formula. There’s an AI for that too.

It’s not going to revolutionize what it means to have an MBA, but soon this will evolve into business plans and pitch decks guided by an AI’s “insights.” From there, marketing, architecture, educational lessons, website designs and more are up for grabs.

In the end, AI is not creative the way humans are. AI can be boiled down to an array of complex mathematical equations that improve over time to achieve a specific goal. The nature of computing hasn’t changed, except now, instead of looking for discrete and correct answers, we’re asking computers for creative answers where success is judged by the final product’s usefulness.

This unique approach to creativity, which leverages the strengths of computers, will push human creativity forward. It will enhance the way humans understand, interact and build our world.

Now, China's Xi Jinping is set to become ruler for life. Why is he so beloved by his people?",https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/chairman-of-everything-the-omnipotence-of-china-s-xi-jinping-a-b45dbd67-24fc-40f4-a0f8-8f382da6fccc,"Xi had hardly entered office when he issued comprehensive measures aimed at fighting corruption. From December 2012 to June 2021, the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection didn’t just investigate 631,000 lower-ranking members of the party – referred to derisively by Xi as ""flies"" – but 393 powerful party leaders, called ""tigers,"" also lost their jobs. Many of them ended up in prison.

There was also fabulous wealth to be found in the immediate surroundings of the president himself. In 2012, the Bloomberg news agency published a report according to which Xi’s extended family had amassed several hundred million dollars through company investments and real estate deals. The largest share of the riches was attributed to his brother-in-law. In 2015, the New York Times took the story further, reporting that relatives of Xi’s had invested early on in a company belonging to the country’s wealthiest man and later sold their shares for a multimillion-dollar profit. However, Xi himself has never been implicated in such deals, nor have his wife or daughter.

For Xi, the anti-corruption campaign had two significant advantages: It increased his popularity in the country, with people no longer having to bring along a bottle of perfume or whiskey every time they interacted with public officials. And it enabled Xi to get rid of his political adversaries. Powerful functionaries fell victim to the purge, such as Zhou Yongkang, former head of the security services, in 2013. In 2017, it was the turn of Sun Zhengcai, a member of the Politburo who many had seen as a potential successor to Xi. Both were sentenced to life in prison.

Since then, all power in China has been concentrated in Xi’s hands. Whether it is economic or financial questions, it is all taken care of by Xi’s people, the ""Xiites."" He even gets involved in the details. In 2014, for example, he personally issued 17 decrees relating to environmental protection. And if any of his directives isn’t followed to the letter, the offender faces an abrupt end to their career.

Under his pre-predecessor Jiang Zemin, the Standing Committee made its decisions by majority vote. Then came Hu Jintao, who even gave a veto to every member of the committee, referred to at the time as ""the nine dragons controlling the water."" Xi’s nickname, by contrast, is ""chairman of everything.""

At one time, Article 79 of the Chinese constitution held that the president was not allowed to hold onto power for longer than two consecutive terms. In 2018, Xi had the provision removed, to the delight of party newspapers.

But not all Chinese were equally convinced. Was this not an example of a modern-day ruler claiming the ancient ""mandate of heaven"" so he could stay in office for life? On the day of the announcement of the elimination of term limits, internet censors in China blocked the hashtag #Emperor within minutes. Developments on the stock exchange, though, were extraordinary: Shares for the company Shenzhen Emperor Technology rose by almost 10 percent. It was a way for stock investors to draw public attention to the term despite internet censorship – a creative form of protest that is understood in China.

When Xi entered office in 2012, the Chinese internet was a wild, chaotic place where the armies of censors frequently found themselves trailing hopelessly behind clever users. Today, artificial intelligence takes care of most of the thought-control police work. The ""Great Firewall,"" which separates China’s internet from the rest of the world, has become almost impermeable. The government has criminalized the use of VPN software, which can help users avoid such cyber-impediments.

But what began with the internet has now grown to encompass the entire country: Complete control, everywhere.",artificial intelligence,spiegel online

Some artists see it as an offshoot of a larger movement — like non-fungible tokens and even the metaverse — that is making it harder to sus…,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/ai-art-nft-technology-1.6626015,"From the outside, the last few years have seen a non-stop series of revolutions in the art world.

From the time they found widespread notoriety early last year, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have commanded price tags in the tens of millions for pieces of digital art. But critics describe them as a fundamentally valueless grift that offers nothing of substance to arts patrons, and artists themselves have complained of their work being stolen and ""minted"" without their knowledge .

At the same time, the web3-based metaverse has been touted as the new home for that art — a digital environment Facebook has sunk billions of dollars into, even as its own employees fail to adopt its use.

And most recently AI art (which can create art based on either text prompts or simply an unfinished sketch) has been pitched as a route to art's ""democratization,"" allowing those without the technical abilities to create illustrations themselves cheaply and quickly — though only after the systems have been trained on billions of examples of existing art, often without the consent, or remuneration, of the original creators.

So what gives? Why has the art world been buffeted again and again in the past year with changes marketed as benefiting artists but that have seemingly upended the way art is made and consumed? Why have innovations from the tech world that are supposed to affect the way society as a whole operates seemed to blow up and court controversy, the most notably in art spaces?

WATCH | Can the tech that powers crypto, NFTs be used for more than making money?: Can the tech that powers crypto and NFTs be used for more than making money? Duration 6:53 Take a look at how blockchain is being developed to authenticate Indigenous art and for use in health care.

""These technologies present themselves, look for ways to get talked about by the art world,"" explained Rob Horning, a technology writer and founding editor of Real Life magazine, pointing particularly to the rise of NFTs.

An NFT is a creation primarily operating from the Ethereum blockchain — effectively a system that publicly records and tracks online transactions. The main purpose of that system is to make it possible for the Ethereum cryptocurrency — which uses ""fungible"" (exchangeable) tokens, meaning they can be traded one for another as functionally identical items — to function.

In contrast, an NFT's ""non-fungible"" nature means it is unique — no two are interchangeable. That means they can be linked to a digital artwork (which themselves are very rarely stored on the blockchain themselves) to give it authenticity.

In essence, that means the valuable part of an NFT in the visual arts world is the perception of value. While the digital art it's tied to can be copied a limitless amount of times, only one person can say they have an ""authentic"" copy.

That technology, Horning said, had little to no clear purpose before inventing a market for itself for selling digital artwork.

Pushback, criticism of tech in art world

While the initial expressed goal was to give artists without representation the ability to sell their work, NFTs have proven much more divisive among artists.

While theft and piracy have proven to be huge issues in the space, there has been pronounced pushback against NFTs from the group they were initially supposed to help: smaller artists who, instead of finding new avenues to sell their work, are finding themselves mashed up against tech and crypto subcultures using — and selling — their work without the artists' consent .

But despite the pushback, the technology continues to be pitched and promoted, Horning said, as NFTs and cryptocurrency remain only ""as significant as the buzz around them.""

""There's a constant pressure for people who are invested in crypto to get crypto in the news, get people talking about crypto,"" he said. ""And one of the ways you can do it is to get artists to talk about crypto, or get artists to make things that tangentially involve crypto or NFTs.""

The bumpy intersection of the art and tech worlds is seeing a more recent, though not unfamiliar, collision now with AI art. Through machine learning models such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, anyone with an internet connection can input a few prompts and generate any image they'd like.

Like with NFTs, some artists have fought back against it. Artists such as Simon Stålenhag — whose sci-fi scenes gave inspiration to the Amazon Prime series Tales from the Loop — and web-comic artist Sarah Andersen have complained that those systems are trained off of publicly available art, including their own works. That gives users the ability to request that images be generated in a living artist's style, mimicking their work — and potentially taking business away from them.

I find the notion that they just went ahead to be bizarre and violating. Art comes from a person’s complex perspectives and lived experiences, not to mention years of work; training an algorithm to make an imitation of that, without my permission, just feels insulting. —@SarahCAndersen

Artificial intelligence art generators are ""not in the hands of artists right now. It's in the hands of early adopters of tech,"" Stålenhag told Business Insider in a recent interview .

Blair Attard-Frost is a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto who studies the impact of AI and ethical ways to implement it in industry. They said that those artists fall into the camp of the ""labour-displaced,"" those whose workflow has been fundamentally changed by the implementation of AI. And like Stålenhag, Attard-Frost said they are concerned about how AI art systems have been built from those artists' creations for little or no pay.

But those issues crop up in many industries that implement artificial intelligence. The reason it is more visible in the art world is the central position art has in people's daily lives.

""One reason why this 'AI artist' stuff is attracting so much attention is because it's much more generalized, right?"" Attard-Frost said. ""It affects everybody, and it unlocks all kinds of new abilities for many people ... in a way that those more specialized applications aren't quite doing.""

As to why these tech inventions have built such strong connections with the art world as opposed to other areas, there are a number of reasons. Robert Enright, senior contributing editor to Manitoba's Border Crossings magazine and research professor in art theory and criticism at the University of Guelph, said it partly stems from the industry shifting to value the selling of art over its creation.""

""One of the things that has happened — and I think this explains why NFTs and why there's this sort of search to find a new thing to sell — I think that in lots of ways, the marketing of art has become a very, very significant part of this process,"" Enright said.

""Because there's so much money in the world now, and because the wealthy have to find things to do with their money, one of the things they do is pay exorbitantly high amounts of money for art.""

At the same time, as Attard-Frost explained, these are technologies that are coming to all arenas of life sooner or later. They've simply taken their first stumbling steps in the art world, while regulation around many of these technologies is still so much in its infancy, they compared it to the ""Wild West.""

But Sara Ludy, an American artist whose work often utilizes new technologies, says that's just indicative of the field. The nature of art is experimental, which will always draw artists to new mediums and techniques, which have yet to be widely understood.

While that can make it incredibly difficult to keep up with the shifting requirements of tools an artist needs to master — and lead to potentially predatory business practices from those outside the world of art who see opportunity — art and tech will always find themselves intertwined, she said.

""Artists are driven to expand our definitions of the world and self. Technology is here to expand our definitions of self and connection and all of these things,"" Ludy said said. ""So ... our motivations are very much in parallel with one another.""",artificial intelligence,cbc news

Ayelet Israeli and Eva Ascarza offer a new approach to make artificial intelligence more accurate.",https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/when-bias-creeps-into-ai-managers-can-stop-it-by-asking-the-right-questions,"Most companies rely on artificial intelligence-based algorithms to make a wide variety of business decisions—from pinpointing the products customers prefer to determining which resumes should go to hiring managers.

The problem for companies trying to advance racial equity and inclusion: Algorithms can amplify bias.



Some companies try to address the issue by making sure that their algorithms don’t use data on protected characteristics such as race or gender. Yet, eliminating factors like race from an algorithm doesn’t address the problem. Rather, doing so might even magnify the issue.



Instead, in a recent article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Harvard Business School professors Eva Ascarza and Ayelet Israeli suggest intervening at points along the algorithm’s decision-making chain using what they call “bias-eliminating adapted trees” (BEAT) to ensure that the algorithm generates fair outcomes. As the algorithm sorts through information to optimize its objective, BEAT detects and eliminates bias at key points in the training process. For instance, BEAT could help a car service charge surge pricing during rush hour without discriminating against race or other sociodemographic characteristics.



HBS Working Knowledge spoke with Israeli, the Marvin Bower Associate Professor of Business Administration, and Ascarza, the Jakurski Family Associate Professor of Business Administration, about how managers can apply the findings to eliminate discriminatory business practices.

Rachel Layne: People may assume that algorithms are unbiased, but that’s not always the case. Where does bias creep in?



Ayelet Israeli: There are several sources of algorithmic bias. One is due to historical human bias. When you train your algorithm, you use historical data that might have biases, and these will continue. For instance, a few years ago, Amazon used an algorithm to help them decide who to employ. And the algorithm disproportionally picked men over women because historically, they had hired more men than women. Because humans made decisions that were biased, the algorithm perpetuates this.

Another source of bias is incomplete or unrepresentative information. A famous example is facial recognition. If I use mostly photos of white men to train the machine to learn facial recognition, the machine will perform poorly on recognizing people of color and women.



In our article we're actually focusing on a third type: Even if the data used to train the algorithm is unbiased and representative, there may be correlations between the person’s protected attributes and their behaviors or features that are captured in the data, which may lead to biased outcomes.



Layne: Can you give an example?



Israeli: Suppose that women are more likely to buy red iPhone cases compared to other groups. Now, I decide to exclude gender when I train my algorithm to predict something, in order to prevent any biased outcome. But if I still let the algorithm use the color of the iPhone case, then I'm essentially using a proxy for “this person is a woman.”

Then, when the algorithm uses the color of the case to decide who to hire or who to give a discount to, the algorithm may favor the group that has red cases, meaning it disproportionally favors women, despite having removed the gender information from the data. And, as decision-makers, we might not want to do that.



“Most algorithms do not create the bias per se, but tend to exacerbate it because of scale. And this becomes very problematic.”

Layne: If the problem is in the data, are algorithms creating the bias or was it already there? And is it deliberate?



Eva Ascarza: Most algorithms do not create the bias per se, but tend to exacerbate it because of scale. And this becomes very problematic. Think about the three types of sources that Ayelet mentioned. The first type of algorithmic bias takes [pre-existing] human decisions and automates that process. So, instead of a few humans making decisions, now you can have millions of machines making systematically biased decisions. That scale can have a significant impact on society.



The second one is also exacerbating bias at scale. If you're going to start doing facial recognition to evaluate millions of people, even tiny algorithmic mistakes in prediction across races or genders make a huge difference in the aggregate; any decision that is made based on the prediction of those algorithms will inherently include bias.

In the third case, the bias appears because algorithms add great levels of precision thanks to the scale of the data. For example, algorithms help companies, hospitals, and banks predict what individuals will do, and they do so by finding hidden patterns in the data. Compared to a human looking for predictable patterns in simple data, an algorithm is doing it on steroids, using very large datasets, and is able to capture patterns that are undetectable to humans. If you do it on steroids, these correlations [such as the color of the case and the gender] kick in and create systematic differences that now are sizable. Like when people found out that Uber was charging people in poor neighborhoods systematically higher prices than those in richer areas.

Whether it's purposeful or not, we don't know for every company, obviously, but we believe that it’s likely not intended. That said, the problem for the firm is having not been careful to look at the outcomes of these algorithms to detect these biases in the first place.



“The positive outlook here is—if you compare algorithmic bias to human bias—with algorithmic bias, you can at least offer ways to solve it, and our solution is one of them.”

Israeli: The positive outlook here is—if you compare algorithmic bias to human bias—with algorithmic bias, you can at least offer ways to solve it, and our solution is one of them. Because it's a machine, when you're learning about an issue, you can fix it. Whereas with human bias, we've been trying to deal with it for years. And it's so hard to change. It's so hard to monitor or fix compared to the machine.

Layne: In layman's terms, how does your solution, BEAT, work? You mentioned surge pricing for car services as an example.



Israeli: So, imagine we have three different variables to determine how much the car ride should cost: Time of day, number of passengers, and which neighborhood is the origin or the endpoint.



Let's say that the time of day is not systematically different across people. So, people of all types go at different times of day. Same for the number of passengers. But the third variable, origin and endpoint, systematically varies across people of different groups; people of color tend to live in a certain neighborhood [due to historical disparities].

In general, a pricing algorithm will explore patterns between these three variables and the firm’s profit to see what the firm should charge depending on those characteristics. In contrast, our algorithm will not only explore which price to charge, but also whether each variable we use to determine price creates a biased outcome. For example, the algorithm explores time of day and determines: If it's very late, it should charge more. If it's early, it should charge less. The algorithm will also look for, “Oh, when I split the data by time of day, there is no difference between gender or race. Basically, there's the same type of people in both. So I can follow this rule.”

But when it does the split based on the origin or destination, it will see very quickly, “Oh, if I do the split here, I have mostly people of color” or “here, I have mostly white people.” In those cases, the algorithms ignores that information; it doesn't want to learn things that will impact different groups in different ways. In a way, we only want it to learn the things that are not going to create discrimination. And so the algorithm relies on other variables instead, such as number of passengers, whatever the other things that are not related to race or ethnicity.



Layne: What responsibility do managers have to eliminate bias in the algorithms they deploy?



Israeli: You should at least know what is going on. The number one thing to do is audit your algorithms and check if you have outcomes that are systematically different. And then based on whatever the objective is, whatever your business intentions are, you can decide what to do. But you need to know what is going on. At the very least, our algorithm provides a simple tool to empower managers to do just that, then it can also help them eliminate or reduce that bias if they want to do so.



Ascarza: At the end of the day, it is the firm that should decide how they make their profit. Firms should decide how they grow, and what kind of market they want to be in. But they shouldn't make business decisions blindly, right? That's why we believe this is important to give businesses the tools to audit the outcomes of their algorithms and to make the decision themselves.

And it's true -- AI has already started transforming the healthcare, finance, and manufacturing industries. But there's one area where AI is causing some severe problems: fake reviews.

We spoke with Truely CEO JP Bisson about AI technology and how companies can use it to protect their interests.

BN: How has AI technology impacted the way we live and work?

Advertisement

JB: Artificial intelligence had come a long way since the 50s, when Alan Turing asked, 'Can machines think?' Although no machine has even come close to passing the Turing Test, that question sparked the decades-long research that has brought us AI technology as we know it today.

We are probably unaware of it, but AI is now a considerable part of our everyday lives. We can play a song, turn house lights on and get answers to questions using voice assistants. We get personalized content on our social media feeds and video streaming services. We unlock our phones and open our apps with facial recognition. We get to our destination in self-driven vehicles.

At work, we have software programs that automate operational processes, allowing companies to save resources. We have tools that analyze data, software that measures employee experience, robots that speed up product manufacturing, apps that write content. Recently I have heard of two AI systems in the works -- one that produces realistic visuals and artwork from a description in plain language and another that automates manual tasks in-browser.

It is all so amazing that I can't wait to see what happens next. Still, we must look at AI as a double-edged sword that could cause grave harm if it falls into the wrong hands.

BN: In what ways can AI cause this harm?

JB: We live at an exciting time when almost everything we set our mind to becomes possible, especially with AI technology. But just like I said, people can also use artificial intelligence to harm and destroy the things the technology has helped build.

Case in point: deep learning AI is now used to create deceptive images and videos or deepfakes. AI writing tools have been taught to generate false news and fake reviews. What's scary about all these fakes is that they seem real. To the unsuspecting reader or viewer, they are believably true.

The internet has become a great source of information, and rightfully so. You only need to type a word on any browser, and you'll get pages of results. So you can't blame why people who aren't so discerning believe almost everything they read and see on the web. Unfortunately, the internet has developed into a medium where people no longer necessarily tell the truth.

These untruths have led us to develop a site that would help bring truth back to the internet. We understand how fake reviews hurt not just the product and service providers but also the consumers. Truely's aim is to stop these fake reviews -- which can be mass produced by AI -- and bring the truth back to the internet. And we are fighting fire with fire, using AI technology to identify and remove these fake reviews -- whether written by paid humans or AI-generated -- to give consumers the real score about the products and services we feature on our site.

BN: Can you tell us more about the AI technologies used to create fake reviews, how these technologies work, and how artificial intelligence can filter out fakes?

JB: Generally, artificial intelligence has four components: machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and robotics. Out of those four, people use ML and NLP to generate text.

Machine learning allows computer computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This AI system is based on the idea that machines should be able to learn and improve independently, just like humans.

There are two main types of machine learning:

Supervised learning, where the computer is given a set of training data. The computer then uses this training data to learn what it's supposed to do.

Unsupervised learning, where the computer is given data but is not told what to do with the data. It has to figure out patterns and structure on its own.

Under machine learning, we have deep learning, which is a powerful tool for generating text. So you feed a computer a large body of text, and from there, the system learns the distribution of words and grammar rules.

Once the system has learned the rules and what-have-you, it can generate new realistic and coherent text. And yes, this technology has been very helpful in quickly creating written content such as news articles, product descriptions, text summaries, and more. Unfortunately, people also use it to create fake news, reviews, and comments -- which, as we know, can be detrimental not just for businesses who get these fake ratings but for society as a whole.

Natural language processing, on the other hand, is a form of artificial intelligence that allows computers to understand and process human language. This system works by converting human language into a format that computers can understand. AI algorithms are then used to analyze and interpret human language. With these algorithms, a computer can understand the overall meaning of a text, identify named entities, extract key phrases, and even find the sentiment of a text. NLP is becoming more and more commonplace in our everyday lives, with people using it for the same use cases they use ML for.

At Truely, we use these technologies to filter out fake reviews. Our AI analyzes reviews for certain red flags and language patterns, indicating that the reviews are not genuine. It also looks for patterns in the language used. For example, fake reviews often use superlative words to describe a product, while real reviews are more likely to use neutral language. It also uses other clues to identify and filter out fake reviews on the list of software products and services on the Truely site.

The tools we use have proven to be valuable in the fight against fake reviews. As AI technology evolves, I am optimistic that it will become more reliable in weeding out fake reviews.

BN: What does this technology mean for SaaS providers and businesses?

JB: There is only one thing I'm sure of: the world of online reviews is changing. This AI technology is already significantly impacting businesses, especially those that rely heavily on online reviews.

Generally, this AI technology is good news for businesses, as it means they no longer have to worry about the negative impact of fake reviews.

Companies that rely on fake positive reviews to boost their ratings will now be more likely to be exposed, leading to a loss of customer trust and potential legal problems.

Overall, AI that removes fake reviews is a significant development for businesses. Besides exposing fake reviews, it protects the credibility of SaaS firms and other companies.

87,A pioneer of AI reveals what the tech is really capable of: “It’s not sentient” - Inverse,https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/12/e2fd7135-4114-4800-8065-638c45ceb62e-getty-1430941321.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg,16/10/2022,"If we want to reach true artificial intelligence, we'll need to combine both modern and traditional methods. And we're currently quite far from that goal.",https://www.inverse.com/science/ai-dumb-true-intelligence,"The field of artificial intelligence has never lacked for hype. Back in 1965, AI pioneer Herb Simon declared, “Machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do.”

That hasn’t happened — but there certainly have been noteworthy advances, especially with the rise of “deep learning” systems, in which programs plow through massive data sets looking for patterns, and then try to make predictions.

Perhaps most famously, AIs that use deep learning can now beat the best human Go players (some years after computers bested humans at chess and Jeopardy).

Mastering language has proven tougher, but a program called GPT-3, developed by OpenAI, can produce human-like text, including poetry and prose, in response to prompts.

Deep learning systems are also getting better and better at recognizing faces and recognizing images in general. And they have contributed to the software behind self-driving vehicles, in which the automobile industry has been investing billions.

But scientist, author, and entrepreneur Gary Marcus, who has had a front-row seat for many of these developments, says we need to take these advances with a grain of salt.

Marcus, who earned his Ph.D. in brain and cognitive sciences from MIT and is now a professor emeritus at New York University, says the field of AI has been over-reliant on deep learning, which he believes has inherent limitations.

We’ll get further, he says, by using not only deep learning but also more traditional symbol-based approaches to AI, in which computers encode human knowledge through symbolic representations (which in fact was the dominant approach during the early decades of AI research).

Marcus believes that hybrid approaches, combining techniques from both methods, may be the most promising path toward the kind of “artificial general intelligence” that Simon and other AI pioneers imagined was just over the horizon.

Marcus’s most recent book is “Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust” (Pantheon, 2019), co-authored with Ernest Davis, a professor of computer science at NYU.

Undark recently caught up with Marcus for an interview conducted by Zoom and email. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Undark: Let’s start with GPT-3, a language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. The New York Times Magazine said GPT-3 writes “with mind-boggling fluency,” while a story in Wired said the program was “provoking chills across Silicon Valley.” However, you’ve been quite critical of GPT-3. How come?

Gary Marcus: I think it’s an interesting experiment. But I think that people are led to believe that this system actually understands human language, which it certainly does not. What it really is, is an autocomplete system that predicts next words and sentences. Just like with your phone, where you type in something and it continues. It doesn’t really understand the world around it. And a lot of people are confused by that.

“GPT-3 certainly does not understand what it’s talking about.”

They’re confused by that because what these systems are ultimately doing is mimicry. They’re mimicking vast databases of text. And I think the average person doesn’t understand the difference between mimicking 100 words, 1,000 words, a billion words, a trillion words — when you start approaching a trillion words, almost anything you can think of is already talked about there.

And so when you’re mimicking something, you can do that to a high degree, but it’s still kind of like being a parrot, or a plagiarist, or something like that. A parrot’s not a bad metaphor, because we don’t think parrots actually understand what they’re talking about. And GPT-3 certainly does not understand what it’s talking about.

The GPT-3 is not as smart as some people may think. Laurence Dutton/E+/Getty Images

UD: You’ve written that GPT-3 can get confused about very basic facts. I suppose if you ask it who the president of the United States is, it may be almost as likely to say Donald Trump as Joe Biden — just because it is, as you say, mimicking. I suppose in some sense it doesn’t really know that it’s currently 2022?

GM: It may even be more likely to mention Donald Trump as president, because probably the database that it is trained on has more examples of Trump. He’s in the news more; he was in the news for longer; he was in office for longer. He continues to be in the news more than your average ex-president might be.

And yes, the system does not understand what year we live in. And it has no facility for temporal reasoning. You know, as a function of temporal reasoning, that just because you were president doesn’t mean you’re president anymore. Just because you were alive doesn’t mean that you’re still alive. You can reason that Thomas Edison cannot be president anymore because he is dead; GPT-3 cannot make that inference. It’s astonishingly dumb in that regard.

UD: In spite of these AI systems being dumb, as you put it, people are often fooled into thinking that they’re smart. This seems to be related to what you’ve called the “gullibility gap.” What is the gullibility gap?

GM: It’s the gap between our understanding of what these machines do and what they actually do. We tend to over-attribute to them; we tend to think that machines are more clever than they actually are. Someday, they really will be clever, but right now they’re not. And you go back to 1965: A system called ELIZA did very simple keyword-matching and had no idea what it was talking about. But it fooled some people into discussing their private lives with it. It was couched as a therapist. And it was via teletype, which is sort of like text messaging. And people were taken in; they thought they were talking to a living person.

“It’s not sentient, it has no idea of the things that it is talking about.”

And the same thing is happening with GPT-3, and with Google’s LaMDA, where a Google engineer actually thought, or alleged, that the system was sentient. It’s not sentient, it has no idea of the things that it is talking about. But the human mind sees something that looks human-like, and it races to conclusions. That’s what the gullibility is about. We’re not evolved nor trained to recognize those things.

UD: Many readers will be familiar with the Turing Test, based on an idea put forward by computer pioneer Alan Turing in 1950. Roughly, you ask an unseen entity a series of questions, and if that entity is a computer, but you can’t tell it’s a computer, then it “passes” the test; we might say that it’s intelligent. And it’s often in the news. For example, in 2014, a chatbot called Eugene Goostman, under certain criteria, was said to have passed the test. But you’ve been critical of the Turing Test. Where does it fall short?

GM: The Turing Test has a kind of incumbency: It’s been around the longest; it’s the longest-known measure of intelligence within AI — but that doesn’t make it very good. You know, in 1950, we didn’t really know much about AI. I still think we don’t know that much. But we know a lot more. The idea was basically, if you talk to a machine, and it tricks you into thinking that it’s a person when it’s not, then that must be telling you something.

But it turns out, it’s very easily gamed. First of all, you can fool a person by pretending to be paranoid or pretending to be a 13-year-old boy from Odessa, as Eugene Goostman did. And so, you just sidestep a lot of the questions. So a lot of the engineering that has gone into beating the Turing test is really about playing games and not actually about building genuinely intelligent systems.

UD: Let’s talk about driverless cars. A few years ago, it seemed like great progress was happening, and then things seem to have slowed down. For example, where I live, in Toronto, there are no self-driving taxis whatsoever. So what happened?

GM: Just as GPT-3 doesn’t really understand language, merely memorizing a lot of traffic situations that you’ve seen doesn’t convey what you really need to understand about the world in order to drive well. And so, what people have been trying to do is to collect more and more data. But they’re only making small incremental progress doing that. And as you say, there aren’t fleets of self-driving taxis in Toronto, and there certainly aren’t fleets in Mumbai.

Most of this work right now is done in places with good weather and reasonably organized traffic, that’s not as chaotic. The current systems, if you put them in Mumbai, wouldn’t even understand what a rickshaw is. So they’d be in real trouble, from square one.

With current progress in AI, highly effective driverless cars won’t be here anytime soon. Yuichiro Chino/Moment/Getty Images

UD: You pointed out in Scientific American recently that most of the large teams of AI researchers are found not in academia but in corporations. Why is that relevant?

GM: For a bunch of reasons. One is that corporations have their own incentives about what problems they want to solve. For example, they want to solve advertisements. That’s not the same as understanding natural language for the purpose of improving medicine.

“The fruits of current AI are in the hands of corporations rather than the general public.”

So there’s an incentive issue. There’s a power issue. They can afford to hire many of the best people, but they don’t necessarily apply those to the problems that would most benefit society. There is a data problem, in that they have a lot of proprietary data they don’t necessarily share, which is again not for the greatest good. That means that the fruits of current AI are in the hands of corporations rather than the general public; that they’re tailored to the needs of the corporations rather than the general public.

UD: But they rely on the general public because it’s ordinary citizens’ data that they’re using to build their databases, right? It’s humans who have tagged a billion photos that help them train their AI systems.

GM: That’s right. And that particular point is coming to a head, even as we speak, with respect to art. So systems like OpenAI’s DALL-E are drawing pretty excellent imagery, but they’re doing it based on millions or billions of human-made images. And the humans aren’t getting paid for it. And so a lot of artists are rightfully concerned about this.

“The humans aren’t getting paid for it.”

And there’s a controversy about it. I think the issues there are complex, but there’s no question that a lot of AI right now leverages the not-necessarily-intended contributions by human beings, who have maybe signed off on a “terms of service’’ agreement, but don’t recognize where this is all leading to.

UD: You wrote in Nautilus recently that for the first time in 40 years, you feel optimistic about AI. Where are you drawing that optimism from, at the moment?

GM: People are finally daring to step out of the deep-learning orthodoxy, and finally willing to consider “hybrid” models that put deep learning together with more classical approaches to AI. The more the different sides start to throw down their rhetorical arms and start working together, the better.

This was the question that Juan Carlos Noguera, Assistant Professor of Industrial Design at Rochester Institute of Technology, recently posed to his class of Industrial Design MFA students. The resulting explorations prompted conversations and reflections on the evolution of the design discipline as well as unexpected inspirations during the design process.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) progressed by leaps and bounds over the past few years, and in particular the open access to image generation tools such as Midjourney and OpenAI's Dall-E have recently led to an explosion of interest in these technologies. Images produced by the software have now won prizes in competitions, raising the question of if/when algorithms will replace designers and creative professionals. The intent with this project was not to ask whether the software will replace a designer entirely, but rather where and how these tools fit in a designers' personal workflow.

To start, Professor Noguera showed the results of an abstract prompt - ""Cylinders Embracing Spheres"" along with words like ""Ceramic"", ""Raku"" and ""Vessel"". He then distilled the resulting images into a product concept, modeled these in Autodesk Fusion360 and produced renderings of a final concept.

With no prior personal experience to guide them, the students ended up using the AI tools in different ways within their process and workflow. Professor Noguera states:

Some of these designers used AI-generated images as a form-finding tool that accelerated or augmented their existing process, and others saw the AI take them in unexpected directions, with very rich results. The variety of products designed, ranging from musical instruments, furniture, to assistive technologies and consumer electronics, shows us the potential of using these tools in a variety of industries.

One student, Shen Liu, created a balance chair for children. The AI tools made it easy to add to his ideas, helping him to clarify his thinking. Each set of results from the software led him to define his prompts more specifically, uncovering his requirements through pictures. Although AI might assist by providing surprising inspirations, ultimately he felt that ""it is unrealistic to rely entirely on AI for design because the complex principles of user-centered design are difficult or impossible to describe in language.""

Another student, Jayden Zhou, used a prompt of ""futuristic sci-fi stringed instruments"" which led to a series of images similar to current guitars. But in the corner of one image was an incomplete sketch of an instrument with an unusual form. Taking this as his inspiration he was able to translate that into a design for an electric violin with a body style unlike anything on the market now. Although the initial sketch came from the software, he realized that ""AI results do not come with emotional judgments, which is an essential part of the design."" It was the imagination of the designer that developed the idea into a compelling visualization.

The jury is still out on the question of how AI will impact designers and the profession in the future. You can get a glimpse of what the future might hold, with details on all the student projects, in the full write up of the project, published on Professor Noguera's website. Add your thoughts on the potential impact of AI on the future of design in the comments below.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is among the most innovative computer science technologies. It is comparable to human intelligence in terms of features like language comprehension, thinking, learning, and problem solving.

New York, Oct. 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Global Automotive Artificial Intelligence Market Size, Share & Industry Trends Analysis Report By Application, By Process, By Technology, By Offering, By Component, By Regional Outlook and Forecast, 2022 – 2028"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06352703/?utm_source=GNW

In the creation and modification of the technology, the market’s manufacturers are confronted with huge intellectual obstacles. In addition, the expansion of the automotive sector is anticipated to increase the market for automotive artificial intelligence.



The automotive sector has reaped the benefits of artificial intelligence and is among the primary industries employing AI to augment and imitate human actions. In addition, the advent of standards like adaptive cruise control (ACC), advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), and blind spot alert, as well as the increase in demand for comfort features, entice automotive providers to AI.



Autonomous cars are distinguished according to their degree of autonomy. Level 5 cars are completely autonomous, requiring no human involvement for safe operation. Nowadays, the significant proportion of autonomous vehicles on the road, like the Cadillac CT6 and Audi A8, belong to levels 2 and 3, are capable of performing at least two duties concurrently, and need a human driver to operate safely.



COVID-19 Impact



To mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments throughout the world were compelled to institute strict lockdowns and demand social isolation. As a result, the demand for new automobiles declined significantly. In addition, the availability of raw materials decreased, production slowed, and worldwide supply networks were disrupted. The automobile industry’s losses have impeded the implementation of cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies. However, it is projected that the use of automotive artificial intelligence would expand over time owing to the growing demand for connected vehicles and the ongoing global vaccination campaign.



Market Growth Factors



Growing need for customer experience and efficiency of automobiles



Human-machine interface (HMI) solutions for the automobile sector are now easier to handle and manage, hence boosting the user experience. A user may operate applications such as music systems, car lighting, and infotainment systems with such technologies. Due to the rising demand for better customer experience and additional features, the percentage of a vehicle’s cost devoted to its electronics system has climbed from 1–2% to 8–12%.



Significant likelihood of in-car payments



Among the most recent innovations, in-car payments are intended to change the ways in which consumers pay for parking or tolls, refuel, and potentially even go grocery shopping. Open Banking, which allows consumers to pay immediately from their bank and eliminates friction and security concerns associated with their payment trip, might be utilized to develop in-car wallets as well as payment systems. By simplifying transaction fees and enhancing the entire user experience, third-party payment networks might be eliminated.



Market Restraining Factors



Surge in the overall cost of vehicle



Autonomous cars are projected to be expensive due mostly to the commercialization of new technology systems. The majority of innovative technology are included into luxury and premium automobiles, which have a restricted client base due to their high price. Therefore, a high car price is likely to inhibit market expansion. In comparison to semi-autonomous cars, the demand for costly autonomous vehicles is predicted to be mild.



Application Outlook



On the basis of application, the automotive artificial intelligence market is divided into Human–Machine Interface, Autonomous & Semi-autonomous Driving, Identity Authentication, Driver Monitoring and Autonomous Driving Processor Chips. Identity Authentication segment recorded a significant revenue share in the automotive artificial intelligence market in 2021. Authentication is the procedure of confirming the identity of a known user in order to grant access to an account, location or device. In addition, authentication of identity is employed when a person’s authenticity must be demonstrated. In this situation, previous personal information provided is compared.



Process Outlook



Based on Process, the automotive artificial intelligence market is classified into Signal Recognition, Image Recognition and Data Mining. Signal Recognition segment garnered the maximum revenue share in the automotive artificial intelligence market in 2021. Signal recognition is a technique for producing outcomes using spoken, visual patterns, and sound. The signals often relate to the speech or sound produced by a machine or a person, which may be identified by natural language processing (NLP) devices and used to provide a result. Signals are the unprocessed data that AI systems must be able to analyze in order to generate, comprehend, and make intelligent judgments.



Technology Outlook



By technology, the automotive artificial intelligence market is segmented into Deep Learning, Machine Learning & Computer Vision, Context- aware Computing, and Natural Language Processing. Machine Learning & Computer Vision segment recorded a significant revenue share in the automotive artificial intelligence market in 2021. Machine learning enables automobiles to assess and learn from various driving scenarios, therefore reducing accidents and making them safer and more fuel-efficient. It can generate precise models that could direct future activities and instantly uncover trends at a scale that was not before possible.



Offering Outlook



On the basis of offering, the automotive artificial intelligence market is bifurcated into Hardware and Software.

Not only are they regularly working weekends, but they are also doing upwards of 12-hour days, shooting every genre of photography you can think of. They have mothers of the bride and groom to charm and bridezillas to soothe. But their work isn’t done when the honeymoon is over. No, now they have literally thousands of images to trawl through and cull, and that’s even before retouching begins.

So that’s where some clever software and AI can really step in to help. AfterShoot does exactly that. It uses artificial intelligence to sort through your batches of images and cull all the bad ones leaving you with a perfectly edited batch ready to retouch in the blink of an eye.

So how does it work? It uses AI to automatically cull entire galleries by detecting any less-than-desirable images. It will edit out anything out of focus, blurry photos, duplicates, and closed eyes. It will also clump together anything that it detects are duplicates. It will also rate what it thinks are the best images based on emotion and facial expressions.

But rest assured that it doesn’t actually delete anything and you can always go back and fine-tune the settings. For the duplicate images you can manually select your favourite should you wish to override the AI. You can also choose to make the parameters more or less strict, and zoom into faces to compare quickly.

Another interesting feature is that AfterShoot can also use the image metadata to select the images. And because it uses machine learning, it will gradually learn your likes and dislikes the more that you use it.

“AfterShoot was born around saving photographers time,” says marketing director Mark Allen. The founder was apparently watching his photographer uncle cull and edit images after shooting a wedding. He thought that he could probably design some software to speed up the workflow, and AfterShoot was born.

It really is quick as well. The software started with 500 images and culled them down to just 165 in only three minutes. I couldn’t even get up and make a cup of tea in that time. There’s no doubt that if you shoot large batches of images, this program could really save you a lot of time.

The company are also releasing an editing component as well. The beta test will be released to a list over the next few weeks with the full subscription-based version set to come out in the first half of 2023.

The editing part of AfterShoot will include AI editing of exposure, white balance and HSL sliders, vibrance, saturation, highlights, shadows, tone curves and more.

After you’ve made all of your selections you can simply export seamlessly to Capture One or Lightroom. I don’t know about you, but if I shot weddings and could speed up my workflow this much, it would probably be worth the monthly subscription.

Pricing starts at $14.99 per month or $10 a month if paid annually.",artificial intelligence,diyphotography
93,Robotics prowess is a sign of strength,https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/10/12/11/robot-1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,17/10/2022,"Robotics technology has grown rapidly in recent years, integrating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5G",https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/china-daily/robotics-automation-ai-industry-b2201055.html,"Robotics technology has grown rapidly in recent years, integrating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5G. It is also boosting new products and new applications that can promote global economic development and people’s well-being.

The 2022 China Robotics Industry Development Report, published in August by the Chinese Institute of Electronics, estimates that the global robotics market will be worth $51.3 billion (£45.3 billion) this year, with an average annual growth rate of 14 per cent from 2017 to 2022. The value of the global robotics market is forecast to exceed $65 billion (£57.5 billion) by 2024.

“The robotics industry is an important symbol of a country’s technological strength and level of high-end manufacturing,” Jin Zhuanglong, China’s minister of industry and information technology, told the World Robot Conference in Beijing in August, 2022.

Combined with emerging technologies such as AI, 5G and new biological materials, the robotics industry is entering a key period of strategic opportunity for development and upgrading, Jin said.

Robots, an important tool to promote digital transformation and boost the digital economy, are accelerating their integration into production and people’s daily lives, said Wang Hong, deputy director of the first equipment industry department of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, adding that the industry has shown great development potential.

China has formed what is basically a whole industry chain ranging from robot parts to robot applications, Wang said.

A Siasun technician inspects robots at a workshop in Shenyang, Liaoning province, in April 2022 (PAN YULONG/ XINHUA)

“In the first half of the year, while the development of the robotics industry slowed due to COVID-19, it has gradually picked up pace.”

China’s industrial robot industry produced a record 366,000 robots in 2021, 67.9 per cent more than in 2020. The output of service robots rose 48.9 per cent to 9.21 million last year.

The institute’s report forecasts that China’s robotics market will continue to boom this year. The market is forecast to be worth $17.4 billion (£15.4 billion) in 2022, growing 22 per cent a year on average.

The production of industrial robots, buoyed by a series of supportive policies and the rapid development of emerging technologies, is growing quickly and has played a key role in boosting the industry’s advancement.

Many Chinese industrial robot companies are enjoying a revival in demand for their products, as customers such as new energy industry players have stepped up their production amid better containment of the pandemic.

The new energy industry is at a breakout point for the growth of robot applications, said Zhang Lei, vice-president of Siasun Robot &Automation Co, one of China’s largest robotics companies.

There has been rising demand in China for industrial and mobile robots from new energy’s rapid development, and Siasun has been taking part in the process, Zhang said.

“Our mobile robots have been widely used in manufacturing plants of major new energy companies.”

Milton Guerry, former president of the International Federation of Robotics, said: “China is by far the biggest robot market in the world in terms of annual sales and operational stock.” The federation is a professional, non-profit organisation based in Germany.

The federation’s figures on robot density, based on the number of industrial robots per 10,000 employees, are a useful indicator of China’s dynamic development, Guerry said.

China’s robot density in the manufacturing industry ranks ninth globally with 246 industrial robots per 10,000 employees, whereas five years ago it was 25th globally with 49 robots per 10,000 employees, the federation says.

Chen Yu, a partner with the Chinese venture capital firm Yunqi Partners, said he has seen high demand for robots in labour-intensive industries and industries that potentially put employees at high risk.

“Few people like to work in those industries. Also, robots have big advantages over people in terms of standardisation, safety and intelligence.”

In addition, AI provides efficient digital technology useful to all industries as the digital economy becomes more important. The sensors of intelligent robots can examine the environment and collect data, process the information and make decisions through logical analysis and understanding, and then react to situations and complete tasks, Chen said.

As a hybrid offline and online war wages on in Ukraine, Viktor Zhora, who leads the country's cybersecurity agency, has had a front-row seat of it all.…",https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/22/ukraine_cybersecurity_chief_mwise/,"As a hybrid offline and online war wages on in Ukraine, Viktor Zhora, who leads the country's cybersecurity agency, has had a front-row seat of it all.

Zhora is the deputy chairman and chief digital transformation officer at Ukraine's state service of special communication and information protection.

Cyber aggression from neighboring Russia is nothing new, he said during a video keynote at Mandiant's mWISE event this week. It's been ongoing since at least Moscow annexing Crimea in 2014, leading up to the NotPetya ransomware outbreak in 2017, and all of this helped prepare Ukraine and its networks for the series of data wiping malware and denial of service attacks that started in January of this year. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine the following month.

""We took a lot of lessons from cyber aggression for the last eight years,"" Zhora said. ""And I think that is one of the reasons why the adversary hasn't reached its strategic goals in the cyber war against Ukraine.""

But while Ukraine hasn't experienced the level of destructive cyberattacks against critical infrastructure targets that international cybersecurity agencies have been warning about since the war began, Russia has won the disinformation battle — at least within its own borders, according to Zhora. One only has to watch some mainstream Russian TV to see Putin's pro-war, anti-West, anti-Ukraine propaganda in overdrive, which runs alongside the Kremlin's online disinformation tactics.

""This is a very dangerous activity, fighting for the minds of people, and this is the game in which Russia won on their territory,"" Zhora said, about the Russian information operations that have accompanied the invading army.

These Kremlin-pushed false narratives ran the gamut from accusing Ukrainian ""Nazis"" of being the aggressors and committing war crimes in this conflict to downplaying the effect of Western nations' sanctions against Russia. State-controlled news outlets, social media networks, and GRU-run Telegram channels amplify pro-Kremlin brainwashing.

The real info wars

They aimed to demoralize Ukrainian troops — eg, the President Zelenskyy dies by suicide fake news — as well as alienate the invaded nation's allies and bolster Russian citizens' support for the occupation. Programming Russian citizens at least worked, though Putin's mobilization of citizens may dent that.

Of course, Russia isn't the only country adept at information operations. China, Iran and even the US and UK are quite good at it, too. And Russian citizens aren't the only ones who swallow fake news. Case in point: the Big Lie that Donald Trump won the 2020 US presidential election, which is now being spread by hundreds of candidates running for elected offices in the upcoming US midterm elections.

A recent Pew Research survey of 24,525 people from 19 countries ranked the spread of false information online as their second-biggest worry with 70 percent of those surveyed saying it represents a ""major threat"" to their country.

""This same way of attacking humans' brains is used in other countries,"" Zhora said. And as such, it requires a coordinated, cross-border effort to thwart, much like the more typically destructive forms of cyberattacks, he added.

""Completely new approaches should be developed to prevent the influence of this propaganda, to prevent subversion in our partner countries and our allies,"" Zhora said. ""Cybersecurity is a joint effort, and countering propaganda and disinformation also [requires] joint policy and global policy.""

How to defend against attacks on confidence?

With other types of cyberthreats, such as ransomware, data-wiping malware, and DDoS floods, the cost to business is typically top of mind. But even these these types of threats have another cost, similar to influence operations, in that they can shake citizens' trust in infrastructure and institutions.

US National Cyber Director Chris Inglis touched on this during his mWISE keynote address, and said he's seen ""attacks on confidence"" escalate over the past five to 10 years.

""Think about the Colonial Pipeline attack, where, of course, it was an attack on an undefended virtual private network,"" Inglis said.

In this May 2021 intrusion, Russia's DarkSide group broke into Colonial's IT system, prompting the company to shut down all of its pipeline operations before the criminals accessed that part of the business. And this fed into an East Coast fuel shortage when the pipeline remained out of service for five days, prompting fights at US gas stations.

""At the end of the day, it was really an attack on confidence,"" Inglis said. ""Millions of people up and down the Eastern seaboard went to the darkest possible corner thinking that just like a hurricane sweeping the white bread off the store shelves, that they needed to flood the gas stations and essentially extract petroleum from that pipeline.""

""If you're the attacker, you might have been after data and systems, you might have been after the money that you could get by holding a critical function at risk,"" he continued. ""But you couldn't have missed that you succeeded in an attack on confidence.""

While the government and private infosec professionals need to defend data, IT systems, and critical infrastructure that relies on digital systems against cyberthreats, they also need to defend against attacks on confidence, Inglis said. ""And perhaps that last one is the hardest one of all.""

Confidence is complicated because not many people have intricate knowledge of how, say, an energy grid works — or even how an electronic ballot machine works. It also requires the populace to trust those in government and industry defending these systems as well as having a plan in place to respond to emergencies.

Herein lies another lesson-learned from Ukraine, Inglis said. ""Do we have the confidence to say that we can actually hold our own, the way the Ukrainians have confidence in holding their own on an architecture that, by any stretch of the imagination, is not a perfect technical architecture. But they've done a masterful job of operating on top of it."" ®",cybersecurity,theregister.com

The vulnerability ""can cause Aptos nodes to crash and cause denial of service,"" Singapore-based Numen Cyber Labs said in a technical write-up published earlier this month.

Aptos is a new entrant to the blockchain space, which launched its mainnet on October 17, 2022. It has its roots in the Diem stablecoin payment system proposed by Meta (née Facebook), which also introduced a short-lived digital wallet called Novi.

The network is built using a platform-agnostic programming language known as Move, a Rust-based system that's designed to implement and execute smart contracts in a secure runtime environment, also known as the Move Virtual Machine (aka MoveVM).

The vulnerability identified by Numen Cyber Labs is rooted in the Move language's verification module (""stack_usage_verifier.rs""), a component that validates the bytecode instructions prior to its execution in MoveVM.

Specifically, it relates to an integer overflow vulnerability in the stack-based Web3 programming language that could result in undefined behavior and therefore crashes.

""Since this vulnerability occurs in the Move execution module, for nodes on the chain, if the bytecode code is executed, it will cause a [Denial-of-Service] attack,"" the cybersecurity firm explained.

""In severe cases, the Aptos network can be completely stopped, which will cause incalculable damage, and have a serious impact on the stability of the node.""",cybersecurity,internet

Read more about this high growth stock.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4548251-fortinet-stock-market-puking,"Fortinet, Inc. Just_Super/E+ via Getty Images Fortinet

The cybersecurity business we review in this report (Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT)) is attractive for a variety of reasons, including its high growth, large total addressable market and attractive valuation. In particular, the shares have sold off hard as the low-interest-rate bubble has burst, but unlike other ""pandemic darlings"" this one is actually very profitable and generates powerful cash flow (therefore it won't face the same growth-capital-raising challenges as others that will be paralyzed by higher borrowing rates, lower stock prices for new share issuances, and a slowed economy). Its valuation multiple has been crushed, but its business and earnings keep growing-and likely will for many years to come.

Fortinet: Overview

Fortinet is a cybersecurity stock. The company describes itself as ""Broad. Integrated. Automated."" More specifically, ""the Fortinet Security Fabric brings together the concepts of convergence and consolidation to provide comprehensive cybersecurity protection for all users, devices, and applications and across all network edges."" And over 580,000+ customers currently trust Fortinet with their cybersecurity solutions.

Fortinet Investor Presentation

By the Numbers

And to put Fortinet in perspective versus other high-growth businesses, here is a look at a variety of critical metrics on high-growth businesses (those with at least 20% expected revenue growth, this year and next) sorted by market cap.

Stock Rover Stock Rover

(CRWD) (NET) (PANW) (OKTA)

As you can see, Fortinet is one of the few names on the list that has high growth AND positive free cash flow yield, very strong margins, a low cost of debt and very reasonable valuation metrics (price-to-sales and forward price-to-earnings) relative to its very strong growth rate.

YCharts

Less Susceptible to Capital Market Challenges

Fortinet has been around since 2000 (founded by current chairman and CEO Ken Xie) and unlike a lot of other high-growth stocks, it is not at the mercy of the capital markets to fund its ongoing growth. For example, many high-growth companies were simply issuing more shares in 2021 to raise more capital for growth. This worked out great while their stock prices were high (i.e. they could raise a lot more money easily), but now that top growth stock prices are down 40%, 50%, 70% and more (see table above) it's not so easy to raise capital.

Compounding the lower share price issue, is higher interest rates. Before, companies could issue debt at very low interest rates, but now interest rates are higher-thereby making it a lot more expensive to raise capital for growth.

Further still, the economy has slowed (we could be entering an ugly recession) and this simply adds to the challenges other high growth stocks face.

On the other hand, Fortinet has a strong investment grade credit rating (BBB+ and Baa1), and it is already cash flow positive (others are still simply burning cash to fund growth) and Fortinet is profitable (something many high-growth stocks simply are not). In fact, Fortinet has been profitable and free cash flow positive every year since its IPO in 2009 (impressive!). And this combination of positive factors bodes extremely well for Fortinet considering the capital markets are now significantly more challenging, not to mention Fortinet's future growth opportunities are great.

High Growth, Strong ""Moat"" Business

Fortinet's business is attractive because it has strong growth potential, as measured by its large TAM (total addressable market) and its powerful moat. For starters here is a look at the company's estimates of the TAM-which remains very large and growing (a good thing!).

Fortinet Investors Presentation

Further, Fortinet is a strong ""moat"" business, meaning it has attractive and sustainable competitive advantages. For example, unlike other cybersecurity solutions, Fortinet uses a platform approach. And it is this platform approach that creates its moat because it creates a network effect and high switching costs for customers. As per the company's investor presentation:

""Cybersecurity has traditionally been deployed one solution at a time and was not designed to work well with other deployed solutions while increasing management complexity. A platform approach consolidates point products into a cybersecurity platform, allowing for much tighter integration, increased automation, and a more rapid, coordinated, and effective response to threats across the network.""

Further still, Fortinet ranks highly among a variety of industry products and solutions, including multiple high ""magic quadrant"" positions.

Fortinet Investor Presentation Fortinet Investor Presentation

Risks

Fortinet does face a variety of risks, including the potential for an ongoing economic slowdown (recession) which would negatively impact virtually all business, including Fortinet. However, Founder, Chairman and CEO, Ken Xie, noted on the latest quarterly earnings call that the macroeconomic slowdown has actually created opportunities for Fortinet in hiring as competing for top cybersecurity talent has become easier (as competitors have hiring freezes and slowdowns-cybersecurity remains in high demand from clients). Specifically ""agreed hiring is relatively a little bit easier compared to like a few quarters ago, especially in the cybersecurity space.""

Another risk is Fortinet's growing effort to expand beyond its traditional ""small and mid-sized business"" clients and into enterprise level clients. Large enterprise customers currently make up 40% of Fortinet's business, representing a growing number.

Fortinet Investor Presentation

However, as Fortinet continues its enterprise-level efforts, competitors could step up the competition thereby making it more difficult for Fortinet to grow at its expected rate.

Conclusion

Fortinet stands out among high-growth stocks that have recently sold off hard because it has the business strategy and financial wherewithal to keep thriving for years to come, while other high growth stocks will likely be increasingly challenged. We currently own shares of Fortinet in our Disciplined Growth Portfolio, and we selected it as one of the top ideas in our new report: When The Market Pukes: Buy These 4 Stocks in Buckets.

If you are looking for a powerful growth stock currently trading at a compelling low price (i.e. the shares have lots of long-term upside) Fortinet is absolutely worth considering for a spot in your prudently concentrated long-term portfolio.",cybersecurity,seeking alpha

This collaboration is a direct actionable response to the Department of Education/Federal Student Aid (FSA) guidance promulgated on December 18, 2020 for colleges and universities to comply with National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) 800 171 R2 requirements which set safeguards for protecting sensitive information transmitted online.

The cybersecurity solutions and expansion of the implementation team are available at no cost to participating HBCUs due to the generosity of Cisco, whose initial financial support of $150 million was announced in May 2021.

Through this partnership, each MBE will play a critical role in accelerating the analysis of current security posture, preparing a gap analysis report, defining the bill of materials necessary to mitigate gaps, ordering and delivering required technical solutions, and optimizing systems throughout the twelve months of maintenance of the delivered technical solutions.

“Over the last two years, we’ve made steady progress building scalable systems, processes, governance and technology, and establishing strategic partnerships to increase the resilience of our institutions and the global competitiveness of our students,” said Mark Brown, Executive Director of Student Freedom Initiative.

“We look forward to continuing to grow the number of participating institutions and adding other strategic partners committed to long-term, strategic partnerships with all Minority Serving Institutions to reduce the wealth gap through the lens of education.”, Brown continued.

“When we think about HBCUs, aging infrastructure, and the need to be cybersecurity-compliant in our Cisco systems, we have the services and the products that can assist HBCUs,” said Saidah Grayson Dill, Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of Cisco.

“We are leveraging our resources to help HBCUs protect against cyber threats while simultaneously helping to build the diverse IT workforce of the future.”, Grayson Dill continued.

“Working with the Student Freedom Initiative gives us the perfect opportunity to put our commitment to social justice in action by supporting technological efforts for HBCUs in retention, enrollment, and attainment of students,” said Damian Young, Founder and CEO of Procellis Technology.

“It’s been gratifying to see tangible improvements in the overall well-being of the HBCUs we’ve worked with, and we look forward to supporting SFI as we continue our relationship.”, Young added.

“Sology Solutions is proud to work with Student Freedom Initiative who has a shared vision to close the digital equity gap through the provision of broadband, training, and economic development,” said Ed Christmas, Founder and Managing Principal of Sology Solutions.

“Our work to drive technological excellence and IT modernization at HBCUs will have a direct impact and bring about real change in underserved communities.”, Christmas continued.

“It is an honor to partner with Student Freedom Initiative to ensure HBCUs and their students have a secure and compliant cybersecurity solution that will allow the universities to focus on expanding enrollment, both in person as well as remotely, and increase their capacity for teaching and research,” said Milton Moore, Founder and CEO of IPC Consulting.

“HBCU students deserve the best education and the best technology, and we are thrilled to assist in that mission.”, Moore concluded.

In direct support of Student Freedom Initiative’s vision to reduce the wealth gap through the lens of education, Cisco has also expanded its philanthropy by providing access to the Cisco Networking Academy and Talent Bridge.

Students participating in these offerings will have the opportunity to obtain professional certifications in cybersecurity and job placement support. It is estimated there will be a 33% growth in cybersecurity-related jobs through 2030, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and an average salary of $79,000 for those with relevant security certifications.

Cisco Networking Academy is celebrating its 25th anniversary and continues to be one of the longest-standing IT skills-to-jobs programs in the world. The program provides IT and cybersecurity courses, simulation software, and hands-on practice opportunities via a learning platform to support instructors and engage learners in 190 countries.

To date, over 17.5 million global learners have taken Cisco Networking Academy courses to gain digital skills, and 95% of students that have taken Cisco certification aligned courses have attributed obtaining a job or education opportunity to Cisco Networking Academy.

Cisco’s Network Academy certifications are an investment of time and resources for HBCU students and staff. IT certifications can differentiate HBCU students from other professionals in their career field, which is particularly important in today’s competitive marketplace.

Statistics captured in 2021 show how individuals with certifications report salaries that are higher than those who are not certified.",cybersecurity,help net security

109,Nasdaq Bear Market: 5 Terrific Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying on the Dip,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/705111/bear-market-stocks-plunge-crash-invest-correction-getty.jpg,22/10/2022,These bargain-priced growth stocks are ripe for the picking with the Nasdaq Composite plunging by as much as 38%.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/22/nasdaq-bear-market-5-growth-stocks-regret-not-buy/,"There's a very good chance that when 2022 comes to a close, it'll be remembered as one of the most difficult years in history for professional and everyday investors. The first half of the year saw the benchmark S&P 500 produce its worst return since 1970. The S&P 500 is often viewed as the best barometer of U.S. stock market health.

But things have been markedly worse for the tech-driven Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which has shed as much as 38% of its value since hitting an all-time intraday high in November 2021. Although all three major U.S. indexes are entrenched in a bear market, the Nasdaq's plunge really stands out.

However, trouble on Wall Street often begets opportunity. With the exception of the current drawdown in the major indexes, all previous double-digit percentage declines were eventually erased by a bull market rally. This means the Nasdaq bear market plunge is the ideal chance for patient investors to put their money to work.

It's a particularly good time to consider buying growth stocks, which have a history of outperforming value stocks when the U.S. economy weakens. What follows are five terrific growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.

Mastercard

The first outstanding growth stock that long-term investors will regret not adding to their portfolio as the Nasdaq dips is payment processor Mastercard (MA -4.01%). Despite the growing likelihood of a U.S. recession, Mastercard is well positioned to deliver for its patient shareholders.

While it might sound counterintuitive, being cyclical is actually a great thing for Mastercard. Even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, the economy spends a disproportionately longer amount of time expanding. Mastercard benefits from consumer and enterprise spending growing in lockstep with the U.S. and global economy over time.

Something else that makes Mastercard special is its lending avoidance. Like its main rival, Visa, Mastercard strictly sticks to processing payments. When recessions occur, lenders typically see loan delinquencies and charge-offs rise, which forces them to set aside capital to cover loan losses. Since the company doesn't lend, it doesn't have to worry about setting aside capital. This is a big reason Mastercard bounces back so quickly from economic downturns.

Investors also would be wise not to overlook its expansion potential. Globally, cash is still used in a large percentage of total transactions. This gives Mastercard a multidecade opportunity to expand its payment infrastructure into currently underbanked regions of the world.

PubMatic

For investors looking for something a bit more off-the-radar than one of the world's top payment processors, consider small-cap adtech stock PubMatic (PUBM -3.87%). While there's little question that advertising revenue is among the first things to be hit when the winds of recession begin swirling, PubMatic brings clearly defined competitive advantages to the table in the digital ad space.

The first thing investors should appreciate about this company is its positioning. It's a sell-side provider (SSP), which means it uses its programmatic ad software to help businesses sell their digital display space to advertisers. There's been a lot of consolidation in the SSP space, which leaves few choices for businesses other than PubMatic.

Advertising dollars are also shifting away from traditional print and billboards to digital platforms, such as mobile, video, and over-the-top channels. The digital ad industry is projected to grow by a compound annual rate of 14% through 2025. PubMatic has been crushing the industry's growth-rate forecast with an organic rate that has predominantly ranged between 20% and 50%.

But what really stands out about PubMatic is the company's internally designed and built cloud infrastructure. It could easily have relied on third parties, like some of its peers. But because it chose to build out its own cloud infrastructure, PubMatic can now enjoy higher margins than many of its peers as its revenue scales up.

Nio

A third terrific growth stock you'll regret not scooping up during the Nasdaq bear market dip is electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio (NIO -2.27%). Although automakers are facing a mountain of supply chain challenges and contending with historically high inflation, Nio's location and innovation should help drive big gains.

With most developed countries wanting to reduce their carbon emissions, the push to consumer and enterprise EVs represents a no-brainer growth opportunity. One of the reasons Nio is so intriguing is because it's based in China, which is the world's No. 1 auto market, and its EV industry is still relatively nascent. This gives a newcomer like Nio a reasonable shot to grab a significant piece of the pie for itself in the coming years.

Despite being founded less than eight years ago, Nio has impressive innovations. The company has aimed to introduce at least one new vehicle each year, and has brought over a half-dozen EV models to market. Nio's recently rolled-out sedans, the ET7 and ET5, are direct competitors to Tesla's flagship Model 3 sedan in China. With the top-tier battery pack upgrade, Nio's sedans can be driven significantly farther than the Model 3.

And as I've previously pointed out, Nio's innovation sets it apart. The battery-as-a-service (BaaS) subscription that was introduced in August 2020 offers buyers a discount on the purchase price of their EV, as well as the opportunity to charge, swap, and upgrade their batteries in the future. In return, Nio receives high-margin recurring revenue from BaaS, and the continued loyalty of early buyers.

Trulieve Cannabis

The fourth phenomenal growth stock that investors will be kicking themselves over if they don't buy it on the Nasdaq bear market plunge is marijuana stock Trulieve Cannabis (TCNNF -3.25%). Even though cannabis reforms have stalled on Capitol Hill, around three-quarters of all states have legalized weed in some capacity, creating plenty of opportunity for a multi-state operator (MSO) like Trulieve.

One of the unique aspects of Trulieve has been its method of expansion. Whereas most MSOs have been opening dispensaries and cultivation facilities in as many legalized states as possible, Trulieve almost exclusively focused on the medical-marijuana-legal Florida market until last year. As of Oct. 3, Trulieve operated 177 dispensaries in eight states, 120 of them in the Sunshine State.

Beside the fact that Florida is projected to be one of the nation's top-dollar weed markets by 2024, saturating the Sunshine State has a purpose. It has allowed Trulieve to keep its marketing costs down, which has resulted in 18 consecutive quarters of adjusted profitability. Most U.S. MSOs aren't yet profitable.

The other aspect of Trulieve Cannabis that makes it interesting is its acquisition of the MSO Harvest Health & Recreation, which it completed last year. This deal put Trulieve in the No. 1 position in the cannabis market in Arizona, where adult use is legal. With a successful operating blueprint in hand, Trulieve has another billion-dollar market it can dominate.

CrowdStrike Holdings

The fifth terrific growth stock you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip is cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD -7.81%). Though recessionary concerns are hitting virtually all premium-valued growth stocks, CrowdStrike has both macro and company-specific tailwinds working in its favor.

On a macro basis, the cybersecurity industry has evolved into a basic-need service. It doesn't matter how poorly the U.S. economy or stock market performs, there's always a need for security solutions to protect against robots and hackers trying to steal sensitive data. Services that are basic necessities often deliver predictable operating cash flow -- and Wall Street loves predictability.

What separates CrowdStrike -- a provider of end-user cybersecurity solutions -- from its competition is Falcon, the company's cloud-native platform. Falcon oversees around 1 trillion events daily and relies on artificial intelligence to grow more efficient at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time. Though CrowdStrike isn't the cheapest solution available, the fact that its gross retention rate is hovering around 98% suggests it's possibly the best solution for businesses.

What's more, businesses really seem to like CrowdStrike's services. Over the past five years, the percentage of customers that purchased four or more cloud-module subscriptions skyrocketed from less than 10% to more than 70%. Having existing clients buy additional services is a recipe for a future subscription gross margin of 80% (or higher).",cybersecurity,motley fool

Data breaches affected 188 million people in the United States in 2021, and that’s not even counting attacks by ransomware and other malware, like malicious documents. You need to do everything you can to protect yourself, because you will be targeted – in fact, if you’ve ever received a phishing email, you’ve been targeted already.

Staying cyber-safe is a matter of protecting your sensitive information with unique passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and comprehensive antivirus software. You need to safeguard your online activity by using a virtual private network. Protect your devices from theft, and stay vigilant, especially when you’re checking email or interacting with friends on social media.

Use Unique Passwords for Every Single Account

You absolutely can’t be reusing the same password for every one of your online accounts or even for multiple of your online accounts. If you do that, and hackers get ahold of one of your passwords – say, in a data breach – then all of your accounts will be compromised.

Instead, create unique and strong passwords for each and every one of your online accounts. The easiest way to do this is by using a password manager. A password manager can help you generate strong passwords that consist of random strings of letters, numbers, and special characters, and it will store them for you, too. You’ll be able to use just one set of login credentials to access your password manager, and then you’ll be able to copy and paste your secure passwords into your login accounts. Change your passwords every three months to make them harder for hackers to get hold of.

Activate Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a feature that creates extra security for login accounts because it requires you to submit extra information when you try to login to the account using your username and password. You’ll be asked to enter a passcode texted to your phone, for example, or click on a link in an email sent to an alternate address. MFA can help keep hackers out of your login accounts, even if they manage to get their hands on your passwords. And if you start getting weird messages asking you to verify your login for something, you’ll know that someone is actively trying to hack into that account.

Use a Paid Antivirus Suite

If you can’t afford to pay for an antivirus program, a free program is better than nothing. But a paid program offers more features and, usually, a better user experience, as well as better customer service. Use a premium internet security suite to protect your online activity. It’s worth it to get features like spam filters to protect you from phishing scams, ransomware and malware protection, parental content controls, VPN protection, extra privacy for financial transactions and social media use, and password management all rolled into one software suite.

Keep Your Software Up to Date

If you care about your privacy online, it’s vital that you keep your operating system (OS) software up to date, and keep your browsers and other apps updated, too. Software updates typically include patches for security flaws that developers have discovered, so not installing them is leaving yourself vulnerable to malware, ransomware, and viruses. Software updates can improve your system performance, too.

Install a VPN

If you use public wifi networks at all, you need a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN encrypts your online activity so that hackers can’t spy on you using packet sniffers. It creates a safe tunnel for your data to travel through, so that your banking information, credit card numbers, emails, and social media remain private and secure.

Protect Your Devices from Theft

Physical theft of your devices is as much a threat as digital theft of your information. Keep your laptop, tablet, and smartphone password-locked so that if someone steals it, they can’t just immediately get access to all of your data. If you’re using your device in a public place, keep an eye on it – don’t leave your laptop unattended to go to the coffee shop bathroom.

Stay Vigilant Online

All the VPNs, antivirus programs, and password managers in the world can’t protect you from yourself. You need to keep your guard up online and your wits about you. If you’re on social media and someone messages you saying they’re in trouble and need you to send money fast, don’t panic and open up Venmo. Contact the person by another means and you’ll probably find that you’ve been targeted by scammers. Be careful of phishing emails and social engineering attacks. They’re getting more common and more sophisticated, and it only takes a brief lapse in judgment or moment of weakness to fall victim to one.

As cybercriminals get more sophisticated and more skilled, you need to be even more on your guard when you go online. Stay safe as you use the internet, and avoid losing time, money, and peace of mind to a cybercriminal.

By ROD McGUIRK

Australia on Saturday proposed tougher penalties for companies that fail to protect customers’ personal data after two major cybersecurity breaches left millions vulnerable to criminals.

The penalties for serious breaches of the Privacy Act would increase from 2.2 million Australian dollars ($1.4 million) now to AU$50 million ($32 million) under amendments to be introduced to Parliament next week, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said.

A company could also be fined the value of 30% of its revenues over a defined period if that amount exceeded AU$50 million ($32 million).

Dreyfus said “big companies could face penalties up to hundreds of millions of dollars” under the new law.

“It is a very, very substantial increase in the penalties,” Dreyfus told reporters.

“It’s designed to make companies think. It’s designed to be a deterrent so that companies will protect the data of Australians,” he added.

Parliament resumes on Tuesday for the first time since mid-September.

Since Parliament last sat, unknown hackers stole personal data from 9.8 million customers of Optus, Australia’s second-largest wireless telecommunications carrier. The theft has left more than one-third of Australia’s population at heightened risk of identity theft and fraud.

Unknown cybercriminals last week demanded ransom from Australia’s largest health insurer, Medibank, after claiming to have stolen 200 gigabytes of customers’ data including medical diagnoses and treatments. Medibank has 3.7 million customers. The company said the hackers had proved they hold the personal records of at least 100.

The thieves have reportedly threatened to make public medical conditions of high-profile Medibank customers.

Dreyfus said both breaches had shown “existing safeguards are inadequate.”

As well as failing to protect personal information, the government is concerned that companies are unnecessarily holding too much customer data for too long in the hope of monetizing that information.

“We need to make sure that when a data breach occurs the penalty is large enough, that it’s a really serious penalty on the company and can’t just be disregarded or ignored or just paid as a part of a cost of doing business,” Dreyfus said.

Dreyfus hopes the proposed amendments will become law in the final four weeks that Parliament will sit this year.

Any new penalties will not be retroactive and will not effect Optus or Medibank.

Analyst Dan Ives noted that checks for the September quarter were ""strong"" as deal flow continued to hold up despite the uncertain macro economy.

""We believe federal deal flow in [the third-quarter] was a clear standout as more government agencies are laser focused on protecting data, endpoints, [and] infrastructure in an increasing dangerous cyber environment with threats increasing by the day,"" Ives wrote in a note to clients. Ives has an outperform rating and a $200-a-share price target on Palo Alto Networks (PANW) after the company recently enacted a three-for-one stock split.

Ives added that there appears to be more of a focus on moving to zero-trust architecture, which is likely to ""disproportionately"" benefit companies such as Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) and Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) amid increased federal spending and the continued push to the cloud.

Ives added that federal cyber security tracking for 2022 looks to be up between 20% and 25% from 2021, and 2023 is expected to be more of the same, especially in light of ""high profile"" attacks that appear to be accelerating.

""Overall quarter-end checks were particularly solid for the likes of Tenable (TENB), Fortinet (FTNT), CyberArk (CYBR), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Zscaler (ZS) as deal activity for each of these vendors appeared to track ahead of our expectations in the field despite the negative market noise being baked into these names,"" Ives explained.

In addition, Ives noted that Check Point Software (CHKP) likely had a ""relatively firm"" third-quarter, despite a softer spending environment in Europe as its deal pipeline going into the fourth-quarter was ""solid.""

With Russia continuing with its war on Ukraine on all fronts, including cyber attacks, more employees continuing to work from home and the recent Russian and Chinese-linked propaganda networks that were taken down by Meta Platforms (META), the outlook for cybersecurity spending has never been higher, Ives said.

Specifically, areas such as identity threat detection, privileged access management, endpoint and vulnerability security and the continued shift to zero-trust software are likely to see further momentum.

Despite the optimism surrounding the quarter, not everything is looking postitve, Ives admitted. Aside from the aforementioned issues in Europe, there are all signs that small and medium-sized businesses are slowing cybersecurity deals, as ongoing economic weakness hits companies differently.

Nonetheless, Ives noted that the strength in the U.S. is ""more than enough"" to make up for any weakness in other areas, especially with most security companies ahead of their own targets between 3% and 5% as of the third-quarter, despite the ongoing global uncertainties.

Last month, it was reported that Palo Alto Networks (PANW) was nearing a deal to acquire Israeli cybersecurity startup Apiiro for approximately $600M.",cybersecurity,seeking alpha

They were wrong, she says. This is what really happened…",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/22/chelsea-manning-leaked-military-documents-free-world-prison,"Chelsea Manning’s memoir opens like a Jason Bourne novel with a scene in which the then 22-year-old, on the last day of two weeks’ military leave, tries to leak an enormous amount of classified data via a sketchy wifi connection in a Barnes & Noble in Maryland. Outside, a snowstorm rages. Inside, Manning, a junior intelligence analyst for the US army, freaks out as the clock ticks down. In 12 hours, her flight leaves for Iraq. Meanwhile she has half a million incident reports on US military activity to upload from a memory stick to an obscure website called WikiLeaks. The military would later argue she didn’t have the clearance even to access these files – “exceeded authorised” as Manning puts it, in army parlance – but the fact is, she says, “It was encouraged. I was told, ‘Go look!’ The way you do analysis is you collect a shit-ton of data, a huge amount, in order to do the work on it.”

Everything about Manning on that afternoon of 8 February 2010 – her name, her gender, her anonymity, her freedom – is provisional and shortly to change. Three months later, she’ll be in a cage in Kuwait. Three years after that, she’ll be starting a 35-year prison sentence at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Meanwhile, the wider consequences of her actions that day will, depending on your view, topple governments; endanger lives; protect lives; uphold democracy; compromise global diplomacy; change the world in no measurable way whatsoever; or – Manning’s least favourite interpretation – boil down to a cry for help from a troubled young transperson seeking the care she required. Today, sitting across the table from me in an office in Brooklyn, Manning is tiny, fierce, dressed all in black with long blond hair, and vibrating with enough nervous energy to power the lights. “Are we recording?” she says as her eyes skim the room. For the space of our 90-minute encounter, she will seem only partially present, each question yanking her back to some unseen site of contest where she must defend herself against endless and wide-ranging charges.

The memoir is called README.txt, a misleadingly clunky title (it refers to the file name she used for the leaks) for a highly entertaining book that, while telling the story of why and how Manning leaked the data, gives equal space to her origins in Oklahoma, a complex and traumatic family story creating the conditions for all her subsequent decisions. It’s a terrific read, full of unexpected turns and details that counter many of the assumptions made about Manning at the time. In the wake of her arrest, she was characterised by the US government as, variously, a nihilist, an anarchist, an idealist and an ideologue. Three days into her trial in 2013, Edward Snowden leaked classified National Security Agency (NSA) documents revealing how the US government spied on its own citizens, something, Manning notes drily in the book, that only damaged her image further. “I support Ed generally, but on a personal level, the timing was difficult for me,” she writes. Snowden emerged as the grownup, the credible whistleblower to Manning’s loose cannon, “hero” to her “bad leaker”. Compared with Snowden, Manning was young, inexperienced and, because she was in prison, unable to defend herself in interviews. When, at the end of the trial, a photo surfaced of Manning wearing a blond wig and eye makeup, it delivered to her critics a further made-for-TV narrative: she had a secret she couldn’t tell, so she told a nation’s secrets.

People said, oh, this is because you're trans. No, it’s because I was a data scientist who had way too much information

Manning, now 34, snorts mirthlessly at this interpretation. “People tried to say, ‘Oh, this all happened because you were trans.’ It’s like, no; it’s because I was a data scientist who had way too much information and was actually trying to do my job, and realised that continuing on like this is not sustainable. We can’t keep doing the same thing and expecting different results.”

She is talking about the raw data it was her job to harvest and analyse in Iraq, and that, within weeks of arrival, she came to feel was being dishonestly reported to the American people by the military. Manning speaks quickly, in a way that seems linked both to her talent for processing large amounts of complex information and to a more basic need to scuttle past black spots of memory. She was in prison for seven years before President Obama commuted her sentence in 2017, a chunk of that time spent in Quantico military prison, in solitary confinement. She tried to kill herself twice during that jail term and a third time, in 2019, when she returned to prison, this time for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating Julian Assange. That refusal was an incredible piece of self-sacrifice, blowing a final hole in the idea that she was driven by mental turbulence, not principle. “I’m very frustrated by that even to this day,” she says, adding that there are a number of diagnoses on her Wikipedia page that are misidentified PTSD. “Gender dysphoria’s not on the radar any more; it’s been treated, or some would go so far as to say ‘cured’. All the other diagnoses were just untreated, unidentified, complex post traumatic stress syndrome. That is my sole diagnosis.”

Manning wrote the book to restore a sense of nuance to a story that, over the years, she feels has been seized on by one pressure group or another seeking to use her to fortify their cause. It has left her with a tendency to find a hidden agenda in even the blandest statement, which gives rise to occasionally comic misunderstandings. When I say the book is very good, she looks concerned and says, “I’ve spoken a lot about commodification in the digital age, and everything’s a product now, and everything has to be sponsored, from people on TikTok and Instagram, to the entirety of society where it feels like every single interaction you have has a monetary transaction or value to it.”

There’s a short pause. No, I – I just meant that I thought it was a good read. Entertaining. Manning looks fleetingly blank. “OK.”

The irony of making journalists sign NDAs to read the manuscript (it is watermarked on every page to discourage leaks) isn’t lost on her. She gives a whaddya-gonna-do shrug. “Ownership of something you can copy still seems absurd to me, especially in the NFT era. My publisher’s not happy with me for saying that. Which I understand. But I do find it a little silly.”

It is hard to imagine what Manning’s life consists of these days. Before the pandemic, she was doing speaking events mainly at the invitation of students, but lockdown put paid to that. She has some consulting gigs with tech and security firms, “on the AI side – nuanced and complex opinions on crypto-applications and post-crypto currency,” she says. She lives alone, in Brooklyn, where her social life revolves around the music scene – she has always been a big music person; as a teenager, Napster was her gateway to online culture.

Last August, she popped up as a guest DJ at Elsewhere, a huge club in Brooklyn where she wore light-up cat ears and played a set including Britney Spears remixes and the theme from Succession. She has, perhaps, the worst form of celebrity, one that guarantees intrusion and wild gossip – earlier this year, she was rumoured to be dating Canadian musician (and Elon Musk’s ex) Grimes, something she won’t dignify with comment – but one that doesn’t deliver any perks or income. “I’m not an actor or a movie star,” she says. “Even YouTubers make more money than me.”

Still, two years after her release from Fort Leavenworth, she had won some kind of equilibrium and was starting to rebuild a life. All that ended in 2019, when she was subpoenaed to testify in front of a grand jury about her interactions with Assange. She refused, and was sent back to prison. Given everything she’d been through, this was, surely, a very difficult decision to make? Manning looks indignant to the point of outrage. “Not hard at all.”

I’m amazed, I say, not least because in the book, she appears to be no fan of Assange’s, characterising his faction within WikiLeaks as the less “responsible” of the original cohort of hackers. (She won’t be drawn on her personal dealings with Assange, nor on the legal fight he currently faces.) “No,” she says. “The grand jury process is a screwed-up process and regardless of whether it’s activists on the frontline or if it’s journalists, I’m not going to participate in that.”

But the cost to you personally –

“Oh, when you’ve already spent seven years in prison, 18 months is just ... ”

She fades out. Surely, I suggest, having already served time makes the prospect of a return to jail even worse, particularly in light of your PTSD? “No. I – ” Her voice trembles and her eyes fill with tears. “OK, I’m going to get real intense here.” Manning’s voice lowers, loudens and becomes very harsh, as if she is forcing out an unbearable truth. “I struggle every day with the world out here,” she says. There is a long pause. “I have a lot of trouble with this world, this so-called free world, compared with the life that I had in prison.”

Why? “I struggle with the fact that ... I don’t know what tomorrow brings out here. I feel less supported than I did in both the military and in prison. In prison I know that I have housing; I know that I have healthcare; I know that I have food. I don’t feel as secure here. And people are so detached. There is no community. People don’t talk to each other. People don’t say hi to you. People are suspicious of each other.” Her voice rises to a peak. “There’s more community in a prison than there is out here! And that says a lot about how fucked-up our world is right now. I struggle with it every day.”

Manning was released from a detention centre in Virginia in March 2020, a year after she was imprisoned, when the grand jury’s investigation expired and her testimony was no longer required. To have that much fight in her, to remain true to her principles in the face of such cost, is admirable to the point of baffling. It stems from optimism, she says, and I believe her. “I know that community is possible, because I’ve seen it, and I’ve seen it in the worst places that you can possibly imagine. Whenever humanity is pushed to the edge, I see the best, so I know it’s there.”

If there is a strand unifying all the contrasts that have governed Chelsea Manning’s life, it is her dislike – consistent and to the point of perversity – of orthodoxies of any kind. She won’t be owned by a single group, no matter how sympathetic to her cause. During her trial, the old lefties and free-speech campaigners who turned up to support her pissed her off when they disrupted the courtroom and annoyed the judge. In the book, she calls out elements of the radical transparency crowd at WikiLeaks, including Assange, for being “troll-y” and “nihilist”. She breaks rank with elements of the trans community – at the time of her arrest, she was still living as a gay man – by deadnaming herself in the memoir. There is, she believes, too much emphasis placed on identity at the expense of other considerations. “That’s not how I think. I have things that I care about, I have positions that I hold, and I feel like especially in the online era, you find an identity and you fit your beliefs to your identity, which is not how I work at all.”

The fact is, she writes, she didn’t join the military to advance an ideological agenda, or to help the enemy, or to cause chaos for its own sake. She joined for the reasons so many people do: because she was lost, unemployed, directionless and wanted to impress her father, a US navy veteran who she claims bullied her relentlessly as a child for being a “sissy”. “Essentially: trying to get my father to respect me again. That was the largest part, I think.”

I felt a duty to make the world understand what was happening in Iraq and Afghanistan, the true casualty numbers

She also hoped the rigours of military life would quell her gender dysphoria; “thinking it’s better to try to tamp down on that, which is basically what most trans people did in the early 2000s.” And it did die down, under the weight of the crushing physical demands of basic training. Then training ended and “I was like, oh, crap. It’s still there.”

After acing the aptitude tests, Manning was posted to army intelligence and, at 22, found herself deployed in Iraq as part of the graduating class of the 2007 recruitment surge. The shock was immense. Along with other analysts, she was housed in a converted basketball court in the green zone, providing direct support to frontline troops by anticipating enemy movement. She was very good at her job. She was also horrified and depressed, fielding graphic raw images from the battlefield. One night, a clerical error made by a special operations unit – they used an old address for a target – resulted in the death of a group of Iraqi civilians. “I blamed myself in part because I left my desk to go eat. I shouldn’t have left.” If she hadn’t been absent, she says, “I could’ve solved this.” She felt powerless, and angry, and guilty. She wondered if there was anything she could do.

The assumption about whistleblowers is that the bravery it takes and the self-sacrifice it entails require a confidence bordering on narcissism. To call out systems as large as the US military, there has to be, surely, something wrong with you. The fact that Chelsea Manning was so young when she uploaded the incident reports and significant activity logs to WikiLeaks isn’t irrelevant; risk assessment at that age isn’t what it is a decade later. To Manning, analysing the data, precedent suggested that the consequences might not be too dire. Forty years earlier, when Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers, exposing the US government’s lies about Vietnam, he escaped a jail term. More recently, Thomas Drake, a whistleblower who in 2006 communicated with journalists about inefficiency and fraud at the NSA, had been sanctioned but not imprisoned. Manning’s assumption was that she’d face dishonourable discharge. She believed it was worth it. As she writes in the book, when she left Barnes & Noble that day after uploading the files, it made her “feel like I’d done something, that I’d relieved my conscience a little. I felt a duty to my fellow humans to do this, to make the world understand more about what I knew was happening in Iraq and Afghanistan every day, to understand what the true casualty numbers were.”

Manning wanted to apprise the American public of several things: how badly the Iraq war was going; and that the secrecy around it was designed to save face, not a security measure to protect the national interest. A year later, similar concerns propelled her to leak a huge cache of diplomatic cables from the US Department of State. (That leak would reveal nothing so starkly as how porous and pathetic US government cybersecurity was that a low-ranking 22-year-old analyst could access and disseminate the data.) The question remains less one of whether or not Manning was justified in her actions as why, of the hundreds of intelligence and other officers with access to the same information, she was the one to break rank. There was in her background a “kernel” of belief in the theory of radical transparency, “but it was very specific to music. It was very Napster-era. It was around pirating music, or films.” Before joining the military, she’d engaged in some internet activism, targeting evangelical churches by trolling their discussion groups, but this was largely recreational at a time when early internet culture was, as she says, “a playground”, rather than the “toxic cesspools of extreme rightwing ideologies it became”.

She has vaguely anti-authoritarian roots on both sides of her family. Her mother, Susan, was Welsh, from a large, working-class family in Haverfordwest. Her father, Brian, is from a Catholic family from the midwest, with a strong libertarian streak. Manning’s parents met in a pub in Wales in the mid-1970s, where her father was stationed with the US Navy. They married and moved back to the US, winding up in Oklahoma where her father found a job as an electronic data processor for the Hertz Corporation.

It was a comfortable, middle-class home. It was also violent. Both Manning’s parents were alcoholics; her father frequently “beat the crap” out of her, she writes, sometimes for no apparent reason, but often triggered, Manning believes, by what he perceived to be his son’s effeminate behaviour. Her mother was gentler, but also zoned out on alcohol and “incapable of behaving like an adult. She never learned to drive or to balance a chequebook, and her alcoholism eventually made it even more difficult for her to function in the world.” There was at least one suicide attempt, when Manning found her mother passed out half-naked in the hallway. After her parents split up in her early teens, she followed her mother to Wales for a short, unhappy period before returning to the US. If there is a scorched-earth mentality in her thinking, it has been born of necessity. Less apparent is how she built and maintained her considerable confidence. At school, she was an academic high performer who felt cleverer than her classmates. After being introduced to computers aged six, she almost immediately started doing basic-level programming. Still, looking at the whole picture, I suggest, it wasn’t exactly a background to foster self-esteem.

“Well, it was very advantageous,” Manning says. “I was a middle-class white boy in Oklahoma.”

Right, but your memoir describes you as a child of alcoholics growing up in a violent home. “Very typical, though, in that region. But yeah, being trans in particular ... ” She tapers off. “But for being trans, I would’ve been on the path to going to Harvard.”

Manning is resistant to narratives that dead-end in victimhood. She spent years in therapy fighting to recover from the guilt of “abandoning” her mother when she returned to the US from Wales. “I’ve come to recognise that I was in a co-dependent relationship and had to do something different.” Her mother died in 2020. She has no idea where her father is. “We tried to track him down for the book, but he’s very mercurial.” In her late teens, Manning says, her father kicked her out of the house and she lived in her car for a while, selling bootleg Adobe software out of a parking lot. It wasn’t long after that she joined the military. “When you’ve been through the things I’ve been through, most things don’t seem that insurmountable,” she says.

Politically, several important things happened in Manning’s childhood. In 1993, when she was five, the US government sent troops into a hostage situation in Waco, Texas, bungling the mission and killing 76 people, including 25 children. Manning’s father jumped instantly into the “government’s-going-to-take-your-guns mentality”, she says, a position she despises. “It’s an excuse, a rallying call for something deeper and much more sinister. A significant amount of the libertarian strain of American politics is deeply connected to this air of superiority among upper-middle-class white men.” Nonetheless, from a young age Manning learned to maintain a measure of scepticism in relation to the US government, one that she never entirely lost.

Being a middle-class white boy in Oklahoma was advantageous. But for being trans, I'd have been on the path to Harvard

The other political influence during her formative years was the gay rights movement. As a 10-year-old, Manning kissed a boy called Sid. Sid kissed back, before calling Manning a faggot. “I didn’t even know what gay meant at that point,” she writes, “and I bet the kids calling me that didn’t really, either. It was just a bad thing, we all thought, the worst insult you could use. I just wanted the whole thing to go away.” Her gender dysphoria was so deeply suppressed at that point that she simply assumed, with a sinking heart, that she was gay in a state where “homosexual sex” would be a criminal offence until 2003. Five years later, while Manning was learning to be an intelligence analyst at Fort Drum, New York, the voters of California passed Proposition 8, a ballot initiative to outlaw gay marriage.

This was a huge moment for Manning in terms of both her mental health and her belief in systems of government. “My whole life, I’d been told that things were always going to get better,” she writes, “that the system was set up with checks and balances, that liberal society meant slow but steady ‘progress’ toward democratic inclusion.” The passing of Proposition 8 blew that vision apart. “It wasn’t just a repudiation of that promise. It wasn’t even just a national tragedy. It was a personal rejection of me, and millions of other queer people, as human beings.”

To Manning’s detractors, her leaking of the Iraq reports, and later the Afghan war logs and diplomatic cables, was an expression of monstrous arrogance; at best an overreaction to the normal chaos of war by a naive young recruit, at worst a bad-faith action designed to aid the enemy. After uploading the files, nothing happened for a long time, then everything happened at once. WikiLeaks released the reports to the Guardian, the New York Times, Der Spiegel and other media partners. The military began an inquiry. As Manning felt the net closing in, she worried about her fellow analysts coming under suspicion – she had acted entirely alone – and effectively confessed to an anonymous contact online, whom she suspected had links to the FBI and she imagined, correctly, would turn her in. Less than a week later, two agents from the Army Criminal Investigation Division turned up to question Manning, accompanied by civilians from the state department and the FBI. She was immediately arrested and transported from Iraq to Kuwait, where she was imprisoned, under canvas, in a makeshift jail made entirely of metal bars. In other words a cage, where she would spend several months. “A tyre cage, we called it. Built in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I remember because that was the only piece of writing on it. It was a brain-melting experience.” She was stripped down to the most basic shadow of humanity. “Food. Water. Cool. My reptilian needs were the primary driver.” Meanwhile the guards goaded her about her next move. “Maybe they’ll send you to Cuba, or Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti,” she recalls them saying. “We do bad things there.”

Instead, Manning was conveyed to Quantico, a military prison in Virginia that at first struck her as an improvement. “It’s funny because people say, ‘Your time in Quantico was very bad.’ But the initial thoughts I was having in Quantico were: ‘I’m in the United States! Hot and cold running water! Air-conditioning!’” The relief didn’t last long. Manning was held in solitary confinement, harassed constantly with rules – she wasn’t permitted to lie down during the day and any attempt to do so would result in barked orders to sit up again. She was on suicide watch, and as a result was denied pillows or bedding she might use to harm herself. She was not permitted to exercise in her cell or to meet other prisoners. She was entirely isolated in Quantico for nine months, an experience the UN later ruled was “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of article 16 of the convention against torture”. Meanwhile, military doctors diagnosed her with depression, anxiety and gender dysphoria, all of which were used by her defence team when, three years later, she finally came to military trial.

Of the 22 counts with which Manning was charged, she pleaded guilty to 10 and was found guilty on a further seven, among them six counts of espionage. She was sentenced to 35 years’ imprisonment, escaping life without parole only because the judge rejected the government’s most serious accusation – that Manning had given information to the enemy. In the event, she was found not guilty of treason. The single note of relief for Manning was that, with the trial over, she could finally come out as trans without compromising her case. She could also start legal proceedings to compel prison authorities to permit her to have hormone treatment in jail. Pretrial, she had started signing some letters “Breanna Manning”. Now, in Fort Leavenworth, she decided“Chelsea” was the right name. “It was a neighbourhood in Manhattan full of dance clubs where queer people could feel totally at home and normal and welcome,” she writes. She put out a statement via her lawyer. Then she knuckled down to spend what she assumed would be the next 30 years in military prison.

In fact, when President Obama commuted Manning’s sentence in 2017 – he pointed to the apology she’d read out in court as evidence of her contrition – with time served she would end up spending another four years inside before release. Her experiences at Fort Leavenworth had been a combination of deep depression and suicidal thoughts – exacerbated, according to Manning, by the destabilising effect of the hormones the government allowed her to start taking in 2015 – and what she characterises as a surprisingly peaceable existence. An individual as birdlike as Manning taking female hormones in a male prison would, one imagines, have been at risk of attack. In fact, she says, she had almost no problems; a couple of fights, that’s it. “You have to remember I was pretty sociable in prison. People knew me and I got to know people.” She helped other prisoners with their legal problems. She became a popular inmate. “People stopped seeing me as a trans person; they saw me. I could hear it sometimes – oh, well, you’re different.” These days, Manning says, the fact of being trans “feels like such a minor thing in my life. Like: I went through this transition period and it was very difficult and I needed access to care, and once I got care I’ve been able to function as an adult and not really think about this stuff. It very rarely comes up.”

And so she tries, again, to rebuild a life for herself. The speaking income hasn’t really recovered post-Covid, but she is about to embark on a multi-city book tour and relishes the prospect of meeting and debating with people. She receives hundreds of letters a year, occasionally hateful, mainly admiring. Reading her book put me in mind of Regeneration, Pat Barker’s novel of the first world war and the best encapsulation of PTSD I’ve read. I ask if she has read it and she looks bemused, eyes skimming the room, before going off on a diatribe about the US military’s “psychology of lethality”.

I try once more to discover a shred of hesitation, doubt or regret at any of the events of the last 12 years. In your place, I say, given the extremes of your circumstance, a different personality would have gone into retreat. Manning looks taken aback that, analysing the data, anyone could reach this conclusion. “That’s not me!”",cybersecurity,the guardian

The White House’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, and other senior officials are set to be deposed under oath as part of a lawsuit claiming the government worked alongside social media platforms to create a “massive censorship enterprise” throughout the Covid-19 outbreak.

In a Friday ruling, Judge Terry Doughty granted a joint request from the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana to compel several current and former officials to testify in the suit, among them Fauci, ex-White House press secretary Jen Psaki, Director of White House Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and two high-level figures from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

“After finding documentation of a collusive relationship between the [Joe] Biden administration and social media companies to censor free speech, we immediately filed a motion to get these officials under oath,” Missouri AG Eric Schmitt said in a statement. “It is high time we shine a light on this censorship enterprise and force these officials to come clean to the American people, and this ruling will allow us to do just that. We’ll keep pressing for the truth.”

While the defense insisted that senior officials can only be called to testify about their actions in office under “extraordinary circumstances,” Judge Doughty said the personnel in question met that standard. He added that the two Republican-led states “have proven that Dr. Fauci has personal knowledge about the issue concerning censorship across social media as it related to Covid-19,” ordering him to cooperate with a deposition.

Requests to depose the other officials were granted on similar grounds, as the judge concluded all either held direct meetings with social media firms about the purported censorship, or had close knowledge of those discussions.

Jen Easterly, who heads up the DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was also ordered to testify. She played a “central role” in “flagging misinformation to social-media companies for censorship,” the plaintiffs argued, describing the cyber agency the “nerve center” of “the federal government’s efforts to censor social media users.”

The same official was said to be involved in the DHS’ now-defunct ‘Disinformation Governance Board’ – dubbed the ‘Ministry of Truth’ by critics – which would have created a new mechanism to facilitate cooperation between the White House and social media sites.

Initially filed last May by Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, the lawsuit claims the federal government encouraged online platforms to censor, delete or ban certain speech about the pandemic, including discussion of the “lab leak theory of Covid-19’s origin,” as well as questions about the effectiveness of face masks, vaccines or lockdown policies, among other issues.

The two AGs have largely relied on documents obtained through subpoenas of YouTube, Twitter and Facebook’s parent firm Meta, which detail regular communications between the government and social media sites.

The White House, as well as the eight officials ordered to testify, have yet to comment on Friday’s ruling. The depositions must take place within 30 days of the order, though it remains unclear whether the defense intends to appeal the decision.",cybersecurity,rt

Australia on Saturday proposed tougher penalties for companies that fail to protect customers' personal data after two major cybersecurity breaches left millions vulnerable to criminals.

The penalties for serious breaches of the Privacy Act would increase from 2.2 million Australian dollars ($1.4 million) now to AU$50 million ($32 million) under amendments to be introduced to Parliament next week, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said.

A company could also be fined the value of 30% of its revenues over a defined period if that amount exceeded AU$50 million ($32 million).

Dreyfus said ""big companies could face penalties up to hundreds of millions of dollars"" under the new law.

""It is a very, very substantial increase in the penalties,"" Dreyfus told reporters.

""It's designed to make companies think. It's designed to be a deterrent so that companies will protect the data of Australians,"" he added.

Parliament resumes on Tuesday for the first time since mid-September.

Since Parliament last sat, unknown hackers stole personal data from 9.8 million customers of Optus, Australia's second-largest wireless telecommunications carrier. The theft has left more than one-third of Australia's population at heightened risk of identity theft and fraud.

Unknown cybercriminals this week demanded ransom from Australia's largest health insurer, Medibank, after claiming to have stolen 200 gigabytes of customers' data including medical diagnoses and treatments. Medibank has 3.7 million customers. The company said the hackers had proved they hold the personal records of at least 100.

The thieves have reportedly threatened to make public medical conditions of high-profile Medibank customers.

Dreyfus said both breaches had shown ""existing safeguards are inadequate.""

As well as failing to protect personal information, the government is concerned that companies are unnecessarily holding too much customer data for too long in the hope of monetizing that information.

""We need to make sure that when a data breach occurs the penalty is large enough, that it's a really serious penalty on the company and can't just be disregarded or ignored or just paid as a part of a cost of doing business,"" Dreyfus said.

Dreyfus hopes the proposed amendments will become law in the final four weeks that Parliament will sit this year.

Any new penalties will not be retroactive and will not effect Optus or Medibank.

120,Will a Recession Increase Remote Work?,https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/styles/manual_crop_1_91_1_1528x800/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2022-09/will_a_recession_increase_remote_work.png.jpg?itok=fRrQ6fGQ,22/10/2022,"While some headlines claim that a recession will mean the end of remote work, many companies will benefit by having most employees working remotely during an economic downturn.",https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/intentional-insights/202210/will-recession-increase-remote-work,"Source: DCStudio/Freepik

Many recent headlines claim that an upcoming recession will mean the end of remote work. That’s because the recession will lead to a cooling labor market, giving executives more power to force employees to comply with their demands. And while surveys show that the large majority of employees prefer to spend most or all their time working remotely, most executives want employees to be in the office.

Thus, according to these headlines, the recession will wipe out remote work. Unfortunately, they fail to grasp the key factors of a recession that will actually boost remote work.

Leadership in an Economic Recession Requires More Discipline

It’s true that a recession will give employers more power. However, what the headline authors miss is that a recession requires getting the most return on investment from employees.

In a period of economic growth, the comfortable bottom line for most companies gives traditionalist executives significant leeway to default to their intuitive personal and selfish preferences for in-office work. As one such executive wrote in a recent op-ed, “There’s a deeply personal reason why I want to go back to the office. It’s selfish, but I don’t care. I feel like I lost a piece of my identity in the pandemic… I’m worried that I won’t truly find myself again if I have to work from home for the rest of my life.”

Once a recession hits, executives will need to show more discipline. Rather than trusting their gut, they’ll need to rely on the hard data of what makes the most financial sense for companies. And there’s no question that a focus on profits over personal preferences will benefit remote work for many reasons.

Pandemic Productivity Growth Driven Mostly by Remote Work

We have extensive evidence showing that remote work is more productive than in-office work. A Stanford University study found that remote workers were 5% more productive than in-office workers in the summer of 2020. By the spring of 2022, remote workers became 9% more productive, since companies learned how to do remote work better and invested in more remote-friendly technology. Another study, using employee monitoring software, confirms that remote workers are substantially more productive than in-office workers.

What about concerns about team productivity in the form of collaboration and innovation, versus individual productivity? Indeed, collaboration and innovation — as opposed to individual productivity — can be weakened in remote settings. But that’s only if leaders try to shoehorn traditional office-centric methods into remote work, instead of using best practices for collaboration and innovation in remote settings, such as virtual asynchronous brainstorming. A recent peer-reviewed study found a boost for collaboration for well-designed remote work. And a study of 307 companies finds that greater worker autonomy and flexibility results in more innovation.

Overall, counting both individual and team productivity, productivity is substantially higher from remote work. A new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that productivity growth in businesses widely relying on remote work like IT and finance grew from 1.1% between 2010 and 2019 to 3.3% since the start of the pandemic. Compare that to industries relying on in-person contact, such as transportation, dining and hospitality. They went from productivity growth of 0.6% between 2010 and 2019, to a decrease of 2.6% from the start of the pandemic.

Besides being more productive, remote workers are willing to work for less money. Another NBER study found that remote work decreased wage growth by 2% over the first two years of the pandemic, since employees perceive remote work as an important benefit. As a concrete example of this trend, a survey of 3,000 workers at top companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft found that 64% would prefer permanent work-from-home over a $30,000 pay raise.

Relatedly, companies don’t have to pay as much in cost-of-living expenses if they’re not hiring workers who live in expensive cities near company offices. Indeed, companies that offer remote work opportunities are increasingly hiring in lower cost-of-living areas of the US and even outside the US to get the best value for talent. That’s a major reason why one of my clients, a late-stage software-as-a-service startup, decided to offer all-remote positions.

Benefits of Remote Work for Retention and Recruitment

Besides offering more productivity for less money, remote work boosts the ability of companies to get the best hires. Over 60% of Morning Consult survey respondents would be more likely to apply for a job offering remote work.

Likewise, remote work improves retention. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (64%) to an ADP Institute survey reported they would consider looking for a new job if forced to come in full-time. That includes 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds. And flexibility ranks only behind compensation for job satisfaction in a Future Forum survey. An NBER paper reporting on a randomized trial found that offering a hybrid vs. an office-centric schedule improved retention by over a third. Thus, because over 85% of its employees preferred full-time remote work, one of my clients, the Jaeb Center for Health Research, decided to adopt a home-centric model to improve retention.

Even the Biden administration finally realized these facts. In March, Biden called for the vast majority of federal workers to return to the office. But by July, his officials defended remote work for government employees as improving recruitment, retention, and productivity. That matches surveys of government employees by Cisco, with 66% preferring to work more than half their work week remotely, and 85% saying flexibility to work from home substantially improves their job satisfaction.

Remote Work Can Improve Your Company’s Financial Health

We know that diversity improves financial performance and decision-making. That aligns with clear data showing that underrepresented employees have a strong preference for remote work compared to the average employee. Such desires stem from the reality of microaggressions and discrimination against minorities. Companies are already seeing these consequences: Meta reported that it met and even exceeded its diversity goals two years ahead of schedule due to offering remote work options.

Further financial benefits stem from a decreased need for office space and associated expenses such as utilities, cleaning, and security. An NBER report found that regions with more remote work experienced the biggest decline in demand for commercial real estate and consequent rents. Indeed, both Amazon and Meta recently announced halts on office space construction projects because so many of their employees worked remotely.

Of course, the most forward-looking organizations will still invest in office space for their employees: namely, their home offices. Another of my clients is the University of Southern California’s Information Sciences Institute, which carries out basic and applied research in machine learning and artificial intelligence, networks and cybersecurity, high-performance computing, microelectronics, and quantum information systems. It provided a wide range of home office technology and furniture to its staff to improve their productivity. Doing so is a wise investment, even in a recession.

Traditionalist Executives Will Embrace Facts About Remote Work, or Fade Into Irrelevance

The cost savings and productivity improvements associated with remote work, combined with less leeway for personal preferences due to the discipline imposed by the recession, will result in more and more traditionalist executives supporting their employees working remotely most or all of their time. To do so, they will have to overcome the challenge of cognitive dissonance, namely how they deal with contradictory information: their internal gut reactions versus external financial reality.

Traditionalist leaders fail to adopt innovative best practices for the future of work because of dangerous judgment errors known as cognitive biases. These mental blindspots impact decision making in all life areas, ranging from the future of work to relationships. Fortunately, recent research has shown effective and pragmatic strategies to defeat these dangerous judgment errors, such as by constraining our choices to best practices.

The best leaders are courageous enough to change their minds when the facts change. More timid, second-rate leaders fall into confirmation bias, the tendency to look for information that confirms their beliefs. They also suffer from the ostrich effect, denying negative facts about reality.

These less competent leaders will try to stick to their personal predilections even during a recession. As a consequence, their companies will underperform in comparison to more flexible companies, and such leaders will eventually be forced out for denying reality and replaced by more savvy leaders who endorse remote work. That’s why a recession will, in the end, boost remote work.

Conclusion

A recession will prove to be a boon for remote work, with more and more people working remotely. Financial planning for hard times requires getting greater returns on employee investment, engagement, and retention. In this regard, extensive evidence shows remote workers are more productive than in-office workers. They would quit instead of giving up the benefits of working from home. Workers are even willing to work for less money if offered remote positions. In fact, government officials are defending telework policies. Beyond cost reductions, companies will have a better chance of improving their financial performance because their workforce will become more diverse working remotely. Moreover, remote companies can slash operational costs because of a decreased need for office space. As a result, Traditionalist executives will be at a disadvantage in an economic downturn if they do not embrace these hard facts and change their minds. These are the facts, and a recession will only make them more obvious.",cybersecurity,psychology today

The penalties for serious breaches of the Privacy Act would increase from AUD 2.2 million (roughly Rs. 11 crore) now to AUD 50 million (roughly Rs. 264 crore) under amendments to be introduced to Parliament next week, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said.

A company could also be fined the value of 30 percent of its revenues over a defined period if that amount exceeded AUD 50 million.

Dreyfus said “big companies could face penalties up to hundreds of millions of dollars” under the new law.

“It is a very, very substantial increase in the penalties,” Dreyfus told reporters.

“It's designed to make companies think. It's designed to be a deterrent so that companies will protect the data of Australians,” he added.

Parliament resumes on Tuesday for the first time since mid-September.

Since Parliament last sat, unknown hackers stole personal data from 9.8 million customers of Optus, Australia's second-largest wireless telecommunications carrier. The theft has left more than one-third of Australia's population at heightened risk of identity theft and fraud.

Unknown cybercriminals this week demanded ransom from Australia's largest health insurer, Medibank, after claiming to have stolen 200 gigabytes of customers' data including medical diagnoses and treatments. Medibank has 3.7 million customers. The company said the hackers had proved they hold the personal records of at least 100.

The thieves have reportedly threatened to make public medical conditions of high-profile Medibank customers.

Dreyfus said both breaches had shown “existing safeguards are inadequate.”

As well as failing to protect personal information, the government is concerned that companies are unnecessarily holding too much customer data for too long in the hope of monetizing that information.

“We need to make sure that when a data breach occurs the penalty is large enough, that it's a really serious penalty on the company and can't just be disregarded or ignored or just paid as a part of a cost of doing business,” Dreyfus said.

Dreyfus hopes the proposed amendments will become law in the final four weeks that Parliament will sit this year.

Any new penalties will not be retroactive and will not effect Optus or Medibank.

125,"Investment Strategy Monthly Insights, October 2022",https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1311598658/image_1311598658.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,22/10/2022,"Europe’s energy security and decarbonization goals will spur R&D in cleantech, solar in particular.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4548299-investment-strategy-monthly-insights-october-2022,"nespix

Significant macroeconomic challenges remain, but investors may have reason to believe that Europe passed peak pessimism. Russia does not have much energy leverage left, and following the massive selloff in European assets in recent months, most of the energy supply shock looks priced in. Europe appears to be serious about curbing stubborn energy inflation, evidenced by a potential price cap on natural gas needed for electricity.

The UK government’s decision to reverse its proposed tax cuts helped assets rebound somewhat. While the Bank of England (BoE) is expected to hike by over 200 basis points (bps) before year-end, we believe there is an increasing chance that the bank postpones quantitative tightening (QT) until 2023. Reducing gilt buying by £80 billion over the next year at a time when gilt supply is expected to rise dramatically would not bode well for the BoE’s financial stability objective.1

In Italy, the electoral victory of the far-right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni resulted in a limited market reaction, with the bund/btp spreads widening by only 8bps following the results. The market reaction may be more significant come the end of October when the new government is formed and its key fiscal programs become clearer, which is important given that the country’s 150% debt-to-GDP ratio.2

Outside Europe, China’s 20th Party Congress indicated that China is preparing more aggressive easing and growth-oriented policies, even with leadership hesitant to abandon its zero-COVID policies. Recent declarations from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) indicated a shift toward increased liberalization, pointing to greater monetary independence and an unwillingness cap the yuan’s weakness.3

It’s the opposite in the U.S., where the dollar remains strong, to the benefit of domestically oriented U.S. companies, particularly those in the middle of the Biden administration’s push to decarbonize infrastructure. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) could stabilize at its high in the coming weeks, but it seems poised to weaken as monetary conditions become restrictive. Neither the labor market nor inflation will derail the Fed’s tightening. We expect the Fed to remain on its tightening path and increase the fed funds rate as long as there is no sign of a marked slowdown in hiring, wage growth, and core inflation.

Investment strategies highlighted this month:

Renewables Benefit from Europe’s Likely Move To Cap Gas Prices – Capping gas prices to help curb inflation can preserve superior profit margins for renewable energy producers. More broadly, Europe’s energy security and decarbonization goals will spur R&D in cleantech, solar in particular.

20th Party Congress Policy Agenda Positive for Chinese Equities – We expect further easing of monetary and fiscal policies to boost growth prospects and earnings expectations, and possibly trigger a rebound in Chinese equities.

Technology to Help U.S. Firms Navigate Difficult Conditions – Tech stocks have been battered this year, but we believe bright spots will emerge as U.S. companies invest in productivity-enhancing and cost-saving technology.

Europe’s Renewables: Energy Security and Decarbonization Push Spurs Investments

We believe investors have reason to be slightly more optimistic about Europe as it progresses in its energy transition. The region’s dependence on Russian gas is now just 9%, down from 40% before the invasion of Ukraine. Gas reserves are at about 88% full, within range of the European Commission’s (EC) requirement of maintaining reserves at 90%, though most European countries still need to save 10–15% of their gas consumption to comply with the EC’s targets.4,5

In the real economy, consumers, companies, and governments must make do with less and more expensive energy. Countries such as France, Portugal and Spain have it easier, as they were hardly dependent on Russian energy. The situation is different in Eastern and Central Europe, given their reliance on Russian gas, but countries are pivoting. Germany unveiled a new €200 billion stimulus package, which should help support consumers and business activity over the winter months and improve the outlook for the region overall.6 The outlook is less optimistic for Italy and the UK, where political uncertainty compounds the economic uncertainty and fiscal and financial risks are rising.

Further coordinated measures seem likely, including a price cap on natural gas. If implemented at the EU level, this measure would partially subsidize energy consumption, relieving some of the burden on consumers and companies. The exact structure remains unclear, including the financing and whether fossil energy companies’ profits will be tapped. Also, we expect changes in the energy pricing system that decouple natural gas prices from other electricity sources, including liquified natural gas (LNG), wind, solar, and nuclear.

However, the EU is unlikely to drastically change the “pay-as-clear” mechanism in the European energy market, where the most expensive energy source dictates the price of a kilowatt-hour of electricity. Under this pricing model, producers of cheap electricity, such as renewables, sell their electricity at the highest price, which is often the gas price. This model is positive for renewable energy producers because it can result in high margins. The net profit margin for European renewable energy producers is 11.6% currently, versus 7.4% for the rest of the world.7

For investors, what should be increasingly clear is that Europe will not return to its 2021 energy mix. Europe’s expedited moves to secure its energy and decarbonize have spurred numerous initiatives. Notably, REPowerEU is the EC’s plan to cut make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030. The plan includes a rapid rollout of solar and wind energy projects combined with renewable hydrogen deployment. The EC estimates that 780 gigawatts (GW) of solar and 510GW of wind power must be installed across the region by 2030 to meet REPowerEU’s objectives. As part of the REPowerEU’s plans under the modified Recovery and Resilience Fund, the EU announced a €300 billion investment in renewables and cleantech and the electrification of infrastructure and transportation.8

In addition, urgent needs include new grid balancing and back-up power sources, currently provided mainly by fossil fuels, hydro, and nuclear. Other large-scale projects include geothermal and nuclear fusion studies. Also, the European Space Agency (ESA) proposed a research and development (R&D) program to develop commercial solar power stations in space. Dubbed the Solaris project, European science ministers are set to evaluate its feasibility in November. In 2050, solar is expected to be the single largest contributing energy source to the EU, accounting for 40% of the EU’s energy.9

We view companies that manufacture, operate, or supply components for renewable energies such as solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear components, and hydrogen as attractive given the demand prospects. Raw materials like nickel, cobalt, copper present opportunities for the long term. In the short to medium term, uranium is core to renewed focus on nuclear energy.

Chinese Equities: Rebound Can Materialize Amid Easing Policies

China started on its path to easier monetary and fiscal policy due to the Omicron variant, which resulted in several long lockdowns this year. With dampened consumption and business activity amid the government’s zero-COVID policy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts China’s economy to grow just 3.2% in 2022.10 The strong U.S. dollar reducing global demand and the risk-off environment created a challenging investment backdrop for Chinese equities. However, positive signs include industrial production and manufacturing production improved slightly in in September.11 For 2023, the IMF forecasts China’s growth to accelerate to 4.4% in 2023, outpacing global GDP growth forecasts of 2.7%.12

The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in October, at which President Xi unveiled new party leadership for the next five years, offered additional reasons for optimism about China’s growth trajectory. The government seems determined to boost growth and achieve three key targets: common prosperity, technological and manufacturing self-reliance, and liberalization of market access. However, Xi’s declarations at the Congress about prioritizing national security and stronger military alongside the reaffirmation of opposition to Taiwan independence point to elevated geopolitical uncertainties in the region. These factors could weigh on investment sentiment for Chinese assets and cap near-term growth prospects.13

First, China’s objective to reduce inequality and shift to a consumer economy, so-called “common prosperity”, could benefit consumer discretionary-oriented sectors and themes as easing measures take hold. The effects of these measures depend on the number of COVID cases and resulting lockdowns, as Xi reiterated the government’s commitment to the zero-COVID strategy.14

Second, China’s push to develop its domestic semiconductor market illustrates the country’s goal of technological and manufacturing self-sufficiency. The focus on semiconductors is likely to accelerate following President Biden’s announcement of additional export control restrictions on chip companies. Chinese hardware technology companies could gain domestic market share as a result and increase profits for chip companies like SMIC, China’s largest semiconductor manufacturer.

The People’s Bank of China is likely to help the corporate landscape by cutting banks’ reserve requirement ratio by at least 25bps by year-end. With accommodative monetary conditions and increasing tax refunds and tax cuts and deferrals, corporate loans rose to 1.35 trillion yuan in September, nearly double from a year ago.15 We expect most of this funding to be directed to infrastructure developments.

And for the third objective, recent PBOC policy decisions indicate a reluctance to intervene heavily to cap the yuan’s weakness. The central bank’s preference for a market-driven approach to stabilize the currency point to greater monetary policy independence and exchange rates liberalization.

From a market standpoint, Chinese stock valuations are compelling, in our view. Following the large selloff since early 2020, Chinese stocks captured in the MSCI China index are trading at 10x forward earnings, close to their 2011 lows.16 Chinese stocks’ return on equity (ROE) could beat expectations in 2023, should China implement additional easing measures to boost economic growth. Sectors that are likely to outperform in the next year include Tech, Industrials amid higher defense spending, and Consumer Discretionary, led by automobiles and electric vehicles. Consensus aggregated by Bloomberg shows that analysts expect the combined earnings of companies in the Hang Seng Tech index to rebound over 10% in 2023 and close to 40% over the next two years. In comparison, analysts forecast the combined earnings for the broader MSCI China Index to grow 6% in 2023 and 11% over the next two years.17

Themes that look well-positioned to benefit from this upside potential in Chinese stocks include Renewable Energy, including solar, an industry where more than half of the constituents are produced by Chinese companies, and wind. Other themes that can benefit include Lithium & Battery Technology, Disruptive Materials, and E-commerce. These themes should not only benefit from the global structural push for digitization and decarbonization, but also local tailwinds from Chinese policies to stimulate growth.

U.S. Tech: Productivity Enhancers and Cost Savers Are Bright Spots

While high inflation, slowing growth, and market volatility may make investors skittish, these dynamics can create compelling investment opportunities as companies adjust to this challenging operating environment. Investing in technology is one way for companies to achieve higher productivity gains, especially in the U.S., where the job market is likely to remain tight and wage growth elevated.

In September, the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, despite the Fed’s tightening.18 The growth in average hourly earnings remained at a monthly pace of 5.0% yoy, which is not consistent with the Fed’s 2% inflation target.19 We expect the supply of workers to keep pressuring the job market, due in part to a large group of U.S. workers set to reach retirement age. The possibility of a downward trend in the participation rate will not help bring down wage growth in the medium term.

We expect cost-reducing technologies will be in greater demand as price levels rise. Longer-term, technology’s role in cost reduction is likely to increase significantly in the next decade, given the likely reversal of globalized manufacturing that led to decades-long deflation. For example, developed economies’ heightened focus on economic resilience through energy security and end-to-end supply chain controls, coupled with the prospect of stubbornly higher inflation, suggest greater investments in robotics and automation. In our view, dampened valuations in the Tech sector currently offer attractive entry opportunities in companies active in these technologies.

Some of the top disruptive themes that will enable productivity gains and cost reduction are trading at a discount to the broader market while providing better risk-adjusted returns. Renewable Energy, U.S. Infrastructure Development, Cybersecurity, Lithium & Battery Technology, and Disruptive Materials have been relatively defensive compared to the broader market while also standing out as key drivers of growth for the next decade among the clean energy and digital transition.

The blockchain technology has consistently broken barriers and is paving new roads in concepts we thought had reached their limits. It wasn’t until recently that gamers realized they could cash out on long hours spent playing video games with play to earn games. This concept was only made possible when blockchain technology was integrated with video games. A similar occurrence has taken place in the field of education. The blockchain technology has bridged the gap between learning and earning with incentivized learning: the learn to earn model.

What Is The Learn To Earn Model?

The learn to earn model brought about by blockchain differs depending on the blockchain project. But generally, it refers to the acquisition of knowledge along with incentivizes for various learning activities. These rewards may vary based on the platform but are mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies. An example is CoinMarketCap’s ""learn crypto, earn crypto"" program, where learners can earn various crypto assets, from BNB on the Binance Smart Chain to $LIKE, Only1’s native token. Other such programs include the Coinbase Earn Program, which allows Coinbase users to get free cryptos by acquiring crypto knowledge, and Singapore-based Phemex’s educational program called ""Learn and Earn.""

The Role Of The Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are the key to everything in the decentralized finance space, and together with blockchain, they bring secure automation to any system, hence the pivotal role they play in the learn to earn model. With smart contracts, rewards and disbursements of incentives are automatic, based on the code of the smart contracts and specified activities for rewards.

Examples Of Learn To Earn Projects

Education Ecosystem

Launched in 2015, Education Ecosystem is a project-based learning platform that teaches people how to build real products in areas such as programming, game development, Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, data science, and blockchain. Education Ecosystem is special because it focuses on more advanced learners (i.e., students and professionals), helping them advance their careers. With an ingenious earning model, Education Ecosystem offers rewards in its native token, $LEDU, to both project creators and learners for various positive activities within the platform. Positive activities for rewards include:

Creating learning projects

Watching project videos

Sharing videos on social media

In 2022, Education Ecosystem improved its project library by adding around 300 short and long projects to its platform.

EarnCrypto

EarnCrypto is a crypto reward platform that offers users rewards for various activities on the platform, one of which is learning. Users on EarnCrypto can earn rewards when they watch guides and informative videos on the platform, and they get rewarded after short assessments pertaining to the videos. EarnCrypto also offers users rewards for taking surveys, completing various tasks, and sometimes, testing crypto applications.

Earnathon

Earnathon is a website dedicated to sharing knowledge on a host of crypto topics. Users can hop on to the site to acquire knowledge on a variety of crypto-related topics. At least seven projects are registered on the platform, offering their native tokens as rewards to entice users into deciding to take their courses. Users also have the option of earning rewards in Earnathon’s native token, ENA. Though Earnathon may have a good concept, there are questions over its legitimacy as the platform lacks a whitepaper or a roadmap.

BitDegree

Another learning project with incentives, BitDegree enables users to earn crypto by watching a series of informative videos about blockchain known as ""Learndrops."" It then proceeds to assess their knowledge with a test before rewarding them with cryptos.

Binance Learn To Earn Program

Binance offers various reward programs, one of which is the Binance learn to earn program, which simply allows users the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency by taking quizzes and tests on blockchain knowledge obtained from the Binance academy. Binance offers a host of fundamental courses on blockchain through its academy, a section on its website replete with many topics on crypto and blockchain.

Final Thoughts

Leveraging blockchain technology, tokenization has been employed by various projects seeking to incentivize learning. This has provided users with a means to increase their crypto portfolios while acquiring substantial knowledge. For bridging the gap between learning and earning by incentivizing learning, blockchain technology seems to be an innovation. Hopefully, we might see the adaptation of incentivized learning in traditional education.",cybersecurity,elearningindustry.com

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia on Saturday proposed tougher penalties for companies that fail to protect customers’ personal data after two major cybersecurity breaches left millions vulnerable to criminals.

The penalties for serious breaches of the Privacy Act would increase from 2.2 million Australian dollars ($1.4 million) now to AU$50 million ($32 million) under amendments to be introduced to Parliament next week, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said.

A company could also be fined the value of 30% of its revenues over a defined period if that amount exceeded AU$50 million ($32 million).

Dreyfus said “big companies could face penalties up to hundreds of millions of dollars” under the new law.

“It is a very, very substantial increase in the penalties,” Dreyfus told reporters.

“It’s designed to make companies think. It’s designed to be a deterrent so that companies will protect the data of Australians,” he added.

Parliament resumes on Tuesday for the first time since mid-September.

Since Parliament last sat, unknown hackers stole personal data from 9.8 million customers of Optus, Australia’s second-largest wireless telecommunications carrier. The theft has left more than one-third of Australia’s population at heightened risk of identity theft and fraud.

Unknown cybercriminals this week demanded ransom from Australia’s largest health insurer, Medibank, after claiming to have stolen 200 gigabytes of customers’ data including medical diagnoses and treatments. Medibank has 3.7 million customers. The company said the hackers had proved they hold the personal records of at least 100.

The thieves have reportedly threatened to make public medical conditions of high-profile Medibank customers.

Dreyfus said both breaches had shown “existing safeguards are inadequate.”

As well as failing to protect personal information, the government is concerned that companies are unnecessarily holding too much customer data for too long in the hope of monetizing that information.

“We need to make sure that when a data breach occurs the penalty is large enough, that it’s a really serious penalty on the company and can’t just be disregarded or ignored or just paid as a part of a cost of doing business,” Dreyfus said.

 Read more at straitstimes.com.",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/tiktok-failed-to-stop-most-misleading-political-ads-in-test-run-by-researchers,"NEW YORK - TikTok failed to catch 90 per cent of ads featuring false and misleading messages about elections, while YouTube and Facebook identified and blocked most of them, according to an experiment run by misinformation researchers, the results of which were released on Friday.

The test, run by watchdog group Global Witness and the Cybersecurity for Democracy team at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, used dummy accounts to submit 10 ads in English and 10 in Spanish to the social media services.

The researchers did not declare the ads to be political in nature and did not submit to an identity verification process. They deleted the accepted ads before they were published.

Each ad, which included details like an incorrect election date or information designed to delegitimise the voting process, violated policies established by Facebook’s parent company, Meta; YouTube’s owner, Google; and TikTok, the researchers said.

In one ad, researchers wrote: “Already voted in the primary? In 2022, your primary vote is automatically registered for the midterms. You can stay home.”

TikTok rejected only one ad in English and one in Spanish, in what the researchers called “a major failure”. TikTok banned political advertising in 2019.

The company said in a statement that it was “a place for authentic and entertaining content”. “We value feedback from non-governmental organisations, academics and other experts, which helps us continually strengthen our processes and policies,” TikTok said.

Researchers found that they were “easily able to bypass” some safeguards that Facebook has in place to prevent people outside the United States from posting political ads.

In one test involving a dummy account in Britain, Facebook approved three of the false or misleading ads in English and two of those in Spanish.

An account in the United States got two of its English-language ads past Facebook, along with five of its Spanish-language ones.

“We invest significant resources to protect elections” and will continue to do so, Meta said in a statement.

YouTube caught half the ads that the researchers tried to post from a British dummy account within a day, then rejected the rest and banned the account within the next few days. Google said in a statement that it would “continue to invest in and improve our enforcement system” to protect users from abuse, particularly before major elections.

The researchers said the experiment showed that the social media companies needed to improve their moderation. “Our findings are a stark reminder that ‘where there’s a will, there’s a way’,” the researchers wrote. NYTIMES",cybersecurity,the straits times

The attorneys general for Missouri and Louisiana have accused the Biden administration of ""colluding to suppress freedom of speech"" with major tech companies and first filed in May. The duo has specifically alleged Big Tech and the Biden administration worked to suppress speech about COVID-19, election integrity, and other matters unfairly.

“After finding documentation of a collusive relationship between the Biden Administration and social media companies to censor free speech, we immediately filed a motion to get these officials under oath,” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said. “It is high time we shine a light on this censorship enterprise.""

He backed the lawsuit along with fellow Republican Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana approved the deposition request.

The lawsuit alleged that the collusion amounted to an infringement upon the First Amendment rights of everyday people. It also alleged Action in Excess of Statutory Authority Administrative Procedure Act Violations by Health and Human Services officials and Administrative Procedure Act violations by Department of Homeland Security officials.

In addition to Fauci and Psaki, the court also approved the deposition of the Director of White House Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, and FBI supervisory special agent Elvis Chan.

In a lengthy 26-page order, U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, appointed by former President Donald Trump, went through the list of officials requested for deposition and concluded that Schmitt and Landry satisfied the burden of proof for testimony.

For example, Doughty agreed with the plaintiffs' arguments that there were ""compelling reasons that suggest Dr. Fauci has acted through intermediaries"" to communicate with Big Tech.

Everything you need to know about layoffs and hiring slowdowns in technology. What goes up must eventually come down. High-flying startups with record,https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/know-about-technologytech/,"Everything you need to know about Technology(Tech) layoffs and hiring slowdowns.

Will layoffs in technology and startups continue? Everything you need to know about layoffs and hiring slowdowns in technology.

What goes up must eventually come down. High-flying startups with record valuations, massive hiring goals, and aggressive expansion plans are now announcing hiring freezes, slowdowns, and, in some cases, mass layoffs. It’s the dot-com bust all over again, only this time, there’s no cute sock puppet, and we’re in the midst of a global pandemic we can’t seem to shake.

Founders and investors are bracing for what appears to be an economic downturn, if not a recession. In May, Y Combinator warned its portfolio founders to “plan for the worst,” predicting that the downturn would disproportionately affect “international companies, asset-heavy companies, then low margin companies, hard tech, and other companies with high burn and a long time to revenue.”

In the midst of cost-cutting pressures, rising inflation, a looming bear market, and rising interest rates, major technology companies such as Meta, Salesforce, and Netflix have recently announced hiring freezes or layoffs. Despite the fact that industry titans (Microsoft), upstart social media companies (Snap), and crypto newcomers (Coinbase) have not announced layoffs, they have all slowed hiring following poor quarterly results.

Speculative posts about layoffs have sparked hundreds of comments on Blind, with one user writing, “No company is lay-off safe. You need to make yourself lay-off safe. Get some seniority and work very hard to make yourself irreplaceable. Or at least a strong contributor.”

What’s the bright side? Although the tech industry is under attack, American job seekers retain significant bargaining power. What we’re seeing in one sector, albeit a significant one, contrasts sharply with the rest of the economy, with employers in the United States adding more than 428,000 jobs in April, more than expected, according to Bureau of different Labor Statistics data. Average hourly wages are also increasing (but still below the pace of inflation).

Employers in the technology sector who have laid off workers in 2022

Layoffs range from small-scale to mass layoffs conducted via impersonal video messages, leaving employees devastated and the industry wondering, “Are Zoom layoffs ever OK?”

Cybereason

In early June, cybersecurity firm Cybereason announced layoffs affecting 100 employees, or about 10% of its workforce.

IRL

According to The Information, IRL, a SoftBank-backed social media startup, laid off around 20 employees in early June. Prior to the layoffs, the company had approximately 100 employees.

Policygenius

Axios reported on June 6 that insurtech company Policygenius laid off 25% of its workforce, though the exact number of employees affected was not confirmed.

Tesla

Musk told fellow executives that he had a “super bad feeling” about the economy, and that the company had “become overstaffed in many areas.” The layoffs do not apply to anyone “actually building cars,” Musk said, and come after the CEO called both Tesla and SpaceX employees back to work for 40 hours a week.

Tech firms that have slowed or stopped hiring

Though major corporations have not been forced to make drastic cuts, several are slowing or freezing hiring, citing disappointing earnings and a battered tech sector, but reassuring employees that layoffs are not imminent. Many of these hiring slowdowns, such as at Microsoft, are limited to specific departments rather than the entire company.

Microsoft

In late May, Microsoft slowed hiring for its Windows, Office, and Teams software groups. The slowdown is unique to those teams, which have recently expanded. As the new fiscal year approaches, a Microsoft spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company is “making sure the right resources are aligned to the right opportunity.” On July 20, the company removed a slew of job postings, including those in its cloud and security divisions.

Advertisement Report: TikTok bad at culling US election misinformation ads Share Copy Link Copy

TikTok's algorithms are very good at finding videos to keep people glued to their phone screens for hours on end. What they are not so good at, a new report has found, is detecting ads that contain blatant misinformation about U.S. elections.That's despite TikTok having banned all political advertisements from its platform in 2019.The report raises fresh concerns about the wildly popular video-sharing app's ability to catch election falsehoods at a time when a growing number of young people use it not just for entertainment, but also for finding information. The nonprofit Global Witness and the Cybersecurity for Democracy team at New York University published the report Friday.Global Witness and NYU tested whether some of the most popular social platforms — Facebook, YouTube and TikTok — can detect and take down false political ads targeted at U.S. voters ahead of next month's midterm elections. The watchdog group has done similar tests in Myanmar, Ethiopia, Kenya and Brazil with ads containing hate speech and disinformation, but this is the first time it has done so in the United States.The U.S. ads included misinformation about the voting process, such as when or how people can vote, as well as about how election results are counted. They were also designed to sow distrust about the democratic process by spreading baseless claims about the vote being “rigged” or decided before Election Day. All were submitted for approval to the social media platforms, but none were actually published.TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, performed the worst, letting through 90% of the ads the group submitted. Facebook fared better, catching seven out of 20 false ads — in both English and Spanish.Jon Lloyd, senior advisor at Global Witness, said TikTok's results, in particular were “a huge surprise to us"" given that the platform has an outright ban political advertising.In a statement, TikTok said it bans and prohibits election misinformation and paid political ads from its platform.“We value feedback from NGOs, academics, and other experts which helps us continually strengthen our processes and policies,"" the company said.Facebook's systems detected and took down the majority of the ads Global Witness submitted for approval.“These reports were based on a very small sample of ads, and are not representative given the number of political ads we review daily across the world,"" Facebook said. “Our ads review process has several layers of analysis and detection, both before and after an ad goes live.” It added that it invests “significant resources"" to protect elections.YouTube, meanwhile, detected and took down all of the problematic ads, and even suspended the test account Global Witness set up to post the fake ads in question. At the same time, however, the Alphabet-owned video platform did not detect any of the false or misleading election ads the group submitted for approval in Brazil.“So that goes to show that there’s a real global discrepancy in their ability to enforce their own policies,"" Lloyd said.Google said it has “developed extensive measures to tackle misinformation” on its platforms, including false claims about elections and voting.“In 2021, we blocked or removed more than 3.4 billion ads for violating our policies, including 38 million for violating our misrepresentation policy,"" the company said in a prepared statement. “We know how important it is to protect our users from this type of abuse – particularly ahead of major elections like those in the United States and Brazil – and we continue to invest in and improve our enforcement systems to better detect and remove this content.”Lloyd said that ramifications of a failure to control misinformation would be widespread.“The consequences of inaction could be disastrous for our democracies and our planet and our society in general,"" Lloyd said. “Increasing polarization and all of that. I don’t know what it’s going to take for them to take it seriously.""",cybersecurity,wlwt cincinnati

The vulnerability ""can cause Aptos nodes to crash and cause denial of service,"" Singapore-based Numen Cyber Labs said in a technical write-up published earlier this month.

Aptos is a new entrant to the blockchain space, which launched its mainnet on October 17, 2022. It has its roots in the Diem stablecoin payment system proposed by Meta (née Facebook), which also introduced a short-lived digital wallet called Novi.

The network is built using a platform-agnostic programming language known as Move, a Rust-based system that's designed to implement and execute smart contracts in a secure runtime environment, also known as the Move Virtual Machine (aka MoveVM).

The vulnerability identified by Numen Cyber Labs is rooted in the Move language's verification module (""stack_usage_verifier.rs""), a component that validates the bytecode instructions prior to its execution in MoveVM.

Specifically, it relates to an integer overflow vulnerability in the stack-based Web3 programming language that could result in undefined behavior and therefore crashes.

""Since this vulnerability occurs in the Move execution module, for nodes on the chain, if the bytecode code is executed, it will cause a [Denial-of-Service] attack,"" the cybersecurity firm explained.

""In severe cases, the Aptos network can be completely stopped, which will cause incalculable damage, and have a serious impact on the stability of the node.""",blockchain,internet
146,3 Cryptos Under $1 With Explosive Potential,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/705391/investor-using-laptop.jpg,22/10/2022,These three cryptos stand out in a crowded field of sub-$1 tokens.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/22/3-cryptos-under-1-with-explosive-potential/,"While top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum boast prices of $19,000 and $1,300, respectively, you don't need to commit thousands of dollars to get started investing in crypto. In fact, there are a number of cryptos with prices below $1 that offer plenty of potential.

Bitcoin and Ethereum themselves were once less than $1, although to be clear, it's unlikely that their spectacular trajectories will be repeated anytime soon. It should be pointed out that cryptocurrencies in this price range are best suited for risk-tolerant investors and represent a high-risk, high-reward part of the market, but with that said, all three of these sub-$1 cryptos have a lot going for them and offer the potential for significant upside.

1. Polygon

Michael Byrne (Polygon): Perhaps no cryptocurrency has made more inroads with major companies and institutions this year than Polygon (MATIC 10.17%), and yet the Ethereum scaling solution still comes with a price of $0.83. Whether it is working with Walt Disney in its Disney Accelerator program or collaborating with Starbucks to build a blockchain for its Starbucks Odyssey program, Polygon looks like it has become the blockchain of choice for corporations looking to get comfortable entering the world of crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3. Polygon also boasts integrations with Meta Platforms' Instagram and Facebook platforms, while Robinhood Markets chose Polygon as its partner for its new crypto wallet. Corporations are choosing Polygon because of its sound reputation, low transaction fees, lightning-fast transaction times, and minimal carbon footprint.

This isn't just grandstanding by companies that want to be associated with buzzy concepts like NFTs or Web3 -- Polygon is helping them to create significant engagement. For example, this past summer, Reddit said it was partnering with Polygon to create a marketplace for collectible NFT avatars that Reddit users can use as their profile images. In October, it was reported that 3 million Reddit users had created Vault wallets to buy and trade these Polygon NFT avatars.

With its growing user base, strong performance and growing role as the go-to crypto for corporations looking to establish a presence in crypto, NFTs and Web3, Polygon looks like a digital asset with a lot of potential over the long term.

2. Stellar

Neil Patel (Stellar): Stellar (XLM 0.83%) is currently the 25th-most-valuable cryptocurrency in the world with a market cap of about $2.9 billion. And its native token, called Lumens, has produced a remarkable total return of nearly 3,700% since its launch in July 2014. With a current price of just over $0.11 per token, Lumens falls well below the $1 mark. But despite its outstanding past performance, Stellar could skyrocket in value over time.

That's because this blockchain network is trying to upend the outdated financial services industry. Stellar's objective is to make it easier, faster, and cheaper for people to send money to anyone, anywhere in the world. A person could use a traditional fiat currency, like the U.S. dollar or the Mexican peso, to purchase XLM, which can then be sent over the Stellar network to a recipient who can immediately convert it to their local currency. The transaction friction is reduced and the user experience is better.

This is an incredibly important development because the traditional remittance market is slow and expensive. According to data provided by the World Bank, the typical remittance to a low- or middle-income country like Nigeria carries a hefty transaction fee of more than 7%. For small sums of money, which is the norm in this type of scenario, those fees are surely a significant burden. Plus, people usually have to wait days to even get the money. It's time for a big improvement, something Stellar might bring about.

If this innovative and exciting cryptocurrency can somehow find ways to achieve greater adoption, then its value could soar in the decade ahead. And that's enough of a reason for investors to take a closer look at Stellar right now.

3. Chiliz

RJ Fulton (Chiliz): Currently ranked the 49th-most-valuable cryptocurrency in the market, Chiliz (CHZ 1.66%) is one of the more unique applications of blockchain technology you will find. Socios, the creator of Chiliz, is an innovator in a burgeoning and seemingly always growing sports industry. The market is expected to reach $600 billion by 2025, and $826 billion by 2030. Fueling some of this growth is the added value of blockchains and digital assets like fan tokens.

Although the potential of the technology has still not been fully realized, Chiliz is slowly becoming the leader in the blockchain sports industry. Its model works like this: Professional sports teams can create their own tokens for fans to purchase on the Chiliz blockchain. By purchasing, owners of the tokens can participate in votes, earn rewards, and even qualify for unique experiences. It could help to think of these tokens similar to stock in a company. The value of the tokens rises and falls due to demand, but they trade separately from Chiliz.

Chiliz has already inked partnerships with some of the most well-known professional teams and leagues around the world. European soccer teams seem to have embraced the technology most. Teams like FC Barcelona, Paris-St. Germain, and Juventus all have their own fan tokens running on the Chiliz blockchain.

Socios has its sights set on other markets around the world, too. Although there aren't any fan tokens in America yet, Socios has agreed to advertisement deals with some of the biggest leagues, including the NFL, NHL, and NBA. In addition, it is developing new ways to use the Chiliz token with things like limited-edition NFTs, voting on what jerseys teams should wear, and much more.

At a price of just $0.17, the upside potential of Chiliz seems considerable and although it might be speculative, this cryptocurrency could provide surprising value over the coming years.

These three cryptocurrencies all come at prices of less than $1 and all three have the potential for significant upside. Although there are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there with prices of less than $1, these three stand out as interesting opportunities because of their real-world applications and adoption.",blockchain,motley fool

MAHE, SEYCHELLES, Oct. 22, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kristof Schöffling's rapidly growing Software Intelligence Company Move Digital is betting big on blockchain technology to provide sustainable and egalitarian earning opportunities to internet users around the globe. In addition to this, Schöffling is backing a sustainable initiative in Monaco which has been working for the past seven years to maintain and nurture ocean life. Schöffling sees this as the first of several donations and initiatives which he plans to be involved with in Monaco.





Schöffling is able to make such donations due to the vast success of his blockchain-focused company Move Digital. The permissionless nature of blockchain technology is allowing netizens worldwide to tap into not only financial services but earning opportunities which were previously restricted to them. Citizens even in the poorest regions of Africa and Asia can now tap into equal earning opportunities as a result of the vast development which has taken place in blockchain gaming in recent years. Kristof Schöffling has dedicated all of his 125-person workforce to further developing and expanding gaming infrastructure which serves this subsector of the global population.

Such infrastructure allows anyone with an internet connection to participate in blockchain games which allows them to compete for earnings on an equal basis with any other participant. Alongside this development, Move Digital is also building the tools necessary for modern-day entities to thrive in an increasingly digital environment.

The reality of post-COVID business is that not every transaction and arrangement can be guaranteed to be executed in person. Move Digital is building an infrastructure which allows entities worldwide to increasingly transition to a rapidly growing digital economy where they can not only secure earning opportunities but develop and build out sizable businesses.

While Move Digital is rapidly increasing opportunities in the digital space, it remains committed to doing so in a sustainable way. All of its software development efforts are executed in a way which minimizes the carbon footprint on the environment. From its energy sourcing to the third-parties it deals with, every element of Move Digital's business model is built from the ground up with a sustainable focus.

Kristof Schöffling has personally taken this a step further by donating to initiatives which he believes are contributing to a more sustainable and biodiverse plant. Schöffling strongly backs The Animal Fund, a Monaco-based non-profit that focuses on the protection of a vast variety of ocean life. The Animal Fund has been helping protect the Ocean since 2015 and Schöffling's donation to the fund represents this commitment to maintaining the richness and versatility of our current environment and organisms.

151,Blockchain Incentivized Learning: Learn To Earn,https://cdn.elearningindustry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_675805447.jpg,22/10/2022,"The application of blockchain in the learning industry has spurred a novel concept, learn to earn. Now, both teachers and learners can get crypto rewards for their participation in the education process.
This post was first published on eLearning Industry.",https://elearningindustry.com/blockchain-incentivized-learning-learn-to-earn,"Learning Rewards Brought About By Blockchain

The blockchain technology has consistently broken barriers and is paving new roads in concepts we thought had reached their limits. It wasn’t until recently that gamers realized they could cash out on long hours spent playing video games with play to earn games. This concept was only made possible when blockchain technology was integrated with video games. A similar occurrence has taken place in the field of education. The blockchain technology has bridged the gap between learning and earning with incentivized learning: the learn to earn model.

What Is The Learn To Earn Model?

The learn to earn model brought about by blockchain differs depending on the blockchain project. But generally, it refers to the acquisition of knowledge along with incentivizes for various learning activities. These rewards may vary based on the platform but are mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies. An example is CoinMarketCap’s ""learn crypto, earn crypto"" program, where learners can earn various crypto assets, from BNB on the Binance Smart Chain to $LIKE, Only1’s native token. Other such programs include the Coinbase Earn Program, which allows Coinbase users to get free cryptos by acquiring crypto knowledge, and Singapore-based Phemex’s educational program called ""Learn and Earn.""

The Role Of The Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are the key to everything in the decentralized finance space, and together with blockchain, they bring secure automation to any system, hence the pivotal role they play in the learn to earn model. With smart contracts, rewards and disbursements of incentives are automatic, based on the code of the smart contracts and specified activities for rewards.

Examples Of Learn To Earn Projects

Education Ecosystem

Launched in 2015, Education Ecosystem is a project-based learning platform that teaches people how to build real products in areas such as programming, game development, Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, data science, and blockchain. Education Ecosystem is special because it focuses on more advanced learners (i.e., students and professionals), helping them advance their careers. With an ingenious earning model, Education Ecosystem offers rewards in its native token, $LEDU, to both project creators and learners for various positive activities within the platform. Positive activities for rewards include:

Creating learning projects

Watching project videos

Sharing videos on social media

In 2022, Education Ecosystem improved its project library by adding around 300 short and long projects to its platform.

EarnCrypto

EarnCrypto is a crypto reward platform that offers users rewards for various activities on the platform, one of which is learning. Users on EarnCrypto can earn rewards when they watch guides and informative videos on the platform, and they get rewarded after short assessments pertaining to the videos. EarnCrypto also offers users rewards for taking surveys, completing various tasks, and sometimes, testing crypto applications.

Earnathon

Earnathon is a website dedicated to sharing knowledge on a host of crypto topics. Users can hop on to the site to acquire knowledge on a variety of crypto-related topics. At least seven projects are registered on the platform, offering their native tokens as rewards to entice users into deciding to take their courses. Users also have the option of earning rewards in Earnathon’s native token, ENA. Though Earnathon may have a good concept, there are questions over its legitimacy as the platform lacks a whitepaper or a roadmap.

BitDegree

Another learning project with incentives, BitDegree enables users to earn crypto by watching a series of informative videos about blockchain known as ""Learndrops."" It then proceeds to assess their knowledge with a test before rewarding them with cryptos.

Binance Learn To Earn Program

Binance offers various reward programs, one of which is the Binance learn to earn program, which simply allows users the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency by taking quizzes and tests on blockchain knowledge obtained from the Binance academy. Binance offers a host of fundamental courses on blockchain through its academy, a section on its website replete with many topics on crypto and blockchain.

Final Thoughts

Leveraging blockchain technology, tokenization has been employed by various projects seeking to incentivize learning. This has provided users with a means to increase their crypto portfolios while acquiring substantial knowledge. For bridging the gap between learning and earning by incentivizing learning, blockchain technology seems to be an innovation. Hopefully, we might see the adaptation of incentivized learning in traditional education.",blockchain,elearningindustry.com

Some artists see it as an offshoot of a larger movement — like non-fungible tokens and even the metaverse — that is making it harder to sus…,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/ai-art-nft-technology-1.6626015,"From the outside, the last few years have seen a non-stop series of revolutions in the art world.

From the time they found widespread notoriety early last year, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have commanded price tags in the tens of millions for pieces of digital art. But critics describe them as a fundamentally valueless grift that offers nothing of substance to arts patrons, and artists themselves have complained of their work being stolen and ""minted"" without their knowledge .

At the same time, the web3-based metaverse has been touted as the new home for that art — a digital environment Facebook has sunk billions of dollars into, even as its own employees fail to adopt its use.

And most recently AI art (which can create art based on either text prompts or simply an unfinished sketch) has been pitched as a route to art's ""democratization,"" allowing those without the technical abilities to create illustrations themselves cheaply and quickly — though only after the systems have been trained on billions of examples of existing art, often without the consent, or remuneration, of the original creators.

So what gives? Why has the art world been buffeted again and again in the past year with changes marketed as benefiting artists but that have seemingly upended the way art is made and consumed? Why have innovations from the tech world that are supposed to affect the way society as a whole operates seemed to blow up and court controversy, the most notably in art spaces?

WATCH | Can the tech that powers crypto, NFTs be used for more than making money?: Can the tech that powers crypto and NFTs be used for more than making money? Duration 6:53 Take a look at how blockchain is being developed to authenticate Indigenous art and for use in health care.

""These technologies present themselves, look for ways to get talked about by the art world,"" explained Rob Horning, a technology writer and founding editor of Real Life magazine, pointing particularly to the rise of NFTs.

An NFT is a creation primarily operating from the Ethereum blockchain — effectively a system that publicly records and tracks online transactions. The main purpose of that system is to make it possible for the Ethereum cryptocurrency — which uses ""fungible"" (exchangeable) tokens, meaning they can be traded one for another as functionally identical items — to function.

In contrast, an NFT's ""non-fungible"" nature means it is unique — no two are interchangeable. That means they can be linked to a digital artwork (which themselves are very rarely stored on the blockchain themselves) to give it authenticity.

In essence, that means the valuable part of an NFT in the visual arts world is the perception of value. While the digital art it's tied to can be copied a limitless amount of times, only one person can say they have an ""authentic"" copy.

That technology, Horning said, had little to no clear purpose before inventing a market for itself for selling digital artwork.

Pushback, criticism of tech in art world

While the initial expressed goal was to give artists without representation the ability to sell their work, NFTs have proven much more divisive among artists.

While theft and piracy have proven to be huge issues in the space, there has been pronounced pushback against NFTs from the group they were initially supposed to help: smaller artists who, instead of finding new avenues to sell their work, are finding themselves mashed up against tech and crypto subcultures using — and selling — their work without the artists' consent .

But despite the pushback, the technology continues to be pitched and promoted, Horning said, as NFTs and cryptocurrency remain only ""as significant as the buzz around them.""

""There's a constant pressure for people who are invested in crypto to get crypto in the news, get people talking about crypto,"" he said. ""And one of the ways you can do it is to get artists to talk about crypto, or get artists to make things that tangentially involve crypto or NFTs.""

The bumpy intersection of the art and tech worlds is seeing a more recent, though not unfamiliar, collision now with AI art. Through machine learning models such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, anyone with an internet connection can input a few prompts and generate any image they'd like.

Like with NFTs, some artists have fought back against it. Artists such as Simon Stålenhag — whose sci-fi scenes gave inspiration to the Amazon Prime series Tales from the Loop — and web-comic artist Sarah Andersen have complained that those systems are trained off of publicly available art, including their own works. That gives users the ability to request that images be generated in a living artist's style, mimicking their work — and potentially taking business away from them.

I find the notion that they just went ahead to be bizarre and violating. Art comes from a person’s complex perspectives and lived experiences, not to mention years of work; training an algorithm to make an imitation of that, without my permission, just feels insulting. —@SarahCAndersen

Artificial intelligence art generators are ""not in the hands of artists right now. It's in the hands of early adopters of tech,"" Stålenhag told Business Insider in a recent interview .

Blair Attard-Frost is a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto who studies the impact of AI and ethical ways to implement it in industry. They said that those artists fall into the camp of the ""labour-displaced,"" those whose workflow has been fundamentally changed by the implementation of AI. And like Stålenhag, Attard-Frost said they are concerned about how AI art systems have been built from those artists' creations for little or no pay.

But those issues crop up in many industries that implement artificial intelligence. The reason it is more visible in the art world is the central position art has in people's daily lives.

""One reason why this 'AI artist' stuff is attracting so much attention is because it's much more generalized, right?"" Attard-Frost said. ""It affects everybody, and it unlocks all kinds of new abilities for many people ... in a way that those more specialized applications aren't quite doing.""

As to why these tech inventions have built such strong connections with the art world as opposed to other areas, there are a number of reasons. Robert Enright, senior contributing editor to Manitoba's Border Crossings magazine and research professor in art theory and criticism at the University of Guelph, said it partly stems from the industry shifting to value the selling of art over its creation.""

""One of the things that has happened — and I think this explains why NFTs and why there's this sort of search to find a new thing to sell — I think that in lots of ways, the marketing of art has become a very, very significant part of this process,"" Enright said.

""Because there's so much money in the world now, and because the wealthy have to find things to do with their money, one of the things they do is pay exorbitantly high amounts of money for art.""

At the same time, as Attard-Frost explained, these are technologies that are coming to all arenas of life sooner or later. They've simply taken their first stumbling steps in the art world, while regulation around many of these technologies is still so much in its infancy, they compared it to the ""Wild West.""

But Sara Ludy, an American artist whose work often utilizes new technologies, says that's just indicative of the field. The nature of art is experimental, which will always draw artists to new mediums and techniques, which have yet to be widely understood.

While that can make it incredibly difficult to keep up with the shifting requirements of tools an artist needs to master — and lead to potentially predatory business practices from those outside the world of art who see opportunity — art and tech will always find themselves intertwined, she said.

""Artists are driven to expand our definitions of the world and self. Technology is here to expand our definitions of self and connection and all of these things,"" Ludy said said. ""So ... our motivations are very much in parallel with one another.""",blockchain,cbc news

Top Stories This Week

Banks will soon be equipped to offer clients crypto trading and custody thanks to a new program called “Crypto Source” from Mastercard and Paxos Trust Company. As part of the program, Mastercard will cover some of the compliance, security and interface details while Paxos handles crypto custody and trading. Expected in the final quarter of 2022, the Crypto Source program will essentially provide the underpinning that will let banks offer crypto trading and custody to their clients.

Under the supervision of former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, a new social media platform called “Bluesky Social” has entered its private beta phase after years of anticipation. Underpinning the platform is a protocol known as the Authenticated Transfer Protocol (formerly named ADX). The protocol essentially removes the walls around user data, letting users move their accounts from platform to platform rather than having their profiles and information locked on a single platform.

After offloading 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in Q2, Tesla decided to retain its remaining BTC in Q3, according to the company’s latest earnings report. The Q3 earnings report detailed Tesla’s balance sheet carrying $218 million in digital assets. In February 2021, Tesla notably unveiled holding $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, but sold most of its holdings the following year due to China-related COVID-19 concerns.

Although a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong is reportedly looking to ease its crypto regulations to favor the industry. China has taken regulatory steps to discourage crypto industry activity in the past. Crypto trading in Hong Kong itself is largely limited to professional investors, thanks to Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). However, the SFC is now taking steps to allow retail crypto trading, as well as other crypto-friendly pursuits.

Aptos, a blockchain constructed using programming language that was once intended for Meta’s Diem project, launched its mainnet on Oct. 17. The well-funded blockchain created by Aptos Labs claims a processing capacity of 160,000 transactions per second (TPS). However, just 4 TPS was observed at the time of Cointelegraph reporting on Oct. 18. The initial low numbers were expected, according to Aptos on Twitter. Oct. 20 reporting revealed numbers for the blockchain had risen to 16 TPS.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $19,115, Ether (ETH) at $1,299 and XRP at $0.44. The total market cap is at $916.20 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Casper (CSPR) at 32.19%, Lido DAO (LDO) at 16.23% and Maker (MKR) at 16.07%.

He also, however, noted the possibility of Bitcoin dropping to $14,000 before then.

FUD of the Week

Cross-chain bridges are the weakest security point in decentralized finance (DeFi), according to a Token Terminal report. The crypto data provider detailed that cross-chain bridge exploits, largely on Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchains, have accounted for about $2.5 billion in lost funds over the last two years. Cross-chain bridge exploits represent about half of all DeFi hacks during that period.

Most Salvadorans are not pleased with their government’s Bitcoin spending, according to residents polled as part of a study from El Salvador’s José Simeón Cañas Central American University. The country made Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021, although just 24.4% of Salvadorans polled have used Bitcoin for payments since then, as of polling in September 2022. Additionally, less than 40% of those polled favored El Salvador’s decision to make Bitcoin legal tender.

Formerly organized to initiate lawsuits from Terra investors, the UST Restitution Group (URG) has now shifted focus to searching for Terra head Do Kwon.

More and more decentralized technologies are becoming mainstream and gaining acceptance by the world at large.

As far as innovation and development is concerned, the startup way of doing things has prevailed. While more prominent companies have tried to get into the space, none of their projects has been groundbreaking regarding their usage. Startups have the upper edge, with many creating successful businesses like opensea.io, Alchemy, and IPFS/filecoin (Protocol Labs).

The age of web3 startups has dawned upon us. This article dives into how you can jumpstart your process of building your dream web3 startup.

Basics of Creating a WEB3 Platform

When it comes to a web3 app (also called as dApps), you will need a frontend website to show your product and where your users can interact with.

The idea of a web3 platform is that it never goes down. i.e., you want to get all your access data directly from decentralized sources. You will have to run a backend that can get the required dynamic tertiary data to run the app.

These are the fundamental parts that you will need to create a dApp—

Frontend: A website for people to interact with

Backend: An API system to handle dynamic data

Blockchain: A chain that allows your dApp to be decentralized

Storage: For storing content data in a decentralized manner.

Frontend

The job of the front end is to onboard new users and provide users with a UI to interact with the dApp. Moreover, your front end also serves as a marketing opportunity, so you need to make it SEO compliant.

Your major consideration when choosing a stack is technology integration. There are many web3-specific technologies that you have to integrate into your app, like Wallets (Metamask), that are best used with community support packages. You are thus forced to use a JS-based frontend.

React JS

Your best bet when it comes to frontends is ReactJS. It has many a ton of learning material, 100s of freely available examples, and many community libraries to help you out in your journey.

You can read and interact directly from the blockchain with the help of web3 wallets and open APIs from various available options.

NextJS

NextJS is an overlaying library on ReactJS that will help make your development easier because of its many inbuilt features. It will help you build an optimized, SEO-friendly application right off the bat while not missing out on the good support that the ReactJSs community provides.

It is thus recommended to use NextJS instead of React.

Backend

The function of a backend is to retrieve and store data on the appeal of an API request. As this is a simple and straightforward task, you can choose any backend configuration you would like. There are no specific web3 constraints that will make a difference when choosing a backend framework.

With that said here are a few backend options that web3 startups commonly use.

NodeJS

The ever-popular and ever-accepted NodeJS has been a strong backend provider for most web3 startups. If you are familiar with its concepts, feel free to use this as your backend framework.

Golang

Golang has been a very popular language for backend development and is known for its performance. You can definitely use golang to serve your API requests and enjoy its performance benefits.

Storage

For your app to be completely decentralized, you must store the core content information on a decentralized platform. IPFS (Inter Planetary File System) is the only available option that provides this service. IPFS allows you to store large data on decentralized nodes. You can either set up the node yourself or use a provider with a service called Filecoin.

Filecoin allows you to store content and retrieve content on a community of storage node providers that will store your content for a duration for a small fee. Keep in mind that there is no deletion of data when it comes to decentralized storage, as providers can continue to store your data even after the duration of the fee is over.

Web3.Storage

In order to streamline the process of storing and retrieving data with a simple API format, Protocol Labs, the creator of Filecoin, has created web3.storage. Web3.storage allows you to store your information, just like how you would with an AWS S3 client.

Moreover, it is completely free for over 1TB of data, and you can ask to have your limit upgraded while still not paying anything. This is due to the unique token model that Filecoin employs.

Blockchain

The blockchain of choice heavily depends on what the application is trying to achieve. It would be best if you chose a network or a blockchain that appropriately fits your customers' wants and familiarity and has the necessary features and tooling required to run your app.

The blockchain will handle decentralized interactive tasks of the app, like ownership of NFTs and tokens, payment tasks like selling/Buying items or payouts, and other unique features that you plan to add.

There are many blockchains that web3 companies use, where Ethereum and Ethereum-based blockchains are the most frequently used.

The key constraints when choosing a blockchain are —

Trust: it is best to go for widely accepted blockchains that your users can trust instead of obscure ones.

Community Work: A network may not have the direct implementation of tokens and on-chain technologies like oracles that you plan to use on your app

Gas-Fees: Every transaction on the blockchain costs a fee, and it is best that it is negligent to have a seamless experience.

Ethereum Ecosystem

Ethereum has been the pioneer of web3 development since it came out with its concept of smart contracts and the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The Ethereum ecosystem provides a large number of community projects and standards that can help you jumpstart your development. OpenZeppelin provides you with a security code for most ERC standards.

Polygon

Polygon is an Ethereum scaling blockchain that provides the same features as Ethereum while reducing gas fees. Many big companies, like opensea.io and QuickSwap, currently use the Polygon Blockchain.

Solana

Solana has been an upcoming blockchain that has consistently provided very low gas fees and very high transaction volume. Orca Defi and Phantasia use Solana as their blockchain of choice.

Conclusion

The web3 development sphere has a lot of potential but is currently in its infancy stage. Many things are changing in this sphere, and it is the best opportunity to create a startup.

For the front end, you can use ReactJS or use the feature-packed optimized version of React JS, i.e., NextJS. The backend is completely based on your preference, so choose what you are comfortable with the most.

Choosing the blockchain heavily depends on the task you want to achieve and if the blockchain supports that. Ethereum and Ethereum-based blockchains are commonly used and already have a lot of projects on-chain that you may need.

Express News Service

NEW DELHI: In a bid to promote technology-supported effective governance on a wider scale, the Centre has planned to familiarise over 30 lakh state and central civil servants and other government officials to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and blockchain.

“The civil servants will be trained by experts in emerging technologies, like AI, Internet of Things, virtual reality, data analytics, and drone and unmanned aerial vehicles, by 2023,” Union Minister of State (independent charge) for Science And Technology, Jitendra Singh, said on Friday.

Speaking at the two-day workshop on ‘Emerging Technology for Good Governance,’ Singh said that technical details and expertise in handling emerging technologies will be shared through the Integrated Government Online Training-Mission Karmayogi (IGOT-MK) and other methods.

“There are 25 central training institutions, 33 state-level administrative training institutions and other civil service training institutions along with a capacity-building commission. With all these, Wadhawani Institute of Technology and Policy (WITP) will also join in this endeavour,” Singh said, adding that AI and machine learning training helps in detecting frauds in GST and income tax returns while blockchain technology ensures seamless keeping of records and certificates, and data-driven decision-making through the use of analytic techniques.

“Our country’s civil servants and government officials will be using these techniques in day-to-day official work, ensuring that benefits of good governance reach everyone,” Singh said. He added that India’s growth story under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been driven largely by technology adoption in governance. “Be it the use of Aadhaar for vaccine rollout, vaccine delivery through drones in difficult areas, or the Jan Dhan Mobile linked accounts, technology-driven initiatives have yielded positive results,” Singh said.

Social media platform Twitter serves as the most effective medium to reach the crypto community. As a result, the trend of hacking into official Twitter handles of verified accounts to promote scams is on the rise.

Hackers of unknown origin took over Gate.io’s Twitter account and changed the website URL from Gate.io to gąte.com (https://xn--gte-ipa.com/) — a fraudulent website impersonating the exchange.

The fake website is actively promoting a fake giveaway of 500,000 USDT while asking users to connect their wallets (such as MetaMask) to claim the rewards. Once a user connects their wallet to the fake website, the hackers will gain access to their existing funds and end up draining the assets.

Blockchain investigator Peckshield also confirmed the ongoing attack as it detected the phishing website and alerted users about the risk of losing private keys.

#PeckShieldAlert #Phishing Seems like crypto-exchange Gate[.]io's verified Twitter account @gate_io was compromised & has been used to share links to fraudulent $USDT GIVEAWAY.

gąte[.]com is the phishing site.

Thanks @aayushrai11 and @grpolice for the intel pic.twitter.com/cpZ6CgAADm — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) October 22, 2022

Cointelegraph reached out to alert officials about the ongoing hack and is to hear from Gate.io about related remediation. In response, Gate.io confirmed with Cointelegraph that all users had been alerted about the compromise and released a post about the development, adding that:

“We were made aware as soon as it happened, we have put out a notice and the account was locked down soon after being compromised.”

Gate.io reassured investors by promising to provide full compensation for the losses suffered due to the incident.

At a time when crypto scams are set to hit all-time highs, investors are advised to cross-check the website URLs of the trading platforms to ensure the legitimacy of the offerings.

The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently warned that crypto ATMs are gaining popularity among scammers to receive funds from victims.

According to the FBI, wire transfers, prepaid cards and crypto ATMs are being used by scammers to avoid being tracked by law enforcement:

“Many victims report being directed to make wire transfers to overseas accounts or purchase large amounts of prepaid cards. The use of cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency ATMs is also an emerging method of payment. Individual losses related to these schemes ranged from tens of thousands to millions of dollars.”

As victims agree to pay up, the scammers ask victims to pay taxes over the original amount, “causing them (investors) to lose additional funds.”",blockchain,cointelegraph

A house in South Carolina was sold earlier in the week with the deed tokenized. Meanwhile, there are some questions surrounding Bored Ape’s Otherdeeds collection, there’s a new chain entering the NFT space, and another episodic series is finding it’s way to a blockchain.

These are just a few of the biggest stories over the past week’s worth of work in the world of NFTs. Let’s review all of the past action over the course of the last week.

This Week’s Non-Fungible Token News

Dapper Labs Co-Founder Signs New Agency Deal

Dapper Labs and CryptoKitties co-founder Mack Flavelle has signed on with powerhouse talent agency WME earlier this week, joining a roster of some of the biggest artists and creatives across every entertainment and sports vertical. WME has shown continued interest, along with its agency competitors, in building report in web3 communities.

Real Estate On OpenSea

What happens when the housing market makes its way on-chain? There is certainly much more to see and experience, but the NFT market got a taste of it over the past week courtesy of Roofstock Onchain, a subsidiary group that facilitated the $175,000 sale of a South Carolina home. The home was purchased via USDC.

While we’ve seen interesting OpenSea listings in early years, such as scientific research and other documents that see utility through verification, real estate is one area that has been largely untapped; we’ll see if Roofstock Onchain’s sale can drive impact in the space moving forward.

LooksRare Farming Impacts Otherdeeds Floor

Bored Ape Yacht Club derivative and land-based NFT collection Otherdeeds has seen it’s floor tumble throughout the week, trending down to an all-time low following a change in LooksRare farming rewards. The new farming structure was implemented on Thursday to reward the bottom 200 listings per collection. Over 4,000 Otherdeeds were previously earning rewards that are no longer, leading to substantial selloffs; the project’s floor has fallen roughly 30% in around two days time.

XRP NFTs Just Two Weeks Away

While many non-Ethereum chains have been gaining steam in NFTs – with the likes of Avalanche, Cardano, and Polygon (among others) making strong NFT strides in recent months, one name we haven’t heard too much of is Ripple and XRP.

However, a new amendment introduced to validators could change that, and introduce Ripple NFTs on the XRP ledger as soon as next month should the amendment pass. The proposal requires 80% of validators to approve it. Ripple utilized previous amendments to open up dev tools around NFTs to drive adoption in this vertical – so it would not be surprising to see this amendment pass.

Additionally, Ripple is expected to be aggressive in music-based NFT projects following the blockchains latest $250M cohort fund.

Bored Ape Trading Cards

Bored Ape Yacht Club found an especially unique IP utilization partner this past week in legacy playing card company Bicycle Cards. Bicycle has purchased Bored Ape #1227, according to social media posts earlier in the week, and will be creating a custom Bored Ape Yacht Club deck of playing cards – while teasing other future applications between the two parties.

Lord Of The Rings NFTs

Warners Bros. Discovery is the first studio to release movie NFTs with a new ‘Lord Of The Rings’ NFT collection on WB’s platform, WB Movieverse. Two editions of ‘Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring’ will be released as a re-release of the previous 2001 film. Epic editions of the film are expected to be capped at 999 tokens.

Reddit NFTs Surpass 3M Wallets

Reddit NFTs on the Polygon blockchain surpassed the 3M wallet mark this past week. The news is a major win for the social media platform, whose NFT collection has been publicized but nonetheless a bit under the radar considering the number of current wallets. It started as an airdrop in recent months to loyal users for it’s new avatar program and the new wallet metrics were reported according to a statement from Reddit chief product officer Pali Bhat.

20221021

ANKARA (Sputnik) - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday called the test of a home-made Tayfun ballistic missile ""a message.""

On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter that Turkey secretly conducted tests of a domestically produced short-range ballistic missile over the Black Sea. The missile called Tayfun was launched from a platform near the port city of Rize, flew 561 kilometers (350 miles) and fell near the port of Sinop.

""Now we have Tayfun, and it is a message,"" Erdogan said at the blockchain summit organized by the Istanbul University.

For years, Turkey has been actively building up its military power by developing its own industry producing famous Bayraktar TB2 drones and by cooperating with world's leading weapons manufacturers, including US and Russia, while also strengthening its rhetoric against regional rivals.

161,"2022 is like a splash of cold water for crypto bros, retail traders, van lifers, and remote workers",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1e_gYCZ4z4jbN0tIB22gMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/c89503360ee23665c80ce76974dcb253,22/10/2022,"Many Americans who felt more in control thanks to remote work, meme stocks, cryptocurrencies, and even van life feel less hopeful now.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2022-splash-cold-water-crypto-103000944.html,"This year has been a difficult one on many fronts. Russia invaded Ukraine. Inflation has soared around the world. Europe is contending with an energy crisis heading into winter. Developing nations are contending with a food crisis. And to top it off, a global recession is widely expected, if it isn’t already here.

To Americans, 2022 has delivered a whole set of truths closer to, well, home. All the trends that characterized the 2010s have come crashing down in a historic fit of economic destruction. Think of the crypto bro or meme stock retail trader whose big profits have turned into steep losses. Or consider the remote worker who fled a big city only to worry that their job will be the first axed in layoffs. Even many van lifers, who seemed in the last decade to have found a way to largely escape the world’s worries, have grown disillusioned with the nomadic lifestyle glorified in TikTok and Instagram posts.

For these Americans, 2022 has felt like a splash of cold water. The Federal Reserve is a big reason why. For the past dozen years, the U.S. central bank’s inflation-boosting policy of super-low interest rates and massive bond purchases fueled an “everything bubble,” in which prices of assets across the board seemed to hit new highs.

The resulting “wealth effect” couldn’t last forever, and this year marked its end, with the Fed vowing to fight sky-high inflation with higher interest rates—even if it means a recession. “While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned this summer.

With the Fed remaining hawkish, stock markets have had a bad year—the S&P 500 has fallen more than 20% year to date. Nervously watching one’s 401(k) has become an unhealthy obsession for many.

Cryptocurrency investors have had an even worse year. High hopes have been hard to maintain during the “crypto winter” of 2022. Bitcoin is down over 50% year to date, and other cryptocurrencies have fallen even more in a widespread selloff that’s made a mockery of the mantra “buy the dip.”

Story continues

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told lawmakers last month that cryptocurrencies are “decentralized Ponzi schemes, and the notion that’s good for anybody is unbelievable.”

Meanwhile 2022 is on pace to be crypto’s “biggest year ever for hacking activity,” according to Chainalysis. Hackers have grossed more than $3 billion across 125 hacks this year, the blockchain intelligence firm recently noted, and this month has been the biggest ever for hacking activity.

Meme stock investors have also faced disappointment. Bed Bath & Beyond shares topped $22 in March, but its struggles soon became apparent, its CFO committed suicide last month, and its share price is now under $6. AMC Entertainment, another meme favorite, has also seen a significant drop, as has video game retailer GameStop.

The speculation in crypto and meme stocks wasn’t healthy in any case, said Ken Griffin, CEO of hedge fund Citadel. “Money misallocated in speculative assets doesn’t create jobs in the long run [and] doesn’t help to create the long-term prosperity that makes America the country that it is,” he said late last month at the CNBC Delivering Alpha conference.

Not everyone joined the speculation frenzy, of course. Some Americans decided to leave the stress behind by embracing “van life.” The alternative lifestyle caught on among remote workers during the pandemic, after becoming popular in the 2010s among millennials seeking nomadic adventure. Videos romanticizing the lifestyle—drinking wine under the stars, sleeping by the beach—garnered millions of views on Instagram and TikTok, and van-conversion companies struggled to keep up with soaring demand amid supply chain woes.

But as Fortune reported this week, many of those trying van life have grown disillusioned with it, sometimes after spending a significant portion of their savings on converting or renovating a vehicle. One 33-year-old described it as “glorified homelessness” and griped about gas prices. Another said more bluntly, “Van life influencer culture is full of sh––,” complaining, among other things, of endless repairs and having to pay for hotel rooms when it’s too hot to sleep in a van.

Other van lifers have griped about having to constantly figure out where to park and sleep, bathroom and showering challenges, and public perceptions of them leaning more toward “bums” than “adventurous” when a parking lot becomes home for the night.

Of course, van life remains popular, and companies are cashing in. Ford is teasing an upcoming camper van called the Transit Trail, with one executive tweeting a van life video about it and writing, “From job site to campsite.” But for many, the day-to-day reality of the lifestyle has proven far removed from the glamorous videos of it on Instagram.

For workers hoping they can continue working from vans or home or even secretly from Bali, 2022 hasn’t been too kind, either, with high-profile CEOs signaling more resistance to the idea. That’s led to remote workers, many of whom claimed to be more productive outside the office during the pandemic, feeling less confident about their work arrangements and prospects.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in May that “remote work is no longer acceptable” and employees unhappy with the change should “pretend to work somewhere else.”

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said last month his investment firm would take a “harder line” toward remote work and that bringing workers back to the office would help reduce America’s record inflation.

Citadel’s Griffin isn’t big on remote work, either. Earlier this month he advised ambitious young professionals against it and said it’s time for America to return to the office and “get back at it.”

With 98% of CEOs expecting a recession in the U.S. in the next 12 to 18 months, according to a new survey from the Conference Board, remote workers increasingly fear they’ll be among the first employees to be fired in potential layoffs. A survey of managers released this month by software firm Beautiful.AI suggests they are right to be scared.

Then there is this worry: If work can be done remotely, might companies eventually outsource it? Surely a worker somewhere in the world is happy to do the job for less.

Anna Stansbury, who teaches the future of work at the MIT Sloan School of Management, warned this month about that possibility, using Google and Facebook coders as an example. If they were able to work “for a year and a half without ever going to the office, it seems very, very likely that a lot of companies will be rethinking this longer-term and outsourcing those kinds of jobs that didn’t used to be outsourced,” she said.

Remote work, meme stocks, cryptocurrencies and even van life gave many Americans a sense they could gain more control over their lives. 2022 has been a reminder that much larger forces sometimes grab the steering wheel.

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Polkadot [DOT] for 2022-2023

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Gavin Wood, the CEO of Parity technology, a firm responsible for Polkadot, announced his change in title on 21 October. However, it would be expected that this type of news may have a negative impact on the state of Polkadot and induce some level of volatility. However, to the surprise of many, Polkadot saw some positive developments.

As can be seen from the image below, Polkadot’s volume grew immensely over the past week. Along with its growth in volume, Polkadot also registered an uptick in its development activity.

Furthermore, the overall sentiment towards Polkadot was also observed to fall more towards the positive. However, the social volume for the same remained flat over the last month.

Not without a fair share of negatives

Despite the positive sentiment, Polkadot wasn’t able to generate growth in terms of revenue. According to data from the token terminal, the fees generated by Polkadot in the last seven days depreciated by 15.8%. This decline had an impact on the revenue generated which also depreciated during the same time period.

One of the reasons for the same could be the decline in the number of active and new addresses on the Polkadot network. As can be seen from the image below, the number of active accounts and new accounts on the Polkadot network declined over the past few days.

Adding to the list of problems for Polkadot, the number of stakers on Polkadot continued to decline as well. As seen below, the number of stakers witnessed a considerable drop and the number of stakers depreciated by 2.23% in the past seven days.

These negative developments may have affected DOT’s price actions as well. At the time of writing, DOT was trading at $0.53 and had fallen by 0.2% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap. However, Polkadot’s volume continued to show growth and appreciated by 38.76% in the same time period.",blockchain,ambcrypto.com

Miners (the network participants) undertake mining to verify the legitimacy of transactions on the blockchain and ensure network security by preventing double-spending. In return for their efforts, miners are rewarded with a certain amount of BTC.

There are various ways to mine cryptocurrencies, and this article will discuss how to get started with mobile crypto mining from the comfort of your home.

What is crypto mining?

Mining, a resource-intensive activity that often demands enormous computing power to solve a computational problem and add the next valid block to a blockchain, is a crucial component of cryptocurrencies.

Typically, graphics processing units (GPUs) or high-performance hardware are used for cryptocurrency mining. However, unlike GPU mining rigs, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining equipment is explicitly made for mining cryptocurrencies, making an ASIC miner more powerful and energy-efficient than a comparable GPU miner.

READ ALSO What are the different ways to mine cryptocurrency?

Being application-specific, ASICs can be used exclusively for one purpose, such as to mine a specific coin. Nonetheless, the risk of mining just one coin is high due to the enormous volatility of the cryptocurrency market. For instance, the ASIC equipment will be useless if the coin’s value declines over time or the developers decide to alter the hashing algorithm.

Alternatively, can you mine cryptocurrency on your phone? Proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies like BTC can be mined using smartphones. Small-scale miners can join mining pools to combine their computer power to raise the likelihood of mining a block successfully. However, the computing power offered using smartphones will be little compared to ASICs, and miners’ payouts will be roughly equal to their contribution.

What is mobile crypto mining, and how does it work?

Mining cryptocurrencies using the processing capacity of smartphones powered by iOS and Android systems is called mobile crypto mining. As mentioned before, in mobile mining, rewards will be approximately the same percentage as computing power offered by miners. But, overall, is mining cryptocurrency on your phone free?

Cryptocurrency mining on the phone requires one to invest in a smartphone, download a cryptocurrency mining app and get a stable internet connection. However, the incentive for crypto miners may be substantially smaller and may not cover the cost of the electricity used to mine. Additionally, the smartphone will experience extreme strain from mining, reducing its lifespan and perhaps destroying its hardware, making it worthless to use for another purpose.

Many apps are available for iOS and Android operating systems to mine cryptocurrencies. However, most apps are only available on third-party crypto mining sites, whose legitimacy must be carefully investigated before use. For instance, according to Google’s developer policy, mobile mining apps are not allowed on Play Store. However, it enables developers to create applications that let them control mining taking place somewhere else, like on cloud computing platforms. The possible reasons behind such restrictions include the quick depletion of batteries; the smartphone will overheat if mining is done “on device” because of the intensive processing.

To mine Bitcoin on mobile, miners can either go for Android solo mining or join mining pools like AntPool, Poolin, BTC.com, F2Pool and ViaBTC. However, not every smartphone user can opt for solo mining as it is a computationally intensive task, and it may take decades before you can mine cryptocurrencies using your phone, even if you use one of the newest flagship models.

Alternatively, miners can join cryptocurrency mining pools using apps like the Bitcoin miner or MinerGate Mobile Miner to generate adequate computational processing power and share rewards with contributing stakeholders. However, miners’ pay, payment frequency and incentive options depend on the pool size. Also, be aware that each mining pool follows a different payment system and rewards may vary accordingly.

For instance, in a pay-per-share system, miners receive a specific payout rate for each share they successfully mine, each worth a particular amount of mineable cryptocurrency. On the contrary, the block reward and the mining service fee are settled according to the theoretical profit. Miners also receive a portion of the transaction fees under the full pay-per-share system.

How to mine cryptocurrency on an iPhone

Miners can download mining apps on iPhones to mine cryptocurrencies without investing in expensive hardware equipment. However, regardless of the mining app miners choose, mobile crypto mining may result in high wear and tear without reasonably rewarding their time and effort.

For instance, it may cost miners a lot to run the iPhone on high energy. However, the quantity of BTC or other altcoins they can mine is minimal. Moreover, mobile mining may result in iPhone’s low performance due to the excessive computing power required and the constant need to charge the phone.

Is mobile crypto mining profitable?

Mining profitability depends upon the computational power and efficient hardware used during the crypto-mining process. That said, the more advanced equipment one uses to mine cryptocurrencies, the more likely one will earn more profit than those using smartphones. Moreover, some cyber criminals use the cryptojacking method to secretly use the computing power of unprotected devices to mine cryptocurrencies, making them inefficient for mining in case the original owner wants to mine cryptocurrencies.

Nonetheless, crypto miners often perform a cost-benefit analysis (the advantages of a choice or action less the expenses involved with that choice or activity) to ascertain the mining profitability before making any investments. But, is mobile mining legal? The legality of mining on smartphones, ASICs or any hardware equipment depends upon the jurisdiction of residence, as some countries restrict cryptocurrencies. That said, mining using any hardware equipment will be rendered illegal if cryptocurrencies are restricted in a particular country.

Above all, one should determine their mining goals and prepare their budget before choosing any mining equipment. Before making any investments, it is also important to take environmental issues related to crypto mining into account.

The future of mobile crypto mining

Despite the surge in popularity of cryptocurrency mining, it has been criticized for being economically and environmentally harmful, causing PoW cryptocurrencies like Ethereum to move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Additionally, the legal status of mining cryptocurrency is unclear in some jurisdictions, which puts doubt on the viability of a mining strategy. Furthermore, over time, mining apps begin to degrade the smartphone’s functionality, making them inefficient for cryptocurrency mining.

On the contrary, while the evolution of mining hardware equipment enabled miners to run their rigs profitably, the struggle for sustainable mining rewards will keep driving technological advancement. Nonetheless, what the next significant innovation in mobile mining technology will look like is not yet known.

But many find themselves having to schlep across the river into SoHo, TriBeCa or other trendy Manhattan neighborhoods to showcase their work. No one understands this better than Christophe Roberts. The Chicago-born, Brooklyn-based artist has lived that experience for over a decade.

His passions and interests were always on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge, leaving him to wonder why the options were so limited in his Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. So he decided to take matters into his own hands and embarked on a five-year journey developing the concept for SEED Brklyn, a space to nurture the creativity that Brooklyn has always been known for.

“There’s a world that exists here that I felt was missing an experience like SEED,” he said. “And I’m from the school where you build what you don’t have.”



Roberts and his team literally built SEED from the ground up. And he says he approached the design and construction like an art project. Everything about the space, which officially opens on October 21, is intentional and a treat for all of your senses.

“Post-COVID, any space you go into has to be multi-layered. You can’t just have a rack of clothes,” he said. “You need a narrative. You need to have an experience.” And as a multi-disciplinary artist, building experiences people can interact with is one of the things Roberts does best.

From the moment you walk into SEED’s Greenhouse Cafe, you’re transported to an artist’s paradise that includes coffee from La Colombe, plants for sale, vinyl collectibles and more.

And once you’re caffeinated, you move on to The Garden, a two-level immersive retail space which is carefully curated with books about art and culture along with apparel and accessories from a mix of well-known and promising designers, including Martine Rose and Jason Markk. There’s also a Japanese-inspired sneaker laundry that lets you get your kicks cleaned while you wait.

From there, you move on to The Oasis, an event space and NFT gallery that features technology that helps artists and art lovers to interact with the digital space. “I didn’t think that the digital space was necessarily approachable, especially when it came to the blockchain, NFTs and stuff like that,” Roberts said. “I created a sculpture called the seed pod, which is a display system with digital touch screens, nooks and shelves in each wall that really makes sense for NFTs.”

Something that sets The Oasis apart from other NFT galleries is the partnership with Infinite Objects, a company that makes frames for digital prints. “When you mint an NFT, you get a physical item even if the artist doesn’t have merchandise. So you always walk away with something,” he said.



Roberts’ vision for SEED includes giving back to the Bed-Stuy community, with general classes on entrepreneurism, freelancing, and more. “I want to bring in lawyers to talk about LLCs for protecting creative assets,” he said.

If you can’t make it to Bed-Stuy to visit SEED Brklyn, you can still connect with the space on their website, where a lot of fashion and collectibles are for sale. “We’re building a global brand, so we put a lot of energy into the e-commerce site,” he said. To have a fair fight, we have to be just as resilient on the web as we are in person.”

As Roberts prepares to share SEED with Bed-Stuy and the rest of the world, he hopes to inspire other artists to create. “Seed is inspired by my journey, the landscape around me and the needs of it,” he said.",blockchain,the root

In addition to this, Schöffling is backing a sustainable initiative in Monaco which has been working for the past seven years to maintain and nurture ocean life. Schöffling sees this as the first of several donations and initiatives which he plans to be involved with in Monaco.





Schöffling is able to make such donations due to the vast success of his blockchain-focused company Move Digital. The permissionless nature of blockchain technology is allowing netizens worldwide to tap into not only financial services but earning opportunities which were previously restricted to them. Citizens even in the poorest regions of Africa and Asia can now tap into equal earning opportunities as a result of the vast development which has taken place in blockchain gaming in recent years. Kristof Schöffling has dedicated all of his 125-person workforce to further developing and expanding gaming infrastructure which serves this subsector of the global population.

Such infrastructure allows anyone with an internet connection to participate in blockchain games which allows them to compete for earnings on an equal basis with any other participant. Alongside this development, Move Digital is also building the tools necessary for modern-day entities to thrive in an increasingly digital environment.

The reality of post-COVID business is that not every transaction and arrangement can be guaranteed to be executed in person. Move Digital is building an infrastructure which allows entities worldwide to increasingly transition to a rapidly growing digital economy where they can not only secure earning opportunities but develop and build out sizable businesses.

While Move Digital is rapidly increasing opportunities in the digital space, it remains committed to doing so in a sustainable way. All of its software development efforts are executed in a way which minimizes the carbon footprint on the environment. From its energy sourcing to the third-parties it deals with, every element of Move Digital's business model is built from the ground up with a sustainable focus.

Kristof Schöffling has personally taken this a step further by donating to initiatives which he believes are contributing to a more sustainable and biodiverse plant. Schöffling strongly backs The Animal Fund, a Monaco-based non-profit that focuses on the protection of a vast variety of ocean life. The Animal Fund has been helping protect the Ocean since 2015 and Schöffling's donation to the fund represents this commitment to maintaining the richness and versatility of our current environment and organisms.

Founded by Monaco-based Berit Lagard, The Animal Fund has been extremely active in carrying out high-impact initiatives since its beginning in 2015. The hands-on operation has carried out large-scale waste management and educational programs worldwide which have not only educated the masses but have made a meaningful improvement to the health of our oceans.

Schöffling is committed to supporting the Monaco based Animal Fund long-term with both donations and personal assistance. He sees The Animal Fund as the first of many investments and donations which he intends to make in Monaco which he views as a hub for such activities and innovations. Monaco based enterprises and organizations have helped Schöffling minimize the carbon footprint of his own operations at Move Digital and he will continue to work with such enterprises as Move Digital scales and maintains activities which minimize their carbon footprint.

In a recent blog post, Galaxy Digital finds that over $1.8 billion worth of royalties have been paid out to NFT producers on ETH while creators on OpenSea, the world’s largest NFT marketplace, have seen their royalty figures double since last year.

“Over $1.8 billion worth of royalties have been paid out to creators of Ethereum-based NFT collections. In addition, the average royalty percentage paid out to creators on OpenSea, the platform that has paid out the most royalties to creators by far, has doubled from 3% to 6% over the past year.”

The crypto firm also finds that a small number of NFT collections account for the majority of all NFT royalties earned so far.

“Major brands in NFTs, across both legacy players and crypto-native organizations, have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars in income from royalties generated on secondary sales. In fact, just 10 entities accounted [for] 27% of all royalties earned and 482 NFT collections accounted for 80% of all royalties earned thus far.”

According to the report, there’s been an ongoing debate on whether NFT royalties should exist. Proponents argue that content creators should be reimbursed for their works becoming more popular over time while those who oppose them argue that the enforcement of royalties would change how NFTs fundamentally work.

The research cites Solana (SOL) co-creator Anatoly Yakovenko, who previously said that the enforcement of royalties would split ownership of digital collectibles between users and NFT creators. According to Yakovenko, creators would be able to use smart contracts to repossess NFTs in case users don’t pay royalties.

“To implement [NFTs] directly in the tech, the concept of ‘ownership’ needs to change. The NFT isn’t completely owned by the user or the creator. The creator must retain certain rights to effectively enforce royalties.“

The world as a whole is a centralised space. Every country is centralised to a degree, with autonomous decisions having to be processed by a central authority first. This can be seen with the requirement for building permits on land and houses people already own.

Centralisation keeps wealth in the hands of a few, benefitting only them instead of an accurate distribution of wealth that can be earned without a centralised authority. This kind of decentralisation can be seen in cryptos associated with Tron (TRX), Decentraland (MANA) and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).

Tron – Decentralising the Web

Tron was created in 2017 by Justin Sun as a direct challenge to the modern media industry, specifically big streaming sites. Tron is a decentralised blockchain-based digital platform. It has its cryptocurrency in this blockchain called TRX and ranks at number fourteen on CoinMarketCap. Its price has only been going up recently, with a 4.40% increase in the past week.

With the slogan ‘’Decentralize The Web,’’ what is Tron doing to help decentralise the internet? A decentralised system is free from intermediary control and restricted use, creating a zone of permissionless ownership. Protocol governance is the key to decentralising anything, and Tron does this successfully. Unlike crypto giant Bitcoin (BTC), which uses the Proof Of Work method, Tron uses a Delegated Proof Of Stake consensus system.

The DPoS system increases the power of the community to select nodes approving these transactions. This allows for transactions to be approved by stakeholders, allowing them to be carried out much faster. This consensus method increases decentralisation without using up a large amount of energy. This helps Tron have extremely low transaction fees making it much more accessible for the average person.

Decentraland: Does It Live Up to Its Name?

Decentraland is a virtual metaverse game that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This creates a decentralised game that users can own their land via the blockchain. Decentraland is controlled by the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO), which owns the most important smart contracts and assets of Decentraland. Players can vote on what happens in the world and features they like/dislike and want to change the world by using the DAO.

In the world, players can customise their avatars and purchase LAND NFTs, allowing them to legally own a piece of real estate in the game. The native currency used for most transactions is the MANA token. Players can buy/sell NFT assets to place on their LAND tokens in the marketplace for these MANA tokens. By having the players control what happens in the game via the DAO, Decentraland has made a truly decentralised metaverse.

Big Eyes Coin – Decentralised Currency

Big Eyes Coin is a form of cryptocurrency referred to as a meme coin. The coin is an ERC-20 token, which means it’s built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is one of the most secure blockchains out there. It allows for decentralised exchange of wealth to occur.

Like Tron, the Ethereum blockchain doesn’t use the proof-of-work consensus method. Instead, it uses the proof-of-stake consensus method. This method uses stakeholders to verify nodes and transactions that occur on the blockchain. This gives investors power over the blockchain. This differs from a typical bank system controlled centrally, leaving you with little knowledge of what is happening to your money.

BIG tokens are the native currency for the meme coin. With the coin’s ongoing pre-sale launch raising a massive $8.47 million, will Big Eyes Coin be the next big crypto hit?

To Summarise

De-fi systems are the best way to control your finances, with many different crypto platforms, including play-to-earn games, meme coins and blockchain to choose from. Unshackle yourselves from centralisation and look into Big Eyes Coin, Tron and Decentraland.

[Raquel Vazquez Llorente is the Head of Law and Policy, Technology Threats & Opportunities, at WITNESS. Wendy Betts is the Executive Director of eyeWitness, initiated by the International Bar Association.]

Traditionally, international justice has adjudicated abuses and crimes that occurred well in the past. For the first time in history, we are seeing active and cooperative investigations from the beginning of a conflict. Not just Ukraine itself, but also multiple other countries like Germany, UK and Sweden, and international institutions like the International Criminal Court are already gathering information for future accountability processes.

The speed with which this has been set in motion, and the abundance of actors and accompanying resources, are due in large part to an effort to leverage technology to collect information that can help advance justice and accountability more efficiently–from criminal cases to human rights reporting. Various Ukrainian ministries have built portals to enable citizens to upload information, and organizations are adapting existing technology to document international crimes. Photo and video in particular have received a lot of attention for their potential to uncover abuses, and multiple initiatives are underway to provide technology to record visual evidence. Yet, when trying to build new tools or adapt existing technology for a conflict zone, it is important to acknowledge the work that other actors have been conducting for years in the technology and human rights space. When moving fast endangers lives, the stakes are simply too high for the international community to ignore what past experience has taught us.

We know that using technology to collect data for evidence in accountability processes involves trade offs. While people in conflict zones film events for many reasons other than sharing it with the International Criminal Court and other judicial bodies, these institutions have standards for information collection that can be difficult to meet once the footage has been captured. Coding decisions must balance competing priorities from the design phase, particularly concerning user’s anonymity, their ownership–now and in the future–over the information they have collected, and the process for authenticating the photos and videos according to legal standards.

The Clash Between Anonymity, Verifiability and Control Over the Data

A key characteristic of software designed for gathering potential evidence of war crimes is that it must meet the needs of two constituencies: those collecting the information and those using it for analysis. Documentation teams, activists and other individuals capturing information want a tool that is easy and secure to use, protects their privacy, and allows them to maintain control over the information they collect. Investigators, prosecutors, and other organizations taking in the information to build cases or write reports want as much detail as possible about the data that was collected and the person who recorded the footage. They also want to limit access to the information and its circulation.

Addressing the needs of these two constituencies so war crimes footage is effectively used for justice and accountability is one of the principal challenges when developing this type of documentation technology.

For instance, anonymity of the individuals collecting information is a difficult feature to balance with the demands of justice. Individuals recording the footage may want to stay anonymous because of genuine threats to their personal safety. They may not want their IP addresses or other identifiable information collected. Unfortunately, applying lessons learned from other sectors which also deal with sensitive data is not straightforward. As an example, healthcare data can be anonymised for research purposes without losing its value. Personal details such as name or other contact details are not relevant to understand how cancer can be diagnosed earlier. However, such details are highly relevant for criminal justice investigators, who want as much information as possible about the source. Knowing who has accused you, and of what, is a fundamental tenet of fair trials that we should not forgo–else we risk creating a Kafkaesque international justice system.

People using tools for documenting human rights abuses and the investigators making use of that information need to have full and transparent knowledge of what identifying information is being collected, where it is stored, and who has access to it. Documenters, survivors and witnesses need to be informed that for certain fact finding processes such as criminal justice, any details they supply may be publicly released or shared with other parties, including the defense. Anything collected can be subpoenaed by governments with ulterior motives, and it is open to disclosure if the organization preserving the data is not able to resist or narrow down requests for information when they are overbroad or put individuals at risk. If personally identifiable information has been collected, the anonymity of the source cannot ever be guaranteed.

Relatedly, if people using a tool to collect information prefer to stay anonymous, this will inevitably interfere with the control they have over their information. Once they have uploaded the footage to a portal or a server managed by an institution, they are in the hands of the organization that now hosts the information. Even if the entity’s mandate is exclusively to use the data for accountability for human rights violations, the concept of justice may vary across cultures and peoples. Some people may agree for their information to be used for United Nations reporting, but may want to stay away from criminal justice processes.

Individuals recording footage understandably want a certain level of agency over the footage they collect. Users’ consent must not only be fully informed, but also agile, as close as possible to the decision point when their data is shared with a third body. For these conversations to happen, the user would have to provide enough information to be reachable, or receive sufficient details in advance to ensure their agreement covers a vast array of data sharing scenarios. As with anonymity decisions, what is crucial is that people using these documentation tools understand what control and ownership they have over the data collected, and investigators know what level of consent the users have given.

Media Authenticity and Justice: The Blockchain Fallacy

Technology designers will also need to balance how effortless it is to capture or upload footage with the verification practices required for accountability processes. At a minimum, institutions receiving the footage will want to know not only where it came from and when it was taken, but also that it has not been edited. Tools developed for these purposes will require compromises. For instance, controlled-capture technologies, which lock in provenance details when photos and videos are recorded, make it easier for investigators to verify the footage. However, current tools require the software to be installed on the device. This offers less flexibility to the user, who would need to have identified, downloaded and used that specific software to take the photo or video. Having a specialised tool at the ready may not be feasible, and even if available, in a conflict zone, citizens often default to their phone camera.

On the other hand, some data collection tools may allow people to upload footage they have taken with their regular phone camera. But footage recorded with a standard phone camera can be edited, as can any information about where and when that footage was captured. Even if at the point the footage is discovered some tracking details are embedded, often relying on blockchain technology, there will be shortcomings–uploading photos and videos into a blockchain does little for verification if the footage has not been authenticated first.

Blockchain technology can offer a misleading appearance of authenticity. While it can prove that the footage has not been edited while in the system, blockchain cannot tell you whether the photo or video had been manually altered prior to upload or generated by artificial intelligence. Malicious actors can then easily submit photos and videos with edited metadata, or even deep fakes. Developers of software for war crimes documentation should not overstate what their technology can verify and authenticate, and need to be upfront about what metadata and content may require additional verification techniques.

What’s Ahead for Documentation Technologies

With the war between Russia and Ukraine, we are witnessing a shift in the investigation of war crimes and widespread human rights violations in conflict. Some of these changes may be specific to this conflict, but other developments may signal how accountability for mass scale violations will unfold in the future. Inescapably, technology will play a bigger role in the documentation of coming conflicts. Rather than quick and ad hoc fixes as each new situation arises, we should invest in the responsible evolution of once niche media authentication tools—many actually pioneered by human rights organizations—including mainstream applications driven largely by commercial companies.

As resources pour in and money is channeled into developing software to document visually war crimes and other international violations, institutions funding technology solutions for justice and accountability must be cautious about tools that promise both extensive user control and thorough verifiability. They should also be aware of the difficult balance of different human rights at play and how this may affect specific communities, particularly paying attention to their vulnerabilities and the technical knowledge they may need to understand the tradeoffs of a documentation tool.

If you want anonymity, users will relinquish their opportunity to provide informed consent to some usages. It is difficult to meaningfully consent at the time of recording when the future options for justice and accountability are still not fully defined. If the premise is that consent cannot be traded, then the software must collect personally identifying information. This then runs against privacy rights.

The potential of technology for recording war crimes and human rights abuses is unquestionable, but if we want meaningful justice and accountability, we owe it to the communities affected by conflict to think carefully about how documentation tools are developed and deployed.",blockchain,opiniojuris.org

But it's not likely that bitcoin will do the same.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/22/how-ethereums-merge-made-crypto-mining-more-sustainable.html,"After years of anticipation, the cryptocurrency ethereum finally implemented a major network upgrade that completely changes how the blockchain verifies transactions, mints new coins and secures its network. Called proof-of-stake, this system has reduced ethereum's energy consumption by more than 99%.

Energy usage has been one of the cryptocurrency industry's biggest targets for critique. But it's not likely that bitcoin will follow suit.

Instead, the bitcoin network is sticking with a system called proof-of-work, in which highly specialized computers try to guess a winning number that serves to validate transactions and create new coins. This is what's known as mining.

At the moment, guessing a winning number takes more than 100 sextillion tries. All of this work helps to secure the network by making it nearly impossible for bad actors to accrue enough computing power to take control. But recent research also shows that in 2020, mining bitcoin consumed 75.4 terawatt hours of electricity, more than all of Austria or Portugal.

This is the system formerly used by ethereum. But now the network has swapped out miners for validators. Instead of playing a massive computational guessing game, validators are assigned to verify new transactions, and earn ether as a reward for doing so.

To ensure that these validators act honestly, they essentially have to make a security deposit by staking a certain amount of ether coins into the network. If a validator tries to attack the network, they'll lose their stake. Ethereum proponents say this penalty will make the network more secure, while bitcoin enthusiasts see proof-of-work as the more secure, tried and true approach.

However, the optics of bitcoin's energy use in the midst of the global climate crisis has become a problem for the network. In response, some major bitcoin miners are starting to seek out renewable energy to power their data centers and trying to change the narrative by touting bitcoin's energy use as an asset, as it helps drive investment into the nation's aging electrical grid.

The Casper Network (CSPR) is a proof-of-stake layer one blockchain that aims to bring smart contracts and decentralized apps (DApps) to a global scale.

The project’s native token, CSPR, is trading at $0.047958 at time of writing, up from $0.035885 one week ago. The low-cap altcoin is also up more than 4% in the past 24 hours.

Earlier this month, CasperLabs, the blockchain software and services company behind the network, released CEP-78, an enterprise-grade non-fungible (NFT) standard for the Casper Blockchain.

The new NFT standard is designed to enable organizations to maintain upgradability over their tokens after they’ve been deployed, according to a press release announcing the launch.

CasperLabs officials have also laid out a plan to upgrade Casper’s consensus protocol to “Casper 2.0” in the first quarter of 2023.

Says Medha Parlikar, the chief technology officer at CasperLabs,

“Casper is already the only blockchain that enables upgradable smart contracts. Casper 2.0 introduces a more powerful feature set in which everything on Casper is a contract – and contracts have all the properties of accounts (including the ability to pay for transactions and to stake on the network). This will enable a more user-friendly user experience, making onboarding the next million users onto blockchain that much easier.”

CSPR is the 85th largest crypto by market cap. It remains down over 96% from its all-time high of $1.33 reached on May 12th, 2021.

2022 has been a torrid year for cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin price crash had a far-reaching effect on many other tokens. As Bitcoin dipped more than 50% of its value, other coins followed suit, with some altcoins suffering harsher fates. But, if cryptocurrency market history has taught us anything, the bull market is on the way.

All bear market losses are usually washed away. As a result, the price of crypto assets will soar. To prepare for the bull market, identify coins likely to maintain positive values.

The Next True Layer One

Cardano is currently considered one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the coin market based on market cap. It has grown substantially by offering an impressive utility that only a select few can access – supporting decentralized applications. Cardano is a flexible, scalable blockchain that’s designed to be able to use smart contracts to support decentralized applications.

As a result of this ability, this cryptocurrency is home to several finance apps, crypto tokens, games, and so on. While Cardano has been on the market for a long time, its smart contract capability was recently unlocked in 2021. This led to a widespread wave of interest in cryptocurrency. However, the 2022 crypto dip cut the coin’s growth short. As more projects gradually find their way to Cardano, it’s expected that the cryptocurrency will gain more value.

ADA is the token that powers the decentralized protocol. However, Cardano’s development team is also committed to preserving the environment. As a result, they have adopted a unique blockchain protocol known as Ouroboros.

The Future of Crypto

Tron is a decentralized protocol that’s committed to further decentralization. The Tron Foundation created this protocol. Compared to other crypto tokens, Tron has some reasonable achievements. In 2018, Tron acquired BitTorrent – a popular decentralized service with 100 million monthly users. In 2021, it also surpassed Tether as the cryptocurrency with the most stable coins. During this same year, Tron adopted a DAO to control future developments.

Tron exists as a blockchain and cryptocurrency. TRX is the cryptocurrency symbol and token that powers the blockchain. All decentralized projects hosted on the Tron blockchain use TRX to transact. You can purchase Tron on its native platform or any top crypto trading exchanges worldwide. Tron can process several transactions and decentralized projects because a delegated proof-of-stake mechanism powers it. The delegated proof of stake system involves users using their digital assets to vote for delegates. These delegates will be responsible for controlling the key decisions for the blockchain. The Tron Virtual Machine (TVM) is a consensus mechanism that runs through the Tron Ecosystem. The TVM will ensure that every project on the Tron ecosystem is connected while still staying independent of each other.

Eyes on the Prize

Big Eyes is a meme coin that has made many people wonder if it was the start of a new era in the meme sector. No coin in the meme sector has gained as much recognition as Big Eyes for a long time. After the recent Twitter war with Tamadoge, many people became aware of Big Eye’s capabilities. That’s why Big Eyes’ presale is selling out fast. They’re down to the last stage, and all is set for a launch.

Buy Big Eyes Coin

Big Eyes is a cryptocurrency that aims to give back to users. There’s an ongoing competition for users to win $250,000. What’s more? The cryptocurrency will be used to mint NFTs. Furthermore, there are plans to introduce a centralized exchange on Big Eyes. This exchange will allow users to buy, sell and swap different digital assets.

That stance is threatening the country's position as a global leader in gaming",https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-is-losing-its-place-as-the-world-s-gaming-capital,"A marked hostility toward new and emerging Web3 technologies like cryptocurrencies runs the risk of costing Japan its place as the world’s gaming capital. We’re getting dangerously close to the point of no return, and here’s why.

Nobody can be sure where the country’s antagonism to crypto originated or why it still persists even after the nonfungible token (NFT) and crypto “boom” of 2021, which took off in a major global way and prompted officials in the United States and Europe to backtrack on their initial antipathy for the space, finally opening up to regulations. The White House just released its first crypto regulatory framework in September 2022, and the European Parliament Committee followed up in October 2022 by approving the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework, also known as MiCA, with a landslide vote. As the first European crypto policy, the much-discussed MiCA text represents revolutionary progress in the direction of what many consider the future of the financial world.

Japan, however, has a very different stance.

We all know Japan is home to gaming giants like Nintendo and Sega and has been for decades, with triumphs such as Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, the Sega Mega Drive and the Game Boy. But, in order to remain at the top of its game (pun absolutely intended), the sector needs to be able to consistently and rapidly change with the times, not stay stuck where it was when it first gained recognition. Gaming is a highly creative space and has always had the technology to back its extraordinary potential. But, in order to do so, it does need to be able to stay up to speed with new and evolving innovations, or it will become stagnant and lethargic.

Related: GameFi developers could be facing big fines and hard time

GameFi is an emerging area of interest in the industry with immense potential. But, when you look more closely, there are very few Japanese companies developing the GameFi sector into what it is sure to become within a few years to a decade. And if that doesn’t change soon, the entire industry will be at risk.

The crypto and tech worlds are two of the main stages of exciting and rapidly evolving progress happening in the modern age, and in Japan, they’re being held hostage by crucial elements like taxation and a complicated screening process.

In Japan, there is no ground to account for crypto assets properly, and none of the auditors want to audit crypto assets. Due to strict listing rules drawn up by the Financial Agency, the process of listing a coin in Japan can be confusing and frustrating to a fault. But, when time is money to any entrepreneur with a brilliant idea, waiting six months for a token to be screened is unnecessarily discouraging.

Then, there’s taxation. In Japan, token issuers are taxed on unrealized assets at the end of the fiscal year, regardless of whether they have enough fiat currency to cover high taxes or not. And, while non-crypto stock profits are taxed according to a flat 20% rate, crypto earnings are subject to an exorbitant 55% tax rate, a 35-point difference.

Related: The feds are coming for the metaverse, from Axie Infinity to Bored Apes

As Japan’s reputation falters, other countries will be waiting with open arms to accept its bright minds and fearless entrepreneurs who just can’t understand why their country turned its back on them. Europe is full of investor-friendly nations with rational regulatory systems, like the Netherlands. With the new MiCA legislations as close as they are to being widely implemented, it’s not extreme to wonder if other countries would be better suited to home Japan’s brain drain.

We might indeed be seeing small improvements in the right direction. The government might be inclined to soon ease the current onerous listing rules and allow the country’s $1 trillion crypto trading market to flourish a little more easily, with exchanges able to “list over a dozen coins in one go and without a lengthy screening process.” And since assuming office in 2021, Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has prioritized Web3 development as a means to “economic revitalization,” meaning we might witness a marked change in how the country both regulates crypto and supports the Web3 sector’s growth as a whole.

But the clock is ticking, and if only time will tell how Japan’s role in the gaming sector will impact the economy of its future, it’s hard to be overwhelmingly optimistic.

Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.

On Thursday, the CFTC released its annual enforcement report for the fiscal year 2022. The report details various actions taken by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and takes special note of crypto-related actions.

CFTC’s 2022 Enforcement Report Explained

In the report, the CFTC states it filed 82 enforcement actions in 2022 with 18 of these being connected to digital assets—more than 20%. The Commission also mentioned that it obtained orders imposing $2.5 billion in various penalties—notably more than its proposed budget of $365 million requested for 2023.

Chairman Rostin Benham specifically mentioned the actions aimed at regulating the crypto market stating that “the CFTC continues to aggressively police new digital commodity asset markets with all of its available tools.” Benham also characterized 2022 as the year of “unprecedented financial market conditions” citing both the disruption caused by emerging tech and the increased retail investor participation.

The report also lists its most notable actions throughout the year with regard to digital, and other assets. The very first entry on the list is the Commission’s action against Digitex over price manipulation and a failure to register. While not mentioning Mirror Trading by name, CFTC also notes its complaint over a fraud worth $1.7 billion—the case Benham mentioned several times when requesting more authority over digital assets.

Crypto Regulation in the US Throughout 2022

Amidst the increased crypto regulatory activity in 2022 both in the US, and across the globe, the CFTC has been seeking increased authority over digital assets. While the SEC—the agency that drew the bulk of criticism over its numerous actions both from the community, and certain representatives—appears to be its main rival in the endeavor, Chairman Gensler has been supportive of Benham’s drive.

It is still unclear which agency will take primacy when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation, but it is clear that the watchdogs are bound to get more involved in the following years. This September, the White House finally released its framework for the future regulation of digital assets.

While regulators and representatives have been increasingly vocal on the topic of digital assets, the private sector started organizing. Over the previous months, the very first crypto-focused PAC has been founded by the Blockchain Association, and Coinbase started grading politicians based on how crypto-friendly they are.

It embodies the core values of the platform, namely, a user-oriented approach to the service provision and the most favorable conditions for mass adoption of the latest blockchain innovations. Now, the exchange announced an upcoming listing of WBT on another big-name crypto exchange from CoinMarketCap’s top-10, Gate.io.

Two months have passed since WhiteBIT announced the start of WBT trading. These two months were fruitful for WhiteBIT Token and no wonder! The public token sale amazed the crypto community, as it ended 15 minutes after the start. Only one week after the trading started, the token price doubled, producing positive sentiment in the media and among traders worldwide.

WhiteBIT has successfully conducted the first trading competition on the WBT/USDT pair and held a token airdrop. In less than a month after the release, WBT was listed on Huobi. On October 25, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. UTC, WBT will be listed on Gate.io.

WhiteBIT Token owners can enjoy a wide range of benefits that make the use of WhiteBIT services more pleasant and easy, namely:



Token holders can get an up to 100% maker fee discount and an up to 90% discount on the taker fee.

Holding WBT allows users to withdraw ERC20 and ETH tokens fee-free.

The interest rate within a referral program is increased to 50%.

WBT holders can conduct free AML checks every day.

The token supply is limited to 400 000 000 WBT, with 200 mln WBT being treasury tokens that are to be unlocked according to a specific schedule. Moreover, the asset is backed by a deflationary mechanism that presupposes a weekly burning of WBT.

Here’s how Volodymyr Nosov, the CEO of WhiteBIT, describes the endeavors of the exchange, and WBT specifically, “We worked tirelessly to provide the community of our exchange with a high-end product that would be worth its attention. We appreciate our users, so we put much effort into satisfying their needs. WBT meets our expectations, and each piece of news related to the token proves us right. We don’t stand still, we keep fueling the progress of crypto innovations on our exchange, as well as in the industry as a whole.”

Lace, which is a Cardano wallet being developed by IOG, is currently at the beta stage. According to IOG, it “brings together a wealth of Web3 features, from managing digital assets, to accessing NFTs, DApps, and DeFi services, so you can discover and enjoy a new world of digital experiences.”

Hoskinson’s comments were made with Peyton Winget, who is the Co-Founder and CEO of Bloom Pool LLC (as well as Founder and CEO of Atirum Lab), at the “Rare Bloom” event in Denver, Colorado (October 14-15, 2002), which was hosted by the Cardano community at the Gaylord Rockies Resort and Convention Center.

When asked about Lace, Hoskinson said:

“I thought a lot about how do we get Cardano to a billion users? How do we get the ecosystem to become the world’s financial operating system?…

“What is the consumer interface? What is the portal upon which a billion people will do stuff, whether they’re playing with NFTs, they’re issuing assets, they’re doing DeFi things, they’re playing video games, there’s identity components, estate planning components managing billions of dollars, security tokens, all this type of stuff.

“So, about last year, we said let’s start a research project to imagine what a portal and interface to all of those use cases would look like to go above and beyond what a normal cryptocurrency wallet does. So, an identity-first wallet with full node security but light enough to be on a phone…

“We put some of our best people together. We took a lot of great new technologies like Mithril and Atala PRISM and a lot of legacy stuff that we invented in the cardano ecosystem, and we pulled it all together, and now Lace as a product is starting to come out to market.

“It’s one of our first commercial B2C products, and so it’s not a reference client. It’s not like Daedalus, which is a neutral playground, but rather this is IO’s view of how crypto ought to be done and our hope is that it’s going to kind of push along the standards for our entire ecosystem, get every wallet to become Mithril-enabled, have people start really getting identity seriously, talk about certified wallet standards, and these types of things.

“It’s a browser based interface. It’ll eventually come to your cellphone and to the desktop and every step of the way. It’s innovating as much as it can. So, we’re real excited to kind of demo it, build a beta movement around it with some pioneers, and hopefully we’ll be able to translate that into a very successful ecosystem that can bring in everybody, not just the crypto enthusiasts, but the entire space.

“It’s also going to be cross chain. So, it’s not just Cardano. It’ll support Bitcoin, Ethereum,and a lot of other ecosystems and showcase what we’ve created as an ecosystem to the rest of the cryptocurrency space in that respect.“",blockchain,cryptoglobe

In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Smith, the executive director of the crypto lobbying group Blockchain Association, says that Bitcoin’s current price is being stabilized by long-term investors while adding that retail traders have largely fled the digital asset markets due to bearish conditions.

Smith, however, says that retail investors will likely return once the economy gathers steam.

“I think Bitcoin has been largely stable for a couple of reasons. One, you have the retail investor that has largely exited investing in Bitcoin… People are worried about paying for gas. They’re worried about paying for groceries. They don’t have the ability to put extra money away by investing in Bitcoin at the moment.

But I do think that the investors that are in there right now are holding out for a future date. They’re in it for the long run. And I think as we start to see the economy turn around and people putting more risk into their investment portfolios, we’re going to see the investment in Bitcoin rise and subsequently the price.”

Smith also weighs in on the possibility of the US Congress adopting crypto regulations by the end of the year, which some believe will attract more institutional investments in Bitcoin.

“Congress is actually actively working on legislation that would provide additional regulation for the underlying digital commodity spot market, so including the Bitcoin spot market, and this actually has a real chance of getting done before the end of the year.

The chair and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee has introduced the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, the DCCPA, and this is a pretty good framework for regulating centralized exchanges in the spot markets. There is one outstanding issue around decentralized finance. These are software protocols that operate completely differently than custodial centralized exchanges. But that’s an issue that’s being worked out. I’m optimistic we’ll come to a good resolution there. I think there’s a decent chance we could see legislation signed into law before the end of the year.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $19,167.

Blockchain tracker Whale Alert initially spotted the transaction involving a large Ethereum holder relocating 97,273 ETH worth $124.69 million at time of transfer.

According to Whale Alert, the large crypto trove was shifted from one unknown wallet to another wallet of unknown origin. Since the funds were not transferred to a known exchange wallet where they could be sold in the open market, the whale likely moved the crypto stash for security purposes.

Other notable whale transactions recently on Whale Alert’s radar include:

•75,999 ETH worth $101.2 million transferred from an unknown wallet to another unknown wallet.

•50,000 ETH worth $66.5 million transferred from crypto exchange FTX to a wallet of unknown origins.

The transaction activity comes as wealthy ETH whales have accumulated billions of dollars worth of the second-largest crypto asset by market cap in just over a month, according to market analytics firm Santiment.

“Since September 11th, Ethereum billionaire whale addresses holding one million or more ETH have collectively added 3.5 million more coins. This has increased their cumulative bags by 14%. There are currently 132 such addresses in existence.”

Meanwhile, Santiment finds that wallets holding 100,000 to one million ETH are unloading the digital asset.

“Ethereum’s shark and whale addresses (holding 100,000 to 1 million ETH) have dropped 3.3 million ETH in just the past five weeks. This equates to about $4.2 billion in dumped coins. The asset’s price vs. Bitcoin has ebbed and flowed based on [the] behavior of these key stakeholders.”

Santiment says that holders of between 10,000 to 1,000,000 of the Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin have bought over 47 million more LINK over the course of the 2022 bear market.

According to Santiment, the newly accumulated amount of the 24th-largest crypto asset by market cap is approximately 4.73% of Chainlink’s existing supply.

“Chainlink’s shark and whale addresses (holding 10,000 to one million LINK) have been busy accumulating during the 2022 bear market. Since March 3rd, these addresses have added 47.31 million LINK to their wallets, collectively. This translates to $312.7 million more invested.”

Chainlink is trading at $6.54 at time of writing.

Turning to Litecoin (LTC), Santiment says that the whale transactions and address activity of the 22nd-largest crypto asset by market cap soared this week to an 11-month high.

According to Santiment, Litecoin may have bottomed out against king crypto Bitcoin (BTC).

“Litecoin has been quietly under the radar in 2022, but address activity and whale transactions have exploded this week. Particularly with $1 million+ valued transactions on the network, the timing of these spikes happened just as LTC began rising vs. Bitcoin.”

Litecoin is trading at $51.52 at time of writing, up over 26% from its 2022 low of $40.30.

191,Flare (FLR) Airdrop Finally Starts Oct. 24,https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/2022-10/25030.jpeg,22/10/2022,"After over two years of development, Flare (FLR) network moves toward ultimate decentralization",https://u.today/flare-flr-airdrop-finally-starts-oct-24,"After over two years of development, Flare (FLR) network moves toward ultimate decentralization

Flare (FLR), a blockchain focused on cross-network interoperability and bringing smart contracts to non-programmable chains, is almost ready to start FLR distribution to XRP holders.

Flare (FLR) approaches decentralization and airdrop: New deadlines

According to an official announcement shared by the Flare Network (FLR) team, its protocol is finally achieving decentralization governance. For the next six to nine months, the network will operate in Beta Mode.

Token Distribution Event (TDE) News#Flare will be decentralized on or around 24th October, enter Beta Mode, and be ready to initiate token distribution.

1/3 pic.twitter.com/oBGeCavvdZ — Flare ☀️ (@FlareNetworks) October 21, 2022

Currently, the network's transaction validating process is fully decentralized: over 100 independent validators are in charge of keeping network integrity and attack resistance. With that milestone accomplished, the team is ready to distribute FLR tokens to all eligible wallets — both exchange-based and non-custodial ones.

As such, the team is starting to discuss the airdrop with the supporting exchanges (over 100 platforms): their users are responsible for 9 out of 10 wallets eligible for the airdrop. As a result of ""constructive conversations,"" XRP tokens will be released by exchanges two weeks after the official Token Distribution Event (TDE) date.

While the network is almost ready for the distribution, based on the estimated discussion timelines and Christmas holidays, the final date of tokens being airdropped to end user wallets will be by Jan. 9, 2023. However, should exchanges be able to distribute FLR in December, Flare's instruments will be ready.

How many crypto users will receive FLR?

The Flare (FLR) team is fascinated by the scale of its token distribution. They estimate the final number of the cryptocurrency holders ready for participation in the FLR airdrop to be between 5 and 10 million:

We estimate that 5-10 million individuals will receive FLR during the public token distribution, and the exchanges have a very important task in ensuring that all of their customers' funds are distributed safely. Flare Network is one of the largest token distributions that blockchain has ever seen.

As reported by U.Today previously, FLR tokens will be airdropped to all owners of XRP who took part in the snapshot event on Dec. 12, 2020. All major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges supported the airdrop: their users will get FLR proportionally to their XRP holdings at the snapshot date.

Since 2020, the Flare (FLR) network has organized a series of testnets (""Coston"") and launched Songbird (SGB), a canary network for Flare's mainnet.",blockchain,u.today

The team at Lady Ape Club has also stated that the airdrop is based on an #STRMNFT snapshot taken on October 15.

Marketed as bringing excitement to the uneventful life of the Bored Apes of BAYC, the imaginative Lady Ape Club collection features female versions of the iconic Bored Apes decked up in everything from gold jackets to frilled frocks.

This new addition of the tiny tots is assured to bring more thrill and a sense of adventure into the collection. The crypto community is already excited to see what new avatars the baby apes will come out in. “I’m sure that the baby apes will be adorable and eccentric at the same time,” claims a fan of the Lady Apes.

Notably, back in July, this witty and inventive collection grabbed a coveted spot on a prominent NFT marketplace’s Top 10, dethroning several other popular projects at the time. And the arrival of these new little darlings could propel the collection back into the spotlight.

When the Lady Ape collection launched on the STRMNFT marketplace earlier this year, 9000 of them were sold out within a matter of a few hours. This says a lot about the sizzling NFT ensemble. For the uninitiated, STRMNFT is an up-and-coming platform created to expand the utility of NFTs to all types of users. The platform was officially launched in May this year and opened its first sale in July with the LAC NFTs.

While the trading volume of NFT has dropped nearly 98% since January, many believe that the NFT market is poised for a comeback. Recent reports also hint toward positive adoption signals at an institutional level and continued growth in use cases. Moreover, C-level executives in major crypto firms have explicitly stated that they are bullish on the NFT space. And though several barriers exist today, NFT fanatics hope that the future holds much in store for them.

Interested users can also check out LAC’s website for more information regarding the collection.

About LAC

Lady Ape Club (LAC) is a collection of 10,000 Lady Ape NFTs. LAC is not affiliated with Yuga Labs. Nonetheless, the NFT collection gives consumers full ownership and commercial use rights. The LAC collection was designed by the TNC Art Team, which is the creative wing of the TNC group — one of the leading companies in the blockchain industry, with over 500 developers and experts providing blockchain solutions all over the world.

Shinnosuke Murata

by Shinnosuke Murata, founder of blockchain games developer Murasaki

Japan is home to some of the world’s most prestigious and instantly recognisable gaming companies, from Nintendo and Bandai Namco to Square Enix and Sega. But I, a Japanese serial entrepreneur working precisely in the gaming space, have to admit I’m concerned about the future of Japan’s famed and treasured industry.

The Japanese government’s negative stance on emerging technologies like crypto means the country’s gaming sector is thoroughly unable to keep up with the times, change and mature alongside them, and adopt new and much-needed innovations to breathe new life into its core.

The reality is, there are few Japanese game developers and companies working in new and exciting areas of the industry, like GameFi, and this is due primarily to a few different factors. The first one that I’d like to go into more detail about related to taxes, which can be a painfully boring topic and not one readily associated with the exciting and entertaining gaming world, I know. But I need to be honest: taxes hugely impact revenue, and the ability to make a profit from one’s creative and entrepreneurial efforts remains a focal point of any business strategy worth its salt, so it’s important to talk about how Japan’s fiscal policies might kill the booming crypto sector before it even has a chance to set up shop in the country.

In Japan, token issuers pay taxes on unrealised assets of crypto, which means that if their token market cap is $100m, they will need to pay $30m at the end of the fiscal year. But Japanese regulations also categorise crypto earnings as “miscellaneous income, which means they can be taxed at rates up to 55%.” All other (non-crypto) stock profits in the country are subject to a flat 20% tax, so a 35-point difference is quite significant, wouldn’t you agree?

Now, let’s look at auditors. Japanese regulations are set up in a way that makes issuing tokens extremely –and unnecessarily– difficult. Auditors do not want to audit crypto assets, especially fungible tokens. Because the exchanges follow strict protocols as instructed by the Financial Agency, the listing process can be lengthy and frustrating, protracting for months and months up to more than half a year. What’s more, the JVCEA (Japan Virtual and Crypto Exchange Association) identifies the token listing process as the main obstacle keeping the Japanese crypto market from booming, reportedly suggesting that “changing the existing rules to allow for expedient processing could increase Japanese involvement in the global crypto markets”.

In Japanese media, the conversation around market slowdown and a general brain drain is a heated, known, and recurring topic. But when you look at the hard, cold facts at hand, it’s clear that the situation poses a lot more systemic problems than might initially be obvious, and that the challenges faced by the Japanese games industry are as perplexing as they are obstinate But, not all is lost.

A few months ago, Bloomberg reported that the Japanese government was considering implementing new regulations easing the coin listing process, making it possible for exchanges registered with the Financial Services Agency to list some assets without undergoing a screening process at all.

And four years after its “retreat” from Japan, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, is reportedly seeking to obtain a licence to operate in the country. This is in line with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s new and improved economic agenda, which looks to make Web3 development “one of the pillars of economic revitalization,” and thus support the growth of companies in the crypto, blockchain, and related decentralised spaces.

These are not insignificant steps for Japan to take, but they remain necessary if the country aims to regain its place as the world’s gaming capital. I believe it is imperative that it does – or at least, attempts to do – just that, and that would better come sooner, rather than later.",blockchain,city a.m.
194,Global Energy Consumption From Bitcoin Mining Is Just Over 0.10%,https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mining.jpg,22/10/2022,"One major argument against Bitcoin is the amount of energy used in mining new blocks.

Regulators have gone all out to curb the proof-of-work blockchain’s energy consumption and reduce its environmental impact. However, the latest findings show that Bitcoin mining energy usage only accounts for a small portion of the world’s energy production.

The Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) estimates the cryptocurrency’s energy consumption to be just 0.16% of the world’s total output. The organization, which accounts for 51 of the world’s largest mining companies, released this figure in its Q3 report.

However, the report also states an increase in the cryptocurrency’s energy consumption year-on-year.

More On BMC’s Q3 Report

The BMC published its analysis and research on the energy used by Bitcoin miners on October 18th. These miners enable the Bitcoin network to process transactions despite its extremely decentralized structure.

BMC’s founder, Michael Saylor, explained in a video that Bitcoin’s power usage is extremely little compared to the world’s electricity usage. He stated that the amount of electricity used for mining is just 0.16% of the total amount used worldwide.

According to the research, Bitcoin’s network utilizes 266 TWh annually, while global power usage is 165,317 TWh. Saylor noted an interesting fact: one-third of the blockchain’s entire power usage is waste that can’t be used. This means that the amount of electricity used by the Bitcoin network has little effect on global warming.

Saylor, Microstrategy’s former CEO, also said that the Bitcoin network presently runs on a 59.4% renewable energy mix. This makes it a frontrunner in the PoW blockchain industry.

BTC Emissions Near Zero Despite Pressure From Environmentalists

The BMC also determined that bitcoin mining contributed just 0.1% (or “negligible”) to global carbon emissions. Bitcoin miners have long been under fire from environmental activists who say their excessive energy usage harms the environment.

Greenpeace, one notable independent global campaign network, has been running a campaign under the slogan “change the code, not the climate.” The aim is to get the Bitcoin network to switch to the proof-of-stake method, which is better for the environment. However, the official account has attracted barely 1,100 followers as of this writing.

BTC Records High Year-On-Year Consumption

Despite using less energy than other industries, the report also stated that BTC’s year-on-year (YoY) consumption increased by 41%. It’s also worth noting that the cryptocurrency’s mining efficiency increased by 23% in Q3 2022 compared to the same quarter the year prior.

The consumption increase is attributed to BTC’s hash rate’s 8.3% and 73% increase in the third quarter and year-on-year, respectively. This increase comes despite BTC’s falling price and fewer blocks mined. As of writing, Bitcoin was trading in the red zone, down 0.45% in the last 24 hours.

This increased consumption has renewed worries among cryptocurrency miners that authorities may soon step in and crack down on the industry. In March, the European Union shot down a proposal that would have outlawed cryptocurrency mining outright. However, stricter rules might yet be on the horizon.

195,House of Blueberry Has Been Outfitting Digital Avatars for a Decade,https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/jeans.jpeg?quality=80&strip,22/10/2022,"Mishi McDuff founded House of Blueberry to outfit Second Life avatars a decade ago, and the demand for digital clothes and accessories has only exploded since then.",https://observer.com/2022/10/house-of-blueberry-has-been-outfitting-digital-avatars-for-a-decade/,"This story was initially published in The Creators — a newsletter about the people powering the creator economy. Get it sent to your inbox.

House of Blueberry is a digital fashion house, which means it creates virtual assets like wearables for avatars. But it got its start in 2012, far before the metaverse and blockchain technology took off.

Mishi McDuff, founder of House of Blueberry, or Blueberry for short, attended a 2011 virtual concert in Second Life, an online gaming platform some call the first metaverse. She had wanted to see Sean Ryan, a Texas-based singer and songwriter, perform. McDuff joined the platform for the first time and attended the concert with her starter avatar. But alongside characters dressed as fairies, warriors and supermodels, she felt out of place. For her second virtual concert, she wore a polka dot dress she created in Photoshop, and concert attendees asked to buy her design for their own avatars.

McDuff founded Blueberry knowing Second Life users were willing to spend money on their digital identities. Its first year, Blueberry recorded $60,000 in sales according to McDuff. By 2016, its yearly revenue hit $1 million with a team of three, designing virtual clothing for Second Life. Last year, McDuff decided to expand the team and scale the company as interest in the metaverse swelled. It has now entered the Roblox metaverse and sold more than 20 million virtual assets total. In addition to digital clothing, their portfolio includes accessories, hair styles, pets and pet clothing.

The Observer’s Rachyl Jones recently interview McDuff:

What’s your business model?

We are a digital wearable company but also very much a data company. Based on what our customers are purchasing, we are able to predict trends and service their needs, just by looking at our data. Blueberry also isn’t a service provider for real-life fashion brands. We are a digital-native fashion house where we create our own designs.

Who is the primary audience for digital clothing right now?

Honestly, anybody who has a digital identity—anybody decorating their space or dressing up their avatar is a potential customer for Blueberry.

Why do users value their digital clothing?

I mean, it’s the same reason why I wore this dress today to work. It’s how you express yourself. These are not just games. They are social platforms. This is where you meet your friends. I met my husband on Second Life. How you present yourself actually matters just as much as how you do in real life, simply because you’re forming these social connections.

What are some of the most popular outfits you’ve sold?

One of my best selling items is a collaboration where we created an outfit that shows stretch marks between the rips on jeans, which sold more than 6,000 units. Isn’t that interesting? I feel like there was this era on the internet where body perfection was very much on the forefront. In digital spaces where you have your alter ego playing an avatar, people feel safer to own what has been considered flaws. And honestly, that was probably one of my most mind blowing experiences during this business. People care about being authentic even with their digital identity.

We also sell a lot of casual streetwear. And this stuff has realistic-looking folds—not so much couture fit. That might be considered ill-fitting in fashion. But it’s realism in the metaverse, and those kinds of assets sell the most.

How do the prices compare to a wearables’ equivalent in real life?

It costs significantly less. On Second Life, a single color of a shirt can sell for $2. When we release collections, that entire look can be up to $20. And then in Roblox we’re not able to sell entire collections yet. But single color items will sell for about $1.

How do you create clothes for different interfaces that might have different body types or resolutions?

In Second Life there are seven different avatars we create for. Assets are in three categories: hyper-realistic, somewhat stylized like Fortnight, and more cartoony like Roblox. And we have assets in each category. An asset created for a Second Life can be easily translated to the game Sims, but you can’t necessarily translate it to Roblox.

What have you noticed people are willing to spend more money on?

Entire looks collections on Second Life. That can be anywhere from $20 to $30, which is a lot when you think about digital wearables. A Fortnight skin costs $10, and that’s premium. Collections are entire looks where users can change the colors and patterns. Putting looks together piece by piece is less appealing to the customer.

What’s trending right now, according to your data?

We were able to predict this several months ago actually—the ‘90s are making a comeback. Customers were buying low waisted jeans and crop tops with poppy colors. We ended up creating a bunch of ‘90s-inspired sets and they’re selling really well right now. Even though we only launched in Roblox in July, several of our items are on their first page of the catalog.

Due to the devastating REDs of coins, investors sought ways to diversify their investment portfolios and make more profitable returns.

Investors in popular cryptocurrencies like Stacks (STX) and Celsius Network (CEL) aren't too keen on profits in the short term. Therefore, they are looking towards cryptocurrencies with unique utilities like Flasko, which top crypto analysts have predicted to surpass others in 2023.

Stacks (STX) Unable To Maintain Its Value

As a layer one blockchain solution, Stacks (STX) aims to address decentralized applications and smart contract development through the use of Bitcoin (BTC) cryptocurrency. Stacks (STX) chose Bitcoin (BTC) because it is already widely used and can address security and privacy issues.

In recent months Stacks (STX) has been facing a downtrend. It declined by -4.32% in the last seven days and still showing certain risks for the past few days. Stacks (STX) might have good fundamentals, but analysts don't think it would be profitable in the short term.

In the previous month, Stacks (STX) price was reduced by -10.69% and currently trades at $0.29. While some might interpret it as a good buy opportunity, a further look at the 90-day price change shows a -30.41% price decrease. With the continuous loss of value over such long periods, analysts aren't too keen on Stacks (STX) making huge profits in 2023.

Celsius Network (CEL) Is Way Down From All-Time Highs

Celsius Network (CEL) coin is the native cryptocurrency for the Celsius network as it ranks among the top digital cryptocurrencies. As a blockchain protocol, Celsius Network (CEL) uses programmability as its primary emphasis point to spread awareness. With Celsius Network (CEL), programmers can develop and create smart contacts which can automatically execute tasks after meeting specific criteria.

From an all-time high of $ 8.0232862, Celsius Network (CEL) token currently trades at $0.98079 after a seven days price change of -3.34%. According to Binance, Celsius Network (CEL) ranks number 119 in the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem, with a market capitalization of $234.27M and a total circulation supply of 238.86M.

In the last month, Celsius Network (CEL) coin price decreased by -37.95% while there was also a 90-day price change of +24.85. The past rise and sudden price drop could be an investment opportunity for holders of Celsius Network (CEL) coins. Some analysts suggest that CEL might not get to any new all-time high soon and are more comfortable with alternative investments.

Flasko (FLSK) Could Get A Significant Price Increase In 2023

After the conclusion of Flakso's first stage of the presale, this coin ranks among the top rising cryptocurrency set to provide massive profit returns in 2023. Flasko will be the first alternative investment platform that allows investors to buy or sell minted and fractionalized NFTs backed by luxury and rare wines, champagnes, and whiskeys.

With the second stage of the Flasko presale going on for a price of $0.065, analysts predict it could rise by 4,000% in the coming year. Investors are secured from risks knowing that Flasko successfully passed its Solid Proof audit and will lock its liquidity for 33 years.

197,What is XRP and what is Ripple?,https://forkast.news/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ripple-graphic-2-1.png,22/10/2022,Why has Ripple Labs been in the U.S. SEC's crosshairs and what’s the difference between Ripple and XRP?,https://forkast.news/xrp-what-is-ripple-labs-xrpledger/,"XRP is a cryptocurrency that powers real-time gross settlements on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) blockchain. Developers David Schwartz, Arthur Britto and Mt. Gox founder Jed McCaleb started developing the distributed ledger in 2011 to improve cross-border payments.

The XRPL launched in June 2012 with XRP, the same year financial technology firm Ripple Labs was founded (initially called NewCoin, then OpenCoin, before rebranding to Ripple Labs) by veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur Chris Larsen and the three developers.

After the company was founded, XRPL architects gifted 80 billion XRP tokens to Ripple for the company to start building on the network.

This Forkast explainer will explore:

What is Ripple?

San Francisco-based Ripple Labs is the operator of RippleNet, a payments and currency exchange network dedicated to removing the hurdles and lags in the existing financial system with blockchain-powered innovations.

RippleNet was designed to provide an alternative to the SWIFT network by offering faster and cheaper cross-border payments through the XRPL and XRP.

The company uses XRPL technology to enhance cross-border payments, liquidity and central bank digital currencies (CBDC).

The XRP Ledger’s native token — XRP

XRP is used as transaction fees in XRPL, cross-border transactions, international settlements and liquidity sourcing.

XRP has a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens, with almost half in circulation as of October 2022. The 100 billion XRP was pre-mined in January 2013, where the founders retained 20%, 77.8% was allocated to Ripple Labs and 0.2% was airdropped on different forums.

Ripple initially placed 55 billion XRP tokens in an escrow account that still had 45.7 billion as of October 2022.

Financial institutions can use XRP to bridge two currencies to facilitate cheaper and faster cross-border transactions. XRPL’s decentralized exchange converts payments using the cheapest currency trade order available.

For these banks and institutions to use XRP’s payments technology, they often join RippleNet financial network that runs on XRPL.

According to the Ripple whitepaper, the network offers 3 to 5-second settlements and can handle around 1,500 transactions per second with an estimated US$0.0002 in transaction fees through its Unique Node Lists (UNL) consensus mechanism.

UNL is a list of validators trusted by a node operator. Each node operator chooses its own UNL, usually based on a default set provided by a trusted publisher. UNL helps nodes choose the most trusted validators.

What makes Ripple and XRP stand out?

Central banks can use Ripple’s CBDC Private Ledger based on XRPL to manage and issue CBDCs, without building an entire network from scratch. The U.S. Digital Dollar Project has recently announced it is working with Ripple to launch a pilot program to study a U.S. dollar-based CBDC.

Sustainability is one of the main focuses of Ripple Labs and XRPL. The blockchain employs a unique consensus mechanism with reduced energy consumption. For 60 million transactions, XRP consumes 474,000 kWh of electricity, while Bitcoin needs 57.09 billion kWh, the ledger’s carbon calculator claims. XRP emits 270 metric tons of CO2 for the same amount of transactions, while the Bitcoin network emits 27.96 million metric tons of CO2.

Criticisms of Ripple

While Ripple Labs argues that XRPL is a decentralized, public ledger, the sub-penny transaction fees and fast settlements come at the cost of validator centralization. RippleNet has 139 active validators, mostly run by financial institutions, a centralized tally when placed beside the likes of Ethereum’s near-half million.

While anyone can run a validator node on XRPL, each node configures its own UNL. New validators can’t verify transactions unless they’re part of another node’s list. Considering that validators on XRPL receive no financial incentives, the ledger is expected to maintain a centralized node structure.

In addition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple Labs in December 2020 for allegedly conducting a US$1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. The two are still battling it out in the on-going court case.

The 45% of total XRP in existence is in an escrow account controlled by Ripple Labs. Some critics fear the mass amount of tokens held by a single entity puts the cryptocurrency at risk of price manipulation.

In August, Ripple Labs unlocked a billion tokens from the escrow account, leading to XRP bleeding out 3.4% of its value in the next 24 hours.

What does the future hold for Ripple & XRP?

Ripple Labs’ future largely depends on the outcome of its ongoing legal battle against the SEC. But XRP isn’t the only cryptocurrency at risk of becoming a security in this landmark case. The outcome may have rippling effects on the entire cryptocurrency industry and how tokens are classified.

Despite the ongoing lawsuit, the community has been actively developing new features on XRPL. Some of the most promising developments include smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and sidechains.

In March 2022, Ripple Labs committed 1 billion XRP as an extension of XRPL Grants, aimed toward advancing the development of the XRP Ledger.

XRPL’s low-cost and fast cross-border settlements have been Ripple Labs’ primary selling point in onboarding financial institutions to RippleNet.",blockchain,forkast.news

201,Heroic Hasbullah: How a Russian internet sensation landed a contract with UFC and earned worldwide fame,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.10/article/635158ca20302779c0594b6a.jpg,22/10/2022,Hasbulla takes part in the UFC 280 tournament in Abu Dhabi Read Full Article at RT.com,https://www.rt.com/news/565041-heroic-hasbullah-how-russian-internet/,"The diminutive star is slated to take part in the UFC 280 tournament in Abu Dhabi

Dagestani social media star Hasbulla Magomedov has struck a five-year deal with the UFC. It was officially confirmed the other day by the organization’s boss, Dana White: “Yes, we did sign Hasbulla. What he’s going to end up doing remains to be seen.”

He also teased on Twitter that Hasbulla would easily take on former two-weight world champion Conor McGregor: “He [Conor] shouldn’t f*ck around because he will get his ass whooped if he runs into him [Hasbulla] on the streets.”

The statement was White’s reaction to Hasbulla’s recent altercation with McGregor, who tweeted earlier: “I would love to boot that little g*mp Hasbulla over a goal post. How much to get him on the volley?” Although Conor later deleted the tweet, Hasbulla had a chance to respond:

“Hey uncle Dana White and UFC please make it happen. Let me eat this chicken Conor McGregor. I am hungry, I will smash him with my mountain spirit. My brother Khabib Nurmagomedov smashed him and all his team, now is my time to rise!”

Magomedov has never lost a fight – though, to be fair, he hasn’t had any, yet. He is no ordinary UFC fighter: his weight (less than 20 kilograms/44 pounds) is about the third of the lightest UFC weight class, and his height is no more than 93 cm (3 ft). Although Magomedov is unlikely to fight in the octagon, his uniform and merchandise are already available on the UFC website. How was this small guy from Dagestan, who does not even speak English, able to reach stardom?

Rise of a young eagle

Little is known about Hasbulla’s childhood years. His exact date of birth is unknown, but he is believed to be about 20 years old. Born in Dagestan, Hasbulla was affected by an unknown disorder that halted his physical development at the age of five. According to Hasbulla himself, he was shown to multiple doctors, but not one was able to make a clear diagnosis. Despite his childlike appearance, mentally he matches his actual age. Hasbulla always asks to be called by his full name, without diminutive suffixes.

Hasbulla first gained popularity by posting a TikTok video of himself eating strawberries and commenting on it:

Strawberries are the bomb, honestly!

The video first went viral in Dagestan, then took the rest of Russia by storm. In the TikTok clips that followed, Magomedov kept eating things on camera and making funny remarks about the process. Strawberries were followed by other fruits and vegetables: watermelon, cucumber, and raspberries.

Ever since his childhood, however, Magomedov’s real passion has been martial arts. There are several videos of him fighting with children – though much younger than Hasbulla, they were in his weight class. When his TikTok videos made it to the English-language part of the web, Hasbulla came to be known as ‘Mini Khabib’, in reference to Khabib Nurmagomedov, Dagestan’s most popular UFC fighter. Hasbulla feels this connection to Khabib is important to him: He has even called himself “the second eagle of Dagestan after Khabib Nurmagomedov” and stressed that he trains in the same gym as the former UFC champion.

Hasbulla has no trainer and there are no videos of his professional bouts to assess his fighting skills. The popular Chechen MMA blogger Askhab Tamayev said in his video about Magomedov’s training that he saw the young man winning against “two other guys who were pretty good.” He didn’t show the recording, claiming “YouTube will probably block it.” Later in his blog, he mentioned a few times that he could not upload Hasbulla’s fights on the platform because of the man’s unconventional appearance, inviting his viewers to subscribe to his Instagram account instead.

In one of Tamayev’s videos, Hasbulla declared he was ready to fight anyone in his weight class if the money was right. At the time, he was ready to fight for around $1,500. The Tajik singer Abdu Rozik accepted his challenge.

Friend, foe, and opponent

Abdu Rozik is a year younger than Hasbulla and shares his disorder. His parents sent him to school when he was only 12 years old out of fear a car could hit him or grazing cattle attack him on his way to school.

Organizing the fight between Hasbulla and Abdu Rozik was Askhab Tamayev, who had prior experience in organizing amateur MMA fights. By then, he’d already had a few video collaborations with Hasbulla, paying him around $300 for each. Initially, the prize was set at around $15,000, but after seeing the attention the event drew, each fighter was promised a fixed sum a few times larger than that.

Hasbulla’s true fame came after his press conference with Abdu Rozik in May 2021. As of today, the video has around 17.5 million views, which is half a million more than the Connor–Khabib conference achieved over four years. The popularity of the video benefited all parties. For Hasbulla, he enjoyed more invitations to Tamayev’s blog, this time for around $8,000 per video.

The rivalry of the pair made waves well beyond Russia’s borders, eventually reaching Dana White, the UFC President. At some point, he even proposed organizing the fight under the auspices of the UFC.

Tamayev said the conference was taking place the day before the fight, but even though six months have passed since then, the fight still hasn’t happened. Hasbulla has repeatedly stated he is ready to fight at any time, but his opponent is chickening out. Abdu Rozik has been saying the same about Hasbulla, comparing him to Conor McGregor, who is famous for his trash talk.

Another reason the eagerly-anticipated fight may have been called off might be Hasbulla’s falling out with Ashab. Little is known about the conflict for certain, although Tamaev has alluded to the corrupting influence of money and fame on Magomedov.

Prior to his press conference with Abdu Rozik, Hasbulla had agreed to fight him for 100,000 rubles ($1,620). He later hiked that sum to 20 million (about $325,000). Hasbulla openly admitted he was only going to fight Abdu Rozik for money. As his popularity grew, so did his financial appetite. Still, in spite of his apparent success, Hasbulla’s parents disapprove of his choices and say Muslims shouldn’t fight each other, with or without getting paid.

Ashab Tamaev’s YouTube channel launched Hasbulla’s personal brand, turning him from a little-known TikTok personality into a Russia-wide phenomenon. The rest was Magomedov’s own work.

A small community

Even though the fight fell through, it generated a lot of hype. Hasbulla’s clash with Abdu Rozik was covered by major media outlets, with journalists and experts debating, among other things, the ethical aspects of the situation. Ulyana Podpalnaya, the head of the Russian Dwarf Athletic Association, denounced the fight, calling it a “show meant for laughter,” evidently alluding to the historical practice of using dwarves and other smaller people as jesters in the courts of aristocrats.

“This is not even an exhibition fight. They are paid a lot of money to do a show, so that people can have a laugh. There is nothing serious about this, this is not a sport. I’d say it’s unethical, it’s wrong. An event like that does not attract attention to dwarf athletics,” she said.

Hasbulla was not the first blogger with a growth hormone deficiency. Abdu Rozik created his Instagram account about six months earlier. Their standoff has contributed to the visibility of other people with similar conditions. Erali, an Uzbek blogger, has challenged both Hasbulla and Abdu Rozik, saying he can take them on. In his recorded address, he said he wanted to “raise Uzbekistan’s standing” and give both his opponents “an Uzbek chapalak” [slap on the face].

He did get to meet Hasbulla and Abdu Rozik and had a mock fight with the latter wearing full-sized boxing gloves. His fight with Hasbulla, however, was genuine and was quickly broken up. Since the amount of Instagram followers he has is only a fraction of those of Hasbulla and Abdu Rozik, Erali has failed to catch up to his older colleagues so far. Moreover, the Uzbek blogger has complained about his compatriots siding with his Dagestani opponent.

“I need your support, and you’re telling me Hasbik will beat me up and win. Such words make my blood boil. I promise you I will defeat him!” he said.

Businessman, Muslim, and Dangerous Man

Hasbulla’s popularity climbed along with the NFT market. The OpenSea platform has generated the Crypto Hasbulla collection – a set of the blogger’s images in which he is pictured as various celebrities and fictional characters. Each portrait is hand drawn, and there is a limited number of them – 10,000 pieces. Hasbulla has been promoting his tokens, selling the equivalent of $2 million as of April 2022. His customers have formed a community, and members get a chance to meet the blogger during his travels around the world. In September, he toured Australia, and his plan for 2023 is to visit the US, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, the UK, Europe and other countries. The creators of Crypto Hasbulla have said this is the first time a celebrity has built an offline community through blockchain and NFT technology.

Hasbulla is a devout Muslim. He studies the Koran and regularly conducts a Mecca pilgrimage. But his religious background doesn’t get in the way of his cultural connection with his fans in the West. He is active in his social media accounts and open to working with bloggers from different countries. Hasbulla’s childlike face has charmed many. He doesn’t look threatening to a Western audience, unlike Khabib, for example.

Nevertheless, Hasbulla has often been criticized for his discriminating views. In December 2021, he threatened the girl who posted a picture of his twin sister, and demanded an apology from her. When responding to TikTok bloggers in his stories, he defended domestic abuse, saying that “women are dangerous” and physical violence is justified. Magomedov’s account was blocked the next day. Then owners of the clinic where the blogger’s sister was filmed posted their apology. Despite his non-threatening appearance, Hasbulla looked quite scary when he told his haters that they should expect a visit from some “brothers” – his fighter friends. Hasbulla knows Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya – he was the one who settled the conflict between Tamayev and Hasbulla, siding with Magomedov.

Hasbulla has been able to scale his popularity. When asked about future plans in a recent interview, he said he wanted to start his own business and help the needy from the profits. Hasbulla also claimed he wanted to head Dagestan’s police someday and run his “motorcade all over the place.” According to Magomedov, after he gets the job, he will “raise hell in the city” and organize a parade for his haters. He would also lower the speed limit for residential areas and increase it on highways, let people drive without license plates, and remove all traffic cameras along with the “rats who take pictures of violations and send them to cops.”

What kind of future awaits Hasbulla?

Hasbulla’s plans may seem funny, but as Khabib Nurmagomedov has shown, a public figure can easily enter the political scene if they’re backed by social capital. Khabib has made many statements throughout his career on Dagestan’s social problems and put his status to good use by getting involved in the life of the region, especially its cultural aspects.

He voiced his support of the hate campaign targeting the Black Star record label performers, whose songs, according to the mixed martial artist, go against the teachings of Islam. Nurmagomedov said that “every scumbag will answer for their words,” because the men of Dagestan are responsible for the ethical purity of the region and won’t tolerate some “conceited fags with dubious ambitions.” The MMA champion also urged the Dagestani government to check the ‘Hunting For Men’ play for compliance with the law, as he strongly feels it is offensive to the people of Dagestan. Following his public remarks on the subject, the actors performing in the play received threats and were forced to apologize.

Just like Khabib, Hasbulla has used his social media stories to address the people of Dagestan on many occasions. On New Year’s Eve, he posted a photograph of a crowded square in Dagestan with the caption, “Come to the mosque at least like that. Crazy imam.” He also posted a photo of a flock of sheep on a pasture, alluding to a similarity between the animals and the festive crowd.

Hasbulla has recently started giving interviews to English-language outlets. But since his English skills are almost nonexistent, he usually asks his ‘brothers’ to interpret for him. And even with their help, the language barrier prevents him from giving anything other than one-word answers to even the most basic questions.

Hasbulla is very cautious in his political comments. But, unlike his older friend Khabib, he did offer his opinion on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. On the day that the special military operation kicked off, he posted a photo of himself on a tank in his Instagram stories, accompanied by a caption apparently addressed to Ukrainians – “Take care, I’m coming for you.”

Putin, what a lion you are,” he added.

When asked about his own peace-keeping potential, he usually says, “I wish for all this to end and for us to live in peace and friendship, but we have other people dealing with this, let them sort it all out.”",blockchain,rt

And the cryptocurrency market was no different!A year back, during the last Diwali, things were all shiny for the crypto market. The prices were continuously increasing, and many cryptocurrencies reached their all-time highs. Unfortunately, things are not the same now. And that is not necessarily a bad thing! The reason is simple. Prices have corrected and the valuation is fair. Let us dive a bit deeper to understand why this is true.The global crypto markets have lost billions of dollars, taking the total market value below $1 trillion in just a year from nearly $3 trillion. Meanwhile, the Indian government has also been critical of this asset class and has fired tax reforms to neutralize demand. Bitcoin plunged from its peak of around $68,000 (as of November 2021) to less than $20,000 in eight months. Also, Ethereum faced a downward spiral from $4,800 to around $1,000. Other popular cryptocurrencies among Indian audiences, such as Binance Coin, and Solana, have also witnessed massive falls.The Russia-Ukraine conflict and China's Covid-19 lockdown policy have disrupted the overall production of goods worldwide. It resulted in an increase in food prices and production costs.The rise in inflation has forced global economies to raise interest rates, negatively impacting the international financial markets. The US and the UK recorded an inflation of 8.6% and 9.1%, respectively, as of May 2022.India's inflation rate was 7.04% at the same time, but it is still higher than RBI's target range of 2% to 6%. The RBI acknowledged the economic uncertainty due to the inflationary environment caused by external triggers. Hence, the overall risk factor is forcing Indian investors to exit the crypto markets, considering its volatility.As per RBI, the crypto market is designed to bypass the regulations, making them act cautiously. Sticking to its philosophy, the Indian government introduced crypto tax laws that levy a 30% tax rate on income from cryptocurrencies and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on cryptocurrencies.The new tax reforms decreased the trading volumes of Indian crypto exchanges. Moreover, cryptocurrency companies in India are coming under regulatory scanners for financial irregularities.Recent occurrences like the Terra Luna crash further forced governments to strengthen their stance against cryptocurrency. The crash earned a lousy reputation for algorithmic stablecoins, undermining public trust in cryptocurrencies.The triple-edged sword of inflation, stringent regulation, and project failures are slowing the crypto movement in India.Let's start with the best-performing crypto projects in the past few months.MKR is an Ethereum-based governance token of the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol. It is one of the earliest protocols within the DeFi ecosystem.The project manages DAI, decentralized crypto with a stable value soft-pegged to the USD. It has reached 1,049 USD experiencing a price increase of 74.88% in the last 30 days.HT is the native token of Huobi Global, a crypto exchange built over the Ethereum network. HT faced an upward movement of 68.58%, reaching 7.69 USD.Quant was launched to connect blockchains and networks globally without hampering the efficiency and interoperability of the networks. QNT is currently at 169.67 USD and had an increase of 68.10%, closer to Huobi Token.Below are the top three worst performers in the past months.Klaytn was launched in June 2019 as an open-source blockchain focused on the metaverse, gaming, and the creator economy. KLAY declined by 33%, reaching 0.133 USD.Chillz is a well-known crypto project within the sports and entertainment space. It enables users to participate in the governance of their favourite sports brands. CHZ saw a downward movement of 30.57%, reaching 0.1675 USD.Ethereum Classic (ETC), a hard fork of Ethereum, aims to host and support decentralized applications (DApps). ETC is currently at 21.63 USD, which is 26.29% lower than last month's price.As a best-case scenario, regulators worldwide might collaborate on a global framework for crypto regulation.However, at least in the short term, the probability of such an occurrence is slim as international views contradict one another. At one end of the spectrum, we have El Salvador and the Central African Republic, which said, ""Bitcoin is an official currency."" In contrast, China mentions, ""Crypto transactions are illegal.""India isn't likely to be at either end of the spectrum, considering its plan for CBDC (Digital Rupee or e-Rupee). It seems advantageous for the global remittance economy as it can effectively reduce time consumption during international transactions.However, India's current crypto tax rule will continue to negatively impact overall trading activity, forcing entrepreneurs to shift to conducive jurisdictions like Dubai.The chance for a friendlier reform might further decrease in India in case of the following instances.- Increase in the usage of Bitcoin and other well-known cryptos for illegal activities- An increase in security breaches and other similar threats to blockchain-based payment systemsThese issues might look hypothetical but can happen at any time. In the future, it is improbable that India or any government will stop the spread of the crypto movement entirely, but there is a chance for slowing down.Hence, the Indian entrepreneurs and crypto communities must keep engaging with regulators to tweak the policy to create a favourable environment.",blockchain,the times of india
206,"2022 is like a splash of cold water for crypto bros, retail traders, van lifers, and remote workers","https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1326412844-e1666389284221.jpg?resize=1200,600",22/10/2022,"Many Americans who felt more in control thanks to remote work, meme stocks, cryptocurrencies, and even van life feel less hopeful now.",https://fortune.com/2022/10/22/2022-splash-cold-water-remote-workers-retail-investors-crypto-bros-van-lifers/,"This year has been a difficult one on many fronts. Russia invaded Ukraine. Inflation has soared around the world. Europe is contending with an energy crisis heading into winter. Developing nations are contending with a food crisis. And to top it off, a global recession is widely expected, if it isn’t already here.

To Americans, 2022 has delivered a whole set of truths closer to, well, home. All the trends that characterized the 2010s have come crashing down in a historic fit of economic destruction. Think of the crypto bro or meme stock retail trader whose big profits have turned into steep losses. Or consider the remote worker who fled a big city only to worry that their job will be the first axed in layoffs. Even many van lifers, who seemed in the last decade to have found a way to largely escape the world’s worries, have grown disillusioned with the nomadic lifestyle glorified in TikTok and Instagram posts.

For these Americans, 2022 has felt like a splash of cold water. The Federal Reserve is a big reason why. For the past dozen years, the U.S. central bank’s inflation-boosting policy of super-low interest rates and massive bond purchases fueled an “everything bubble,” in which prices of assets across the board seemed to hit new highs.

The resulting “wealth effect” couldn’t last forever, and this year marked its end, with the Fed vowing to fight sky-high inflation with higher interest rates—even if it means a recession. “While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned this summer.

With the Fed remaining hawkish, stock markets have had a bad year—the S&P 500 has fallen more than 20% year to date. Nervously watching one’s 401(k) has become an unhealthy obsession for many.

Cryptocurrency investors have had an even worse year. High hopes have been hard to maintain during the “crypto winter” of 2022. Bitcoin is down over 50% year to date, and other cryptocurrencies have fallen even more in a widespread selloff that’s made a mockery of the mantra “buy the dip.”

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told lawmakers last month that cryptocurrencies are “decentralized Ponzi schemes, and the notion that’s good for anybody is unbelievable.”

Meanwhile 2022 is on pace to be crypto’s “biggest year ever for hacking activity,” according to Chainalysis. Hackers have grossed more than $3 billion across 125 hacks this year, the blockchain intelligence firm recently noted, and this month has been the biggest ever for hacking activity.

Meme stock investors have also faced disappointment. Bed Bath & Beyond shares topped $22 in March, but its struggles soon became apparent, its CFO committed suicide last month, and its share price is now under $6. AMC Entertainment, another meme favorite, has also seen a significant drop, as has video game retailer GameStop.

The speculation in crypto and meme stocks wasn’t healthy in any case, said Ken Griffin, CEO of hedge fund Citadel. “Money misallocated in speculative assets doesn’t create jobs in the long run [and] doesn’t help to create the long-term prosperity that makes America the country that it is,” he said late last month at the CNBC Delivering Alpha conference.

Not everyone joined the speculation frenzy, of course. Some Americans decided to leave the stress behind by embracing “van life.” The alternative lifestyle caught on among remote workers during the pandemic, after becoming popular in the 2010s among millennials seeking nomadic adventure. Videos romanticizing the lifestyle—drinking wine under the stars, sleeping by the beach—garnered millions of views on Instagram and TikTok, and van-conversion companies struggled to keep up with soaring demand amid supply chain woes.

But as Fortune reported this week, many of those trying van life have grown disillusioned with it, sometimes after spending a significant portion of their savings on converting or renovating a vehicle. One 33-year-old described it as “glorified homelessness” and griped about gas prices. Another said more bluntly, “Van life influencer culture is full of sh––,” complaining, among other things, of endless repairs and having to pay for hotel rooms when it’s too hot to sleep in a van.

Other van lifers have griped about having to constantly figure out where to park and sleep, bathroom and showering challenges, and public perceptions of them leaning more toward “bums” than “adventurous” when a parking lot becomes home for the night.

Of course, van life remains popular, and companies are cashing in. Ford is teasing an upcoming camper van called the Transit Trail, with one executive tweeting a van life video about it and writing, “From job site to campsite.” But for many, the day-to-day reality of the lifestyle has proven far removed from the glamorous videos of it on Instagram.

For workers hoping they can continue working from vans or home or even secretly from Bali, 2022 hasn’t been too kind, either, with high-profile CEOs signaling more resistance to the idea. That’s led to remote workers, many of whom claimed to be more productive outside the office during the pandemic, feeling less confident about their work arrangements and prospects.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in May that “remote work is no longer acceptable” and employees unhappy with the change should “pretend to work somewhere else.”

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said last month his investment firm would take a “harder line” toward remote work and that bringing workers back to the office would help reduce America’s record inflation.

Citadel’s Griffin isn’t big on remote work, either. Earlier this month he advised ambitious young professionals against it and said it’s time for America to return to the office and “get back at it.”

With 98% of CEOs expecting a recession in the U.S. in the next 12 to 18 months, according to a new survey from the Conference Board, remote workers increasingly fear they’ll be among the first employees to be fired in potential layoffs. A survey of managers released this month by software firm Beautiful.AI suggests they are right to be scared.

Then there is this worry: If work can be done remotely, might companies eventually outsource it? Surely a worker somewhere in the world is happy to do the job for less.

Anna Stansbury, who teaches the future of work at the MIT Sloan School of Management, warned this month about that possibility, using Google and Facebook coders as an example. If they were able to work “for a year and a half without ever going to the office, it seems very, very likely that a lot of companies will be rethinking this longer-term and outsourcing those kinds of jobs that didn’t used to be outsourced,” she said.

Remote work, meme stocks, cryptocurrencies and even van life gave many Americans a sense they could gain more control over their lives. 2022 has been a reminder that much larger forces sometimes grab the steering wheel.",blockchain,fortune

But did you know that you could actually use this instability to your advantage and make money off it? What’s more, you can do that without taking an actual position in the market! Sounds appealing, right? This is possible with crypto arbitrage trading, which we discuss in detail in this tutorial.

What Is Cryptocurrency Arbitrage?

To understand what cryptocurrency arbitrage is, we are first introducing the concept of arbitrage. Imagine that you’ve just bought a pencil for $10, which you then sold to someone else for $11. You would make a profit of $1 by simply trading it for a higher price. This model of trading is known as arbitrage.

Arbitrage is a technical term given to the old basic practice of buying a product for a lesser price and selling it for a higher price. It’s different from regular crypto trading, as you have to wait for the price of the product to rise in the future with regular trading, yet with arbitrage, you simply sell the product where it is already valued at a higher price.

For a number of reasons, the price of a crypto coin is not always the same on different exchanges. This allows you to buy a coin at a cheaper price from one exchange and instantly sell it for a higher price on another exchange: a process known as cryptocurrency arbitrage.

In crypto markets, traders use arbitrage opportunities by buying and selling crypto assets on various exchanges to profit from different prices for the same asset.

Why Are Crypto Exchange Prices Different?

Various factors influence the differences in crypto exchange prices. The most common factors are:

Liquidity and fluctuation in trading volume

Recent bid and centralized exchanges

Liquidity pools and decentralized exchanges

Let’s discuss these factors in detail.

Liquidity and Fluctuation in Trading Volume

The value of virtual currencies is based primarily on the trade volume, which is the cornerstone of crypto arbitrage and the primary reason for variable prices on various exchanges.

Cryptocurrency is not tied to fiat money, such as the US Dollar or the Euro, nor is it associated with any one nation or exchange in particular. As with other commodities, supply and demand for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin vary based on the market and the time you decide to make a purchase or sale.

Recent Bid and Centralized Exchanges

The core principle of trading on centralized exchanges is that the latest bid-ask paired request on the exchange order book determines how much an asset will cost.

Simply put, the real-time price of an asset on a centralized exchange is determined by the price at which it was traded most recently. Since the prices at which Bitcoin is purchased on an exchange can be different from one exchange to another, the price of Bitcoin also varies slightly on every platform.

Liquidity Pools and Decentralized Exchanges

Decentralized exchanges operate in a diametrically opposite manner, where the goal is to make the prices similar to the ones shown across other exchanges. Therefore, this system relies on crypto arbitrage traders to stabilize the price of a digital currency.

Decentralized exchanges use liquidity pools instead of an order book system where crypto assets are traded at a certain price. Every crypto trading pool is unique. Therefore, if someone wanted to trade Bitcoin (BTC) for Ethereum (ETH), they would need to search for a BTC/ETH liquidity pool on the exchange.

Each pool relies on funds from generous contributors who introduce their crypto assets to serve as liquidity in exchange for a specified share of the pool’s transaction fee. In reputable decentralized exchanges, the value of these crypto assets is regulated through a mathematical formula that keeps the pool’s asset ratio steady.

Best Crypto Arbitrage Trading Strategies

Let’s go through some of the most common, viable crypto arbitrage trading strategies.

1. Simple Arbitrage

Simple arbitrage is among the most convenient and feasible trading strategies. It involves buying crypto on one exchange at a lower price and selling it on another for a slightly elevated price to generate profit. As it is fairly low risk and easy to execute, other arbitragers can take advantage of the same opportunity.

2. Decentralized Arbitrage

The decentralized arbitrage strategy relies on using smart contracts to determine the price of crypto trading pairs. If these pairs’ prices on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) diverge noticeably from those on centralized exchanges, crypto arbitragers can take advantage of this situation to conduct cross-exchange transactions for profit.

Traders can use DEX to set up trading pools between any two cryptocurrencies. By using three distinct trading pools, a trader can swap currency X for currency Y, then Y for currency Z, and lastly, Z for X.

There is an arbitrage opportunity, as the exchange rates for each trading pool are independent. Also, the three changeable currency rates aren’t perfectly synced together. Overall, decentralized arbitrage is very similar to simple arbitrage except for where it’s limited to decentralized exchanges and smart contracts.

3. Triangular Arbitrage

Triangular arbitrage involves shifting money across three or more digital assets on a single exchange to profit from the difference in price between one or two cryptocurrencies. For instance, an arbitrage opportunity exists when the BTC/DAI pair is trading at 40,000 DAI, and one ETH equals 3,000 DAI, but the BTC/ETH pair is inefficiently priced at 40 ETH instead of 35 ETH.

Moving on, you can follow a simple strategy. Firstly, deposit funds to the exchange and purchase 1 BTC for 40,000 DAI, then trade the BTC/ETH pair to convert the BTC into 40 ETH. Finally, sell the 40 ETH for 50,000 DAI.

At the end of the process, you could make 10,000 DAI in profit on three transactions with a 20% ROI. However, for this strategy to work, it’s very important to seize this rare chance immediately before the exchange’s algorithm promptly fills the price gaps.

4. Statistical Arbitrage

Let’s say Elon Musk or another influential person in the crypto market announces plans to dive into the NFT sector. The next thing we know the price of NFT project coins will start pumping hard.

If you’re going to apply the statistical arbitrage strategy, you’ll have to pick a pair of NFT coins with a strong correlation and very similar fundamentals, like $MANA and $SAND.

Image credit: Vecteezy

To select these pairs, automated systems run a check based on a number of leading indicators, like volume and even price action, then the trending coins are ranked based on these scores, and those that rank the lowest are bought, while those that rank on top are shorted.

If you notice that one of these coins is outperforming the other, you’ll need to buy the lower-valued coin in the hope that it will rise to the level of its outperforming partner while also shorting the ascending coin. Lastly, you need to wait for the prices to fluctuate again so that the two prices converge, and you can make a profit from the following reversal.

Why Is Crypto Arbitrage Considered a Low-Risk Strategy?

Crypto arbitrage traders are usually novice investors looking for quick short-term profits without caring about market conditions. They differ significantly from day traders, who rely on accurately predicting crypto prices. The conventional methods of generating profit from crypto trades are complicated and require adequate experience and a maturation period.

Conversely, cryptocurrency arbitragers profit from the chance to make money by utilizing market price disparities. This is a safer and more reliable method, as it doesn’t rely on predictive pricing strategies or analyzing market sentiments.

Crypto Arbitrage Trading Advantages

Apart from being a low-risk strategy, there are other reasons why you may want to consider arbitrage trading:

Crypto’s juvenescence: trading in cryptocurrencies is highly unregulated and fragmented, and data is sent slowly across exchanges. Compared to many major investment markets, there are fewer traders and less competition, which can all result in greater arbitrage possibilities.

Assortment of exchanges: there are over 380 exchanges globally to efficiently trade crypto. This immense variety, coupled with crypto’s great volatility, gives rise to greater potential for the price differential.

Swift profit: compared to the conventional strategy of purchasing bitcoin, keeping it, and then selling it later, this presents the opportunity to make gains considerably more quickly.

Crypto Arbitrage Trading Risks

Just as with other forms of investment, arbitrage trading has its fair share of drawbacks:

Levied charges: it is crucial to know that arbitrage trading may incur fees. This trading, withdrawal, or deposit fee can add up and dramatically reduce your profits. Although high-volume traders experience low fees, investors need to carefully analyze the profitability by keeping these factors in their calculations.

it is crucial to know that arbitrage trading may incur fees. This trading, withdrawal, or deposit fee can add up and dramatically reduce your profits. Although high-volume traders experience low fees, investors need to carefully analyze the profitability by keeping these factors in their calculations. KYC rulings: regulations requiring “Know Your Customer” (KYC) checks may make it difficult to access many exchanges. For instance, to place trades, you may need to have a bank account in the nation where the exchange is located.

Blockchain transaction speed: cross-exchange transactions rely heavily on the time it takes to validate these transitions, which can significantly affect the efficiency of arbitrage trading. For instance, Polygon may take five minutes to one hour to verify transactions. In the meantime, the market can move against you. Therefore, arbitrage traders should adhere to blockchains that have fast transaction rates.

Volatility and time constraints: due to the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies, the price may drastically fluctuate while you are transferring money across exchanges.

Frequently Asked Questions

Are arbitrage bots necessary for yielding substantial profit? Crypto arbitrage can be made more reliable and profitable with bots, but you will need to weigh the cost of the bot against the risk it entails and the time required to monitor it. Bots can make arbitrage trading more practical for you, but you don’t need one to use the strategy. Manual crypto arbitrage trading is still possible. However, if you wish to get a bot, your best options are: Cryptohopper

Arbismart

Coinrule

Is crypto arbitrage legal? Crypto arbitrage is perfectly legal in most parts of the world, as it contributes to market efficiency and helps endorse price equalization. Use Wikipedia to check the levied taxes and legality of the crypto trade for your country.

Where can I compare crypto prices? You can compare crypto prices on a crypto arbitrage scanner website. Crypto arbitrage scanners find a coin’s minimum and maximum prices by comparing rates on several exchanges, then display those figures to the trader. You can find reputable exchanges with high rates where you can sell your coin with the help of a competent crypto arbitrage scanner. Popular options include CoinMarketCap, TradingView, and Yahoo! Finance. If you are a manual trader, check out our article about the best crypto screener websites for helpful resources.

It does not necessarily reflect the opinion of U.Today. Every investment and all trading involves risk, so you should always perform your own research prior to making decisions.

In a tweet, Bob Summerwill, ETC Cooperative executive director, stated that the primary verified Ethereum Classic Twitter account, eth_classic, has been suspended. He maintains that the reason for this remains unclear as Twitter provided no helpful information. He added, ""I suspect it is likely an automatic false-positive action. Nothing controversial was posted. I have lodged an appeal. I do not suspect anybody reported it.""

Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, who got wind of the news, tweeted: ""This just crossed my desk a few minutes ago. Did the eth_classic Twitter handle seriously just get suspended?""

When a Twitter user suggested an appeal be made to restore the account, Hoskinson poked fun, saying: ""I'm sure they will get a 70-paragraph email.""

""Drama""

The primary account of the Ethereum Classic project, which is now suspended, has been mired in controversy in recent months.

Charles Hoskinson was accused of insisting on ownership of the Twitter account. Hoskinson claims that he ""owns"" the primary verified Ethereum Classic Twitter account (with 600,000 followers) and will not transfer it to the ETC community so that it can be used effectively. He will not even consider selling it. ""Instead, he chooses to damage ETC,"" Summerwill wrote in a Sept. 6 tweet.

The controversy had the Ethereum Classic DAO community seeking a solution, tagging Twitter Support in a tweet: ""What is your proposed solution to the Ethereum Classic open-source project's Twitter handle? Should we update the project's Twitter account to a different handle? How do we solve the current issue?""

Fast forward to Oct. 6, and Bob Summerwill accused Hoskinson of repurposing the account, noting that ""6 years of community work had been erased.""

The Ethereum Classic account had over 600,000 followers since its inception in July 2016, and up until Sept. 15, it was used to post about Ethereum Classic.

The account was now repurposed as the new community page for Ergo, a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain similar to Ethereum but affiliated with Cardano.

As reported by U.Today, Hoskinson slammed Ethereum Classic, calling it a ""dead project with no purpose.""",blockchain,u.today

Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are giving up what they have and rushing to purchase Flasko presale.

Solana (SOL) Is Struggling And Investors Are Not Happy

Solana (SOL) held a prominent place among the most innovative cryptocurrency projects. This project was developed with the objective of scaling up the entire blockchain technology.

Developers are able to create decentralized applications within the Solana (SOL) platform. These applications were developed, and there are real users behind them. However, the bear market created an impact on the upward growth of Solana (SOL). With the trend showing downward, Solana (SOL) is quite struggling right now.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is Not A Good Investment To Consider Now

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has no reliable project supporting it. Many investors realized that Shiba Inu (SHIB) was nothing more than a hyped-up currency. The excitement has passed. Back then, Shiba Inu (SHIB) was backed by crypto-whales like Elon Musk. They abandoned the coin, nevertheless, a very long time ago. As a result, investment in Shiba Inu (SHIB) is not an investment to be recommended at this time. Investors are aware of this and keep selling Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens in order to invest in the Flasko presale.

Flasko (FLSK) Will Be The Next Big Investment

The hype for Flasko as a cryptocurrency has been building since its presale. But unlike other cryptocurrencies, the hype surrounding Flasko is because of its unique concept.

Flasko, a new crypt initiative, aims to be the first investment platform to allow its users to invest in rare and luxury whiskeys, fine wines, and vintage champagne. The wine and spirits industry has been growing over the years, making Flasko a secure long-term investment.

Currently available for presale at $0.065, Flasko is expected to rise in value by 4,000% in 2023. Investors are also keen on investing because Flasko successfully passed the Solid Proof audit and had its liquidity locked for 33 years.

Early investors will get the most benefits, so we recommend checking out Flasko now.

Gavin Wood, the co-founder of the Polkadot ecosystem, is stepping down as the CEO of blockchain infrastructure company Parity Technologies – the development company behind Polkadot. Wood shared a statement on October 21 in which he states that he never wanted to assume the role of CEO and although he could act as such for an interim period, it was not a role in which he saw himself finding “eternal happiness,” saying:

Anyone who has worked with me knows where my heart lies. I’m a thinker, coder, designer, and architect. Like many such people, I work best asynchronously. A good CEO needs to be available to others on a far more continuous basis. They need to enjoy representing the company, both internally and externally. They need to not be bothered by large swathes of their time becoming eaten up in meetings and calls with a plethora of multicoulored boxes on their calendar.

The former CEO indicated that he would remain the company’s majority shareholder and will take on the role of chief architect. The co-founder of Parity, Björn Wagner, will take over as the new CEO. The company was founded in 2015 as EthCore, by Wood, Aeron Buchanan, TJ Saw, Ken Kappler, and Jutta Steiner, with Björn Wagner. Wagner joined as co-founder a year later. Wood added in the statement that he will contribute to making Polkadot and Web 3 more relevant to large swathes of the population. He indicated that he would be refocusing on “exploring how we can contribute to making Polkadot and Web3 more relevant to large swathes of the population,” adding that this will start by “helping the community design and build several interesting chain-integrated social primitives which I think are crucial for us to deliver a true Web3 platform.”

Although Wood’s reasons for stepping down as CEO differ vastly from most, he does join a host of top executives that have recently decided to hand over management such as Jesse Powell from Kraken and Alex Mashinsky from Celsius.

2022: The worst year in terms of crypto hacks…

On 13 October, the research firm Chainalysis revealed that October had already become the worst-ever month for crypto-related crimes with over $718 million in overall losses. Funds were stolen from various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols during 11 different attacks.

According to the report, this year is expected to surpass 2021 as the most prolific year for hacking on record. Through 125 hacks, hackers have made more than $3 billion. Following a $325 million attack on popular cross-chain service Wormhole, a $625 million attack on Axie Infinity’s Ronin bridge, and a $200 million attack on the Nomad bridge also took place.

Decentralized apps that have not been thoroughly audited make for easy and consistent short-term profit for protocols. Poorly protected protocols are easy pickings for hackers who take advantage of their highly vulnerable locks.

According to Giustra, the global economy is shifting to the digital world, and Bitcoin is likely to stand out based on his projection of an upcoming monetary system reset, he said during an interview with Stansberry Research on October 22.

In this line, the billionaire opined that Bitcoin could destabilize the sovereignty of fiat currencies, even posing a threat to the possible establishment of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) by jurisdictions like the United States.

“They are going to create their own central bank digital currency like everybody else in the world and they’re not going to want competition. I see Bitcoin as an anti-sovereign fiat play and if I’m right about a monetary reset where everybody’s going to something else that incorporates digital currencies in whatever they create, the last thing they’re going to want is the competition from Bitcoin,” he said.

U.S. crypto framework

With the United States increasingly focusing on establishing a crypto regulation framework, Giustra stated the world needs to understand the country is aiming to be ahead in blockchain and not the digital asset space.

Notably, different United States government agencies have issued proposals on regulating crypto in line with President Joe Biden’s Executive Order. In this case, most federal agencies have pushed the idea of establishing a digital dollar.

Giustra’s crypto criticism

Despite his latest sentiments on Bitcoin, it is worth noting that Giustra has in the past pointed out that the flagship cryptocurrency is not a solution for everything. However, he maintains the asset will likely go higher in the future.

In a previous debate with Bitcoin proponent and MicroStrategy former CEO Michael Saylor, Giustra also criticized the crypto community’s support for the sector. The businessman had noted that crypto fans exhibit ‘a cult behavior’ by attacking critics of the sector.

Overall, Giustra backs the idea of diversifying investment portfolios with various assets. In his proposition, investing in hard assets like real estate, gold, art, and Bitcoin is safe.

Get rich, get ahead, or get experience. Jobs, Expertise, Opportunity, Connections. You can have it all in Bangalore. Despite being the 5th-largest metro in India, Bangalore has nearly 900 higher education institutions – more than any other city. That includes over 100 engineering colleges and nearly 100 institutions offering graduate business education courses. For the latter, the best-known and most-prestigious of the bunch is the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore. Ranked as the #2 graduate business program in India by The Financial Times, IIM Bangalore differentiates itself through scale and distinction. That includes a stellar faculty featuring over 150 experts, researchers, and practitioners, not to mention a wealth of electives. Overall, the school counts 1,200 students among its various graduate business programs, enabling MBAs to tap into a wide network of high potentials. When it comes to the one-year EPGP (Executive Post-Graduate Program) program, the return on investment is high. Within three years of graduation, EPGP grads are earning more than American counterparts from Cornell and Duke – with a 67% jump between pre-EPGP and post-graduation pay. All this comes with a deep immersion into inner workings of the larger Bangalore community.

ACCESS TO IT ALL

Lokender Singh Rathore has re-located to Bangalore after 10 years in the Indian Navy, where he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Before that, he worked as a management consultant for Deloitte. For him, the school’s resources, coupled with its location, provide the perfect preparation for his long-term plans to move into operations and program management.

“IIM Bangalore is situated in the Silicon Valley of India and has produced most of the unicorn firms in India,” he tells P&Q. “NSRCEL, a start-up incubation cell at IIM Bangalore, provides numerous opportunities to experience the “hustle” culture and learn from one of the best entrepreneurs of the country. In today’s world where digital infrastructure is rapidly evolving, it is extremely important for all organizations to inculcate innovation and start up mentality to sustain growth and profitability, which is often called as intrapreneurship. Hence, it is imperative for all MBA graduates to build entrepreneurship skills. And there is no better place than IIM Bangalore for that in India.”

Taking Rathore’s point a step further, Akriti Ghai boils the IIM Bangalore EPGP difference down to one word: access. “It was the prospect for interactions with industry leaders, entrepreneurs, innovators through IIM B Business Conclave, EPGP Seminar and Alum Series, PGP social clubs, and Vista events,” she notes. “These gave me confidence that IIM Bangalore is the ideal place for a holistic education and industry engagement. This paves a great way to learn and lead by staying abreast of the latest business challenges, corporate opportunities, and networking events, which put together will aid me in developing a business mindset for my future endeavors.”

MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE TOP FIRMS

Ghai herself hails from Ernst & Young. And you’ll find plenty of students who’ve worked for top employers in the EPGP Class of 2023. Case in point: Abhishek Pandey. Before business school, he led a product development team responsible for Honda’s first BS6 compliant scooter. He was so respected at Honda that he represented the firm as its youngest technical lead ever at the International Auto Expo in 2016. By the same token, Bibin Kumar trained over 20,000 undergraduates over two years at Infosys – earning the company’s highest feedback scores in the process.

His secret? “I had to wake up every morning, wear the mask of a brave soul, and be there for my students when they needed me,” Kumar explains. “I saw happiness, I laughed with my students. I saw success. I celebrated with my students. I saw failures – failures that led to some students getting expelled from the training program. They would be jobless, and I had been there, so I wept with them, helplessly…But overall, my time as a trainer helped me [to] build empathy and become a better person.”

The EPGP Class of 2023 has distinguished itself in many other ways. A year after joining Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), Sipra Priyadarshinee became the company’s first female employee – and youngest engineer – to complete “a large-scale critical capacity enhance project…incident free.” Vishwa Prakash Shukla found his footing in edtech as a confounder, winning the Maharashtra Government’s ‘Maharashtra Startup Week in 2018. When Mamta Kumari joined the Steel Authority of India’s Bokaro Steel Plant, she created the Buddy Project to help them move out of administrative roles and onto the shop floor where they had a chance to earn more and climb higher.

“Under this project, each junior was mapped with a senior so that they get their issues addressed,” she tells P&Q. “This also gave the young women confidence and moral boost to not only stay but also thrive in their jobs. Over the years, I saw the women working on shop floor increase in number.”

A RICHES-TO-RAGS STORY

Sometimes, their efforts were outright heroic. As an operations officer, Gautam Sharad protected the lives of his shipmates and other vessels when he managed an emergency aboard a tanker. Lokender Singh Rathore did the same by coordinating efforts to keep a fire from spreading aboard an aircraft carrier. Of course, some actions were simply gutsy. Exhibit A: Harshad P. Bhoir. He left it all behind – a strategy leadership role working in the CEO’s office with all the authority and perks surrounding it – to come to business school.

“I call this an accomplishment because it wasn’t easy to leave behind a life, that I had built over 6 years,” Bhoir writes. “The change was drastic, but equally necessary. I went from driving a 3.5V6 to a 1.5V4, from my office cabin to being the classroom desk and from board rooms to break-out room. There have been some serious downshifts. Yet, none of what I have learnt at IIMB in the last 6 months would have been possible unless I had given these things.”

What has Bhoir learned? For one, he was exposed to the intricacies of entrepreneurship. Last spring, he launched a dog food startup leveraging his experience cooking for his pet. Thus far, his subscription service has generated 8 customers – all of whom have continued to use his product. Bhoir isn’t alone in speeding up his career momentum in the IIMB EPGP. Lokender Singh Rathore was part of a team that won first place in the Bharat Quiz – a business-themed quiz show sponsored by IIMB that attracted 300 teams. His classmate, Akriti Ghai, won 1st place team in Business Case Challenge, which was part of IIMB’s fall Business Conclave. On top of that, he has been gaining critical work experience by partnering with the Tata Group on a marketing project.

“This involves the growth of its novel business unit for Indian wear ‘Taneira’. Project scope mandates developing business strategy for the brand that leverages its complete potential, identifying right target segment and developing right brand positioning statement.”

WORLD-CLASS TEACHING

Still, some school achievements are difficult to quantify – or even explain. Just ask Janet Mary. Her biggest takeaway from the EPGP program comes down to confidence. “[I’ve been] overcoming my own perception that I am not capable of certain things,” she observes. “This program at IIMB has, more than anything else, instilled deep self-belief and I feel more equipped than ever to deal with any challenge! Being the batch representative of EPGP only further drove this change!”

Then again, with a half year left in the program, Vishwa Prakash Shukla believes his best is yet to come. That said, he has already reaped several benefits from the program. “The MBA program promotes structured thought process. I learned how to prioritize and manage my time. My networking skills have improved, and I am now able to connect with enterprises and startups more frequently on weekends.”

For many, IIM Bangalore’s biggest strength is its faculty’s teaching and research prowess. And you won’t find many class members who dispute this notion. For many students, class sessions rank among the highlights of the program thus far. One of the most popular courses thus far has been Professor Rejie George Pallathitta’s Competition and Strategy course. Notably, Lokender Singh Rathore appreciates how Pallathitta has made the course frameworks so relevant and easy-to-understand. The biggest lesson from the course?

“Peter Drucker had said, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast”,” Rathore writes. “After undergoing the Competition and Strategy course, I have learnt that a well formulated strategy is that package of a meal without which cultural changes will die out of starvation.”

EPGP Class of 2023

HANGING AT HIGH TIDE

Macroeconomics was another popular choice by the Class of 2023. Abhishek Pandey lauds how Professor Chetan Subramanian’s energy and engaging content motivated him to get up in the morning. Sipra Priyadarshinee shares Pandey’s sentiments. “The way Prof Subramanium taught the subject was just wow,” she writes. “It was like listening to a mesmerizing story. Now when I see a news on economics, I can actually understand it!”

Ann George, a transport planner who dabbles in teaching Zumba, gave her vote to Brand Management, which is taught by Professor YLR Moorthi. Her big takeaway? “If a person isn’t able to convey an idea in a simple and crisp manner, he or she is clearly bluffing.”

That’s not to say that IIM Bangalore is all classes, projects, and networking. For the Class of 2023, the big hangout is a place called High Tide. George describes it as a place that personifies the program’s “Work Hard, Play Hard’ culture. On one hand, it is a place, it is a place where student teams gather over food to complete a report. At other times, George notes, “We always hit this pub after our exams and party our guts out.”

Of course, the best gathering spots aren’t always bars or clubs. Mamta Kumari predicts that when her class is quizzed on their favorite spot at their 10-year reunion, they will respond ‘D802.’ “It is the apartment where three of our classmates live, the walls of which know all our secrets outside the classroom activities,” Kumari explains. “This is where we went from being strangers to becoming friends. Parties, afterparties, live sports, and case competitions – there’s never a reason not to gather here. I am sure that come the end of our program, this is where we’ll bid our goodbyes. D802 is special.”

SECRET TO BUSINESS SCHOOL HAPPINESS? GET A DOG

Similarly, Harshad P. Bhoir believes his home will come up as a favorite spot – and not just because he can cook and his wife can host. “Having a golden retriever at home is like having a magnet with de-stressing abilities. MBAs, especially when packed into a year, aren’t easy on you. Having a dog is probably the best way of getting rid of all the stress.”

It wasn’t the stress that brought the Class of 2023 to IIM Bangalore’s EPGP program. Instead, it was a sense that something was missing – or the possibilities were too great to ignore. After a decade in manufacturing, Mamta Kumari recognized her skills in finance, technology, and project management weren’t enough to take her to the next level. At the same time, Bibin Kumar returned to campus to supplement his experience with classroom learning. For him, business school has been like returning to the past. Only yhis time, Kumar says, he is looking at his career using an entirely different lens.

“Six months in, I keep connecting my learnings back to my less successful and failed experiments,” he admits. “[This time], I seem to have answers to how I would have tackled those situations differently.”

Candid discussion among students

A Q&A WITH THE CHAIRPERSON

This month, P&Q reached out to Dr. Ashok Thampy, the Chairperson of the EPGP program and a Professor of Finance & Accounting. Among the topics, Dr. Thampy addressed new developments at IIM Bangalore, along with the expansion of its STEM and digital capabilities and the school’s relationship with the larger Bangalore ecosystem.

P&Q: What are the two most exciting recent developments at IIM Bangalore and how will they enrich the MBA experience for current and future MBAs?

Thampy: “IIMB has blended the asynchronous courses designed for its highly successful MOOCs platform with synchronous learning on digital platforms to offer integrated digital learning experiences to supplement classroom learning. Some of the business issues which have got increased attention are those related to supply chain management, contingency planning, employee health and safety, and business continuity management.

IIMB has a lot of new courses coming in. For example, we do have a course on gamification. We, of course, have courses which are covering Meta Verse and Web 3.0. So those are, of course, currently electives. Elements of Industry 4.0 (automation; Internet of Things; 3-D printing; data warehousing and analytics, etc.) are becoming an integral part of contemporary manufacturing. Contemporary services businesses are dependent on technology and advanced data analytics. The core principles of marketing, finance or operations management are likely to remain the same, but a successful manager will need to integrate a good understanding of technology and data with the traditional functional skills.”

Main Block

P&Q: What are two most differentiating features of your MBA program? How do each of these enrich the learning of your MBA students?

Thampy: “The one-year full-time Executive Post Graduate Programme (EPGP) is an intensive residential program which is designed for professionals with an excellent career record and with experiences across varied industries.

The diversity of the cohort is significant. The current batch has Chartered Accountants, Fashion Designers, Army Veterans, a Commandant from CRPF, Sailors from Merchant Navy, Aeronautical Engineers, Bankers, Engineers from Oil & Gas, Sales Leaders, Engineers from the IT industry, to name a few. Such diversity make the learning experience unique.”

P&Q: In recent years, there have been several areas that have gained increased prominence in business school programming, including STEM, analytics, artificial intelligence, and digital disruption. How does your full-time MBA program integrate these concepts across its curriculum?

Thampy: “We leverage the advantage of being in Silicon Valley of the country. Our close connect with industry is a huge advantage. IIMB has 10 Centres of Excellence and several initiatives such as the Behavioral Science Lab, which provides a controlled environment for data collection for behavioural research. The Data Analytics Lab – DCAL – is a dedicated research and training lab to support interdisciplinary empirical research using data on India and other emerging markets. The Centre for Software and Information Technology Management (CSITM) fosters close links with the IT sector in India and abroad in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Digital Transformation, Product Management, Digital Governance & Policy, Healthcare Technology, IT Outsourcing, Cloud Computing, Agile Development, Digital Platforms, Digital Payments, and Emerging Technologies (Blockchain, Extended Reality, IoT, RPA, etc.). These subjects are offered as electives.

Our students participate in and win at global and national technology case study competitions which is clear evidence that we apply what we learn in the classroom.”

IIM Bangalore Library

P&Q: If you were giving a campus tour, what is the first place you’d take an MBA applicant? Why is that so important to the MBA experience?

Thampy: “The campus of IIM Bangalore features among the ‘25 Most Significant Works of Post-War Architecture’, in The New York Times Style Magazine in 2021. The architect of the iconic and award-winning campus is Pritzker Laureate Dr. Balkrishna Doshi, Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Fellow of the Indian Institute of Architects. The campus, with its structures and spaces, continues to inspire learning and discovery. It integrates buildings with the fundamentals of nature and climate. It offers a living, breathing space ideal for a place of learning and supports students’ academic and social needs. That is also something that attracts students from all over the world. Truly, our 100-acre campus is our pride and joy. It is also home to rare species of flora and fauna, and in a city like Bangalore, it is an oasis of tranquility.

Inside this amazing campus lies our favourite spot – the library. An amazingly vibrant space stocked with unparalleled resources on management subjects, including fantastic online repositories, the IIMB library is every student and researcher’s dream come true.”

P&Q: Bengaluru is known as a “Silicon Valley of Asia” – along with being one of the fast-growing cities in India. How does IIM Bangalore leverage its Bengaluru location to provide school projects, employer partnerships, and job opportunities for students?

Thampy: “Yes, definitely location has been a big advantage for us. We have a comprehensive project embedded into our core of our EPGP courses. So various companies approach us with problem statements, where our students, mentored by faculty, work with these companies and analyse their challenges and come up with probable solutions. Also, we have seminars and leadership talks almost every week, where eminent personalities and industry experts come and interact with our students. As Bangalore is the startup capital of the country, many cofounders have come and shared the journey with our students. We also have the NS Raghavan Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning (NSRCEL), our incubator, which provides the platform that helps entrepreneurs access resources and mentors, and innovate the future of India. In fact, many of our students work in those startups in various roles, on a part time basis, to learn from them.

Campus Blossoms

P&Q: In the 2022 Financial Times ranking, IIM Bangalore earned one of the 15 highest scores for being recommended by alumni. What is behind this high level of alumni satisfaction? How does the school bring students and alumni together and tap into alumni to provide greater mentoring and opportunities for MBA students?

Thampy: “IIMB prides itself on its alumni engagement. We have a dedicated office for Alumni Relations. We have a Dean overseeing Alumni Engagement. The Director of IIMB meets the alumni regularly. We have alumni representation on the Board. Our alumni are involved in the school’s activities from interviews to placement; from delivering guest lectures to leading workshops in their areas of expertise; from being part of juries for case competitions to addressing open house sessions during admissions.

We have an Alumni Committee that connects the current batch to the alumni. Every student in the cohort is assigned an alumni mentor. We have AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions over weekends where alumni from sectors such as Corporate Finance, Product Management, Technology Consulting, Management Consulting, etc. interact with students.

The EPGP curriculum includes a Comprehensive Project, which examines a contemporary live issue or topic pertaining to either a specific company or an industry. Alumni help with sourcing such projects. This reinforces the program’s strong connection with industry. This Student-Alumni engagement helps us network, get industry updates, plan our careers and hone our problem-solving abilities.”

Sports Day

P&Q: IIM Bangalore is one of the most prestigious and selective MBA programs in India. What are two ways that applicants can set themselves apart and increase their odds of receiving deeper consideration for admission?

Thampy: “It isn’t about high GMAT scores alone! Diversity is prized so is experience and domain expertise. Having clear career goals for which the EPGP is a stepping stone does help. The programme emphasizes peer learning not just from the cohort of 75 fellow students but from the PGP cohort as well.”

P&Q: What are some aspects of IIM Bangalore’s programmes and culture that make it appealing to women? International students?

Thampy: “IIMB is an equal opportunity campus. IIMB has a significant number of women on the Board, women in the faculty body, women students and staff. There are women in leadership roles across the school. There is a Women in Management club; there are Women in Leadership seminars and workshops; there are programs like Tanmatra that nurture women in business and leadership. NSRCEL has long-running and hugely popular Women Entrepreneurship programs for women who start up and scale up.

IIMB provides a wholessome classroom experience. Live projects, placements, internships have never been biased on the basis of gender. Companies which come for recruitments hire students for their skills, knowledge and capabilities.

For EPGP students, IIMB provides family housing. Many women in the EPGP cohort have young children and there is plenty of support including round-the-clock healthcare for all, and crèche, sports coaching and summer camps for children on campus. Festivals are celebrated with enthusiasm on campus.

IIMB is EQUIS accredited. It is also among the top ranked B-schools in the world, featuring in the Top 50 of FT and QS global rankings. There is an Office of International Affairs at IIMB which handles Student Exchange Programmes. IIMB has exchange partnerships with over 70 schools, globally. Large cohorts of students from B-schools across the world spend a term at IIMB and apart from the classroom learning, they enjoy educational/field visits, food tours and cultural exchange programs. They find the city of Bangalore appealing and the IIMB campus, welcoming and nurturing.”

5 REASONS TO CONSIDER IIM BANGALORE

1) World Class Faculty: “I am being taught by industry experts and advisors, authors of the books that are referred by several other business schools around the globe, economists who are in the discussion panels alongside cabinet ministers on the news every day, and ex-faculty member or alumnus of Harvard, MIT Sloan, Kellogg, NYU, Cornell, Warrington, University of Texas, Yale, Michigan, ISB and other IIMs. The faculty profile of IIM-Bangalore is one of the richest in the world. This itself is the biggest reassurance to MBA aspirants seeking the best learning in their sprint at IIM Bangalore.

Even if someone is not taught by most of the faculty, all professors are extremely welcoming for talks, discussions, guidance, and projects.”

Abhishek Pandey (’23)

2) S Raghavan Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning (NSRCEL): “I get to meet and interact with some of the highly passionate entrepreneurs from the startup capital of the country here. As an aspiring entrepreneur who’s never shy of ideas but always worried about opportunity cost, the stories – of both successes and failures – that I keep hearing from the folks who are turning their ideas into reality are instilling some much-needed confidence in me. Moreover, I get to have a first-hand experience of product development in an entrepreneurial environment, build a great network, and be close to work while at school.”

Bibin Kumar (’23)

3) Location: “[It was the] quality of connections with the Industry. Bangalore, being a technology and start-up hub, offers more in terms of learning for those who have a keen eye for it. It was important in the sense that it gave exposure to the kind of business problems companies were already trying to dabble with.”

Akshay V Bharadwaj (’23)

4) Flexibility: “One of the best and least spoken of part of the elective terms is that you get to decide your own calendar for the last 2 terms depending on your elective choices. This way you are in complete control of your time to be invested in beyond the classroom learning, readings, application and research”

Harshad P. Bhoir (’23)

5) Electives: “The number of options that IIM Bangalore offers in terms of the electives is unmatched by any other institute. Moreover, the faculty conducting these electives are or have been industry experts, so it’s not just the academic flavor that you derive out of the hours spent learning these programs.”

Harshad P. Bhoir (’23)

ADVICE TO PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS

“Plan, Do, Check and Act: The famous PDCA cycle works wonders in personal life too.

“Plan” your career well in advance and that doesn’t mean knowing exactly what you want to do but to know WHY you really want to pursue an MBA from IIM Bangalore. Once that is complete, start “Doing” your preparation and work hard on the application – especially the SOP and Resume. “Check” every single line of your resume and SOP and act on the mistakes with complete honesty. The more real you are, the more confident you will be in your applications and interviews, increasing your chances of a selection conversion.”

Abhishek Pandey (’23)

“It is important to understand that you didn’t get in because you were better than the other applicants but because you were different from them. Being different means the unique ‘YOU’, and only together with the others did you make the class a more complete experience. It might so happen that when you land here, you see a lot of different and amazing individuals. Again, don’t forget you are one of them. With that said, it is extremely important you build new things around who you already are because your core is probably the strongest of your suits. MBA isn’t about reinventing the wheel, but about improving what you already have.”

But after more than a month from that historic event, Bitcoin’s closest rival still has nothing to show for as its price flat-lined as it failed to take off despite the hype that surrounded the second largest cryptocurrency before the merge.

Ethereum struggles to breach and sustain the $1,300 marker

ETH is caught in a pattern that will extend its bearish momentum

A bullish run is still possible with $1,400 as the immediate target

At press time, according to tracking from Coingecko, Ethereum is trading at $1,297 and while it managed to increase by 3.6% over the last 30 days, it is still nowhere near the level it was expected to be after its blockchain’s transition.

The coming days could prove to be more challenging for the digital asset as there’s a possibility it could experience severe price dump.

Ethereum Could Be Looking At $1,000 As Support

The altcoin’s daily technical chart shows its price established a symmetrical triangle pattern which accelerates prevailing trend movement.

In Ethereum’s case, this is not favorable news considering it has been on a consistent decline over the last few weeks.

Source: TradingView

With its current bearish momentum, ETH could end up being in a steep fall all the way to support range of between $1,200 and $1,000.

The asset’s volatility is also high, but this could work either way as it presents an opportunity for an upward break in the trendline that could trigger a price rally up to $1,400.

If Ethereum manages to keep $1,400 as a resistance marker and continue with a bullish movement, it could prime itself to test the $1,550 levels.

The King Of Altcoins Can Still Surge

While some sectors in the crypto space has called the Merge as a dud, Ethereum still has a lot of fight left in it as there is still chance for it to surge and be back in conversations of being at par with Bitcoin.

In fact, even if BTC price remains in status quo and consolidates for a while, ETH’s could start its own rally to surge and invalidate the previous bearish thesis about its trajectory.

If the conditions are met and Ethereum manages to flip the crucial $1,730 resistance marker, it will revisit the psychological $2,000 level.

If that happens, the digital asset will be several steps closer to its all-time high of $4,878 which was attained in November of last year.

Bitcoin is currently experiencing a gradual decline in value due to the increased inflation rate; as a result, people are turning to novel coins, such as Big Eyes Coin (BIG), to save the market. Big Eyes Coin (BIG), Chainlink (LINK), and FTX Token (FTT) are relatively new coins with brilliant plans to expand and rescue the Crypto industry from its impending doom. These three coins employ different approaches but they all have a single goal which is to showcase their potential in the Cryptocurrency community.

Is Big Eyes Coin (BIG) The Crypto Saviour?

While Bitcoin struggles to stay afloat and remain relevant, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) keeps raising more money during its presale. The success of this token at all levels of its presale is giving crypto enthusiasts and analysts a good feeling about the future of the project. Not all heroes wear capes; some of them are cute cat mascots to demystify the concept of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and make it accessible to all interested individuals. Big Eyes is a community-driven platform that puts its users first. To prove this, 70% of all the tokens were made available for purchase during the presale which is still ongoing. Due to this, the community holds the power and Big Eyes lives up to its decentralized plans.

Furthermore, the team plans to set aside 5% of the tokens for ocean preservation as several species are endangered due to several toxic human practices. To kick start this, a Big Eyes merch collection will be launched and made available in both physical and digital forms. Not only will this help in raising money to save the oceans but also increase the reach and popularity of the project. Additionally, a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) club is part of the Big Eyes sophisticated ecosystem and BIG token holders will be granted access to the exclusive NFT events on the network.

Chainlink (LINK) Is Making Smart Contracts Better

Chainlink is a decentralized network that employs smart contracts to ensure an additional safety component. With Chainlink and the availability of smart contracts, users can send payments to bank accounts and other payment networks and options. It operates on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism due to its scalability and low-energy intensity.

Since hitting a new yearly low in June, the price of Binance Coin (BNB) has dramatically risen. Demand has kicked in for the altcoin after the broader market started registering a recovery.

Even so, since reaching an all-time high of $692 in May 2021, the price of BNB has been declining.

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Binance Coin [BNB] for 2023-24

June 2022 had a yearly low of $183 as a result of this decline. However, it is important to note that on the daily chart, the RSI indicator has not yet risen beyond 50.

The nearest long-term resistance level, at $427, would be reached if the current trend continues.

Late in January 2021, Binance Coin joined the upswing in the cryptocurrency market, rising from $40 to $330 in a single month. BNB’s price dropped in March, trading for a while in the $250 to $300 region, but in April it started to rise again quickly, reaching an all-time high of $690.93 on May 10.

Consider this – In January 2021, the price of Binance Coin (BNB) was $40. However, 2021 also saw a significant incline in BNB’s price, one that allowed it to hit $690 on the price charts. In fact, this was its highest price level in 2021.

Worth noting, however, that soon after, the latter few months of 2021 saw the wider market fall across the board. Needless to say, the same had a ripple effect on BNB’s price charts as well, with the exchange token hitting new lows.

In the past, Binance Coin (BNB) rose subtly and gradually to rank among the most valuable cryptocurrencies by market cap. Above all, the growth of Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency trading platform, has caused the value of the BNB to rise significantly in recent years.

In recent months, the bear market has caused Binance Coin (BNB) to experience more severe losses. BNB surpassed its all-time high of $690 during the May 2021 bull market. However, the bear market soon began in November and the price plummeted.

When consumers use the BNB on the platform, Binance reimburses them for a large portion of the transaction expenses. BNB has grown in significance as a component of the platform over the past few years. The demand for Binance Coin rises as Binance expands and gains more users, which boosts the coin’s price and forecast.

Binance makes sure that the supply of BNB is routinely lowered as demand rises. Every three months, a specific portion of BNB is destroyed, making Binance Coin deflationary and improving the outlook for BNB going forward.

BNB also functions as a payment method and opens up more opportunities on the Binance platform, including savings, DeFi staking, and liquidity mining via the BNB vault.

It was initially used as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum (ETH) network before being moved to the Binance network and changing its name to BEP-20.

As the Ethereum Merge has taken place, Binance has been able to manage the transition for its users in an efficient manner.

Binance Coin was initially created in 2017 as a utility token for discounted trading fees. Today, however, its use cases have grown on several cryptocurrency exchanges. BNB can be used to pay transaction fees on many Binance platforms such as Binance.com, Binance DEX, and Binance Chain, besides crypto.com and HTC. Hotel booking sites (e.g. TravelbyBit), SAAS platforms (e.g. Canva), DeFi apps (Moeda) and a large number of platforms accept BNB as a mode of payment.

BNB’s price has fallen as a result of the cryptocurrency market’s sharp bearish shift. One can also argue that the SEC’s issues with Binance took a heavy toll on the price of the altcoin. Even so, expectations remain high.

Finder.com surveyed 54 people recently, with the panel believing that the coin has promising long-term potential. The crypto’s price is expected to hit $781 in 2023. And, although BNB may not be receiving as much attention right now, it routinely ranks among the best-performing currencies in terms of ROI. It is also the fifth-largest crypto in the world.

Late in January 2021, Binance Coin joined the upswing in the cryptocurrency market, rising from $40 to $330 in a single month. BNB’s price dropped in March, trading for a while in the $250 to $300 region, but in April it started to rise again quickly, reaching an all-time high of $690.93 on May 10.

Binance Coin’s price fell as the entire cryptocurrency market collapsed in late May 2021. At about $200, it recovered and rose to about $430, but this upturn was fleeting. BNB fell to about $250 in late June and then fell once more in the middle of July. However, the market began to show signs of recovery later that month, and Binance Coin wasn’t an exception. BNB’s price increased dramatically once more, surpassing $350 in the first half of August.

However, like most cryptos in the market, 2022 wasn’t a good year for the exchange token, with BNB falling on the charts.

Given everything, buying BNB must be a wise decision in the long run, right? Most analysts have positive predictions for BNB. Additionally, the bulk of long-term BNB price projections are upbeat.

Why do these projections matter?

BNB is a cryptocurrency that is native to the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. It is also crucial to the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. The latter, in fact, is one of Ethereum’s competitors, and it offers substantially higher scalability and lower transaction costs.

The steady increase in the number of traders on Binance also has a positive impact on the price of BNB. The cost of this altcoin had increased, rising from $526.94 in October 2021 to $555.34 at the start of January 2022. It is anticipated to keep expanding as trade activity on the exchange rises as Binance establishes itself as a market leader in the cryptocurrency trading industry.

Its value reached a high point, in part due to the volume of BNB used for decentralized applications (DApps), DeFi, and smart contracts after the launch of Binance Smart Chain. With 44 exciting projects, BSC is the second-largest DeFi platform at the moment. Over 620,000% have been added to the value of Binance Coin between its 2017 introduction and its 2021 peak.

The fact that the exchange has maintained a burning program since the coin’s introduction is just another reason to trust BNB. On April 15, 2021, Binance burned more than 1,099,888 BNB, equal to $595,314,380 worth of tokens. This is Binance’s 15th quarterly BNB burn, and in terms of cash, it was the biggest one yet.

In this article, we’ll quickly review the current activity of the cryptocurrency with a focus on market cap and volume. In conclusion, predictions from the most well-known analysts and platforms will be summarized together with an analysis of the Fear & Greed Index to determine market mood.

BNB’s price, volume, and everything in between

At the time of writing, BNB was trading at about $302. Its total market cap was $45 billion, and it was up by a significant number.

And as the numbers slowly go up, investors and experts have gone bullish on the token. The managing director of Digital Capital Management, Ben Ritchie, is positive about BNB and predicts that by the end of the year, the crypto will be worth $300. Ritchie also admitted that the viability of Binance’s exchange will determine the destiny of BNB. Going on to say that the asset has the potential to be a deflationary one, he added,

“The price of BNB also follows the demand and supply. BNB introduced a burn mechanism in every transaction fee and conducted quarterly burns, making it a deflationary asset. Since the BNB chain ecosystem continues to grow, the price may reach as high as $3,000 in 2030.”

At the time of writing, the price of Binance Coin was below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Since 20 January 2022, the 200-day SMA has been indicating SELL for the previous 212 days. Since 16 July 2022, when Binance Coin’s price fell below the 50-day SMA, this indicator has been indicating a SELL signal for the last 55 days.

On 3 February 2022, 197 days ago, the Bitcoin market saw its most recent Death Cross. A Golden Cross hasn’t happened in 353 days since 31 August 2021. Technical indicators predict that Binance Coin’s 200-day SMA will decline over the coming month and hit $ 327.19 by 19 September 2022. By 19 September 2022, Binance Coin’s 50-Day SMA is anticipated to reach a value of $327.18.

At the time this article was written, the contrary view was held by TradingView, with the platform flashing a “Buy” signal for BNB.

Let’s now look at what well-known platforms and analysts have to say about where they believe BNB will be in 2025 and 2030.

BNB Coin Price Prediction 2025

Changelly, for its part, is very optimistic about the fortunes of Binance Coin. It predicted that the lowest BNB price in 2025 will be $1,122.96, while its highest price will be $1,270.31.

Technologist and futurist Joseph Raczynski too has a bullish outlook. He believes Binance to be the top worldwide exchange. He said,

“While BNB is not decentralized, it still can serve a purpose for fast and cheap transactions. That has a cost though. Binance could change parameters on the token without consensus and they are far more likely to be a single point of failure.”

Crypto-exchange CoinDCX predicts that if the end of the previous year was bullish, the beginning of 2025 might likewise be positive. Thus, the price could initially reclaim its position above $2000 and continue to maintain a strong advance. Consequently, one might try to reach $2500 by the end of 2025.

So, with all these positive predictions, is there a reason to not root for BNB? Well, remember that 2025 is still more than three years from now and Binance has a lot going on with the SEC. The SEC is after Binance, accusing it of issuing BNB as an unregistered security.

However, despite this, the market is quite optimistic. The Co-founder and Vice President of MetaTope, Walker Holmes, does not believe that the SEC will significantly harm the future of BNB. He said,

“We have seen this play out with XRP, ETH, and others. CZ can present a very compelling case. I think this is a question of potential monetary penalties. However, at the time of writing, I do not think Binance is at major risk of being taken down.”

BNB Coin Price Prediction 2030

CEO of Balthazar, John Stefanidis, expressed great optimism about BNB in a study. A BNB value of $3,000 by 2030, in his opinion, is entirely doable. Due to its cutting-edge technology and adherence to international rules, BNB is well-positioned for long-term success. He also emphasized that Binance’s great UX, a strong venture team, and a great brand are all factors in BNB’s success.

Although BNB is more affordable for many investors, Desmond Marshall, the Director of Rouge Ventures and Rouge International, thinks Binance Coin might overtake Ethereum. According to him, the implementation of the limits will have the greatest impact on the performance of the crypto. Additionally, the trust that the neighbourhood has in BNB is a crucial factor in determining future growth.

Now, all these predictions are positive, but one has to be careful. We are talking about 8 years from now and it is worth taking into account the current status of the crypto-industry. The prices of BNB and Bitcoin are closely correlated. Fortunately, BNB can be burned on the Binance market, which reduces the number of tokens in circulation and could raise the price of the coin.

The profitability of BNB will be significantly influenced by technological advancements. To enhance the functionality of the blockchain, Binance has several plans to invest in cutting-edge technologies.

Conclusion

Now, it is not that the prediction of BNB coin is always positive. In light of the coin’s volatility and the fact that it “primarily follows the price gyrations of Bitcoin and has no real-world use,” John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, has predicted that BNB’s price will fall to $180 by the end of 2022.

It’s critical to bear in mind that cryptocurrency markets are incredibly unpredictable, making it challenging to provide long-term projections. Worth noting, however, that the F&G Index was in the fear category, at press time. Ergo, better times may not be ahead.",blockchain,ambcrypto.com

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Oct. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Scratch — the NFT research and assessment …",https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scratch-offers-ownership-stake-in-company-as-it-expands-focus-301656503.html,"Scratch, the decentralized finance company, moves beyond SCRATCH Token to offer investors equity in its groundbreaking non-fungible token (NFT) financial services.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Oct. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Scratch — the NFT research and assessment company — is officially dissolving the native Scratch Token to offer its community the chance to become co-owners of the company. Its real-time data-driven NFT valuation tool – Scratch Engine – is an industry-first, and the Company seeks to capitalize on the latest developments in NFTs.

""The NFT and crypto space is an ever-evolving one, and we need to evolve with it,"" says Shawn Owens, Co-Founder of SCRATCH Engine, LLC. ""In the interest of protecting our early adopters and SCRATCH Engine, LLC within the shifting regulatory landscape, we no longer believe that the SCRATCH Token, in its current form, has a viable future.""

The looming threat of the SCRATCH Token being deemed an unregistered security has severely limited the Company's ability to respond to changing market conditions, or to follow anything like a coherent product development cycle of ""launch, measure, iterate.""

""Since inception, the goal of the Scratch Engine has been to provide transparency and standardization in the NFT marketplace."" Owens continues. ""We continue to believe deeply in this mission: empowering buyers and sellers to make transactions based on verified and up-to-date information. When we launched the SCRATCH Token, we did so only in the furtherance of this mission.""

Now with the dissolution and end of support of the SCRATCH Token, the Company wants to make the community something more: owners.

Shawn Owens, Co-Founder of Scratch, believes that deeper community involvement will lead to a far superior product:

""We're offering the opportunity to our early adopters to have ownership in the Company following a reorganization from a limited liability company into a corporation. With our amazing community we've already completed all the items on our Phase One roadmap and have continued onto Phase Two, which we expect will include the launch of the Scratch Engine BETA V1 in Q1 2023. Together we can build the Scratch Engine stronger and better than ever.""

Although the Company originally intended to submit the SCRATCH Token for qualification as a security – and may pursue such a regulatory qualification of a future related digital asset to fuel the Scratch Engine, they now believe that the best path forward is to focus on the product. Then, upon the public launch of the Scratch Engine, the Company will consider the release of a related digital asset.

Scratch realizes they cannot build this alone, and the Company anticipates raising necessary capital through the sale of the equity in the near future.

As part of this raise, they intend to accept SCRATCH from any holders as of 10/21/2022 at 7:35 A.M. CST .as consideration for ownership. Any token holders who, for whatever reason, do not want to participate in this raise and become stockholders of the Company, will have the ability to hold their SCRATCH Tokens. Every effort will be made by the Company to exchange those unredeemed SCRATCH Tokens for a Company digital asset in the future.

Further information can be found at the Scratch's Medium page.

To learn more about the opportunity for equity in SCRATCH Engine, LLC, please see our Medium post for more details, or contact the Scratch team at [email protected].

231,"Inside EmpireDAO, New York’s New Web3 Coworking Space Headquartered Above Supreme",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-12-at-12.27.47-PM-1.png?w=872,22/10/2022,This isn't the typical workspace.,https://wwd.com/business-news/technology/tour-inside-empiredao-new-york-web3-coworking-space-supreme-soho-1235386236/,"A simple paper name tag sticks to your lapel designating your name and decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, affiliation — if you have one.

It’s OK if you didn’t find a DAO — which is basically code built by a community on a blockchain — nor know what it is.

Newcomers to Web3 — the anticipated next wave of the internet — say you learn quickly and there’s no better place to get involved than a breakfast and meetup — like the one held the first Tuesday of each month at EmpireDAO. Opened in September, New York’s newest Web3 coworking space was founded by crypto veteran Mike Fraietta for a crowd of hopeful and current Web3 professionals, some of whom may have never had a physical office before.

At first glance, the 1898-built Renaissance Revival-style building boasts hyped fashion adjacencies, as well as ample graffiti, with its location above the Supreme pop-up at 190 Bowery. Steeped in nostalgia, the building was once Germania Bank, then residence to photographer Jay Maisel in the ’60s before he sold it for $55 million in 2015. In homage to Maisel, the documentary “Jay Myself” plays on loop in the second-floor foyer to EmpireDAO after guests trace a visual timeline of key internet milestones displayed on placards throughout the spiral staircase below.

“What are you building?” is the Web3 version and socially acceptable replacement for “What do you do?” For example, doctors build DAOs to reimagine health care while music fans are reshaping concerts so artists get more agency back. These are the kind of projects discussed at the networking meetups and some of the missions of people who fill the workspace.

In three words: “community-owned community” is what Fraietta is building.

“This is going to happen,” he tells WWD. “This has already been written that this will be the next version [of the internet]. I was the guy 20 years ago going, ‘Everyone’s going to be a publisher…’ Everybody will be a bank, everything will have a token to it, every company will have a [Web3] team, as with social media teams, and it will make things a lot easier….We can make this happen a lot faster by having [EmpireDAO] here.”

Like many, Fraietta — who is wearing a black T-shirt with the company’s logo on the back and pigeon at the chest, over-the-ear Apple headphones around his neck and carrying a comically enormous water bottle — is championing the coming change. Even fashion companies have started to catalogue incoming shifts by participating in events like Decentraland’s Metaverse Fashion Week.

Generally open between 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the work week, EmpireDAO sees roughly 300 members day (currently at max capacity), and alone, occupies six stories across the 36,000-square-foot space. There’s also a roof with a full panorama of downtown Manhattan and painted water tower. Members pay to use a desk with membership sold as NFTs comparable to WeWork’s monthly pricing. On the side, EmpireDAO is renting the space out for special events with partner Hush Events NYC. (One known luxury brand was said to be one recent party-thrower.)

Workspaces are relatively bare but swaths of kitschy and colorful street art occupy the walls (bringing up nostalgia for the work style of former Lower East Side resident artist Jean-Michel Basquiat). EmpireDAO runs an artists in residence program that takes over the gallery space. The second floor, or main entertaining space, opens to a coffee bar stamped in neon script with “EmpireDAO” branding and stately furniture anchoring sitting areas. The spacious lounge reveals remnants of the former bank — like the ornate Otis elevator copper cage (now a bar). Off the main room is a windowed gallery where art-meets-comedy-meets-hackathon-meets-whatever-else is happening at the time.

Though certain stereotypes or vices — be it the handful of electric scooters stashed in the corner or vape puffs in between conversations at EmpireDAO, may come to define tech spaces — there was a balanced and diverse pool of attendees at a DAO founders meetup in early October.

For one, Abigail Carlson from ConsenSys Mesh is looking to support the creation of new impact DAOs as entrepreneurs veer towards Web3 as a new way to crowdfund, share knowledge and spur action, while Kofi Asante-Mensah is looking to bring more power to musicians with his global digital concert enterprise SAGOS (for Solid as Gold Consulting) Marketplace. The marketplace holds concerts in the metaverse and is said to more directly benefit the artist.

According to Tess Fenn, head of community and impact at video streaming platform Beem who also attended the meetup, Web3 culture is like “learning a new language.” And learning that language is aided by the right apps and browsers, she says. These include Brave for internet searches (so your data isn’t packaged off for big bucks without your permission), Telegram or Discord for encrypted instant messaging (not unlike WhatsApp) and your choice of digital currencies. Twitter is also part of it. Like fashion brands learned TikTok and hired staffers for it, learning how Web3 works is all part of facing the Web3 transition head-on.

But to avoid the pitfall of a coworking space like WeWork (which ultimately failed to turn a profit amid rapid expansion) EmpireDAO — which is currently in the midst of its second funding round, though details are few as with its seed round — will need to put its money to good use.

Alec Shaw, who is a partner at Sperax (essentially a crypto investment fund), says the workplace gives a face to otherwise “anonymous” internet users while providing a community feel.

Shaw said crypto projects are now being held to similar financial performance standards as “Web2” companies and the hype around Web3 and crypto isn’t enough to succeed in the long term anymore. Decentralized finance projects like Sperax, NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (currently being probed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for unregistered NFT sales) and communities like EmpireDAO are expected to run revenue-producing businesses.

Speaking broadly of the investment climate around pioneering web projects, Shaw underscores: “When the hype leaves, the projects that survive will be those who closely manage burn rate and focus on often overlooked metrics like customer acquisition cost.”",blockchain,wwd

NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 14: The Disney logo is displayed outside the Disney Store in Times Square, December 14, 2017 in New York City. The Walt Disney Company announced on Thursday morning that it had reached a deal to purchase most of the assets of 21st Century Fox. The deal has a total value of around $66 billion, with Disney assuming $13.7 billion of Fox's net debt.

Disney Music Emporium Virtual Store

TechCrunch reported that Disney introduced a 3D 360 virtual experience for its Disney Music Emporium Online Store. The web3 experience was the product of the collaboration between Disney and Obsess, which is known for creating interactive virtual storefronts since its launching last July. Through this, fans will experience several worlds from Disney films and shows as they discover soundtracks and songs when clicking the vinyl records and CDs on the virtual space.

This was launched a few days ago for the fans to have the access to a virtual storefront that features individual displays for soundtracks. These include Encanto, Wandavision, Turning Red, Tomorrowland, Hocus Pocus, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Star Wars, The Lion King Musical, and more. By clicking the specific titles on the site, users can listen to the preview music and can add it to their carts after.

Disney Music Group President Ken Bunt said in a statement, ""We are excited to collaborate with Obsess to launch an exciting new shopping experience for our Disney Music Emporium store. As we prepare to celebrate 100 years of Disney, this is the perfect way to create discovery and fun for our guests.""

100 Years of Disney Music

As per Business Wire's report, the company advanced its celebration for its 100th anniversary this coming 2023. A musical timeline was also included in the site entitled ""Disney 100: The Wonder of Disney Music"".

Fans can enjoy the history to now of the company's music that marked the fans. The titles that were included on the timeline are the 1928 song ""Steamboat Wille"" by Mickey and Minnie Mouse, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" that was released in 1937, the 1940 classic ""Fantasia"", 2016's ""Moana"", and more.

As Disney develops an accelerator that focuses on Web3, NFT Gators reported that this is the start of the company building future immersive experiences as it targets several projects that involve technologies like augmented reality (AR), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and artificial intelligence (AI) characters.

Instead of using the word ""metaverse"" as several brands and companies have called it, Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek stated it as the next-generation storytelling as they enter this venture in the industry. Last September, Disney also opened its doors as it sought a corporate attorney that will be working with NFTs, Blockchain, Metaverse, and DeFi Transactions.

238,3 Spectacular Stocks Down 58% to 82% to Buy on the Dip,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/705343/a-person-pointing-to-two-arrows-outperforming-another-arrow-with-a-cityscape-below.jpg,22/10/2022,Investors looking for long-term growth in this challenging market might want to consider these three stocks.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/22/3-spectacular-stocks-down-58-to-82-to-buy-on-dip/,"Bear markets are never easy to navigate, and the Nasdaq 100 technology index is on pace for the worst annual decline since the 2008 global financial crisis. But one hallmark of every market downturn is opportunity: High-quality stocks often overshoot to the downside amid broader declines which are driven largely by fear.

A panel of Motley Fool contributors have identified Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -1.73%), Datadog (DDOG -7.82%), and Shopify (SHOP -3.68%) as three opportunities investors should consider buying on the dip, as each stock is trading at a steep discount to its all-time high. Let's explore the details.

A best-in-class semiconductor stock trading at a 65% discount

Anthony Di Pizio (Advanced Micro Devices): Semiconductors are the advanced computer chips essential to our most prized electronics, and the cloud computing technology that hosts our online experiences. Advanced Micro Devices is a world-class semiconductor producer, and it's one of the most diverse in the entire industry.

The company makes hardware for both the Sony PlayStation 5 and the Microsoft Xbox gaming consoles, and its chips are responsible for powering the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles. But that's not all: It also works with all the top providers of cloud services, from Amazon Web Services to Microsoft Azure to Alphabet's Google Cloud.

Now, AMD is set to take a leadership position in high-performance computing thanks to its $49 billion acquisition of Xilinx earlier this year. Xilinx is a pioneer in adaptive computing, which could be the future for advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). Mainstream semiconductors are often in a solid state, meaning they need to be swapped out for new ones when it's time to upgrade. But adaptive chips can adjust to the user's needs in real time and can be reconfigured even after the manufacturing process -- shortening the upgrade cycle.

AMD just reported disappointing preliminary results for the third quarter of 2022, booking $5.6 billion in revenue, for growth of just 29% year over year. However, the data center segment continued to shine with $1.6 billion in revenue and a growth rate of 45%. The company's greatest opportunities over the long run could be in the data center, especially when it comes to applying adaptive technologies, so it's promising to see the segment remaining strong.

Plus, according to analysts' expectations, the company remains on track to grow total sales by 45% for the whole of 2022, to $23.8 billion. With AMD stock down 65% from its all-time high, this could be a prime opportunity to take a position.

An appealing balance between growth and profitability, now at a 58% discount

Jamie Louko (Datadog): Technology and software companies have fallen out of favor with investors lately, but that doesn't mean there aren't high-quality businesses in the space. While many investors have fled from the tech sector, companies like Datadog have continued to post stellar adoption rates and profits.

Datadog operates application observability and performance monitoring software, which helps customers ensure that their digital applications and tech infrastructure are running smoothly and effectively. This is a must-have service for customers, so it makes sense that demand has remained relatively stable this year, despite the concerning economic backdrop. According to Gartner, Datadog is a leader in the space; this helped the company achieve 74% year-over-year top-line growth in Q2, reaching $406 million in revenue.

Importantly, Datadog has profit and cash flow coming in, signaling that it isn't sacrificing profits to achieve artificially higher growth rates. Over the trailing 12 months, Datadog generated almost $354 million in free cash flow -- for a 26% margin -- while keeping net income at $6.5 million.

This cash flow can help the company do something critical to continue thriving in this space: innovate. Competition is fierce in the application performance monitoring space, with immense pressure from established rivals like Dynatrace. For Datadog to maintain its leadership status, it must continue to build and release new products for customers, and the company has done that. As of August, Datadog had announced the rollout of six products in 2022, and it expects to roll out even more by year's end.

With shares down 58% from all-time highs, Datadog's valuation has fallen from an egregious multiple to a much more acceptable one; shares trade at 74 times free cash flow. While that's still expensive on an absolute basis, it's far lower than earlier this year, when the stock was valued as high as 200 times free cash flow.

Considering the company's leadership and flawless execution in an industry expected to be worth $53 billion in 2025, Datadog looks worth paying up for.

The market leader in e-commerce software, at an 82% discount

Trevor Jennewine (Shopify): Shopify makes it easy for merchants to manage an omnichannel business. Its software helps sellers build direct-to-consumer (D2C) websites, and it also integrates with online marketplaces like Amazon and social media like Alphabet's YouTube. Shopify sweetens the deal with adjacent services including discounted shipping, financing, and payment processing.

The comprehensive nature of its offerings has made it popular with small businesses, though Shopify Plus -- a more customizable option for larger businesses -- is also gaining traction. In fact, Shopify and Shopify Plus rank as the top two e-commerce platforms in terms of market presence, according to G2 Grid, and Shopify powered 10.3% of online retail sales in the U.S. last year, second only to Amazon.

Despite that strong market position, Shopify has struggled with high inflation this year, as evidenced by its disappointing financial results. Revenue climbed just 16% in the second quarter, and the company posted a non-GAAP (adjusted) loss of $0.03 per diluted share, down from a non-GAAP profit of $0.22 per diluted share in the prior year. As a result, Shopify has seen its share price plunge 82% since last peaking in November 2021.

However, investors need to focus on the big picture. Shopify actually continued to gain market share in U.S. retail, both online and offline, through the first half of 2022. Moreover, temporary economic headwinds leave the long-term investment thesis unchanged: Shopify is the leading e-commerce software vendor, and it has a particularly strong foothold in the U.S. That bodes well for the future, as online retail sales in the U.S. will grow faster than 12% annually to approach $1.7 trillion by 2026.

But Shopify is also working to strengthen its position and expand its market opportunity. For instance, it recently added business-to-business (B2B) commerce tools to Shopify Plus, so Plus merchants can now sell D2C and B2B from the same platform. That could be a game changer for a couple of reasons. First, it makes Shopify a more compelling option for larger sellers. In fact, management says more than half of existing Plus merchants could utilize B2B tools. Second, it should allow Shopify to capitalize on the massive B2B market. For context, global B2B e-commerce sales are expected to grow at nearly 20% annually to reach $33 trillion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.

Currently, Shopify is bouncing off a 52-week low, and shares trade at an inexpensive 7.5 times sales. That's why this beaten-down growth stock is worth buying now.",cloud computing,motley fool

The round was led by...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netmaker-launches-2-3m-funding-004600234.html,"The Asheville-based startup is backed by Y-Combinator, and is bringing high-tech to Appalachia and beyond

ASHEVILLE, N.C., Oct. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Netmaker, a cloud networking startup, announced $2.3 million in funding to launch their ""superhighway for secure cloud networks."" The round was led by Lytical Ventures, Uncorrelated Ventures, and SaxeCap among others, following their graduation from Y-Combinator. Netmaker offers a platform built on WireGuard which transforms the way companies integrate their networks to make them safe, dynamic and up to 15 times faster than alternatives.

In addition to the funding, Netmaker is announcing the 1.0 release of their community product, and an Enterprise Edition, which offers HA networking, metrics and access controls for users.

Modern applications are significantly more complex than they appear. While individuals see a website or smartphone app, in the background, a vast ecosystem of infrastructure and applications must be connected together to make this software work. Today, those connections are created by operations teams who must follow a process which is expensive, time-consuming, and painstaking. That's where Netmaker comes in.

""We created Netmaker because we had to. We saw this gap between what we're capable of doing with cloud computing, and what networking allowed us to do. We realized that there was nothing on the market that could solve this problem, so we had to build it ourselves,"" said CEO Alex Feiszli.

Netmaker allows applications to access each other directly and securely, without going through a central gateway. It does this with peer-to-peer virtual networks, automated over a client-server model. The server manages the keys, addresses, and discovery of peers, and sends this information to clients, which enables advanced routing operations to move traffic into, out of, and throughout the network.

Recent trends in hybrid cloud, edge computing, and IoT have made this pattern a necessity.

Story continues

""Netmaker makes it simple to abstract away the physical network, allowing IT departments to create logical networks in minutes. Now, putting IoT devices with 5G onto the same flat network with a control environment can be done in minutes instead of days or weeks. I believe it's a tool that will be in every IT department's kit in the coming year."" said Lucas Nelson, Partner at Lytical Ventures.

Feiszli and Carns previously worked together building cloud software and led a team of multi-cloud platform engineers at IBM. During the pandemic, the duo moved to Asheville, NC. Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the town is known more for its craft breweries than its tech startup scene, but Feiszli and Carns have big plans to bring the cloud to the 'Land of the Sky'.

Netmaker was released on GitHub in March of 2021, and the adoption was swift. There are now over 1,200 organizations and individuals running the platform. This traction brought Netmaker to the attention of Y-Combinator, which further accelerated the company's popularity. Growth in active platforms since the start of 2022 has averaged 32% MoM.

The beleaguered e-commerce platform hasn't held up well after the COVID-19 pandemic. And while its unique business model gives it an economic moat, slowing growth and a high valuation should give investors pause.

What went wrong for Shopify

Founded in 2004 and going public in 2015, Shopify is an e-commerce platform designed to help small businesses create customized online stores where they can sell items both online and in-person. It differentiates itself from large third-party online marketplaces such as Amazon by focusing on merchants instead of the end consumer.

Like most e-commerce companies, Shopify performed exceptionally well during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to booms in both online shopping and online entrepreneurship. However, now that the crisis has eased, investors are beginning to reevaluate the company's value.

Second-quarter earnings were disappointing. Revenue grew just 16% year over year to $1.3 billion -- a marked decceleration from the 57% growth rate reported in the prior-year period. To be fair, this can be blamed on challenging comparison against the exceptionally strong pandemic years. But Shopify's management seems to have assumed the boom would never end, causing it to overexpand in anticipation of growth that never materialized. This mistake has been disastrous for company margins.

Profitability looks far away

In the second quarter, Shopify reported much higher marketing, research and development, and administrative spending (which includes hiring staff). But with growth not as strong as expected, operating income dropped from a gain of $139.4 million to a loss of $190.2 million in the period.

To make matters worse, Shopify also faces intensifying competition from Amazon, which also boasts merchant solutions such as Fulfillment by Amazon and Buy with Prime, which allows customers to use perks such as free delivery and seamless checkout directly with partnered merchant stores. Competition with a behemoth like Amazon will not be cheap. And Shopify will have to invest significant capital into its fulfillment capabilities to stay relevant in the industry.

In July, the company completed its $2.1 billion acquisition of end-to-end logistics platform Deliverr to help boost its fulfillment speed and capacity. This buyout could be the first of many similar investments that consume Shopify's capital and may have a negative effect on margins in the near term.

The valuation is too high

Despite falling 80% in 2022, Shopify stock still looks expensive, considering its slowing revenue and unclear path to profitability. With a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of seven, its top-line valuation is almost triple Amazon's 2.4. And while both companies face similar challenges, Amazon's diversified business (which includes cloud computing and digital advertising) can help make up for the slack in its e-commerce operations.

Shopify doesn't have a backup plan, and investors should avoid the stock because of continued risk to the downside.",cloud computing,motley fool

Miners (the network participants) undertake mining to verify the legitimacy of transactions on the blockchain and ensure network security by preventing double-spending. In return for their efforts, miners are rewarded with a certain amount of BTC.

There are various ways to mine cryptocurrencies, and this article will discuss how to get started with mobile crypto mining from the comfort of your home.

What is crypto mining?

Mining, a resource-intensive activity that often demands enormous computing power to solve a computational problem and add the next valid block to a blockchain, is a crucial component of cryptocurrencies.

Typically, graphics processing units (GPUs) or high-performance hardware are used for cryptocurrency mining. However, unlike GPU mining rigs, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining equipment is explicitly made for mining cryptocurrencies, making an ASIC miner more powerful and energy-efficient than a comparable GPU miner.

READ ALSO What are the different ways to mine cryptocurrency?

Being application-specific, ASICs can be used exclusively for one purpose, such as to mine a specific coin. Nonetheless, the risk of mining just one coin is high due to the enormous volatility of the cryptocurrency market. For instance, the ASIC equipment will be useless if the coin’s value declines over time or the developers decide to alter the hashing algorithm.

Alternatively, can you mine cryptocurrency on your phone? Proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies like BTC can be mined using smartphones. Small-scale miners can join mining pools to combine their computer power to raise the likelihood of mining a block successfully. However, the computing power offered using smartphones will be little compared to ASICs, and miners’ payouts will be roughly equal to their contribution.

What is mobile crypto mining, and how does it work?

Mining cryptocurrencies using the processing capacity of smartphones powered by iOS and Android systems is called mobile crypto mining. As mentioned before, in mobile mining, rewards will be approximately the same percentage as computing power offered by miners. But, overall, is mining cryptocurrency on your phone free?

Cryptocurrency mining on the phone requires one to invest in a smartphone, download a cryptocurrency mining app and get a stable internet connection. However, the incentive for crypto miners may be substantially smaller and may not cover the cost of the electricity used to mine. Additionally, the smartphone will experience extreme strain from mining, reducing its lifespan and perhaps destroying its hardware, making it worthless to use for another purpose.

Many apps are available for iOS and Android operating systems to mine cryptocurrencies. However, most apps are only available on third-party crypto mining sites, whose legitimacy must be carefully investigated before use. For instance, according to Google’s developer policy, mobile mining apps are not allowed on Play Store. However, it enables developers to create applications that let them control mining taking place somewhere else, like on cloud computing platforms. The possible reasons behind such restrictions include the quick depletion of batteries; the smartphone will overheat if mining is done “on device” because of the intensive processing.

How to mine cryptocurrency on an Android smartphone

To mine Bitcoin on mobile, miners can either go for Android solo mining or join mining pools like AntPool, Poolin, BTC.com, F2Pool and ViaBTC. However, not every smartphone user can opt for solo mining as it is a computationally intensive task, and it may take decades before you can mine cryptocurrencies using your phone, even if you use one of the newest flagship models.

Alternatively, miners can join cryptocurrency mining pools using apps like the Bitcoin miner or MinerGate Mobile Miner to generate adequate computational processing power and share rewards with contributing stakeholders. However, miners’ pay, payment frequency and incentive options depend on the pool size. Also, be aware that each mining pool follows a different payment system and rewards may vary accordingly.

For instance, in a pay-per-share system, miners receive a specific payout rate for each share they successfully mine, each worth a particular amount of mineable cryptocurrency. On the contrary, the block reward and the mining service fee are settled according to the theoretical profit. Miners also receive a portion of the transaction fees under the full pay-per-share system.

How to mine cryptocurrency on an iPhone

Miners can download mining apps on iPhones to mine cryptocurrencies without investing in expensive hardware equipment. However, regardless of the mining app miners choose, mobile crypto mining may result in high wear and tear without reasonably rewarding their time and effort.

For instance, it may cost miners a lot to run the iPhone on high energy. However, the quantity of BTC or other altcoins they can mine is minimal. Moreover, mobile mining may result in iPhone’s low performance due to the excessive computing power required and the constant need to charge the phone.

Is mobile crypto mining profitable?

Mining profitability depends upon the computational power and efficient hardware used during the crypto-mining process. That said, the more advanced equipment one uses to mine cryptocurrencies, the more likely one will earn more profit than those using smartphones. Moreover, some cyber criminals use the cryptojacking method to secretly use the computing power of unprotected devices to mine cryptocurrencies, making them inefficient for mining in case the original owner wants to mine cryptocurrencies.

Nonetheless, crypto miners often perform a cost-benefit analysis (the advantages of a choice or action less the expenses involved with that choice or activity) to ascertain the mining profitability before making any investments. But, is mobile mining legal? The legality of mining on smartphones, ASICs or any hardware equipment depends upon the jurisdiction of residence, as some countries restrict cryptocurrencies. That said, mining using any hardware equipment will be rendered illegal if cryptocurrencies are restricted in a particular country.

READ ALSO Is Bitcoin legal? A glimpse of BTC’s regulatory environment

Above all, one should determine their mining goals and prepare their budget before choosing any mining equipment. Before making any investments, it is also important to take environmental issues related to crypto mining into account.

The future of mobile crypto mining

Despite the surge in popularity of cryptocurrency mining, it has been criticized for being economically and environmentally harmful, causing PoW cryptocurrencies like Ethereum to move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Additionally, the legal status of mining cryptocurrency is unclear in some jurisdictions, which puts doubt on the viability of a mining strategy. Furthermore, over time, mining apps begin to degrade the smartphone’s functionality, making them inefficient for cryptocurrency mining.

On the contrary, while the evolution of mining hardware equipment enabled miners to run their rigs profitably, the struggle for sustainable mining rewards will keep driving technological advancement. Nonetheless, what the next significant innovation in mobile mining technology will look like is not yet known.

Part 2 considers the collapse scenarios we’re likely to face if we fail in those efforts. In this part we’re looking at concrete things we could work towards to make our software more resilient in those scenarios.

The takeaway from part 2 was that if we fail to mitigate the climate crisis, we’re headed for a world where it’s expensive or impossible to get new hardware, where electrical power is scarce, internet access is not the norm, and cloud services don’t exist anymore or are largely inaccessible due to lack of internet.

What could we do to prepare our software for these risks? In this part of the series I’ll look at some ideas and relevant art for resilient technlogy, and how we could apply this to GNOME.

Local-First

Producing power locally is comparatively doable given the right equipment, but internet access is contingent on lots of infrastructure both locally and across the globe. This is why reducing dependence on connectivity is probably the most important challenge for resilience.

Unfortunately we’ve spent the past few decades making software ever more reliant on having fast internet access, all the time. Many of the apps people spend all day in are unusable without an internet connection. So what would be the opposite of that? Is anyone working in the direction of minimizing reliance on the network?

As it turns out, yes! It’s called “local-first”. The idea is that instead of the primary copy of your data being on a server and local apps acting as clients to it, the client is the primary source of truth. The network is only used optionally for syncing and collaboration, with potential conflicts automatically resolved using CRDTs. This allows for superior UX because you’re not waiting on the network, better privacy because you can end-to-end encrypt everything, and better handling of low-connectivity cases. All of this is of course technically very challenging, and there aren’t many implementations of it in production today, but the field is growing and maturing quickly.

Among the most prominent proponents of the local-first idea are the community around the Ink & Switch research lab and Muse, a sketching/knowledge work app for Apple platforms. However, there’s also prior work in this direction from the GNOME community: There’s Christian Hergert’s Bonsai, the Endless content apps, and it’s actually one of the GNOME Foundation’s newly announced goals to enable more people to build local-first apps.

For more on local-first software, I recommend watching Rob’s GUADEC talk (Recording on Youtube), reading the original paper on local-first software (2019), or listening to this episode of the Metamuse podcast (2021) on the subject.

Other relevant art for local-first technology:

automerge, a library for bulding local-first software

Fullscreen, a web-based whiteboard app which allows saving to a custom file format that includes history and editing permissions

Magic Wormhole, a system to send files directly between computers without any servers

Earthstar, a local-first sync system with USB support

USB Fallback

Local-first often assumes it’s possible to sometimes use the network for syncing or transferring data between devices, but what if you never have an internet connection?

It’s possible to use the local network in some instances, but they’re not very reliable in practice. Local networks are often weirdly configured, and things can fail in many ways that are hard to debug (Source: Endless tried it and decided it was not worth the hassle). In contrast USB storage is reliable, flexible, and well-understood by most people, making it a much better fallback.

As a practical example, a photo management app built in this paradigm would

Store all photos locally so there’s never any spinners after first setup

Allow optionally syncing with other devices and collaborative album management with other people via local network or the internet

Automatically reconcile conflicts if something changed on other devices while they were disconnected

Allow falling back to USB, i.e. copying some of the albums to a USB drive and then importing them on another device (including all metadata, collaboration permissons, etc.)

Some concrete things we could work on in the local-first area:

Investigate existing local-first libraries, if/how they could be integrated into our stack, or if we’d need to roll our own

Prototype local-first sync in some real-world apps

Implement USB app installation and updates in GNOME Software (mockups)

Resource Efficiency

While power can be produced locally, it’s likely that in the future it will be far less abundant than today. For example, you may only have power a few hours a day (already a reality in parts of the global south), or only when there’s enough sun or wind at the moment. This makes power efficiency in software incredibly important.

Power Measurement is Hard

Improving power efficiency is not straightforward, since it’s not possible to measure it directly. Measuring the computer’s power consumption as a whole is trivial, but knowing which program caused how much of it is very difficult to pin down (for more on this check out Aditya Manglik’s GUADEC talk (Recording on Youtube) about power profiling tooling). Making progress in this area is important to allow developers to make their software more power-efficient.

However, while better measurements would be great to have, in practice there’s a lot developers can do even without it. Power is in large part a function of CPU, GPU, and memory use, so reducing each of these definitely helps, and we do have mature profiling tools for these.

Choose a Low-Power Stack

Different tech stacks and dependencies are not created equal when it comes to power consumption, so this is a factor to take into account when starting new projects. One area where there are actual comparative studies on this is programming languages: For example, according to this paper Python uses way more power than other languages commonly used for GNOME app development.

Another important choice is user interface toolkit. Nowadays many applications just ship their own copy of Chrome (in the form of Electron) to render a web app, resulting in huge downloads, slow startup times, large CPU and memory footprints, and laggy interfaces. Using native toolkits instead of web technologies is a key aspect of making resilient software, and GTK4/Adwaita is actually in a really good position here given its performance, wide language support, modern feature set and widgets, and community-driven development model.

Schedule Power Use

It’s also important to actively consider the temporal aspect of power use. For example, if your power supply is a solar panel, the best time to charge batteries or do computing-intensive tasks is during the day, when there’s the most sunlight.

If we had a way for the system to tell apps that right now is a good/bad time to use a lot of power, they could adjust their behavior accordingly. We already do something similar for metered connections, e.g. Software doesn’t auto-download updates if your connection is metered. I could also imagine new user-facing features in this direction, e.g. a way to manually schedule certain tasks for when there will be more power so you can tell Builder to start compiling the long list of dependencies for a newly cloned Rust project tomorrow morning when the sun is back out.

Some concrete things we could work on in the area of resource efficiency:

Improve power efficiency across the stack

Explore a system API to tell apps whether now is a good time to use lots of power or not

Improve the developer story for GTK on Windows and macOS, to allow more people to choose it over Electron

Data Resilience

In hedging against loss of connectivity, it’s not enough to have software that works offline. In many cases what’s more important is the data we read/write using that software, and what we can do with it in resource-constrained scenarios.

The File System is Good, Actually

The 2010s saw lots of experimentation with moving away from the file system as the primary way to think about data storage, both within GNOME and across the wider industry. It makes a lot of sense in theory: Organizing everything manually in folders is shit work people don’t want to do, so they end up with messy folder hierarchies and it’s hard to find things. Bespoke content apps for specific kinds of data, with rich search and layouts custom-tailored to the data are definitely a nicer, more human-friendly way to deal with content–in theory.

In practice we’ve seen a number of problems with the content app approach though, including

Flexibility : Files can be copied/pasted/deleted, stored on a secondary internal drive, sent as email attachments, shared via a USB key, opened/changed using other apps, and more. With content apps you usually don’t have all of these options.

: Files can be copied/pasted/deleted, stored on a secondary internal drive, sent as email attachments, shared via a USB key, opened/changed using other apps, and more. With content apps you usually don’t have all of these options. Interoperability : The file system is a lowest common denominator across all OSes and apps.

: The file system is a lowest common denominator across all OSes and apps. Development Effort : Building custom viewers/editors for every type of content is a ton of work, in part because you have to reimplement all the common operations you get for free in a file manager.

: Building custom viewers/editors for every type of content is a ton of work, in part because you have to reimplement all the common operations you get for free in a file manager. Familiarity : While it’s messy and not that easy to learn, most people have a vague understanding of the file system by now, and the universality of this paradigm means it only has to be learned once.

: While it’s messy and not that easy to learn, most people have a vague understanding of the file system by now, and the universality of this paradigm means it only has to be learned once. Unmaintained Apps: Data living in a specific app’s database is useless if the app goes unmaintained. This is especially problematic in free software, where volunteer maintainers abandoning projects is not uncommon.

Due to the above reasons, we’ve seen in practice that the file system is not in fact dying. It’s actually making its way into places where it previously wasn’t present, including iPhones (which now come with a Files app) and the web (via Nextcloud, Google Drive, and company).

From a resilience point of view some of the shortcomings of content apps listed above are particularly important, such as the flexibility to be moved via USB when there’s no internet, and cross-platform interoperability. This is why I think user-accessible files should be the primary source of truth for user data in apps going forward.

Simple, Standardized Formats

With limited connectivity, a potential risk is that you don’t have the ability to download new software to open a file you’re encountering. This is why sticking to well-known standard formats that any computer is likely to have a viewer/editor for is generally preferable (plain text, standard image formats, PDF, and so on).

When starting a new app, ask yourself, is a whole new format needed or could it use/extend something pre-existing? Perhaps there’s a format you could use that already has an ecosystem of apps that support it, especially on other platforms?

For example, if you were to start a new notes app that can do inline media you could go with a custom binary format and a database, but you could also go with Markdown files in a user-accessible folder. In order to get inline media you could use Textbundle, an extension to Markdown implemented by a number of other Markdown apps on other platforms, which basically packs the contained media into an archive together with the Markdown file.

Side note: I really want a nice GTK app that supports Textbundle (more specifically, its compressed variant Textpack), if you want to make one I’d be deligthed to help on the design side :)

Export as Fallback

Ideally data should be stored in standardized formats with wide support, and human-readable in a text editor as a fallback (if applicable). However, this isn’t possible in every case, for example if an app produces a novel kind of content there are no standardized formats for yet (e.g. a collaborative whiteboard app). In these cases it’s important to make sure the non-standard format is well-documented for people implementing alternative clients, and has support for exporting to more common formats, e.g. exporting the current state of a collaborative whiteboard as PDF or SVG.

Some concrete things we could work on towards better data resilience:

Explore new ways to do content apps with the file system as a backend

Look at where we’re using custom formats in our apps, and consider switching to standard ones

Consider how this fits in with local-first syncing

Keep Old Hardware Running

There are many reasons why old hardware stops being usable, including software built for newer, faster devices becoming too slow on older ones, vendors no longer providing updates for a device, some components (especially batteries) degrading with use over time, and of course planned obsolescence. Some of these factors are purely hardware-related, but some also only depend on software, so we can influence them.

Use old Hardware for Development

I already touched on this in the dedicated section above, but obviously using less CPU, RAM, etc. helps not only with power use, but also allows the software to run on older hardware for longer. Unfortunately most developers use top of the line hardware, so they are least impacted by inefficiencies in their personal use.

One simple way to ensure you keep an eye on performance and resource use: Don’t use the latest, most powerful hardware. Maybe keep your old laptop for a few years longer, and get it repaired instead of buying a new one when something breaks. Or if you’re really hardcore, buy an older device on purpose to use as your main machine. As we all know, the best way to get developers to care about something is to actually dogfood it :)

Hardware Enablement for Common Devices

In a world where it’s difficult to get new hardware, it’ll become increasingly important to reuse existing devices we have lying around. Unfortunately, a lot of this hardware is stuck on very old versions of proprietary software that are both slow and insecure.

With Windows devices there’s an easy solution: Just install an up-to-date free software OS. But while desktop hardware is fairly well-supported by mainline Linux, mobile is a huge mess in this regard. The Android world almost exclusively uses old kernels with lots of non-upstreamable custom patches. It takes years to mainline a device, and it has to be done for every device.

Projects like PostmarketOS are working towards making more Android devices usable, but as you can see from their device support Wiki, success is limited so far. One especially problematic aspect from a resilience point of view is that the devices that tend to be worked on are the ones that developers happen to have, which are generally not the models that sell the most units. Ideally we’d work strategically to mainline some of the most common devices, and make sure they actually fully work. Most likely that’d be mid-range Samsung phones and iPhones. For the latter there’s curiously little work in this direction, despite being a gigantic, relatively homogeneous pool of devices (for example, there are 224 million iPhone 6 out there which don’t get updates anymore).

Hack Bootloaders

Unfortunately, hardware enablement alone is not enough to make old mobile devices more long-lived by installing more up-to date free software. Most mobile devices come with locked bootloaders, which require contacting the manufacturer to get an unlock code to install alternative software – if they allow it at all. This means if the vendor company’s server goes away or you don’t have internet access there’s no way to repurpose a device.

What we’d probably need is a collection of exploits that allow unlocking bootloaders on common devices in a fully offline way, and a user-friendly automated unlocking tool using these exploits. I could imagine this being part of the system’s disk utility app or a separate third-party app, which allows unlocking the bootloader and installing a new OS onto a mobile device you plug in via USB.

Some concrete things we could work on to keep old hardware running:

Actively try to ensure older hardware keeps working with new versions of our software (and ideally getting faster with time rather than slower thanks to ongoing performance work)

Explore initiatives to do strategic hardware eneblament for some of the most common mobile devices (including iPhones, potentially?)

Forge alliances with the infosec/Android modding community and build convenient offline bootloader unlocking tools

Build for Repair

In a less connected future it’s possible that substantial development of complex systems software will stop being a thing, because the necessary expertise will not be available in any single place. In such a scenario being able to locally repair and repurpose hardware and software for new uses and local needs is likely to become important.

Repair is a relatively clearly defined problem space for hardware, but for software it’s kind of a foreign concept. The idea of a centralized development team “releasing” software out into the world at scale is built into our tools, technologies, and culture at every level. You generally don’t repair software, because in most cases you don’t even have the source code, and even if you do (and the software doesn’t depend on some server component) there’s always going to be a steep learning curve to being able to make meaningful changes to an unfamiliar code base, even for seasoned programmers.

In a connected world it will therefore always be most efficient to have a centralized development team that maintains a project and makes releases for the general public to use. But with that possibly no longer an option in the future, someone else will end up having to make sure things work as best they can at the local level. I don’t think this will mean most people will start making changes to their own software, but I could see software repair becoming a role for specialized technicians, similar to electricians or car mechanics.

How could we build our software in a way that makes it most useful to people in such a future?

Use Well-Understood, Accessible Tech

One of the most important things we can do today to make life easier for potential future software repair technicians is using well-established technology, which they’re likely to already have experience with. Writing apps in Haskell may be a fun exercise, but if you want other people to be able to repair/repurpose them in the future, GJS is probably a better option, simply because so many more people are familiar with the language.

Another important factor determining a technology stack’s repairability is how accessible it is to get started with. How easy is it for someone to get a development environment up and running from scratch? Is there good (offline) documentation? Do you need to understand complex math or memory management concepts?

Local-First Development

Most modern development workflows assume a fast internet connection on a number of levels, including downloading and updating dependencies (e.g. npm modules or flatpak SDKs), documentation, tutorials, Stackoverflow, and so on.

In order to allow repair at the local level, we also need to rethink development workflows in a local-first fashion, meaning things like:

Ship all the source code and development tools needed to rebuild/modify the OS and apps with the system

Have a first-class flow for replacing parts of the system or apps with locally modified/repaired versions, allowing easy management of different versions, rollbacks, etc.

Have great offline documentation and tutorials, and maybe even something like a locally cached subset of Stackoverflow for a few technologies (e.g. the 1000 most popular questions with the “gtk” tag)

Getting the tooling and UX right for a fully integrated local-first software repair flow will be a lot of work, but there’s some interesting relevant art from Endless OS from a few years back. The basic idea was that you transform any app you’re running into an IDE editing the app’s source code (thanks to Will Thompson for the screencast below). The devil is of course in the details for making this a viable solution to local software repair, but I think this would be a very interesting direction to explore further.

Some concrete things we could work on to make our software more repairable:

Avoid using obscure languages and technologies for new projects

Avoid overly complex and brittle dependency trees

Investigate UX for a local-first software repair flow

Revive or replace the Devhelp offline documentation app

Look into ways to make useful online resources (tutorials, technical blog posts, Stackoverflow threads, etc.) usable offline

Helm is undoubtedly one of the most popular and successful open-source projects in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Since it was introduced at the inaugural KubeCon in 2015, Helm's usage has steadily grown to solidify its status as the de facto package manager for Kubernetes. It graduated from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2020, and in the CNCF Survey 2020, more than 60% of the survey respondents reported Helm as their preferred method for packaging Kubernetes applications. This rates significantly higher than Kustomize and other managed Kubernetes offerings.

Given Helm's popularity and ubiquity, it's important to understand the architecture and usage patterns to utilize the tool effectively. In this guide, we'll break down the key concepts underlying Helm's structure and walk through some best practices.

Helm Structure

Helm packages Kubernetes applications into charts, which is a collection of templated Kubernetes manifest files. Each chart contains the following content:

example-chart/ ├── .helmignore ├── Chart.yaml ├── values.yaml ├── charts/ └── templates/ └── tests/ ...





Let's dive deeper into each file:

.helmignore – Defines files or patterns to ignore when packaging up the Helm chart (e.g., .vscode , .git , secret files).

– Defines files or patterns to ignore when packaging up the Helm chart (e.g., , , secret files). Chart.yaml – Contains top-level metadata about the Helm chart including the name, version, and other dependencies if the chart bundles multiple applications together. Examples of dependent charts include packaging Zookeeper with Kafka or grouping Prometheus and Grafana together.

– Contains top-level metadata about the Helm chart including the name, version, and other dependencies if the chart bundles multiple applications together. Examples of dependent charts include packaging Zookeeper with Kafka or grouping Prometheus and Grafana together. values.yaml – Sets default values for all templated portions of the chart under the templates directory. These default values can be overridden via –values or –set flags.

– Sets default values for all templated portions of the chart under the templates directory. These default values can be overridden via or flags. charts – Stores tar files of dependent charts if it was specified in Chart.yaml .

– Stores tar files of dependent charts if it was specified in . templates – Holds all the Kubernetes manifest files that define the application, including but not limited to Deployment, Services, autoscaling, ConfigMaps, and Secrets. Along with core Kubernetes files, it can also hold template helpers, NOTES.txt, and test files.

Underneath the hood, Helm uses Go templates to coalesce values into the corresponding template files. This means that it's important to understand YAML syntax as well as Go's data types to create, update, or use a Helm chart.

Helm Lifecycle

Once the chart is created, it is ready to be deployed into a Kubernetes cluster. The Helm CLI uses install or upgrade commands to trigger a new release. Each release is an isolated, deployed artifact of a versioned, templated chart. This means that it is possible to have multiple releases of the same chart as long as the underlying values do not conflict. For example, a PostgreSQL Helm chart can be deployed with the same configurations to two different namespaces.

Also, Helm keeps a history of each release, allowing easy rollbacks. To see the release history, run helm history <name-of-release> . Then to roll back, use helm rollback <name-of-release> <version> . While these CLI commands are useful for development, these will most likely be controlled by a more robust CD system in production.

Helm Best Practices

Now that we have a good understanding of Helm's structure and lifecycle, we'll review some best practices and useful tips to interact with Helm charts.

Bootstrap Charts With Helm CLI

Helm provides an excellent skeleton to bootstrap a new Helm chart via the helm create command. Instead of handcrafting individual Helm files from scratch, take advantage of the create command to get default manifest files (e.g., deployment.yaml , hpa.yaml , ingress.yaml , service.yaml , and serviceaccount.yaml ) as well as templates to provide unique names and annotations.

Check for Errors With Helm CLI

Helm also provides several tools to validate the chart before deploying. YAML and Go template syntax can be difficult to debug, especially when it's due to simple indentation or empty value errors.

helm lint – Examines the chart for syntax issues such as poorly formatted YAML indentation or missing values. Running this command with the –debug flag can provide more information. helm template – Locally renders the templates using provided values. This can be useful to see if the override values are correctly inserted into the manifest templates. To focus on a single template, use the -s flag: helm template my-chart -s templates/deployment.yaml . --dry-run – Lint and template commands can only catch templating issues via static analysis. To catch Kubernetesrelated errors (e.g., using a deprecated Kubernetes API version), run the --dry-run command before invoking the upgrade or install commands.

For advanced guides on template functions, flow controls, and other debugging tricks, refer to the Helm documentation section under ""Chart Template Guide.""

Package With Subcharts

As mentioned in the Helm structure section, sometimes it makes sense to package multiple applications together into a single Helm chart. This pattern is useful to group related applications or databases together into a single deployable unit. Common use cases include packaging PostgreSQL and Redis with a Django app or bundling all the components of the ELK/EFK stack together. Another way to use subcharts is to bundle common helper templates to add annotations, labels, or default values. A good example can be found with Bitnami's charts:

apiVersion: v2 appVersion: ""3.2.1"" dependencies: - condition: zookeeper.enabled name: zookeeper repository: ""https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami"" version: 10.x.x - name: common repository: ""https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami"" tags: - bitnami-common version: 2.x.x name: kafka version: 18.2.0





Use Annotations

Since Kubernetes only watches changes in the deployment spec, by default, changing the contents of a ConfigMap or a Secret that's mounted to a Pod does not automatically trigger a rolling update. This may be unexpected behavior for users expecting a restart with updated values when invoking an upgrade command.

To automatically roll deployments, you can use tools like Reloader or add a checksum annotation in the deployment spec:

kind: Deployment spec: template: metadata: annotations: checksum/config: {{ include (print $.Template.BasePath ""/config.yaml"") . | sha256sum }}





Annotations are also useful to define hooks for jobs that should run before or after an install or upgrade. Common use cases may include running a Flyway migration or running clean-up jobs. While this can be achieved with other CD tools, Helm hooks provide a native way to alter release lifecycle behavior:

apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: annotations: ""helm.sh/hook"": post-install ""helm.sh/hook-weight"": ""-5"" ""helm.sh/hook-delete-policy"": hook-succeeded





Limitations of Helm

While Helm comes with a suite of features to make packaging and releasing Kubernetes applications easier, it's important to note that Helm is simply a package manager — it is not a fully featured CD tool. In other words, organizations should not rely on Helm alone for an end-to-end Kubernetes CI/CD tool. Instead, Helm should integrate with more robust tools such as ArgoCD, JenkinsX, or Spinnaker to keep deployments consistent. Also, since Helm uses plaintext YAML as the primary templating interface, Secrets and non-YAML files are not handled very well. This means Secrets or configuration binaries (e.g., public keys, .dat files) can be better handled outside of Helm via another CI/CD tool.

Finally, while subcharts are useful for organizing related components together, deeply nested subcharts can cause templating issues. If the application truly requires multiple nested subcharts, look for other deployment patterns such as ArgoCD's ApplicationSet to group multiple Helm charts together instead.

Final Thoughts

Helm is a powerful tool that has stood the test of time. Compared to verbose, vanilla Kubernetes manifest files, Helm allows for advanced templating techniques to package Kubernetes applications into deployable units. In this guide, we went over the high-level Helm structure as well as some best practices to use Helm effectively. We then walked through some of the limitations of Helm — mainly the fact that it should not be used as a standalone CD tool.

Nonetheless, with a wide selection of public, production-ready Helm charts, it's easier than ever to download, modify, and install various Kubernetes components.",cloud computing,dzone.com

So when Courtney Bailey got served a three-day notice, she had already lined up a better place with more space for her kids and a lower rent.

But she was scared. She had no cash for the move-in fees — and was worried she was headed for another bout of homelessness.

Then the new landlord found a solution. She could get an interest-free loan to cover the fees and pay it back when she could, or not at all if she couldn’t.

It sounded like a joke, but it wasn’t. Her landlord connected her to the Short-Term Eviction Prevention Fund, a philanthropic enterprise created by a West Los Angeles software entrepreneur, Adam Miller, to test his theory that non-punitive micro loans could reduce homelessness.

Brandon Morris, 11 months, whose mother Courtney Bailey faced eviction when she received a $500 loan, at her four-bedroom, two-bath apartment in Los Angeles. (Gary Coronado/Los Angeles Times)

Miller created a $1-million fund to make interest-free loans to people facing imminent eviction. They will have three years to repay, and those who default will be forgiven.

After conducting a small pilot, the fund now aims to give out 1,000 loans of up to $2,500. Reflecting Miller’s background in cloud computing, the data gathered from applications and payment histories are transmitted directly to a poverty researcher at Notre Dame University who is evaluating the effectiveness of the loans.

Early results have been encouraging enough that Miller, who has put tens of millions of dollars into his philanthropic foundation, said he is open to expanding to 10,000 loans.

“If this could really help people from becoming homeless, that is much more cost effective than trying to remediate somebody who has become unhoused,” Miller said.

Miller, who built Cornerstone OnDemand into a global training and development company, created the 1P Foundation (short for One Planet) with his wife Staci to apply their business and research acumen to philanthropy.

“We wanted to do the hard things,” he said in an interview. “We focused on intractable problems.”

Miller sold Cornerstone in 2021 for $5.2 billion. While pursuing new business interests, he also devotes more of his time to 1P.org — an enterprise that includes the foundation and separate entities for research, advocacy and social impact investing — which Staci Miller heads as chief executive.

Most of its work to date has been focused nationally on gun safety, supporting research seeking common ground between gun owners and gun control advocates.

The micro-loan fund is his local initiative focused, naturally, on the intractable problem of Los Angeles — homelessness.

Housing & Homelessness His crusade to house L.A.’s poor praised by Oprah Winfrey, Garcetti. But others have doubts A developer working to preserve affordable rentals in South L.A. and build housing for homeless people has won praise from the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Mayor Eric Garcetti, who see his work as an important step in dealing with the city’s housing crisis. But the entrepreneur’s efforts are also facing criticism from tenant advocates. A look inside SoLa Impact.

After surveying the landscape of existing homeless initiatives, the Millers concluded that they could have the most impact by helping people to hang on to their housing.

The need couldn’t be clearer. Even as city and county outreach succeeded in moving tens of thousands of people from the streets into housing over the past five years, the number of people on the street continued to climb as new people lost housing.

Even so, city and county efforts to prevent homelessness have been limited. Less than 4% of the sales tax revenue from Measure H goes into prevention programs. A confounding question is whom to target: Hundreds of thousands of Angelenos live under extreme rent pressure but only a tiny percentage become homeless.

Various strategies are being tested as solutions. They range from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors pilot program to supplement poor people’s incomes to a UCLA research project analyzing data from county social services agencies to predict who are most likely lose their homes.

The Millers decided to focus their intervention narrowly on people who face imminent eviction because of a crisis but have the means to pay their rent going forward.

Initially, they put $1 million into a revolving loan fund and built a bare-bones staff to administer it. Staci Miller, who had a research background with entertainment companies and nonprofits, is the unpaid executive director.

Their one employee was Rickey Robinson, formerly an outreach worker with Venice-based Safe Place for Youth. In June of 2021, Robinson launched a pilot in South Los Angeles, letting homeless and housing agencies know that loans were available.

His first clients were four tenants referred by SoLa Impact, a South Los Angeles real estate investment and development company that owns about 200 buildings and is building thousands of units of affordable housing.

Among them, Bailey was pregnant and on leave without pay from a new job with the post office. Bailey received an eviction notice after her COVID rent relief payment came late. She had a new apartment lined up with SoLa. But she had no cash for the move-in fees, and the apartment was going to go to someone else.

Her $500 loan opened the door to what she calls “a forever home for me and my family.”

For Stacie Charles, a $2,500 loan this month paid the back rent on her apartment in South Los Angeles. A series of events — her car breaking down, a daughter graduating from high school, a granddaughter being born — piled onto the cost of inflation.

“Everything was just going crazy,” she said. “Groceries are high. Gas is high. The electrical bills. It’s just hard to keep up with all of this.”

Her landlord was understanding, but losing patience.

“I have been negotiating with her and trying to give her what I could,” Charles said.

Now that she’s caught up, her salary as a clerk is back in balance with her budget.

In all, about 43 loans have been made in the pilot.

The program is now open to all residents of Los Angeles County who meet three basic criteria: They must have income below 50% of the area median, have had a recent financial shock and be facing imminent eviction as a result.

Applications can be submitted on the STEP Fund website. If applications ever exceed the capacity of the fund, preference will be given to those who have income below 30% of the median, have been homeless in the past or were in the foster system.

Currently, though, no one who qualifies will be turned away, Staci Miller, said. Despite the evident need, the program has taken off slowly, partly as a result of eviction moratoriums and government relief during the pandemic.

“The complexity around the rental market and COVID has complicated things,” Miller said. “We’ve seen peaks and valleys as different things have changed. I do expect that toward the end of the year demand will increase.”

One of the main impediments is that applicants must show income exceeding monthly expenses, leaving many ineligible, Robinson said. Even though there is no penalty for those who default, the goal of the program is to recover the money so it can be lent again. Applicants who cannot possibly pay the money back are ineligible.

“The No. 1 reason is their net income is in the negative,” Robinson said. “We don’t want to put anyone in debt. That has been kind of the struggle.”

For those who do qualify, the repayment is flexible. No payments are required for 60 days and then the balance is spread over 36 months. But the software is designed to accept any payment.

“If someone pays $20, we are happy to take the $20 because the intention of getting into that habit of repayment is important,” Staci Miller said.

Starting out, the Millers planned on a repayment rate of about 70%, far below that of a conventional loan program.

In practice, it has not turned out that high, but Staci Miller said she does not consider the percentage so far to be representative because the rate has been improving as they learn from experience.

The Millers said they hope their experiment will help government and large nonprofits design prevention programs, but they’ll wait for the results of the Notre Dame study to make recommendations. Rob Collinson, assistant professor in Notre Dame’s Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities said he will need a sample size of about 500 loans to draw more far-reaching conclusions.

“The results could show that these small loans are effective at keeping people from losing their housing, but it could show that the repayment rate is so low these don’t make sense as loans,” Staci Miller said. “They may make sense as grants.”",cloud computing,los angeles times

IoT Analytics has predicted that by 2025, the world will have well over 27 billion devices connected together!

But while this comes with lots of advantages to the regular internet user and business owner leveraging the digital space, it also comes with increased security concerns such as cyberattacks and software vulnerabilities.

These security issues impact people in healthcare, logistics, finance, retail, manufacturing, and other industries adopting IoT systems.

What are IoT and IoT Security?

IoT is an acronym for the Internet of Things, and it simply indicates a network of smart devices that are connected to share data online without human intervention. IoT architecture often comprises cloud databases for communication, wireless networks, data processing programs, sensors, and smart devices that communicate closely together.

Some key components that aid data processing and exchange among IoT devices include:

IoT hubs, gateways, and other edge devices move and direct data between the cloud and IoT devices.

Smart devices that pull data, store it and share data related to the environment and other components and devices.

On-premises and Cloud data centers have remote servers that transfer data from different ends using wireless connections.

Embedded systems used by smart devices can include communication hardware, sensors, and processors, focusing on curating data, transferring it, and acting on curated data.

IoT technologies are not restricted to a specific industry. They can be used within a wide array of industries, including healthcare, energy, agriculture, logistics, and several others. Smart devices also differ, depending on the specific IoT system’s goal. They could range from DNA analysis to simple sensor hardware. However, some of the most popular ones are:

Healthcare systems. Medical IoT(MIT) makes opportunities available for patients to be monitored by healthcare professionals and even the patients themselves. Some IoT smart devices are wirelessly connected fitness bands, glucometers, and blood pressure and heart rate monitoring cuffs.

Home automation systems control and monitor home features and attributes such as appliances, lighting, alarm, and entertainment systems. Common home automation smart devices are light bulbs, assistant speakers, refrigerators, thermostats, and plugs.

Smart warehouses use interconnected and automated technologies to enhance organizations’ efficiency and productivity. Some everyday things in a smart warehouse include drones, radio frequency identification (RFID) scanners, robots, complex warehouse management software, and artificial intelligence-driven programs.

Wearables commonly deployed by healthcare and sports. This includes blood pressure monitors, smart watches, electrocardiograms, and fitness trackers.

Smart cities. It uses curated data from smart devices to enhance public utilities, infrastructure, and services. Some examples of these devices include lights, connected sensors, waste bins, air quality monitoring systems, and meters.

Connected cars. It means vehicles that are fitted with internet access can transfer data and share access with the car at a point in time. With this technology, people can remotely connect with their vehicles and leverage mobile apps to use their functionality to pay tolls and improve their security.

Top IoT Security Challenges

To understand how to secure applications against IoT threats, it is essential to check out some core risks. Here are the top IoT Security challenges to know about:

1. Unprotected Communications

Many widely used security mechanisms were initially not designed for IoT devices. Instead, they were created for desktop computers and have proven exceptionally hard to implement with resource-constrained IoT devices. This is a cause for weaknesses surfacing in securing communication between IoT devices.

2. Possibility of a Data Leak from IoT Systems

Hackers have been able to hijack means like capturing unencrypted messages from your IoT system. This weakness can leak highly sensitive data records such as your bank account details, location, and even health records.

3. Firmware and Software Vulnerabilities

Several smart devices are resource-constrained and are limited in their computing capabilities. This makes them less efficient in running powerful and resource-driven security functions, which could make them more vulnerable than non-IoT devices.

4. Malware Risks

Zscaler revealed in a recent report that devices that are very likely to get hacked by a malicious attack are smartwatches, smart TVs, and set-top boxes. Once hackers can successfully inject malware into IoT systems, they will have the leeway to perpetrate other forms of attacks. For example, they may collect sensitive data from it, change how the devices function and carry out different attacks on the devices.

How To Secure Applications Against IoT Threats?

1. Deploy Encryption and Secure Communication

Using a VPN with static IP will help secure data transfer and communication between devices. It will also help to attain strong authentication and unique default credentials. When addressing your product’s latest and updated protocols to ensure their functionality.

You should also consider using multi-factor authentication. Enable encryption and secure communication protocols.

2. Disconnect IoT Devices When Not In Use

Many devices today can connect to the internet, even refrigerators and televisions; hence, it is essential to be aware of the functionality you need on them. Check them properly and ensure you understand when to connect to the internet and when to disconnect, especially when not in use.

Use firmware to protect your device and update it often to enjoy the latest security patches and minimize the possibility of an attack. However, since hackers are constantly devising new ways to commit cybercrime, IoT device users cannot afford to be lenient with software security updates.

4. Avoid Using Simple Passwords

If you still use simple passwords such as ‘123456’, ‘7654321’, and the like in this age, you need to rethink your approach before it becomes too late. Strong and secure passwords are the best options for securing IoT devices. They should contain letters, numbers, and even special characters. While this form of password strategy may give you a hard time remembering, you should consider using password managers to support the use.

5. Change Default Router Settings

Many people do not change their router’s name and security codes after purchasing it. Since default router settings are put there by the manufacturers, they could hamper the security of your private Wi-Fi networks. Ensure to enhance your IoT device security by changing your router’s default privacy and security settings.",cloud computing,thefutureofthings.com
251,Meet IIM Bangalore’s EPGP Class Of 2023,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/maJFL8t.he_.C67_UTjuug--~B/aD02NDA7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/poets_quants_171/bca879295ada70904aeda1e5df427c20,22/10/2022,"It has become a cliché to call Bangalore the “Silicon Valley of India” – or even Asia.

Still, it is impossible to deny similarities.

India’s startup and tech hub, Bangalore – or Bengaluru – boasts a $110 billion dollar GDP, matching the economic output of Morocco as a whole. The region gobbled up nearly 60% of India’s startup funding from 2020-2020, with over a third of India’s IT professionals calling it home. From 2019-2021, the city attracted $17 billion in startup funding – and Karnataka raked in $29 billion as a whole. Bangalore has also produced 39 unicorns. That number may be overshadowed by the 220 unicorns grown in the Bay Area-Silicon Valley corridor. However, Bangalore is expected to sprout another 46 unicorns in just the next 2-4 years according to the Hurun Research Institute. That includes Polygon, which had already scarfed up $450 million in funding during the first quarter alone!

Main walkway at IIM Bangalore

A CORPORATE MAGNET

Yes, Bangalore is the place to be. Indian Biotech firms? Bangalore houses half of them. Company headquarters? Try Infosys, Wipro, and Flipkart to start. Country headquarters? Here are just a few firms who operate out of Bangalore: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Dell, IBM, Goldman Sachs, Accenture, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, Oracle, KPMG – well, you get the gist. And that doesn’t count R&D centers for companies like Samsung, Cisco, Boeing, Walmart, Adobe, and General Electric. Thanks to deep investment from investors and government alike, Bangalore is a global force in industries ranging from aerospace and telecom to artificial intelligence and cloud computing.

Sprawling industrial parks and congested traffic, shopping on Brigade Road and dining along St. St. Mark’s Road – a place that’s home to over 100 languages and nearly 13,000 millionaires: That’s Bangalore. And did I mention the free wifi?

Get rich, get ahead, or get experience. Jobs, Expertise, Opportunity, Connections. You can have it all in Bangalore. Despite being the 5th-largest metro in India, Bangalore has nearly 900 higher education institutions – more than any other city. That includes over 100 engineering colleges and nearly 100 institutions offering graduate business education courses. For the latter, the best-known and most-prestigious of the bunch is the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore. Ranked as the #2 graduate business program in India by The Financial Times, IIM Bangalore differentiates itself through scale and distinction. That includes a stellar faculty featuring over 150 experts, researchers, and practitioners, not to mention a wealth of electives. Overall, the school counts 1,200 students among its various graduate business programs, enabling MBAs to tap into a wide network of high potentials. When it comes to the one-year EPGP (Executive Post-Graduate Program) program, the return on investment is high. Within three years of graduation, EPGP grads are earning more than American counterparts from Cornell and Duke – with a 67% jump between pre-EPGP and post-graduation pay. All this comes with a deep immersion into inner workings of the larger Bangalore community.

ACCESS TO IT ALL

Lokender Singh Rathore has re-located to Bangalore after 10 years in the Indian Navy, where he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Before that, he worked as a management consultant for Deloitte. For him, the school’s resources, coupled with its location, provide the perfect preparation for his long-term plans to move into operations and program management.

“IIM Bangalore is situated in the Silicon Valley of India and has produced most of the unicorn firms in India,” he tells P&Q. “NSRCEL, a start-up incubation cell at IIM Bangalore, provides numerous opportunities to experience the “hustle” culture and learn from one of the best entrepreneurs of the country. In today’s world where digital infrastructure is rapidly evolving, it is extremely important for all organizations to inculcate innovation and start up mentality to sustain growth and profitability, which is often called as intrapreneurship. Hence, it is imperative for all MBA graduates to build entrepreneurship skills. And there is no better place than IIM Bangalore for that in India.”

Taking Rathore’s point a step further, Akriti Ghai boils the IIM Bangalore EPGP difference down to one word: access. “It was the prospect for interactions with industry leaders, entrepreneurs, innovators through IIM B Business Conclave, EPGP Seminar and Alum Series, PGP social clubs, and Vista events,” she notes. “These gave me confidence that IIM Bangalore is the ideal place for a holistic education and industry engagement. This paves a great way to learn and lead by staying abreast of the latest business challenges, corporate opportunities, and networking events, which put together will aid me in developing a business mindset for my future endeavors.”

Classroom Arena alongside the walls

MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE TOP FIRMS

Ghai herself hails from Ernst & Young. And you’ll find plenty of students who’ve worked for top employers in the EPGP Class of 2023. Case in point: Abhishek Pandey. Before business school, he led a product development team responsible for Honda’s first BS6 compliant scooter. He was so respected at Honda that he represented the firm as its youngest technical lead ever at the International Auto Expo in 2016. By the same token, Bibin Kumar trained over 20,000 undergraduates over two years at Infosys – earning the company’s highest feedback scores in the process.

His secret? “I had to wake up every morning, wear the mask of a brave soul, and be there for my students when they needed me,” Kumar explains. “I saw happiness, I laughed with my students. I saw success. I celebrated with my students. I saw failures – failures that led to some students getting expelled from the training program. They would be jobless, and I had been there, so I wept with them, helplessly…But overall, my time as a trainer helped me [to] build empathy and become a better person.”

The EPGP Class of 2023 has distinguished itself in many other ways. A year after joining Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), Sipra Priyadarshinee became the company’s first female employee – and youngest engineer – to complete “a large-scale critical capacity enhance project…incident free.” Vishwa Prakash Shukla found his footing in edtech as a confounder, winning the Maharashtra Government’s ‘Maharashtra Startup Week in 2018. When Mamta Kumari joined the Steel Authority of India’s Bokaro Steel Plant, she created the Buddy Project to help them move out of administrative roles and onto the shop floor where they had a chance to earn more and climb higher.

“Under this project, each junior was mapped with a senior so that they get their issues addressed,” she tells P&Q. “This also gave the young women confidence and moral boost to not only stay but also thrive in their jobs. Over the years, I saw the women working on shop floor increase in number.”

A RICHES-TO-RAGS STORY

Sometimes, their efforts were outright heroic. As an operations officer, Gautam Sharad protected the lives of his shipmates and other vessels when he managed an emergency aboard a tanker. Lokender Singh Rathore did the same by coordinating efforts to keep a fire from spreading aboard an aircraft carrier. Of course, some actions were simply gutsy. Exhibit A: Harshad P. Bhoir. He left it all behind – a strategy leadership role working in the CEO’s office with all the authority and perks surrounding it – to come to business school.

“I call this an accomplishment because it wasn’t easy to leave behind a life, that I had built over 6 years,” Bhoir writes. “The change was drastic, but equally necessary. I went from driving a 3.5V6 to a 1.5V4, from my office cabin to being the classroom desk and from board rooms to break-out room. There have been some serious downshifts. Yet, none of what I have learnt at IIMB in the last 6 months would have been possible unless I had given these things.”

What has Bhoir learned? For one, he was exposed to the intricacies of entrepreneurship. Last spring, he launched a dog food startup leveraging his experience cooking for his pet. Thus far, his subscription service has generated 8 customers – all of whom have continued to use his product. Bhoir isn’t alone in speeding up his career momentum in the IIMB EPGP. Lokender Singh Rathore was part of a team that won first place in the Bharat Quiz – a business-themed quiz show sponsored by IIMB that attracted 300 teams. His classmate, Akriti Ghai, won 1st place team in Business Case Challenge, which was part of IIMB’s fall Business Conclave. On top of that, he has been gaining critical work experience by partnering with the Tata Group on a marketing project.

“This involves the growth of its novel business unit for Indian wear ‘Taneira’. Project scope mandates developing business strategy for the brand that leverages its complete potential, identifying right target segment and developing right brand positioning statement.”

WORLD-CLASS TEACHING

Still, some school achievements are difficult to quantify – or even explain. Just ask Janet Mary. Her biggest takeaway from the EPGP program comes down to confidence. “[I’ve been] overcoming my own perception that I am not capable of certain things,” she observes. “This program at IIMB has, more than anything else, instilled deep self-belief and I feel more equipped than ever to deal with any challenge! Being the batch representative of EPGP only further drove this change!”

Then again, with a half year left in the program, Vishwa Prakash Shukla believes his best is yet to come. That said, he has already reaped several benefits from the program. “The MBA program promotes structured thought process. I learned how to prioritize and manage my time. My networking skills have improved, and I am now able to connect with enterprises and startups more frequently on weekends.”

For many, IIM Bangalore’s biggest strength is its faculty’s teaching and research prowess. And you won’t find many class members who dispute this notion. For many students, class sessions rank among the highlights of the program thus far. One of the most popular courses thus far has been Professor Rejie George Pallathitta’s Competition and Strategy course. Notably, Lokender Singh Rathore appreciates how Pallathitta has made the course frameworks so relevant and easy-to-understand. The biggest lesson from the course?

“Peter Drucker had said, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast”,” Rathore writes. “After undergoing the Competition and Strategy course, I have learnt that a well formulated strategy is that package of a meal without which cultural changes will die out of starvation.”

EPGP Class of 2023

HANGING AT HIGH TIDE

Macroeconomics was another popular choice by the Class of 2023. Abhishek Pandey lauds how Professor Chetan Subramanian’s energy and engaging content motivated him to get up in the morning. Sipra Priyadarshinee shares Pandey’s sentiments. “The way Prof Subramanium taught the subject was just wow,” she writes. “It was like listening to a mesmerizing story. Now when I see a news on economics, I can actually understand it!”

Ann George, a transport planner who dabbles in teaching Zumba, gave her vote to Brand Management, which is taught by Professor YLR Moorthi. Her big takeaway? “If a person isn’t able to convey an idea in a simple and crisp manner, he or she is clearly bluffing.”

That’s not to say that IIM Bangalore is all classes, projects, and networking. For the Class of 2023, the big hangout is a place called High Tide. George describes it as a place that personifies the program’s “Work Hard, Play Hard’ culture. On one hand, it is a place, it is a place where student teams gather over food to complete a report. At other times, George notes, “We always hit this pub after our exams and party our guts out.”

Of course, the best gathering spots aren’t always bars or clubs. Mamta Kumari predicts that when her class is quizzed on their favorite spot at their 10-year reunion, they will respond ‘D802.’ “It is the apartment where three of our classmates live, the walls of which know all our secrets outside the classroom activities,” Kumari explains. “This is where we went from being strangers to becoming friends. Parties, afterparties, live sports, and case competitions – there’s never a reason not to gather here. I am sure that come the end of our program, this is where we’ll bid our goodbyes. D802 is special.”

Famous L Square

SECRET TO BUSINESS SCHOOL HAPPINESS? GET A DOG

Similarly, Harshad P. Bhoir believes his home will come up as a favorite spot – and not just because he can cook and his wife can host. “Having a golden retriever at home is like having a magnet with de-stressing abilities. MBAs, especially when packed into a year, aren’t easy on you. Having a dog is probably the best way of getting rid of all the stress.”

It wasn’t the stress that brought the Class of 2023 to IIM Bangalore’s EPGP program. Instead, it was a sense that something was missing – or the possibilities were too great to ignore. After a decade in manufacturing, Mamta Kumari recognized her skills in finance, technology, and project management weren’t enough to take her to the next level. At the same time, Bibin Kumar returned to campus to supplement his experience with classroom learning. For him, business school has been like returning to the past. Only yhis time, Kumar says, he is looking at his career using an entirely different lens.

“Six months in, I keep connecting my learnings back to my less successful and failed experiments,” he admits. “[This time], I seem to have answers to how I would have tackled those situations differently.”

Classroom Arena

Candid discussion among students

A Q&A WITH THE CHAIRPERSON

This month, P&Q reached out to Dr. Ashok Thampy, the Chairperson of the EPGP program and a Professor of Finance & Accounting. Among the topics, Dr. Thampy addressed new developments at IIM Bangalore, along with the expansion of its STEM and digital capabilities and the school’s relationship with the larger Bangalore ecosystem.

P&Q: What are the two most exciting recent developments at IIM Bangalore and how will they enrich the MBA experience for current and future MBAs?

Thampy: “IIMB has blended the asynchronous courses designed for its highly successful MOOCs platform with synchronous learning on digital platforms to offer integrated digital learning experiences to supplement classroom learning. Some of the business issues which have got increased attention are those related to supply chain management, contingency planning, employee health and safety, and business continuity management.

IIMB has a lot of new courses coming in. For example, we do have a course on gamification. We, of course, have courses which are covering Meta Verse and Web 3.0. So those are, of course, currently electives. Elements of Industry 4.0 (automation; Internet of Things; 3-D printing; data warehousing and analytics, etc.) are becoming an integral part of contemporary manufacturing. Contemporary services businesses are dependent on technology and advanced data analytics. The core principles of marketing, finance or operations management are likely to remain the same, but a successful manager will need to integrate a good understanding of technology and data with the traditional functional skills.”

Main Block

P&Q: What are two most differentiating features of your MBA program? How do each of these enrich the learning of your MBA students?

Thampy: “The one-year full-time Executive Post Graduate Programme (EPGP) is an intensive residential program which is designed for professionals with an excellent career record and with experiences across varied industries.

The diversity of the cohort is significant. The current batch has Chartered Accountants, Fashion Designers, Army Veterans, a Commandant from CRPF, Sailors from Merchant Navy, Aeronautical Engineers, Bankers, Engineers from Oil & Gas, Sales Leaders, Engineers from the IT industry, to name a few. Such diversity make the learning experience unique.”

P&Q: In recent years, there have been several areas that have gained increased prominence in business school programming, including STEM, analytics, artificial intelligence, and digital disruption. How does your full-time MBA program integrate these concepts across its curriculum?

Thampy: “We leverage the advantage of being in Silicon Valley of the country. Our close connect with industry is a huge advantage. IIMB has 10 Centres of Excellence and several initiatives such as the Behavioral Science Lab, which provides a controlled environment for data collection for behavioural research. The Data Analytics Lab – DCAL – is a dedicated research and training lab to support interdisciplinary empirical research using data on India and other emerging markets. The Centre for Software and Information Technology Management (CSITM) fosters close links with the IT sector in India and abroad in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Digital Transformation, Product Management, Digital Governance & Policy, Healthcare Technology, IT Outsourcing, Cloud Computing, Agile Development, Digital Platforms, Digital Payments, and Emerging Technologies (Blockchain, Extended Reality, IoT, RPA, etc.). These subjects are offered as electives.

Our students participate in and win at global and national technology case study competitions which is clear evidence that we apply what we learn in the classroom.”

IIM Bangalore Library

P&Q: If you were giving a campus tour, what is the first place you’d take an MBA applicant? Why is that so important to the MBA experience?

Thampy: “The campus of IIM Bangalore features among the ‘25 Most Significant Works of Post-War Architecture’, in The New York Times Style Magazine in 2021. The architect of the iconic and award-winning campus is Pritzker Laureate Dr. Balkrishna Doshi, Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Fellow of the Indian Institute of Architects. The campus, with its structures and spaces, continues to inspire learning and discovery. It integrates buildings with the fundamentals of nature and climate. It offers a living, breathing space ideal for a place of learning and supports students’ academic and social needs. That is also something that attracts students from all over the world. Truly, our 100-acre campus is our pride and joy. It is also home to rare species of flora and fauna, and in a city like Bangalore, it is an oasis of tranquility.

Inside this amazing campus lies our favourite spot – the library. An amazingly vibrant space stocked with unparalleled resources on management subjects, including fantastic online repositories, the IIMB library is every student and researcher’s dream come true.”

P&Q: Bengaluru is known as a “Silicon Valley of Asia” – along with being one of the fast-growing cities in India. How does IIM Bangalore leverage its Bengaluru location to provide school projects, employer partnerships, and job opportunities for students?

Thampy: “Yes, definitely location has been a big advantage for us. We have a comprehensive project embedded into our core of our EPGP courses. So various companies approach us with problem statements, where our students, mentored by faculty, work with these companies and analyse their challenges and come up with probable solutions. Also, we have seminars and leadership talks almost every week, where eminent personalities and industry experts come and interact with our students. As Bangalore is the startup capital of the country, many cofounders have come and shared the journey with our students. We also have the NS Raghavan Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning (NSRCEL), our incubator, which provides the platform that helps entrepreneurs access resources and mentors, and innovate the future of India. In fact, many of our students work in those startups in various roles, on a part time basis, to learn from them.

Campus Blossoms

P&Q: In the 2022 Financial Times ranking, IIM Bangalore earned one of the 15 highest scores for being recommended by alumni. What is behind this high level of alumni satisfaction? How does the school bring students and alumni together and tap into alumni to provide greater mentoring and opportunities for MBA students?

Thampy: “IIMB prides itself on its alumni engagement. We have a dedicated office for Alumni Relations. We have a Dean overseeing Alumni Engagement. The Director of IIMB meets the alumni regularly. We have alumni representation on the Board. Our alumni are involved in the school’s activities from interviews to placement; from delivering guest lectures to leading workshops in their areas of expertise; from being part of juries for case competitions to addressing open house sessions during admissions.

We have an Alumni Committee that connects the current batch to the alumni. Every student in the cohort is assigned an alumni mentor. We have AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions over weekends where alumni from sectors such as Corporate Finance, Product Management, Technology Consulting, Management Consulting, etc. interact with students.

The EPGP curriculum includes a Comprehensive Project, which examines a contemporary live issue or topic pertaining to either a specific company or an industry.

P&Q: IIM Bangalore is one of the most prestigious and selective MBA programs in India. What are two ways that applicants can set themselves apart and increase their odds of receiving deeper consideration for admission?

Thampy: “It isn’t about high GMAT scores alone! Diversity is prized so is experience and domain expertise. Having clear career goals for which the EPGP is a stepping stone does help. The programme emphasizes peer learning not just from the cohort of 75 fellow students but from the PGP cohort as well.”

P&Q: What are some aspects of IIM Bangalore’s programmes and culture that make it appealing to women? International students?

Thampy: “IIMB is an equal opportunity campus. IIMB has a significant number of women on the Board, women in the faculty body, women students and staff. There are women in leadership roles across the school. There is a Women in Management club; there are Women in Leadership seminars and workshops; there are programs like Tanmatra that nurture women in business and leadership. NSRCEL has long-running and hugely popular Women Entrepreneurship programs for women who start up and scale up.

IIMB provides a wholessome classroom experience. Live projects, placements, internships have never been biased on the basis of gender. Companies which come for recruitments hire students for their skills, knowledge and capabilities.

For EPGP students, IIMB provides family housing. Many women in the EPGP cohort have young children and there is plenty of support including round-the-clock healthcare for all, and crèche, sports coaching and summer camps for children on campus. Festivals are celebrated with enthusiasm on campus.

IIMB is EQUIS accredited. It is also among the top ranked B-schools in the world, featuring in the Top 50 of FT and QS global rankings. There is an Office of International Affairs at IIMB which handles Student Exchange Programmes. IIMB has exchange partnerships with over 70 schools, globally. Large cohorts of students from B-schools across the world spend a term at IIMB and apart from the classroom learning, they enjoy educational/field visits, food tours and cultural exchange programs. They find the city of Bangalore appealing and the IIMB campus, welcoming and nurturing.”

5 REASONS TO CONSIDER IIM BANGALORE

1) World Class Faculty: “I am being taught by industry experts and advisors, authors of the books that are referred by several other business schools around the globe, economists who are in the discussion panels alongside cabinet ministers on the news every day, and ex-faculty member or alumnus of Harvard, MIT Sloan, Kellogg, NYU, Cornell, Warrington, University of Texas, Yale, Michigan, ISB and other IIMs. The faculty profile of IIM-Bangalore is one of the richest in the world. This itself is the biggest reassurance to MBA aspirants seeking the best learning in their sprint at IIM Bangalore.

Even if someone is not taught by most of the faculty, all professors are extremely welcoming for talks, discussions, guidance, and projects.”

Abhishek Pandey (’23)

2) S Raghavan Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning (NSRCEL): “I get to meet and interact with some of the highly passionate entrepreneurs from the startup capital of the country here. As an aspiring entrepreneur who’s never shy of ideas but always worried about opportunity cost, the stories – of both successes and failures – that I keep hearing from the folks who are turning their ideas into reality are instilling some much-needed confidence in me. Moreover, I get to have a first-hand experience of product development in an entrepreneurial environment, build a great network, and be close to work while at school.”

Bibin Kumar (’23)

3) Location: “[It was the] quality of connections with the Industry. Bangalore, being a technology and start-up hub, offers more in terms of learning for those who have a keen eye for it. It was important in the sense that it gave exposure to the kind of business problems companies were already trying to dabble with.”

Akshay V Bharadwaj (’23)

4) Flexibility: “One of the best and least spoken of part of the elective terms is that you get to decide your own calendar for the last 2 terms depending on your elective choices. This way you are in complete control of your time to be invested in beyond the classroom learning, readings, application and research”

Harshad P. Bhoir (’23)

5) Electives: “The number of options that IIM Bangalore offers in terms of the electives is unmatched by any other institute. Moreover, the faculty conducting these electives are or have been industry experts, so it’s not just the academic flavor that you derive out of the hours spent learning these programs.”

Harshad P. Bhoir (’23)

ADVICE TO PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS

“Plan, Do, Check and Act: The famous PDCA cycle works wonders in personal life too.

“Plan” your career well in advance and that doesn’t mean knowing exactly what you want to do but to know WHY you really want to pursue an MBA from IIM Bangalore. Once that is complete, start “Doing” your preparation and work hard on the application – especially the SOP and Resume. “Check” every single line of your resume and SOP and act on the mistakes with complete honesty. The more real you are, the more confident you will be in your applications and interviews, increasing your chances of a selection conversion.”

Abhishek Pandey (’23)

“It is important to understand that you didn’t get in because you were better than the other applicants but because you were different from them. Being different means the unique ‘YOU’, and only together with the others did you make the class a more complete experience. It might so happen that when you land here, you see a lot of different and amazing individuals. Again, don’t forget you are one of them. With that said, it is extremely important you build new things around who you already are because your core is probably the strongest of your suits. MBA isn’t about reinventing the wheel, but about improving what you already have.”

</li><li>GC Strategies testifies about $9M ArriveCan contract  National Post
</li><li>The real pr…",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-arrivecan-contract-inaccurate-information-parliament/,"The Canada Border Services Agency has acknowledged it provided inaccurate information to Parliament about a $1.2-million ArriveCan contract and is launching a full review of its list of companies that received federal funding to work on the app.

The Globe and Mail reported Thursday that ThinkOn CEO Craig McLellan had written to the CBSA earlier in the week to express concern as to why his company was included in a list of 23 companies the agency told Parliament had worked on the ArriveCan app.

The CBSA’s reference to ThinkOn included specific information, such as a contract value of $1,183,432, a time window of between Jan. 21, 2020 and March 31, 2022 and a description of work that said ThinkOn provided “experimentation of mobile QR code scanning and verification.” The value was sixth-largest on the list of 23 companies.

Mr. McLellan said he learned of his company’s inclusion on the list after it was reported in The Globe. He said his company provides cloud computing services and does not work in the QR code field.

For two days, opposition MPs asked the government to explain why a company was listed as being awarded $1.2-million for ArriveCan, yet had not received a penny. Liberal MPs responded on Thursday and Friday that the CBSA was looking into the matter.

Late Friday evening, CBSA spokesperson Sandra Boudreau provided a short statement to The Globe.

“When asked to report on all the contracts for ArriveCan, we included ThinkOn in error. We did not have a contract with ThinkOn Inc. and no payment has been made to the company,” she wrote.

When asked how this error occurred, the agency replied: “It was human error. We listed the wrong company name next to the contract information in the report.”

The CBSA did not immediately respond to further questions from The Globe, including a request to identify the company that should have been listed as having been awarded $1.2-million.

However the agency provided a new statement to The Globe on Saturday.

“Given the error, we are doing a full review of the list reported and will be in a position to share with your readers the company name in the coming days,” Ms. Boudreau wrote.

The Globe reported earlier last week that a spokesperson for Ernst & Young – ranked 17th on the list of companies that worked on the app – said the government’s reference to the company receiving $120,000 in ArriveCan work “appears to be an error.”

“EY was not involved with the ArriveCan app,” Victoria McQueen said on Thursday.

However, Ms. McQueen revised that statement in an e-mail sent Friday evening, saying that while Ernst & Young was not directly contracted by CBSA to perform work on the ArriveCan app, it did provide “contracted resources” to the project owing to the nature of another existing contract the firm has with the CBSA.

The CBSA’s statement also clarified another issue with the list. The report to Parliament says a company called “Maplesoft” was awarded $626,000. MapleSoft CEO Laurent Bernardin told The Globe that his software company did not work on the app, but said that his company is sometimes mistaken for another company called Maplesoft Group, a professional services company in Ottawa.

The CBSA confirmed that ArriveCan work was conducted by Maplesoft Group, not Maplesoft.

The Commons committee on government operations began a study Thursday into the government’s management of the ArriveCan app, which the CBSA said began as an $80,000 expense and is now on pace to cost $54-million by the end of this fiscal year.

The committee has approved a motion calling on government departments to provide MPs with detailed documentation – including contracts and invoices – related to the ArriveCan app by the end of the month.

The app was initially created as a way for travellers to upload mandatory health information related to COVID-19 but has since been expanded to allow users to answer customs and immigration questions. As of Sept. 30, it is no longer mandatory but it continues as a voluntary option.

Reached for comment on Saturday, Mr. McLellan, the ThinkOn CEO, said he had not yet received a response to his Wednesday e-mail to the CBSA raising concerns about the ArriveCan list. However, on Sunday, he said he had received an apology that day from the CBSA.",cloud computing,the globe and mail

ASHEVILLE, N.C., Oct. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Netmaker, a cloud networking startup, announced $2.3 million in funding to launch their ""superhighway for secure cloud networks."" The round was led by Lytical Ventures, Uncorrelated Ventures, and SaxeCap among others, following their graduation from Y-Combinator. Netmaker offers a platform built on WireGuard which transforms the way companies integrate their networks to make them safe, dynamic and up to 15 times faster than alternatives.

Netmaker Logo

In addition to the funding, Netmaker is announcing the 1.0 release of their community product, and an Enterprise Edition, which offers HA networking, metrics and access controls for users.

Modern applications are significantly more complex than they appear. While individuals see a website or smartphone app, in the background, a vast ecosystem of infrastructure and applications must be connected together to make this software work. Today, those connections are created by operations teams who must follow a process which is expensive, time-consuming, and painstaking. That's where Netmaker comes in.

""We created Netmaker because we had to. We saw this gap between what we're capable of doing with cloud computing, and what networking allowed us to do. We realized that there was nothing on the market that could solve this problem, so we had to build it ourselves,"" said CEO Alex Feiszli.

Netmaker allows applications to access each other directly and securely, without going through a central gateway. It does this with peer-to-peer virtual networks, automated over a client-server model. The server manages the keys, addresses, and discovery of peers, and sends this information to clients, which enables advanced routing operations to move traffic into, out of, and throughout the network.

Recent trends in hybrid cloud, edge computing, and IoT have made this pattern a necessity.

""Netmaker makes it simple to abstract away the physical network, allowing IT departments to create logical networks in minutes. Now, putting IoT devices with 5G onto the same flat network with a control environment can be done in minutes instead of days or weeks. I believe it's a tool that will be in every IT department's kit in the coming year."" said Lucas Nelson, Partner at Lytical Ventures.

Feiszli and Carns previously worked together building cloud software and led a team of multi-cloud platform engineers at IBM. During the pandemic, the duo moved to Asheville, NC. Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the town is known more for its craft breweries than its tech startup scene, but Feiszli and Carns have big plans to bring the cloud to the 'Land of the Sky'.

Netmaker was released on GitHub in March of 2021, and the adoption was swift. There are now over 1,200 organizations and individuals running the platform. This traction brought Netmaker to the attention of Y-Combinator, which further accelerated the company's popularity. Growth in active platforms since the start of 2022 has averaged 32% MoM.

About Netmaker

Based on the groundbreaking WireGuard protocol, Netmaker is the fastest and most configurable mesh VPN on the market, allowing companies to build distributed, dynamic, and secure networks instantly. Netmaker's use cases span remote access, multi-cloud, hybrid-cloud, edge computing, IoT, and Kubernetes. Founded in 2021 and based in Asheville, North Carolina, Netmaker is led by co-founders and IBM alums Alex Feiszli (CEO) and Dillon Carns (CTO).

Even with stocks' latest rebound, the index has dropped 21% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest decline since 2008.Resilient corporate profits have been one bright spot this year, though doubts are growing over how sustainable they will be. With the bulk of S&P 500 companies still to report, third-quarter profits are estimated to have climbed 3.1% versus the year-ago period, which would be the weakest performance in two years, according to Refinitiv IBES, while earnings growth expectations for 2023 have fallen to 7.2% from 7.8% on Oct 1.Next week's reports from the four megacaps may show whether companies with dominant positions can post solid performance despite worries of a potential economic downturn.Because of their heavy weightings, ""if those stocks don't get it done, that puts pressure on the indices to continue to go down,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services.Microsoft and Alphabet are due to report on Tuesday, with Amazon and Apple set for Thursday.Apple shares are the only ones of the megacaps that have outperformed the broader market this year.

Check here to see why still it's a buy-and-forget stock.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4548319-google-buy-forget-stock-at-95,"patpitchaya/iStock via Getty Images

The investment thesis

I have been a long-time bull on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). And the thesis is really straightforward the way I see it - at least for long-term investors. There is no need to deny the short-term headwinds as many other SA articles have explored in depth. However, if you are willing to look beyond these near-term issues, GOOG offers broad appeal for accounts with 3~5 years horizon. The stock combines the highest rank of financial strength, excellent growth prospects, and a very compressed valuation. And I will detail all these aspects in the remainder of this article.

All told, I see it holding above-average capital appreciation potential for the next 3 to 5 years (i.e., 2025-2027). To wit, the chart below (to be detailed in the next section) shows our projected annual return for GOOG and the overall market represented by the S&P 500 index. As seen, GOOG is projected to provide about 10.5% annual return (""ROI"") at its current price of around $101. It is already more than 3% above the overall market at its current valuation of around 19.5x PE. And given the market volatilities, I think investors have a good chance of grabbing some shares around $95. And you will see later that at such a price, its PE would be only 18.1x adjusted for its cash position, leading to an 11% annual return potential.

With such a wide margin of safety and lead above the overall market, it is truly a buy-and-forget stock. All we need is just to give it some time for the market volatility to run its course and for GOOG's initiatives like its Cloud and ecosystem to grow.

Our roadmap

First, a bit of background on the roadmap. We use it in all our investment decisions and in our market service to help us and our members focused on the long-term like business owners, not stock traders. As detailed in our earlier article:

The long-term ROI for a business owner is simply determined by two things: A) the price paid to buy the business and B) the quality of the business. More specifically, part A is determined by the owner's earning yield (""OEY"") when we purchased the business. And that is why PE is the first dimension in our roadmap. Part B is determined by the quality of the business and that is why ROCE, the most important metric for profitability, is the second dimension in our roadmap.

Now, the long-term growth rate is governed by ROCE and the Reinvestment Rate. These are the two most important growth engines, and they mutually enhance each other. High ROCE means every $1 reinvested can lead to a higher growth rate, which leads to more future profits and more flexible capital allocation to fuel further growth, and so on. So to summarize:

Longer-Term ROI = valuation + quality = OEY + Growth Rate = OEY + ROCE*Reinvestment Rate

How did our roadmap perform?

Using our UTMA account as an example, our current holdings are listed in the chart below. And their place on our roadmap is highlighted in blue in the chart above. Note that for some holdings (like HPQ and MU, the PE is so compressed that they are off this chart).

For performance tracing purposes, I used the prices on July 11, 2022 (the date I first published this portfolio) on SA as the entry price to make it easier for readers to track its performance. As you can see, the account is leading SPY by a small margin of 2.60% based on the prices as of Oct 21. Also, note that our holdings have a much higher dividend yield of 4.21% currently than the overall market (1.61%). And the return comparisons are adjusted for dividends.

As you can also see, thanks to the roadmap, we were able to beat the market both in terms of performance and downward volatility with only 6 stocks during a highly turbulent period of time.

GOOG: top-ranked safety and profitability

After the overall background, let's get back to GOOG.

First, its balance sheet remains in fortress strength. At the end of the June quarter, cash & equivalents sat at about $125 billion, translating into $1.37 per share. At the same time, the long-term debt load was only hovering at about $14.8 billion, leaving a large net cash position. Furthermore, such light leverage affords it a convenient path to funding should the company require financing for strategic growth acquisitions. Also, the valuation becomes even lower when the cash position is adjusted for.

To wit, at a target price of $95, the effective entry price would be only about $93.6 ($95 - $1.37 of cash per share). With its FW EPS around $5.15 according to consensus estimates, its adjusted FW PE is only 18.1x.

Yet, its profitability is quite healthy (actually terrific) in all metrics even when compared to the overachieving FAAMG group as seen below. Take the gross margin as an example. GOOG features a gross margin of around 56.7%, only second to META's 80.4% in this group. In terms of net margin, its 25.9% net margin is also highly competitive and is again only second to META's 28.1%.

Besides these margin metrics, the next chart also shows its ROCE (return on capital employed) over the past decade. I see ROCE as the most important profitability metric because it measures the return of capital ACTUALLY employed. And examine the ROCE over a longer time provides insights into the durability of its moat. As seen, its ROCE has been excellent over the years with an average of about 55%. To put things under perspective, this level of ROCE is only lower than AAPL and MSFT in the FAAMG group.

GOOG: business outlook and growth potential

The growth perspective is quite rosy - again, once you look past the -term issues (to be detailed in the risk section). Its second-quarter revenues rose to $69.7 billion, representing a year-over-year advance of 13%. Its Google Search and Google Cloud segments were the main drivers behind the increase. And in my mind, the two existing drivers will keep fueling growth in the next few years. Especially its cloud business. It is the fastest-growing cloud computing giant according to this IOT report:

The cloud market is dominated by three US-based firms that have seen their revenues grow at high double digits for years, with 2021 being no exception. Among the leading firms, both Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure reported 2021 revenue growth near 50% and are closing in on market leader AWS.

The global public cloud market reached $157 billion in 2021and is expected to grow into a $2 to $10 trillion industry in a few years according to another lOT report. With its rapid growth rate, I see GOOG best poised to capitalize on this secular trend.

Another growth engine involves its growing ecosystem. It is related to its cloud but is also beyond. According to the recent Google Developer Conference (September 14-15, 2022), the Android system has been running on more than 3 billion devices. With such a large number of products, GOOG sits on a gold mine of opportunities across a multitude of products, devices, and platforms. It has the potential to offer consumers cross-platform interactive experiences the way AAPL does.

GOOG: Back to the roadmap

Now, let's go back to the roadmap and wrap up. Again, at its current price levels, the OEY (owners earning yield) is ~5.1% (based on an FY1 FW PE of 19.6x). The growth rate is projected to be about 5.5% for GOOG by assuming a 10% reinvestment rate and 55% average ROCE as mentioned above (long-term growth rate = ROCE * reinvestment rate = 55% * 10% = 5.5%). As a result, the total expected return is about 10.5% at the current price.

At the target price of $95, the effective entry price would be only about $93.6 after adjusting for its cash as mentioned above. And its FW PE would only be 18.1x, translating into an OEY of 5.52%. Combined with the projected growth rate, the total return potential would be about 11%.

Final thoughts and risks

Again, there is no shortage of risks in the near term. These risks include geopolitical considerations and currency headwinds, which are both common and important for multinational enterprises like GOOG. It has been combating rising costs lately, ranging from labor costs to general inflation. Besides the macroeconomic risks, GOOG constantly faces fierce competition and regulatory risks. For example, the rising popularity of short videos is pressuring its YouTube segment. And it has recently been fined by the European Union for violating the EU antitrust rules.

But once we look past these near-term issues, I see a buy-and-forget stock. The stock offers an all-around enticing package combining the highest rank of financial strength, excellent growth prospects, and double-digit annual return potential. At a target price of $95, the total return potential is projected to be about 11%, translating into an OEY of 5.52% consisting of about 5.5% of OEY and another 5.5% of organic growth. And note that my projection is on the conservative side here. Consensus estimates project its EPS growth to be 11.2% in the next 6 years as shown below. I won't be surprised at all if the growth rates exceed my conservative estimates given the highly nonlinear opportunities such as its Cloud and the evolution (or even revolution) of its ecosystem.",cloud computing,seeking alpha

This article was prepared by Navyanshi Nayan in collaboration with Dilantha De Silva.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which is part of the model dividend portfolio at Leads From Gurus, has come under pressure along with other tech companies this year. The tech giant has lost almost a third of its market value in 2022, pushing its valuation below the 5-year average from a price-to-earnings ratio perspective. The company not only has to deal with challenging macroeconomic conditions that have forced the company to lay off thousands of employees but also fight it out with regulators to get the green light to complete the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI). This analysis aims to determine whether MSFT is an appealing buy ahead of the FTC's decision on the Activision deal.

What Is Microsoft's Deal With Activision?

Last January, Microsoft announced its plan to acquire Activision Blizzard (ATVI), one of the world's leading game developers and interactive entertainment content publishers, for $95 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion. Activision owns well-known gaming franchises such as Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, Call of Duty, and Candy Crush.

With the increasing use of smartphones, gaming has become the most popular and fastest-growing form of entertainment. Although gaming consoles remain a key platform for smart games and applications, mobile platforms are gradually taking over as the preferred platform due to their affordability and functionality. According to Microsoft, mobile gaming is the most popular platform today with nearly 95% of all players worldwide playing games on mobile. Further, Statista data reveals that smartphone games will account for 45% of global video gaming revenue in 2022, and with the increasing adoption of smartphones on a global scale, mobile games revenue is expected to surpass $100 billion by 2023. With the acquisition of Activision, Microsoft aims to enter the multi-billion-dollar gaming market and develop AAA-rated games while distributing Activision's most immersive franchises to players across the world.

According to a new study by data.ai and IDC, users around the world downloaded 1.1 billion mobile games per week in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 45% compared to pre-pandemic levels, and the mobile games segment is poised to take over 61% of the total gaming market share in 2022. The Activision deal will help Microsoft accelerate its gaming penetration across mobile, PC, console, and cloud platforms, as well as provide building blocks for the metaverse. Most importantly, the acquisition will strengthen Microsoft's Game Pass portfolio, which currently has over 25 million subscribers.

Game Pass provides players with a subscription option, lowering the cost of games and allowing developers to bring more games to more players. Microsoft intends to include Activision Blizzard games in Game Pass, as well as broaden its appeal to mobile gamers who appear to have more diverse preferences. Furthermore, through its cloud game streaming technology, the company hopes to enable players to play traditional Activision Blizzard console games on other platforms. The cloud platform will expand mobile gaming opportunities and create new distribution channels for game developers outside of mobile app stores to create immersive experiences for players.

The deal, however, has brought gamers some unsettling news: the company may withdraw franchises such as Call of Duty from PlayStation. However, the company has stated on numerous occasions that it intends to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for ""several more years"" beyond the expiration of the current Sony-Activision deal. Microsoft has promised that the same version of Call of Duty will be released on PlayStation on the same day it is released elsewhere.

Since the deal's announcement, regulators have increased their scrutiny of the transaction due to anti-competitive concerns.

Is Microsoft Allowed To Buy Activision?

As Microsoft stated in January, the acquisition would propel Microsoft to become the world's third-largest gaming company by revenue, trailing Tencent and Sony Group Corporation (SONY). The deal, however, has drawn international attention. The first is the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating the deal both from a consumer perspective and a business perspective. The watchdog will evaluate how this deal may affect workers after Activision was accused of discrimination and a hostile workplace while taking into consideration how this deal will affect the competition in the market. The FTC’s decision is expected in November. The antitrust regulator in the UK, on the other hand, is more concerned about the ability of Sony to compete with Microsoft if this deal goes through.

Microsoft has a strong console ecosystem and is well-positioned to compete in the cloud gaming market. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is concerned that Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision will strengthen its position and harm competition in the market for cloud gaming services, which is still in its early stages.

Furthermore, Microsoft's dispute with Sony over Activision's popular game Call of Duty, which the market believes Microsoft will make an Xbox exclusive, is putting additional strain on the deal. Although Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has stated that Call of Duty will be available on PlayStation for several more years, Sony believes that this assurance is insufficient and that Microsoft made this statement to alleviate regulators' fears and close the deal. Sony believes that ""several years"" will most likely refer to three.

PlayStation chief Jim Ryan said in an interview with Games Industry Biz:

Microsoft has only offered for Call of Duty to remain on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement between Activision and Sony ends. After almost 20 years of Call of Duty on PlayStation, their proposal was inadequate on many levels and failed to take into account the impact on our gamers. We want to guarantee PlayStation gamers continue to have the highest quality Call of Duty experience, and Microsoft’s proposal undermines this principle.

According to industry reports, Sony has postponed its annual PlayStation Showcase event which was scheduled for October 20 because the company believes that multiple new ""exclusive titles"" will strengthen Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. UK regulators are looking at whether Microsoft’s takeover of Activision will negatively affect PlayStation and the competitiveness of the market.

The CMA claims that the deal is the largest ever in the gaming industry, and Microsoft's complete control over Activision's powerful catalog could harm the industry by impairing its competitors' ability to compete fairly.

In response to the CMA's reference decision, Microsoft stated on October 11 that Sony's PlayStation has been the largest console platform for over 20 years and is more than double the size of Xbox, and that it was not credible to suggest that its dominance would be challenged by losing access to one title. Furthermore, the company stated that it wants people to have access to ""more games, not less."" Microsoft has stated that it has no intention of taking Call of Duty away from gamers and has committed to making the same game available on both Xbox and PlayStation on the same day. To support its claim, Microsoft, in a statement, stated explicitly why keeping Call of Duty on PlayStation is important for the company:

The value of Call of Duty depends on its community of gamers, the majority of whom are on PlayStation. Keeping Call of Duty on PlayStation is, therefore, a commercial imperative for the Xbox business and the economics of the Transaction. As such, Microsoft has offered Sony a contractual commitment to continue supplying it with Call of Duty, including new releases with feature and content parity. The Referral Decision fails to explain why, in the CMA’s view, Microsoft would make such commitments publicly and privately, if it had no intention of honoring them. Microsoft would not do this... Microsoft has been clear that it is counting on revenues from the distribution of Activision Blizzard games on Sony PlayStation as part of its business case for the acquisition.

Although Microsoft claims the CMA has accepted Sony's complaints without an ""appropriate level of critical review,"" the regulator is continuing with its in-depth investigation, the results of which will be published by March 1.

For now, Microsoft is yet to receive the green light from regulators in Europe and the United States to complete the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

What Should Investors Watch Going Forward?

It is reasonable to assume that the deal, if completed, will have tremendous implications for the gaming industry and Microsoft as digital subscriptions will bring in a new generation of gamers and open new opportunities for Microsoft to expand its gaming business. Despite the ongoing conflict, several analysts have stated that the deal would not be anti-competitive if competitors were given access to Activision games, as Microsoft has already promised.

There is a chance that a regulatory body will block this $70 billion deal, but this does not guarantee that Activision's games will remain in the market as they are now. Despite being a gaming industry powerhouse, Activision continues to face financial and internal organizational challenges. Activision Blizzard has also warned that if the deal falls through, it may be forced to lay off employees due to financial difficulties and be forced to ground some of its existing franchises.

This is not to say that there are no other likely candidates who could acquire Activision. However, only a few companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) are capable of purchasing and investing in the gaming industry at this scale. With all these tech behemoths currently embroiled in legal battles in Europe and China, it seems highly unlikely that one of these tech companies will bid for Activision in case Microsoft’s deal fails to win the approval of regulators. None of these tech giants has an active interest in gaming as much as Microsoft, which has been in the gaming space for over ten years. Microsoft's acquisition of Activision not only makes sense, but the company's resources and talent will help keep studios’ beloved games while also expanding the experience to new gamers.

Assuming the Activision acquisition will go through, Microsoft will be the world's third-largest gaming company by revenue, trailing only Tencent and Sony. If the deal fails, Microsoft will pay a $3 billion breakup fee but the company is confident of receiving regulatory approval. A failed transaction is very likely to hurt Microsoft’s market value as well.

Microsoft, at this point, seems the best home for Activision’s assets, and we believe the deal will eventually receive the approval of regulators.

What Is The Long-Term Prediction For MSFT Stock?

Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, Microsoft still has a long runway for growth as the company expands into new business verticals. The company reported moderate growth in FQ4 due to an increase in operating costs and its decision to scale back operations in Russia. However, its cloud business performed well. On a constant currency basis, the company recorded 46% year-over-year revenue growth for Azure and other cloud services in FQ4 2022, driven by growth in consumption-based services. Azure is the fastest-growing segment as transitioning to the cloud has become an important part of almost every business. The Office 365 Commercial product line saw revenue increase by 19% YoY on a constant currency basis driven by Office 365 E5. The number of Office 365 E5 seats increased by more than 60%, accounting for 12% of the Office 365 installed base. LinkedIn revenue increased by 29% in constant currency driven by significant investments made in the creator studio.

Growth will slow in the coming quarters due to macroeconomic headwinds. The company recently announced its third round of layoffs, following the company's slowest revenue growth in more than five years in the fiscal quarter that ended Sept. 30. On October 25, the company is expected to announce FQ1 2023 results, which will provide an accurate picture of the company's current challenges and progress.

On the bright side, the company is strengthening its presence in the creator economy. Microsoft recently announced the release of four new tools: Microsoft Designer, Microsoft Clipchamp, Microsoft Create, and Image Creator to gain traction among creators in an era where the creator economy is expected to grow exponentially. With the social media industry rapidly changing, Microsoft's entry into the creator economy is a significant step forward and will support Microsoft's long-term growth ambitions as digital transformation gathers pace. This global-scale digital transformation which is revolving around remote working, cloud computing, digital assets, AI-driven business processes, and automation might hit roadblocks in the short run, thereby making it difficult for Microsoft to maintain stellar growth. In the long run, however, Microsoft will come out as one of the biggest winners of the ongoing digital transformation, which is why investors need to double down on every opportunity to invest in Microsoft at cheaper prices.

Takeaway

Regardless of whether the Activision deal goes through or not, Microsoft is becoming very attractive as Mr. Market continues to punish tech companies this year. If the deal is approved, which is very likely to happen, Microsoft will be looking at a tremendous market opportunity that could open doors to bring in billions of dollars in annual recurring revenue with its subscription business. In the long run, we believe Microsoft will emerge as one of the few tech companies with a stable, recurring revenue stream thanks to its subscription-focused business model. This makes Microsoft a very appealing company for income investors who prioritize safety and growth over high yields.",cloud computing,seeking alpha
257,Netmaker Launches with $2.3M in Funding to Fix Cloud Networking with WireGuard - EIN News,,22/10/2022,"The Asheville-based startup is backed by Y-Combinator, and is bringing high-tech to Appalachia and beyond ASHEVILLE, N.C., Oct. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today,",https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/597235362/netmaker-launches-with-2-3m-in-funding-to-fix-cloud-networking-with-wireguard,"The Asheville-based startup is backed by Y-Combinator, and is bringing high-tech to Appalachia and beyond

ASHEVILLE, N.C., Oct. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Netmaker, a cloud networking startup, announced $2.3 million in funding to launch their ""superhighway for secure cloud networks."" The round was led by Lytical Ventures, Uncorrelated Ventures, and SaxeCap among others, following their graduation from Y-Combinator. Netmaker offers a platform built on WireGuard which transforms the way companies integrate their networks to make them safe, dynamic and up to 15 times faster than alternatives.

In addition to the funding, Netmaker is announcing the 1.0 release of their community product, and an Enterprise Edition, which offers HA networking, metrics and access controls for users.

Modern applications are significantly more complex than they appear. While individuals see a website or smartphone app, in the background, a vast ecosystem of infrastructure and applications must be connected together to make this software work. Today, those connections are created by operations teams who must follow a process which is expensive, time-consuming, and painstaking. That's where Netmaker comes in.

""We created Netmaker because we had to. We saw this gap between what we're capable of doing with cloud computing, and what networking allowed us to do. We realized that there was nothing on the market that could solve this problem, so we had to build it ourselves,"" said CEO Alex Feiszli.

Netmaker allows applications to access each other directly and securely, without going through a central gateway. It does this with peer-to-peer virtual networks, automated over a client-server model. The server manages the keys, addresses, and discovery of peers, and sends this information to clients, which enables advanced routing operations to move traffic into, out of, and throughout the network.

Recent trends in hybrid cloud, edge computing, and IoT have made this pattern a necessity.

""Netmaker makes it simple to abstract away the physical network, allowing IT departments to create logical networks in minutes. Now, putting IoT devices with 5G onto the same flat network with a control environment can be done in minutes instead of days or weeks. I believe it's a tool that will be in every IT department's kit in the coming year."" said Lucas Nelson, Partner at Lytical Ventures.

Feiszli and Carns previously worked together building cloud software and led a team of multi-cloud platform engineers at IBM. During the pandemic, the duo moved to Asheville, NC. Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the town is known more for its craft breweries than its tech startup scene, but Feiszli and Carns have big plans to bring the cloud to the 'Land of the Sky'.

Netmaker was released on GitHub in March of 2021, and the adoption was swift. There are now over 1,200 organizations and individuals running the platform. This traction brought Netmaker to the attention of Y-Combinator, which further accelerated the company's popularity. Growth in active platforms since the start of 2022 has averaged 32% MoM.

About Netmaker

Based on the groundbreaking WireGuard protocol, Netmaker is the fastest and most configurable mesh VPN on the market, allowing companies to build distributed, dynamic, and secure networks instantly. Netmaker's use cases span remote access, multi-cloud, hybrid-cloud, edge computing, IoT, and Kubernetes. Founded in 2021 and based in Asheville, North Carolina, Netmaker is led by co-founders and IBM alums Alex Feiszli (CEO) and Dillon Carns (CTO).

261,Compounders And Dividends: My Top 10 And Portfolio Positioning,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1208346838/image_1208346838.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,22/10/2022,My portfolio is dynamic and changing as I grow older and as the market moves. Check out the top positions in my portfolio.,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4548292-compounders-dividends-top-10-portfolio-positioning,"Sportactive/iStock via Getty Images

In my inaugural article introducing my portfolio, I said the following regarding my beliefs on owning the entire market where an oligopoly persists:

Payment Rails, Northern Railroads, Rating Agencies

In markets where there are high barriers to entry and few big players, I find it easier just to own the whole market. I could spend hours, days or weeks researching markets and be unable to decide which company is ""better."" Therefore, it's easier to just own the whole market. Other markets in my portfolio that are similar to the above three (but not perfect comparisons due to competition or other factors) include home retailers (Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW)), physical general retailers (Target (TGT) and Costco (COST)), and cloud computing (MSFT and GOOGL, (Amazon (AMZN) will appear in this portfolio eventually)).

My most recent article highlighting where I put my September 2022 dividends to work provided the most updated look at my top 16 positions:

Company Ticker Allocation Microsoft Corporation MSFT 9.049% Apple, Inc. AAPL 6.425% Broadcom, Inc. AVGO 4.976% Moody's Corporation MCO 4.502% Alphabet, Inc. GOOGL 4.424% Visa, Inc. V 3.936% Mastercard Incorporated MA 3.757% Canadian National Railway CNI 3.632% Essex Property Trust, Inc. ESS 3.571% Lowe's Companies, Inc. LOW 3.526% Costco Wholesale Corporation COST 3.424% Texas Instruments Incorporated TXN 3.218% Meta Platforms, Inc. META 3.195% Home Depot, Inc. HD 3.129% Netflix, Inc. NFLX 2.974% S&P Global, Inc. SPGI 2.862% Click to enlarge

Although those are my top 16 positions, I don't look at my top positions in that way. As noted above, I view several of these companies as ""one"" where I admit I'm not smart enough to pick between the companies, so I own both to reduce the risk of missing out. As said in my first article:

As you can see, there are a large number of positions. That is a feature, not a bug. While I'd love to hold a concentrated portfolio of my 10 highest conviction picks, I instead defer to quantity+quality. I'm a firm believer that quantity drives quality.

Here is how I view the top positions in my portfolio (and how I have a page in my excel sheet arranged):

Companies Tickers Weighting Microsoft Corporation MSFT 9.049% Visa, Inc. + Mastercard Incorporated V+MA 7.693% Moody's Corporation + S&P Global, Inc. MCO+SPGI 7.364% Lowe's Companies, Inc. + Home Depot, Inc. LOW+HD 6.655% Apple, Inc. AAPL 6.425% Canadian National Railway + Canadian Pacific Railway CNI+CP 5.505% Broadcom, Inc. AVGO 4.976% Alphabet, Inc. GOOGL 4.424% Essex Property Trust, Inc. ESS 3.571% Costco Wholesale Corporation COST 3.424% Click to enlarge

Below is a discussion of these segments and how I'd like to position them moving forward:

Big Tech:

MSFT, AAPL and GOOGL are truly in a league of their own. Incredible businesses with competitive advantages, they have been compounding shareholder's capital for years and likely will in the decades to come. You can pick whatever metrics you want to convince yourself these companies are cheap, but they always trade at a premium to the market for a reason. Yes, the stock price now is cheaper than it was a few months ago, or a year ago, but it's dangerous to anchor yourself to ATH. Continuing to buy these companies over long periods of time is always your best move. I know that for where I want my portfolio to be when I'm retired, I need to keep buying these companies. I remind myself of this whenever I average up into a position.

Moving forward - I want all three of these companies to remain in my top ten unless something catastrophic happens. Whenever I feel that these companies are underallocated, you can expect to see me allocate some of my dividend reinvestments into these compounders. At first glance, MSFT and AAPL are right to be in my top five. I could see MSFT falling out of the top position if the payment rails (V and MA) or the ratings agencies (MCO and SPGI) catch a bid and overtake the top position. AAPL will likely always be in the 4-7 range. GOOGL is a frustrating one, if I wasn't a dividend growth investor, I'd instantly double my GOOGL position by selling off something else. My GOOGL position is in a good place though, but you will see me add to it through dividend reinvestments once my yearly dividend is up 10%+ yoy.

Payment Rails - V and MA may be two of my favorite companies. I've discussed V in my previous postings and nearly everything can also be said of MA. They are wonderfully run companies that deserve to trade at large premiums to the market. A ""toll road"" on global GDP, they have faced a number of headwinds over the past decade and have sailed past without issue. That's not to say those headwinds aren't real, one only has to look at the V or MA risk factors to know regulation could hamstring these companies' growth prospects. Until that happens, I'll keep adding on weakness.

Moving forward - I'd start to feel sick if these two companies fell out of my top five, let alone top 10. I'll add whenever I get the chance. These companies should be increasing their dividends at a double-digit clip for years to come. As noted above, if I want my portfolio to be multiples of what it is now (which I'm sure every investor wants) I need to keep accumulating shares of these companies.

The Ratings Agencies

If I had to own ""one"" company for the rest of my life, it would probably be MCO+SPGI (if I had to pick one, probably SPGI, no MCO, no, both). The ratings agencies may have the single best business model. Low capital requirements plus a government mandated oligopoly gives both companies 90%+ market shares. Yes, both companies have 90%+ market shares because any issuance is typically rated by both companies. By that standard, they aren't really even competitors. All of that excess cash comes to us through buybacks and dividends. A quick glance at the recent MCO 10-Q has MCO buying back $871MM of shares and distributing $259MM of dividends. Those figures from the SPGI 10-Q are $8.5B for buybacks and $472MM in dividends. To be clear, SPGI financed those buybacks through debt and the cash on its balance sheet. SPGI acquired INFO earlier this year so it's been cannibalizing its share count. But that's what you love to see with the companies when times are tough, they're buying back shares.

Moving forward - These two should remain in my top three or five companies for years. Expect me to add every now and then through monthly savings and see the guys become repeat offenders in the dividend reinvestment article.

Home Retailers

LOW and HD are known for being stewards of shareholder capital. Both have been compounding their dividends at double digit rates and annihilating their share counts. As much as I love these companies, I'd like to see them tumble down my top ten; that's going to be difficult though. Both appear attractively valued, so I'll keep adding through dividend reinvestments. As of now, I'm happy to have these companies in my top five. I'll keep adding opportunistically and accumulate shares into weakness. Several macro headwinds lay ahead for these companies, so I'm not throwing all of my resources at them. Over the long term, both companies should continue to bear fruit for investors.

Moving forward - I'll keep allocating some dividend reinvestments to these companies every few months. With both yields at attractive levels, it's hard not to dump more. Over the long-term, I'd like to see the companies in the bottom half of my top ten (or out of it) to make room for some other companies I own/will own.

Northern Railways

The last segment I'll discuss is my northern railways, CNI and CP. Depending on how some things play out, this may become ""railways,"" but that may be a different article. CNI and CP are two of the best Class I railroads. These are the opposite of the ratings agencies and payment rails since they have significant CapEx requirements, but those requirements have built nearly impenetrable moats. They have become maniacally focused on reducing costs and improving their operating ratios. This capital discipline has allowed them to pay increasing dividends while cannibalizing their share counts. CP is a very exciting opportunity with the pending acquisition of Kansas City Southern and I fully expect the Surface Transportation Board to bless the deal. Once the deal is done, CP will resume dividend increases. Buybacks should likely resume in early 2024 once CP gets its debt load back to a manageable level (~2.5x)

Moving forward - Pending future purchases, I could easily see this segment catapulting into my top three (and be in the top position at some point). If I had to bet on one business/industry existing 100 years from now, I'm picking the rails because they have the bonds to prove it.

Other Positions:

Rounding out the top ten I have AVGO, ESS and COST. I hope to see AVGO and ESS drop out over the next few years. COST is one of my favorite companies given their shareholder focus (it's right there in their stores) and history of a growing dividend with the occasional special dividend. One other company I'd like to see in my top ten is TXN (which I wrote about a number of times as a future top ten company). I've long admired TXN's CEO and strict capital allocation strategy. There is a good chance TXN will be up there with AZO as one of the best repurchasers of shares over 20+ years.

I believe that's ""nine"" companies when grouped. The tenth company is likely a moving target. I could see American Tower (AMT), ADP (ADP), Danaher (DHR), Meta Platforms, or Netflix or a company I don't own like Amazon, Union Pacific (UNP), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) or Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) settling into that spot. It will be a bit of what the market gives me and how all of these companies perform.

Conclusion

My portfolio is dynamic and changing as I grow older and as the market moves. Companies that I don't expect to be in my top ten (AVGO and ESS) continue to grow. Rather than sell those winners and reallocate to other names, I choose to let winners win and grow positions through selective dividend reinvestments and monthly savings allocations. I will even add to those shares opportunistically (as I have done with both AVGO and ESS this year). Just because I want to reduce the weighting of a position doesn't mean I still won't accumulate into weakness. My portfolio is positioned for the long term, a daily snapshot of my top ten or fifteen names won't have me panicking to rebalance. Targeting a long-term top ten is in an investor's best interest because it allows winners to keep winning and gives you an opportunity to slowly DCA into a position if it's always expensive. Selling shares at times is important, especially if the reasons you bought the company have changed. I'll always sell shares and rebalance when the thesis changes or doesn't play out. Until that happens, I'm holding my positions steady and allowing the magic of compounding to unfold.

In addition, I view my top ten as buckets of several companies covering markets dominated by oligopolies with high barriers to entries. This allows me to focus more on the industries/markets I want to invest in rather than the specific details around the companies. I know I want to invest in the rating agencies, but I don't want to go on a fool's errand to try to determine which company is better (even some of the best investors in the world own both companies rather than own one). I'll leave that to the professionals and allow both companies to compound in my portfolio for decades.

I hope this provided you some insight into how I actually look at my top ten positions and my portfolio positioning moving forward. I look forward to continuing to provide my dividend reinvestment updates on a monthly cadence and will sprinkle in some other portfolio related content as needed.",cloud computing,seeking alpha

But the initiative is spelled out in WEF founder Klaus Schwab's book ""COVID-19: The Great Reset"" and demonstrated in President Biden's adoption of the globalist organization's ""Build Back Better"" plan.

Now, 18 prominent academics and intellectuals have spelled out their concerns about the plan in essays compiled by author and researcher Michael Walsh in a volume titled ""Against the Great Reset,"" reports Just the News.

Stanford historian Victor Davis Hanson, in an essay titled ""The Great Regression,"" points out the ""Orwellian philology"" of the words ""Great"" and ""Reset.""

TRENDING: Inconvenient facts about electric cars

He writes:

Assume the worst when the adjective ""great"" appears in connection with envisioned fundamental, government-driven, or global political changes. What was similar between Lyndon Johnson's massively expensive but failed ""Great Society"" and Mao's genocidal ""Great Leap Forward"" was the idea of a top-down, centrally planned schema, cooked up by elites without any firsthand knowledge, or even worry, how it would affect the middle classes and poor. So often, the adjective ""great"" is a code word of supposed enlightened planners for radical attempts at reconstruction of a society that must be either misled or forced to accept a complete overhaul.

Hanson notes that Barack Obama used the word ""reset"" in his foreign policy initiatives. When Schwab uses the word, the historian writes, he presumes that ""all that came before was flawed … and all that will follow, we are assured, will not be so defective.""

The bureaucrats and technocrats who attend WEF's elite Davos conferences in Switzerland, warns Hanson, do not trust the ability ""of elected leaders and legislatures of Western constitutional governments to solve problems independently.""

Canadian financier and newspaper publisher Conrad Black warns in his essay ""The War on Capitalism"" that the idea of ""stakeholder capitalism"" espoused by WEF amounts to collectivism.

At the 2021 Davos meeting, a Fortune 500 CEO affirmed WEF's assertion that ""capitalism as we have known it is dead.""

Marc Benoiff, the CEO of Salesforce, which is regarded as a pioneer of cloud computing, said the ""obsession"" with ""maximizing profits for shareholders alone has led to incredible inequality and a planetary emergency.""

""Stakeholder capitalism,"" according to WEF and its allies, means that rather than pursuing profits, companies would ""pursue the wellbeing of all people and the entire planet.""

Ahead of the January meeting, Schwab published an op-ed about the need for a ""Davos Manifesto"" for ""a better kind of capitalism.""

""Business leaders now have an incredible opportunity. By giving stakeholder capitalism concrete meaning, they can move beyond their legal obligations and uphold their duty to society,"" the WEF founder wrote. ""They can bring the world closer to achieving shared goals, such as those outlined in the Paris climate agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda. If they really want to leave their mark on the world, there is no alternative.""

Other contributors to ""Against the Great Reset"" include Michael Anton, Roger Kimball, Jeremy Black, Richard Fernandez, David P. Goldman, Salvatore Babones, Alberto Mingardi, Douglas Murray, James Poulos, Harry Stein, John Tierney, Janice Fiamengo and the late Angelo Codevilla.

EDITOR'S NOTE: With what has been called the ""Sovietization"" of the Biden administration – including the shocking criminalization of dissent and massive weaponization of the FBI against political opponents – America is being increasingly compared to a third-world or communist dictatorship. Yet America still has one sacred institution that dictatorships from Zimbabwe to communist China don't have: ELECTIONS. And in reality, there is no reason, despite the regime's all-out efforts at election rigging, that the tens of millions of decent, right-thinking American voters cannot stop the Biden administration's ever-expanding madness this November. For that reason, the September issue of WND's critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine insightfully covers the most electrifying and important races, illuminates the biggest issues, reveals how the latest federal takeover of elections actually violates the law, and much more. Looking forward to 2024, the issue also highlights why, to quote the chairman of a major think tank, Donald Trump ""is the most towering political figure in living memory"" and the person ""most fit to lead"" today's America. It's all in ""STOPPING THE MADNESS: A MIDTERM ELECTION GUIDE FOR VOTERS WHO LOVE AMERICA.""

Driverless car quest has made a bonfire out of $75 billion originally appeared on Au…",https://www.autoblog.com/2022/10/22/self-driving-car-costs/,"Autonomous vehicle companies and suppliers have collectively spent around $75 billion developing self-driving technology, with scant sign of meaningful revenue emerging from robo-car services after all that cash incineration.

This has spelled disaster for Aurora Innovation, TuSimple Holdings and Embark Technology, whose shares have each plunged at least 80% this year. It’s no wonder Intel just slashed the targeted valuation for its autonomous-driving business Mobileye to about $16 billion, a fraction of the more than $50 billion it reportedly had in mind 10 months ago. Cruise, owned by General Motors, raised money at a roughly $30 billion valuation early last year. In March, GM bought out SoftBank Vision Fund at a price implying the venture was worth around $19 billion.

This is what happens when long-gestating new technology meets the short patience of public markets and harsh reality of rising interest rates. Many of these companies raised tens of billions of dollars long before their technology was proven or their businesses came close to being self-sustaining.

The hype of the last decade or so and crash of late is calling into question whether self-driving cars will ever work. Anthony Levandowski, one of Google’s early autonomy pioneers, who left for Uber Technologies and was later convicted for stealing trade secrets, now runs a startup developing autonomous trucks for industrial sites. In a Businessweek cover story this month, he argued that less-complex use cases will be the way forward for the foreseeable future.

Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, who seven years ago ascribed massive value to a Tesla mobility service that’s still nowhere to be found, said in a note recently that autonomy could be a 10- or 20-year proposition.

Companies in the space are now being forced to contemplate drastic measures. Aurora Chief Executive Officer Chris Urmson sent out an internal memo in September raising the prospect of cost cuts, taking the company private, spinning off assets or even trying to sell the company to Apple or Microsoft.

Others have seen high-level turnover. GM CEO Mary Barra dismissed Cruise counterpart Dan Ammann late last year. TuSimple replaced founder and CEO Cheng Lu in March, and its general counsel James Mullen resigned in September. Alphabet-owned Waymo lost its chief product officer Dan Chu last month to 23andMe.

While executives and investors alike are in some cases heading for the exits, well-capitalized companies in the space are plowing ahead into new markets and projects. Cruise plans to replicate its San Francisco robo-taxi service in Phoenix and Austin, Texas. Waymo will start offering rides in Los Angeles and also has been hauling beer between Dallas and Houston.

Startup Kodiak Robotics raised $30 million in private capital this week and ran its freight trucks 8,000 miles from Texas to Florida. While there was a test driver at the wheel, the human ceded to the robot 94% of the time, Kodiak CEO and founder Don Burnette told me in an interview. The company is starting to haul furniture for Ikea.

I asked Burnette if Kodiak will be ready to ditch the safety driver anytime soon.

“We’re pretty close,” he said. “It seems like we always say this. It’s a couple years out.”

It may take even longer, but the market getting the timing of autonomy wrong doesn’t mean it will never work. The lesson is that technology as radical as robotic driving was always better off in the incubators of daring venture capitalists, not the portfolios of trigger-happy stock traders.",electric vehicles,autoblog

The plan envisages a 14-fold increase in the number of charging stations, climbing to 1 million by 2030 from around 70,000 now. It would focus on building them in local municipalities which are currently undersupplied.

It also aims to have 15 million electric vehicles on German roads by 2030 from around 1.5 million now. Other measures in the government's plan include speeding up state approvals to build charging points.

""Our goal: to accelerate the expansion of charging infrastructure, simplify the charging process and thus make it easier for people to switch,"" said Federal Transport Minister Volker Wissing in a statement.

""We know that electromobility is ramping up rapidly, so we have to be quick.""

Germany is expecting exponential growth in the electric vehicle market and the government wants to make it more attractive for buyers to switch to such cars, Wissing said at a press conference after the cabinet approved the plan.

""There has to be a positive experience associated with it,"" he said.

Germany is home to battery-electric vehicle makers including Volkswagen and Tesla, which has a factory on the outskirts of the capital.

The electric vehicle push comes against a backdrop of surging electricity prices, resulting from an energy crisis fueled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

To address that, the German government plans to cap electricity prices, and Wissing said the energy crisis should not derail longer term climate goals.

The electric vehicle plan drew a mixed reaction from industry associations, which have long complained that the government has not kept pace with the rapid expansion of electric vehicles.

The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) said it was an important step and that the speed of implementing the proposals was now key. The BDEW energy and water business association said the proposals would lead to more planning and state control, calling it expensive window-dressing.

Tesla's earliest cars have shot up in price in recent years.

That's thanks to the ""star power"" of the Tesla brand and the significance of the Roadster to electric-car history.

Tesla only made around 2,450 Roadsters from 2008-2012.

When a little California upstart named Tesla Motors released a limited-production, electric sports car in 2008, nobody could have predicted that the same company would someday be the most valuable carmaker in the world and be credited with sparking the electric-vehicle revolution.

Now Tesla's earliest cars are becoming hot collectibles, skyrocketing in price in recent years as Elon Musk's empire has exploded.

Tesla made roughly 2,450 Roadsters between 2008 and 2012, selling them for around $100,000 and up. The quirky two-door convertibles depreciated over time, with one changing hands for $38,000 on the car-auction site Bring a Trailer in 2018.

What a difference a few years makes. According to Hagerty, an insurance firm for classic cars, Roadster values have nearly doubled in the last two years, rising from an average of $69,000 in May 2020 to $127,000 this year. That's based on values provided by owners looking to insure their vehicles and largely reflects what they paid.

Some examples with particularly low mileage or desirable options have raked in much more than that. In January, a 2011 Roadster Sport sold for $190,000. In May, someone paid $212,000 for one of the first 100 Roadsters built.

The run-up in prices lined up with a pandemic-induced frenzy in the collector-car market as enthusiasts turned to their vehicles as an escape, Brian Rabold, vice president of automotive intelligence at Hagerty, told Insider. A sexy, quick, and fun-to-drive car that's become an important piece of EV history, the Roadster also has a distinct appeal among fans of Tesla and of the wider electric-car movement, he said.

""It was Tesla's first product, so it has that special place in history. As Tesla's fortunes have grown and as it's become the company that it is today, a lot of that gets rooted back to the Roadster,"" he said.

In just the last five years, Tesla has matured from a shaky startup to a $700 billion company with a global presence and an army of loyal fans. Its CEO Elon Musk has become a celebrity and the richest person on the planet. All of this has helped catapult the Roadster to new heights, experts said.

Randy Nonnenberg, CEO of Bring a Trailer, chalked up the Roadster's recent success to the ""star power of the Tesla brand.""

Dan Richland, a retired literary agent who lives in California, owned a string of fast gas-powered cars over the decades but became sold on EVs after driving a Tesla Model S in 2020. Since then, he's bought multiple Teslas and plunged much of his net worth into the company's stock, he told Insider. He wanted to own the car that started it all and bought a 2010 Roadster for $140,000 in May.

""My thinking on it was: This is the original Tesla. It is a miracle that this car actually came to market,"" he said.

Part of the Roadster's appeal is that it's more fun and interesting any other electric car available today, said Pete Gruber, who runs Gruber Motor Company, a repair shop in Phoenix, Arizona that specializes in Roadsters. ""You've got four-door grocery-getters all day long,"" he said. ""Nothing out there is a brightly colored, two-seater sports car.""

Gruber launched an online marketplace that connects Roadster sellers and buyers in late 2020 and is planning to open a Roadster storage facility to capitalize on the boom in sales. In the last couple of years, he's seen more serious collectors buying up Roadsters as investments.

Both Rabold and Nonnenberg expect that Roadsters will grow more valuable for the foreseeable future.

""Will it be a rocket ship and they'll be worth 20x what they are now? Probably not. But are they a very solid and appreciating investment? I think so,"" Nonnenberg said.",electric vehicles,autoblog

This video was recorded on October 16, 2022.

Bruce Usher: The most dramatic growth and electric vehicles is not the US or Europe. It's in developing countries already, and mostly around two wheelers and three wheelers. That's where it's being used. In some countries today over 90 percent of two wheelers and three wheelers are electric today and four wheelers traditional automobiles are rapidly catching up. Why? Because they're more efficient vehicle to drive and they're better to drive and they're cheaper to drive. Those cost advantages are really reflected in developing countries.

Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill and that's Bruce Usher, professor at Columbia Business School and author of the recently released book, Investing in the Era of Climate Change. Maria Gallagher and Alyce Lomax caught up with Usher to talk about renewable energy technology, the opportunities and challenges in sustainable investing, and one under-the-radar benefit of electric cars.

Maria Gallagher: To get started as someone who started in a more traditional finance route, how did you pivot into a more sustainable investing mindset?

Bruce Usher: My background wasn't just on finance, I worked initially in Tokyo and then here in New York and Wall Street. I pivoted just up 2002 I had the opportunity to join a small company that was investing in climate change projects in developing countries all over the world. What was interesting about 2002 and I didn't recognize at the time was that in fact there was very little to invest in. That's what's changed in the last 20 years. I think people are unaware of just how dramatic the change has been 20 years ago. We're well aware of the challenge of climate change. The science was already pretty good 20 years ago, but what we didn't have were any solutions to actually decarbonize global economy. There was no way we could have done it at any reasonable cost.

Today we're in a dramatically different situation from renewable energy, which is the cheapest form of power in many countries in the world today if not all countries, electric vehicles which are preferred vehicle from any drivers at better car, to other more exotic solutions like green hydrogen. There's lot of technologies out there, many of them are commercial. In fact, if you just look at what's commercial today, that gets us about halfway to what's called net zero. It's about halfway to reducing emissions we need to reduce to avoid catastrophic climate change. That's how I got into this sector 20 years ago from the financial industry and actually why I'm still in it because it's actually a far more attractive place to be today.

Maria Gallagher: Something that I loved reading your book is it's basically as you're talking about a primer on the existing technologies and the challenges that all of these technologies face and how we need to scale them, what is a renewable energy that you're really excited about and where do you see that going in the next 5-10 years?

Bruce Usher: Let me just start with this, the boring stuff which is renewable, wind and solar. I say it's boring because it's already at scale. It's the fastest-growing source of power on the planet, not just here in the US. It's already highly competitive with fossil fuels, with any other form of power generation today. But as if from an investor's perspective, it's very attractive because it's so well-known. Technology is very stable. It's very long-term. Investors can make very long-term, very stable investments. Particularly given all the market volatility we're all facing today, that investment, those kind of returns are attractive. They're low returns, but they're very low-risk as well. I think so that's an attractive area to be focusing on. Electric vehicles are a little more challenging because what electric vehicle demand is growing dramatically, very exciting space. We're still short of some charging infrastructure, there's still a lot of questions about how that growth is going to continue to accelerate.

From an investment perspective of this opportunity, there's challenges and is challenges around which companies are going to dominate those sectors as well, Is Tesla going to continue staying in the lead or will GM or Ford or other companies that really committed to it are they're going to be catching up? I think of the then are riskier, but far more exciting technologies. Green hydrogen probably leads to list at this point because is using renewable energy, which is as I mentioned a moment ago, very cheap and scale to produce hydrogen. Hydrogen is a really useful gas and industrial application, also for heating, for transportation, and so there's enormous potential for the gas but the cost today is still too high, it's uncompetitive with fossil fuels today and the infrastructure is lacking. Lot of challenges to growing the green hydrogen space, but tremendous opportunities for those to get it right.

Maria Gallagher: I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on nuclear which is an interesting area in the renewable space, if you could talk about the pros and cons there.

Bruce Usher: Sure. Nuclear is controversial subject It has been for a long time, but I think the controversy is actually misplaced. It's a very safe form of power generation. When we look at historically despite some very serious mishaps over the years, the challenges is in the security issue, the challenge is really very simple. It's expensive form of power generation. Today, traditional nuclear is currently built, is in theory costly way of generating power. Now, operating plants can be fairly low-cost. Those that are operating continue to operate and I expect they will continue to operate here in the US and in much of the world. But building new plants is just one of the most expensive ways of generating new power today. The caveat being that there are some new nuclear technologies and development.

There is mostly foreign category of SMR nuclear, small modular reactors. Those technologies have the potential to be both much lower cost, have much better security and safety if you are concerned about that to be smaller and more distributable, which is a big advantage as well. That being said, no SMR nuclear is yet in the commercial market. In fact, the first commercial SMR facility is forecast to be online in 2029. The price points a little hard to know with certainty, but based on what we're hearing from these developers, it's still going to be a fairly costly even at that point in time. I think nuclear's interesting potential, but I will describe it as a long shot on this point.

Maria Gallagher: That's really interesting because I feel like nuclear has been a hot topic of reviving the era of nuclear. That's really interesting the way you're talking about that. Can you speak to the way that all of these green energy options interact with each other?

Bruce Usher: Yeah. This is a really key point Maria. Most investors and policymakers as well, they tend to look at these climate solutions, I call them, mostly energy, but there are other solutions as well. They'd look them as silos. They look at what policy would support say, more solar or what investment producing more electric vehicles. But in fact, these technologies are really connected and that's both the complexity of them, but where I think gets particularly interesting. Let me give an example I mentioned a few minutes ago that as the price of renewable energy comes down, green hydrogen becomes more competitive, green hydrogen has all applications in the industry. Let me give you another example. It's a simpler example but one actually more relevant today. As the cost of electric vehicles come down, more people buy electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are essentially energy storage on wheels. The average driver dries in America for less than an hour a day, actually 48 minutes a day.

The remaining 23 hours of vehicle is not being used. When it's not being used, its tremendous store of power. That's store of power can be used to address the issue of intermittency in renewable energy. I think most people know solar and wind a great source of power when it's sunny or windy, which is not always. Electric vehicles stores powers that when it's not sunny or windy, you can use that power. The new Ford F150 Lightning, which is very popular electric pickup truck. It has the ability to do what's called vehicle to grid or V to G. It allows you to literally plug in your pickup truck into your house, not to draw power to charge a car, but actually to take power from your vehicle into your house.

In places that have had blackouts or because of storms or other reasons, Texas has had this recently, the power that's in that F150 Lightning could provide enough electricity for average American home for three days, you get three days of power stored there. This is really interesting and useful side benefit because is not the main reason people are buying these, but another benefit of EV. These things are very connected, renewable energy, electric vehicles, hydrogen, I'm talking about directly air capturing. Some of these other technologies, they're actually all linked together. As any one of these technologies, any one of these sectors scales, it actually accelerates growth in the other sectors as well.

Maria Gallagher: You touched on about how governments have an interesting challenge because you have to regulate everybody all over the world. You see this disconnect between the developed markets like in the US and in Europe as how we're trying to rework all of our existing infrastructure, and then you have emerging markets who are being asked as people who are not strong emitters to jump the middle section that we've been in for hundreds of years. How do you think about the challenges that are posed to different countries around the world?

Bruce Usher: Yeah. Let's first begin with the big challenge here. Climate change is a global problem. You and I make greenhouse gas affects everyone globally, and same for anybody else. We're all in this together. In a perfect world, we all cooperate, figure out how to solve the problem. We don't live in that world. We never will live in that world, and that's why the international negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions don't have the outcome that more would ideally hoped for, which is everyone agreeing to and it's not going to happen, I don't believe that. That's a bad news and it's a challenge. Here's the reality. The reality is, in developing countries, the big challenge is non-implementation of these technologies because in fact there's an opportunity there to leap-frog the use of fossil fuels, which frankly is pretty inefficient way of generating power to leap-frog these internal combustion engines and go right to electric vehicles and so on.

The most dramatic growth on electric vehicles is not in the US or Europe, it's in developing countries already. Mostly around two-wheelers and three-wheelers, that's where it's being used. In some countries today, over 90 percent of two wheelers and three-wheelers are electric today and four wheelers, traditional automobiles are rapidly catching up. Why? Because they're more efficient vehicle to drive and they are better to drive and they are cheaper to drive. Those cost advantages are really reflected in developing countries. Here's the real challenge when you really drill down and understand what the challenge is in getting developing countries to decarbonize, and that is mobilizing Capital.

Capital investment in developing countries is especially challenging. It's challenging investing in the US, challenging investing in Europe, your investors or all investors it's hard. But in developing countries, is that much harder. It's as much harder because you have much greater long-term risks. The legal infrastructure may not be as strong There may be more political instability and so on that makes long-term investments harder to make or are made it a much higher cost of capital and that makes these projects less attractive. The real challenge in developing countries is not the technologies themselves, it's making sure that capital is finding opportunities to invest in those countries. That's a big challenge, we don't have easy solutions now and today.

Alyce Lomax: Speaking of that theme, your book did such a great job of going through the history and going through different energy sources, it was so enjoyable. But you also talked about investing in a way that could help combat climate change and a few of the areas that you went into were environmental, social and governance or ESG investing, divestment, and thematic impact investing. We were wondering if you could maybe touch on those areas and the pros and cons that you see and the challenges.

Bruce Usher: Sure. Alyce, you mentioned that there are a number of different strategies in the book. As an investor, what are the opportunities to actually put capital to work to address climate change and make an attractive financial return? The book goes through those strategies. That's really the heart of the book. Some of the strategies are frankly pretty controversial. Let me address each in turn very briefly. Let's start with divestment. Divestments become popular strategy, particularly among university endowments where I am here at Columbia University and many of our peer schools. Divestment is a very simple concept. Look, let me give you an example, I don't smoke. I actually don't really like being in a room full of smokers.

If I don't like smoking, why would I invest in tobacco? It's pretty simple. Well, when it comes to climate change, if I'm really concerned about climate change, why would I invest in companies that are the worst polluters? It's the same concept. Bill McKibben, the founder of who put it, ''If it's wrong to wreck the planet, it's wrong to profit from that wreckage.'' That's a powerful statement. The problem with divestment is that it doesn't do much to address climate change because if I sell my shares in a company that's polluting the atmosphere, someone else is buying those shares. But if there's a transaction for companies, they may be owning the largest public companies, and most fossil fuels today are not in public companies. They're actually in sovereign companies, national-owned oil companies, for example, private equity. Divestment isn't very powerful.

What divestment is good for though is aligns your personal values with your investments and that could be very important personally. Just not that important to the planet. Same strategy, you mentioned ESG. ESG has become quite controversial and this is fascinating to me because controversial for all the wrong reasons. ESG is a really simple concept. Look, if you're picking stocks and you want to make an investment, you look at many function of a company. You'd read the financial statements, you can see the management, equality, you look at the competitive products, you do all these analyses. All ESG is doing is saying, in addition to the analysis, not instead of, in addition to, you should also consider some additional factors, some environmental factors, some social factors, some government factors and how are those putting the company at risk or creating opportunity, but more around the risk side of it. Factor zone is ensuring analysis when you're making your stock picks.

That's just smart investing and that's what ESG is all about. ESG is really about risk management for companies and for investors. It's become political. It's all upside down because the reality is ESG also like divestment doesn't do much for addressing climate change. Just because I pick companies that have strong ESG, that might make me a better investor. In fact, there's a decent amount of academic research today suggesting that ESG investors showing that they can outperform and that companies that are starting ESG do better. Climate change, all those companies are doing is managing their risk. The third strategy, and now we get to actually adjust in climate change is thematic.

This is saying look, I really care about climate change. I really want to make good returns, good market risk-adjusted returns on my money. What themes can I invest in? And I mentioned a few minutes ago, I could invest in renewable energy, renewable wind, and solar. It's very low-risk. Every wind and solar project that's built helps us address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That's a theme I like and that's a theme I'm going to invest in. That's a thematic type investment and that does address climate change. The fourth strategy is just to touch on it but doesn't apply to most investors is what's called impact first.

Impact first is when an investor says look, what really matters to me is addressing climate change. I'd like to get a financial return. I wouldn't mind getting my money back. I don't expect to get a market risk adjuster. I'm willing to take additional risk. I'm willing to accept a lower return. That's impact first. The most famous impact first investor today is Bill Gates. Now, Bill Gates' pensive advantage of having very deep pockets, and he can take that additional risk and if it doesn't work out, it's not going to affect his lifestyle. But any investor can be an impact pensive investor. You just have to be aware that this is additional risk, and you shouldn't expect market returns.

Maria Gallagher: It's really fascinating. So Alyce and I both focus in the ESG space and I feel like what we've noticed, at least in the past 5, 10 years, is it's really shifted to now talking about sustainability as table stakes for companies. Most companies have sustainability reports. Most companies say they want to be net zero. Sometimes they report on their own, sometimes they report with different initiatives. How do you think about being critical when you're looking at individual companies or thinking about the space because so much of it now is just filler words that a lot of companies are saying because it sounds good, and it's what everyone else is doing. How do you think about companies in that way?

Bruce Usher: So first of all, let's understand what the problem. The problem here is there are no regulations around sustainability reporting. Put a mindset, imagine there were no regulation amount finance reporting. You could have put anything you want, the 10-K, 10-Q financials and just go ahead. Whatever you think the investors should know, put it out there. Well, we would have an insane cacophony of financial information. It would be really hard to compare, and we'd have a lot of exaggeration. Well, that's where we are on the sustainability situation today. There are no regulation. Now the SEC is considering regulating it, but it hasn't yet, and we don't know if that's going to happen. As a result, companies are trying to report, make themselves look the best they can. I don't think that's unreasonable, but it creates a lot of problems for investors. So what's the advice that I would have for investors? Number one advice, be aware of green-washing.

Companies that green-wash, made it a short-term gain, but in the long run, that almost always turns out to be a bad plan. I think companies green-wash for one of two reasons. Either because they intentionally green-wash, they know what they're saying isn't true and they just trying to look better, and I think that's a very bad outcome for everyone, including the planet. Then they come and say accidentally green washed. What do I mean by accidental? What I mean is these net-zero goals these companies are setting, many companies, through my research, these goals are real. They are real because these companies recognize that the world is going to decarbonize over the next several decades. They recognize the trends are underpinning this.

This is not a moment, a political moment or a consumer-driven moment. This is a moment driven frankly by physics of climate change. It's not a moment. It's going to be this way for the next several decades. Any company that's got management who thinks long-term, understands decarbonization is going to change their business, and it's going to change virtually every business in the world today. It is the big macro trend to the future. If you're sitting there, and you see that macro trend, you go, OK, we have to decarbonize. What the scientists tell us is we got to get to zero. How do we do that? We'll put in place a plan and one way to put up a plan is to have a goal. Without a goal, you don't know what you're shooting for. These net-zero goals, I believe in many cases are real.

The problem is, many companies are setting them without a clear idea, a clear path on how they're actually going to achieve it. This is where the accidental green-washing comes in. They want to achieve these goals. They believe it's actually necessary for business perspective to achieve these goals. But they may be mistaken in terms of their ability to reach these goals and the timelines and the costs of doing so. Then when that tension shows up, say it's too costly, then they're going to find themselves in a green-washing situation. As an investor, you don't want to be back in that kind of company either.

Designed as a wagon-like crossover, it’s more akin to a car-based station wagon than it is a car-based SUV. And that means it’s a wonderful drive.

There are some downsides to the 2022 Kia EV6, the primary one being that its wagon-like design means less cargo space. It’s real-world range also depends heavily on driving style and some of the advanced features are a little shaky, but this new-generation electric vehicle is definitely one of the better ones we’ve driven thus far.



At a Glance

Strong styling for any segment

Excellent drive dynamic and feel

Not as spacious as some options in the segment

Real-world driving range greatly dependent on driving style

Excellent entry into the midsized market

The EV6's driver controls are obvious and easy to use. What appears to be one long screen on the dash is actually two screens, one for the driver's instrument cluster and the other for infotainment Aaron Turpen / New Atlas

There’s no getting past the fact that the new Kia EV6 is one of the best-looking vehicles on today’s market. With pronounced front fenders, a strong set of body lines, and a sleek hatchback, the EV6 has lines and curves that demand attention without being narcissistic.

There are four trim levels and two powertrain setups available. The first is a rear-mounted electric motor that produces 167 horsepower (124.5 kW) to the rear axle, with a 58-kWh battery pack giving it an EPA-estimated range of 232 miles (373 km) per full charge. The other option, which is standard on all trims above the base model, is a 225-hp (167.8-kW) motor on that rear axle and a 77.4-kWh battery pack with an EPA range of 310 miles (499 km) per full charge.

With the latter motor, the system can be upgraded to all-wheel drive, adding a motor to the front axle for a combined 320 hp (238.5 kW). The battery size remains the same, but EPA estimates drop to 274 miles (441 km) with the AWD added.

Our real world experience, however, didn’t find those EPA estimates to be accurate for the AWD model we drove. Our driving and highway test loops returned only about 255 miles (410 km) of total range available. Some of this was likely due to the heavier highway usage (over 55 mph/88.5km/h) we had versus the EPA’s official test. We achieved about 31.2 kWh of usage per 100 miles of driving, or about 10 percent range loss versus the EPA’s estimations. That’s typical of most EVs we’ve driven where highway mileage was a bigger factor.

Worth noting is that the 2022 Kia EV6 is compatible with the latest in DC fast chargers putting out 350 kW. Which means the next-generation fast chargers now finding their way to stations around the US will be an option for EV6 drivers. For home charging, we have a 50-A level 2 service offering up to 40-A delivery. The EV6 charges in about 6.5 hours from that, taking 80 percent of its battery capability in the first four hours of charge time. And it should also be pointed out that Kia has a 10-year warranty on both the drivetrain and the battery here, so range loss worries and battery bricking concerns are covered.

Besides its exterior looks, though, the best attributes of the Kia EV6 are its interior experience and drive quality. There’s comfortable seating for four and available seating for five. Like most midsized or smaller vehicles, the middle portion of the rear seat is not the most comfortable spot in the car. Headroom and legroom are good as well. The lack of a center hump, since there is no driveshaft, means the middle seat is better than most.

Although a crossover by chassis design, the 2022 Kia EV6 is more station wagon than SUV Aaron Turpen / New Atlas

Technology in the 2022 EV6 is good, though not as top shelf as what might be found in some luxury brands. The infotainment screen is of good size and easy to operate, but some of the driver’s aids are a little jumpy at times – especially adaptive cruise, which often slows down unnecessarily and takes a while to realize it can speed up again.

Driving the EV6 is a wonderful experience. It handles nicely, is perfectly balanced, and offers a lot of power whenever it’s requested. Like all EVs, the Kia EV6 can deliver full torque at any time, which means acceleration is phenomenal. Using the (driver toggled) battery-replenishing slowdown option means adding more juice with less braking as well. Every drive metric in the EV6 is near to that of a sports car, but without the jostling suspension and loud road noise normally associated with those vehicles.

In total, we found the 2022 Kia EV6 to be a wonderful entry into the expanding electric vehicle market and believe it’s competitive even with the internal combustion engine options it competes with. This is a solid, well-designed, and good-looking car. We’d pit it against the Ford Mustang Mach-E or the Volkswagen ID.4 as a top contender.

More and more EVs are coming equipped with either V2L (vehicle to load) or V2G (vehicle to grid) capability. This allows EVs to act as a rolling generator, able to power appliances, a home, or shore up the grid itself. Hyundai is using this capability to showcase how its Ioniq 5 EV can power a vacation rental . And if you’re in the UK, you can book a stay there to experience it.



Called Hotel Hyundai, the idea for this EV-powered getaway was inspired by market research that showed sustainability is important to people to people in the UK. They’re also looking for both cheaper and environmentally sustainable travel options and prefer to take a vacation within the UK versus traveling internationally . So Hyundai set up a site in Essex, curated by British broadcaster and critic Grace Dent. The hotel site is made up of three key areas: the main guest suite, the restaurant/bar and an outside cinema area. Each site gets its own Ioniq 5 to plug into for power .

The guest suite has an Ioniq 5 that powers everything from the lights to the appliances.

The restaurant/bar continues the sustainability theme by having a menu of food and drinks that are locally sourced. There’s even an espresso machine that’ s powered by the Ioniq.

The cinema area is a spot where guests can end their evening. The film projector, speakers, and even the popcorn machine are all powered by the Ioniq 5. All this is made possible by the Ioniq 5’s V2L capability.

The IONIQ 5 is able to power the hotel and its experiences using its V2L feature that supplies AC power (230V/50Hz) up to a maximum of 3.6kW (or 15 Amps) power consumption. An adapter from the car provides a socket into which standard domestic appliances can be plugged into.

Guests can book a stay up to 14 nights or enter a chance to win a stay at the hotel.

It’s impressive that all the power for this is coming from the vehicles themselves. But I need something answered: where the hell is the power coming from that charges up the Ioniqs ? Vehicle-to-load tech lets the EV power homes and devices. I get that. But the car’s batteries are a finite power source, and Hyundai doesn’t explain how long each car’s battery lasts, or what the procedure is for swapping in a fresh vehicle.

Until then, appreciate the fact that it’s possible to have a vacation powered purely by EVs.

269,400-mile GMC Sierra EV crab walks into the spotlight looking dashing,https://assets.newatlas.com/dims4/default/0a8285c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1011x531+0+40/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fd9%2F81f1cf5a47b994d137be041739c0%2Fscreen-shot-2022-10-21-at-4.06.38%20PM.png&na.image_optimisation=0,22/10/2022,"After the introduction of the GMC Hummer siblings and the Chevrolet Silverado EV, it was only a matter of time before the GMC Sierra EV popped up.

The sharp-looking electric Sierra debuted this week with a potent 754-hp electric 4WD. The impressive Denali Edition 1 gets rear wheel-steering, crab-walking athleticism and MidGate-driven expandable bed versatility to meet the needs of all kinds of pickup drivers. At over US$100,000, the first edition prices into Hummer territory, but the electric Sierra family will eventually grow to include a base model priced under half that.

For now, GMC is focusing in on the flagship Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 that will be the first of the family to launch in 2024. It mentioned the down-line AT4 and Elevation trims during the debut but only to show a few select interior and exterior photos and confirm that those models will emerge for MY2025.

No matter which Sierra EV exterior trim we're zooming in on, the new truck strikes us as the most attractive major electric production pickup yet. The Sierra EV sticks more closely to the ICE styling template, unlike the drastically reimagined Silverado EV. The boomerang headlamps on the broad, upright Sierra EV front-end are similar to the ones on the ICE truck, albeit part of simplified lighting clusters. The large grille shares the ICE truck grille's general shape but gets filled out by a solid, boldly ""GMC""-badged panel rather than metal mesh.

We don't love the lower mini-grille grate, but beyond that, we think GMC has nailed the Sierra EV styling, giving a truck that looks as high-tech as an EV and as rugged as a traditional full-size pickup truck General Motors

Instead of copying and pasting the standard Sierra flanks onto the EV version, GMC designers create a slightly new look that feels just as stout and strong. The sturdy, level belt line teams with the lower checkmark-like definition dropping down and back from the front fender to create a rugged, powerful aesthetic. The upright rear cab wall completes a silhouette that looks the part of a full-size workhorse.

As on the Silverado EV, the Sierra EV's bed measures in just under 6 feet (1.8 m), a 'tweener for a full-size Sierra, which traditionally has bed options of 5.5- and 6.5-foot (1.7- and 2-m). That doesn't mean that the truck offers less than 6 feet for hauling cargo, though. GMC follows Chevy in adding in an adaptable MultiPro Midgate and 60/40-folding second-row crew cab seats to extend bed length in partnership with a MultiPro Tailgate. That gives owners the ability to create 9 feet (2.7 m) of cargo-swallowing bed floor length with the tailgate closed or 10.8 feet (3.3 m) with it open.

With its MultiPro Midgate and MultiPro Tailgate, the Sierra EV's bed expands from just under 6 feet to just under 11 feet, carrying oversized gear like kayaks, canoes or surfboards General Motors

The multi-positional bed/cab design can even seat a rear passenger on one side and pass-through cargo on the other. An optional tonneau cover adds lockable security over the load, and the front ""eTrunk"" provides another capacious lockable cargo space complete with dual floor drains and a 120-V outlet.

The Denali Edition 1 gets near-Hummer levels of power, promising up to 754 hp and 785 lb-ft via a front/rear-motor e4WD electric drive. Those output numbers come when the driver punches it into ""Max Power"" mode, but for the average commute or work task, he or she will likely want to dial it back and drive more economically toward the estimated 400-mile (644-km) range. Max Power mode also opens up an estimated 0-60 mph (96.5 km/h) just under 4.5 seconds.

The GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 offers 9,500 lb of towing and trailering-capable Super Cruise automated driving tech General Motors

Like the Silverado EV launch edition, the Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 has standard four-wheel steering. It also gets the CrabWalk capability made famous by the Hummer EV. The air ride adaptive suspension lets drivers adjust height by up to 2 inches (5 cm) and creates a plush ride through the gamut of under-tire conditions any good truck will encounter.

The Edition 1 also comes loaded with SuperCruise driver assistance for hands-free autonomy, with or without a trailer in tow. The feature is supported on more than 400,000 miles of US and Canadian roads. Max towing is rated at 9,500 lb (4,309 kg), just shy of the Silverado EV's 10,000 lb (4,535 kg), while max payload settles in at the same modest 1,300 lb (590 kg).

GMC says the Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 will be able to suck in 100 miles of battery power in just 10 minutes using public DC fast-charging General Motors

GMC says that the Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 can charge 100 miles (161 km) worth of battery power in about 10 minutes using its 350-kW 800V fast-charging capability. Available power export options let the truck send out 10.2 kW of power via 10 onboard outlets for powering work tools, charging electronics, running camping equipment, and even charging a separate electric vehicle out in the field away from the grid. When properly equipped with Ultium truck and home add-ons, GM estimates that the battery-packed Sierra can supply a home's electrical needs for up to 21 days, serving the role of backup generator.

A near-17-in infotainment touchscreen basically is the Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 center console General Motors

The Denali Edition 1 has a high-spec interior below a panoramic glass roof that includes open-pore wood trim, aluminum accents and quilted seats. A huge 16.8-in tablet-style infotainment display stands tall on the center console, while a fully configurable 11-in digital instrument panel and 14-in-view multi-color head-up display keep critical info directly in the driver's view. GM's Ultifi software platform promises OTA updates and feature additions.

The $107,000 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 can be reserved now, but deliveries won't begin until early 2024. The AT4 and Elevation models will follow for the 2025 model year, and lineup prices will start around $50,000 ...after plenty of that fancy tech and equipment disappears off the standard features list. Both prices are before destination charge, which prices in at $1,695 as of today.

The future GMC Sierra EV family: 2025 GMC Sierra EV Elevation, 2025 GMC Sierra EV AT4, 2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 (left to right) General Motors

Sierra EV trucks will be assembled from domestic and global components at both the Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck and Lake Orion assembly facilities in Michigan. GMC is saving the details on the lower-tier trims for a future announcement closer to production start.

But it appears that the popularity of old bangers is set to soar instead, thanks to supply chain issues and disruption partly caused by the pandemic.

A record number of ageing vehicles are expected to be on the road in the next five years, new analysis by Auto Trader has revealed.

By 2027 around 15.4 million cars on Britain’s roads will be at least 10 years old, the automotive advertising company says, representing an increase of 3.6 million from 2021.

It attributed the increase to disruption to new car production since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

Shortages of semiconductors and other parts have left two million older cars on the road compared with pre-virus trends.

This has pushed up the average asking price for 10-year-old cars on Auto Trader by £2,000 to £6,176 since 2019.

The BMW 3 Series, Volkswagen Golf and Ford Fiesta are the most popular decade-old models among potential buyers.

An eleven-year-old two-litre BMW 3 series can still be found on Auto Trader for around £3,000 while a 1.4 litre Ford Fiesta from the same year can be picked up for a similar amount.

Ian Plummer, Auto Trader director, said: “The aftermath of Covid means that around 40 per cent of cars on the road will be more than 10 years old in five years’ time.

“The sheer shortage of cars, combined with the practical necessity for drivers to stay on the road, is pushing prices higher.

“As long as those market dynamics remain in place, drivers will have to get used to paying more for older cars.”

From 2030, the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in the UK, but the sale of some hybrid cars will be allowed to continue until 2035.

The ban only affects the sale of new vehicles so people will still be able to buy and sell used petrol or diesel cars after 2030. Diesel vans and other vehicles will be banned from 2030.

The impact of the ban could potentially mean that even more people continue to use and trade older vehicles to avoid paying for more expensive new electric vehicles.",electric vehicles,telegraph.co.uk

EVs, carmakers and their battery partners are planning to install 5.8 terawatt-hours of battery production capacity by 2030, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence and the manufacturers.

Tesla outlined a Battery plan to build 20 million EVs in 2030 using an estimated 3 terawatt-hours of batteries. However, this has been updated where Tesla plans to develop its own batteries to 1 TWh/year in the US alone and use terawatts hours of batteries from suppliers like CATL.

Every 10 million cars per year (50 kwh packs) needs 500 GWh/year of batteries.

Sourcing from CATL and others. Tesla could have enough batteries for 20 million cars by 2025. The number of electric cars that Tesla could produce would increase when they introduce the $30k car with double the production, lower weight and probably a 25 kwh battery pack.

European battery capacity will rise to over 700 GWh by 2025 and over 1.4 TWh by 2030.

CATL, SVolt, CALB, BYD, Gotion targeting a combined 1.8 TWh/year of batteries by 2025. European, US and other makers ramping too. The battery production of auto makers overlaps with their battery company partners.

By 2025, CALB’s production capacity is expected to exceed 500 GWh/year, with an annual production capacity of 1 TWh by 2030.

SVOLT was targeting 600 GWh/year by 2025.

CATL was targeting 1200 GWh/year by 2025.

Energy Storage news reports that Tesla has a target of at least 1500 GWH (1.5 TWH) of energy storage deployment by 2030.

Lithium ion batteries will probably get to around 10 TWh per year by 2030

Lithium Ion Battery capacity was expected to increase to increase more than threefold to 2.8 TWh in 2025 from 0.8 TWh in 2021, with the potential to surpass 5.9 TWh in 2030.

Germany’s Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), targets over $100 billion to build out its global EV portfolio. VW will add new battery “gigafactories” in Europe and North America and lock up supplies of key raw materials.

Toyota is investing $70 billion to electrify vehicles and produce more batteries, and expects to sell at least 3.5 million battery electric models (BEVs) in 2030.

Ford now plans to spend at least $50 billion – and at least 240 gigawatt-hours of battery capacity with its partners as it aims to produce around 3 million BEVs in 2030 – half its total volume.

Mercedes-Benz will spend at least $47 billion for EV development and production, nearly two-thirds of that to boost its global battery capacity with partners to more than 200 gigawatt-hours.

BMW, Stellantis and General Motors (GM.N) each plan to spend at least $35 billion on EVs and batteries, with Stellantis laying out the most aggressive battery program: A planned 400 gigawatt-hours of capacity with partners by 2030, including four plants in North America.",electric vehicles,next big future
273,Electric cars in Germany may fall victim to the energy crisis – Der Spiegel,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.10/article/63529c9485f54051e42d466c.jpg,22/10/2022,"Electric cars may lose out to combustion-driven vehicles in Germany amid the current energy crisis, Der Spiegel reports Read Full Article at RT.com",https://www.rt.com/business/565101-electric-cars-germany-crisis/,"Internal combustion engines might now be more economical than electric alternatives

The current energy crisis in Europe could put the brakes on electric mobility in Germany and make e-vehicles unattractive to potential customers, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.

With electricity getting ever more expensive, charging an e-vehicle is sometimes pricier than filling up a petrol or diesel vehicle, the newspaper writes. The combustion engine is more than €30 cheaper per month on average with a mileage of 15,000 kilometers, the publications writes. By the end of next year, an e-car should “clearly be at a disadvantage,” Der Spiegel quotes Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer from the Center for Automotive Research as saying.

The state bonuses for buying electric vehicles were also reduced by 25%. With an almost a year-long wait for an ordered electric car to arrive, the buyer will get a smaller bonus than they were expecting, the outlet writes, adding that there’s no longer any state subsidy for hybrid cars.

In the current climate, consumers may have little desire to buy a new car. The situation was described as a “toxic mixture of energy crisis and inflation” by Sabine Jaskula from ZF, Germany’s second largest car systems supplier. Electric car production will collapse in Europe next year, she predicts, as only 11 million cars could roll off the assembly line across the industry instead of the planned 18 million.

Another ZF representative described the EU plans to stop selling petrol and diesel cars by 2035 as “illusory.”

There’s also a shortage of public charging stations across Germany, according to Der Spiegel. In some metropolitan areas, a single station has to be shared between as many as 60 vehicles, and a large-scale station refurbishment is needed to provide enough charging spaces for everyone.

According to veteran battery car dealer Wolf Warncke, “There is a risk that prospective buyers will turn their backs on e-mobility.”

In just over 2 years it has sold close to a million units in China. The Mini EV is very popular in the 2nd and 3rd tier Chinese cities and is enabling people who would not have been able to afford a car to be able to get a decent affordable vehicle. Starting at just $4 200, the Mini EV’s appeal to non-consumers or the market not traditionally targeted by automakers has a real potential to disrupt the auto industry. The success of the Hongguang Mini EV shows that there is a huge market for these basic EVs.

It was not surprising then that several mini EVs started to pop up everywhere from other automakers and you can see that they didn’t try to hide the fact that they were inspired by the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV. Quite a few of them have similar specs and look like the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV. Before the LFP battery powered mini EVs became a thing, a few years ago, lead acid battery powered Low Speed Electric Vehicles (LSEV) were the biggest thing in those cities and villages in China.

China’s LSEV market has probably set a precedent for the type of disruptive innovation we are seeing from the mini EVs. These LSEVs vehicles have been quite popular in small towns and in rural areas in China. They are quite an upgrade from bicycles, e-bikes, and motorcycles, as they protect drivers from the elements and generally cost less than $3000. Over 5 million of these LSEVs that generally come with lead acid batteries have been sold in China. These are some of the small vehicles you can get on Alibaba. Now for just about $1000 more, people can get better quality, faster, more powerful city EVs with longer lasting LFP batteries. Some of the big players in LSEV segment, such as Levdeo, are now joining the mini EV race. Levdeo has introduced the Letin Mango in this mini EV segment.

LSEVs are now starting to find their way to some African cities. There have been some available in some West African countries where it was pretty straightforward to introduce them in that region as they drive on the same side as China. It has been a challenge to bring some of them to East and Southern African markets where we drive on the other side of the road. In Zimbabwe, the EV Centre, which is also the official distributor of BYD vehicles in Zimbabwe, has just introduced the Derry Auto V7 LSEV to the Zimbabwean market in right-hand drive. This move is in a bid to offer a wider range of electric vehicles to cater for people with different incomes.

The Derry Auto V7 LSEV is manufactured in China by Henan Derry Energy Automobile Co, LTD. It is a 5-door small EV that seats 4 quite comfortably and has the following specs:

Drive Motor: 10kW (Peak)

Battery Pack: 10,8 kW (LFP)

Solar Panel on Roof: 300W

Maximum Speed: 60km/h

Real world range: To be confirmed. Planning to take it for a range test soon

The Derry Auto V7 is available in Zimbabwe in several colors. Multiple units have just landed, and final pricing will be confirmed.

The larger modern day electric vehicles are still quite pricey compared to their equivalent ICE vehicles when it comes to the upfront purchase price. Although EVs win when it comes to total cost of ownership, the upfront purchase price is still one of the main considerations for consumers. A recent survey in South Africa highlights this. These small low speed electric vehicles which are more affordable could potentially find a market and use cases in a number of areas.

Driving schools, high school and college students, logistics industry and last mile delivery sector, recent graduates and early career professionals are some of the target groups. The average daily commute distance in the large urban centers is around 15 km, as cited in Zimbabwe’s Transport Master Plan. The speed limit in most urban areas in Zimbabwe is 60km/h. The roads in the urban centers are getting increasingly congested and therefore drivers spend a lot of time in slow moving traffic. These LSEVs could be quite usual in urban centers. Will they become as fashionable as they were in China some years back? We will find out in the near future.

So, are fleets the answer? A recent note from AVERE suggests that the decarbonization of fleet vehicle purchases may accelerate the availability of used electric vehicles in the European market.

“The European Association for Electromobility (AVERE) is the association that promotes electromobility and sustainable transport across Europe. Their members consist of companies, research institutions, and national associations supporting and encouraging the use of electric vehicles and electromobility across Europe. They currently have more than 50 active members, including from some of the most successful EV countries, like Norway, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium.

“Within these Associations, there are more than 2,600 industry members, ranging from SME’s, OEMs, and other companies with a commercial interest in electromobility and more than 150,000+ EV users.”

They are currently supporting the European Commission’s commitment to introducing regulation in 2023 for the decarbonisation of corporate fleets.

“Corporate fleets today account for an estimated 63% of new vehicle sales in the EU. They drive, on average, 2.25 times more mileage than privately owned cars, thus accounting for a disproportionate share of emissions. Moreover, corporate cars often quickly enter the second-hand market and become private after 36–48 months.

“They are, therefore, the main driver in bringing affordable second-hand EVs to the market, particularly in Eastern and Southeastern Member States, which, at this stage, remain at an earlier stage of EV market development.”

AVERE believes that regulation by the EU is the most appropriate legal instrument to achieve their goals of 100% new zero-emissions vehicles by 2030, a fully decarbonised European road transport by 2050, and making Europe a world leader in electromobility. This regulation will address the vehicles most driven, and thus the most polluting, first. It will have the secondary effect of making EVs affordable to consumers.

The EU has a planned 2035 phaseout of the sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Many member states have much earlier cutoffs.

AVERE Secretary-General Philippe Vangeel says: “Supplementing the strengthened CO2 standards and the 2035 phase-out of internal combustion engines, the planned proposal on fleets is a win-win and no-regrets solution.

“It will help carmakers by guaranteeing demand for their EVs, our climate by addressing the vehicles with the highest decarbonisation impact, and consumers by making affordable EVs available across the EU and stimulating a flourishing market for used cars. We look forward to working with the Commission on how the proposal could be shaped and enforced in detail.”

In the UK, the reduction in the Benefit in Kind tax has encouraged a transition towards EVs for those who access a vehicle as part of their employment package. In Australia, the federal government is in the process of implementing a similar program with our Fringe Benefits Tax.

Are EV fleets the answer? Possibly. At least, they will form part of the solution to decarbonising road transport.

276,Canadian minister in Washington: We need to decouple from China,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6625614.1666385073!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/champagne-dc.jpg,22/10/2022,A Canadian cabinet minister arrived in Washington with a message: We need to decouple from China. He made a pitch for U.S. investment in Canadian mineral projects to lessen reliance on Beijing for the industrial inputs that increasingly power our economy.,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/champagne-china-us-canada-1.6625546,"This item is part of Watching Washington, a regular dispatch from CBC News correspondents reporting on U.S. politics and developments that affect Canadians.

What's new

Canada's industry minister was in Washington making a pitch for projects north of the border to access U.S. federal funding for critical minerals.

François-Philippe Champagne's trip came after the U.S. passed several bills offering large sums of money for green energy and other high-tech projects.

They include hundreds of millions for President Joe Biden to steer to certain projects under the U.S. Defense Production Act.

As a legal member of the U.S. industrial base, and home to several of the critical minerals that power electric batteries, Canada is hoping some cross-border projects might qualify.

""Yes there are sums in these acts which Canadian companies can tap into,"" Champagne, the innovation, science and industry minister, told reporters Friday at the Canadian embassy in Washington.

""That's what we're going to be working (on) with Canadian industry. To be embedded in these very important initiatives.""

He was speaking at the tail end of a trip where he met his U.S. counterpart, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, the head of NASA, Bill Nelson, and spoke to a business audience.

What's the context

The context is the rivalry with China and Russia. Washington is increasingly unnerved about being dependent on its greatest geopolitical foe, China, for minerals that power the economy: phones, computers, clean technology and electric vehicles.

China dominates the market and once cut off Japan's access to those vital industrial inputs. Just as Russia has now cut off Europe from exports of home-heating gas.

The U.S. is now working to decouple its high-tech economy from China's and j ust restricted exports of advanced computer chips to that country; the U.S. has set out broad strategies for breaking its dependence on Chinese goods.

Champagne said countries that share similar values should be leaning on each other more and leaning less on rivals including China.

""What we want is certainly a decoupling: certainly from China, and I would say other regimes in the world which don't share the same values,"" he told a panel hosted by the Canadian American Business Council.

""People want to trade with people who, really, share the same values.""

WATCH | The future of Canada's supply chains:

'Resiliency' is key to future of supply chains, says Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne Duration 1:09 Champagne told reporters after meetings in Washington that Canada will play a key role in the future of cross-border supply chains with the U.S.

Canadian Deputy Minister Chrystia Freeland this month gave a speech in Washington on a similar theme, arguing for so-called friend-shoring: she said democracies should tighten their economic, and military, bonds and rely on each other more for trade.

Champagne called this a once-in-a-generation chance to rewrite supply chains, as the world shifts toward electric vehicles and toward trading more with reliable allies.

He cited examples of how Canada fits in.

For example, he said he envisions a future where New York State and Quebec form a semiconductor corridor, similar to the auto-production corridor in Windsor and Detroit: as Detroit's Big Three move parts between their plants on either side, he said, an IBM could move computer components to plants back and forth.

He also noted Canadian spending on a critical mineral plant in Quebec : Champagne said the titanium produced there will benefit the U.S. military.

During his trip, Champagne also received blowback for two bills currently in Parliament, his government's bills C-18 and C-11 .

They would require big Internet platforms to compensate Canadian news organizations for content they run, and give the CRTC new power over online content.

A director at a large U.S. business lobby group, Abel Torres at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told Champagne the bills discriminate against U.S. websites; violate trade commitments; contradict the principles of an open internet; and give companies little guidance about how Canadian regulators intend to use their new powers.

""We feel these measures are a step in the wrong direction,"" he told Champagne during the business panel Friday.

WATCH | What is the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act?

U.S. Senate passes Inflation Reduction Act Duration 2:16 The U.S. Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act — a legacy-shaping bill for the administration of President Joe Biden, that includes $369 billion US in clean energy investments as well as provisions that will lower the cost of prescription drugs and increase taxes on large corporations.

What's next

Canada has increasingly secured a spot in the new supply chains for zero-emission vehicles: companies have announced new plants and the just-passed U.S. omnibus bill defined cars in Canada as eligible for a domestic tax credit for electric vehicles.

But the fine print on that so-called Inflation Reduction Act has yet to be released. Also lacking: specifics on which projects will get access to funds under the Defense Production Act.

Car companies have complained that so few models will qualify for the electric-vehicle tax credit as to render it meaningless: companies say there just aren't enough minerals and batteries produced in friendly countries to be eligible for the credits as designed.

We should have more clarity in the coming months about how the tax credits will work.",electric vehicles,cbc news
277,"Car Owners In Canada Shockingly Quoted As Much As $23,000 For Hybrid And EV Battery Replacements",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2011-Lincoln-MKZ-Hybrid-001.jpg,22/10/2022,"In the case of two Ontario residents, the price of the battery replacement service was about as much as the value of their car.",https://www.carscoops.com/2022/10/car-owners-in-canada-shockingly-quoted-as-much-as-23000-for-hybrid-and-ev-battery-replacements/,"As electrified vehicles begin to flood the market, more and more people are finding out about the extremely high costs involved with replacing the battery. The latest of these incidents comes from Canadian EV and hybrid owners, whose vehicle repair costs have left them in shock.

The first case of this happening was with Phyllis Lau from Ontario, whose 2018 Kia Soul EV was in need of a battery replacement. After factoring in labor and tax in addition to the price of the battery itself, Lau was quoted around $23,000 CAD ($16,872 USD) for the service. Lau’s family told CTV News they had an 8-year/160,000 km (99,419 mi) battery warranty, but since their vehicle has racked up over 170,000 km (105,633 mi), they were no longer covered for the replacement. Even after some negotiating, the best the dealership said they could do was cover half the cost of the battery.

Another resident of Ontario who spoke to CTV News, Ken Edwardson, was quoted $20,000 CAD ($14,672 USD) for the battery replacement on his 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, $15,000 CAD ($11,004 USD) of which was just for the cost of the battery alone. That especially stuck out to us, since Edwardson’s car wasn’t even fully electric like Lau’s. That being said, this isn’t the first time that owners of older hybrids are finding out the ridiculous cost of battery replacement, as back in August a Chevy Volt owner was quoted $30,000 USD ($40,895 CAD) to replace the battery in their hybrid vehicle.

All of this opens up a bigger conversation about the lifespan of batteries in hybrids and full-electric vehicles. For those looking to purchase older electrified vehicles, the health of the battery now becomes a major point of concern, just as much as the engine would on a traditional ICE car. On the opposite end of the spectrum, it’s now in manufacturers’ best interest to start researching technologies that will afford batteries with better longevity for the hybrids and EVs of the future.

While we are already there to a degree with better battery technology in the industry than we’ve ever had before, these stories will hopefully serve as a warning to automakers in the years to come as we head into an age of electrification.",electric vehicles,carscoops

The week’s EV news flow was headlined by market leader Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA earnings report.

Here are the key events to bring EV investors up to date:

Tesla’s Present Tense, Future Perfect: Tesla’s third-quarter revenue and automotive gross margin came in shy of estimates, generating negative sentiment toward the stock.

CEO Elon Musk sounded upbeat on the earnings call. He suggested the fourth quarter will likely be “epic.” The Semi launch event will be held on Dec. 1, the billionaire confirmed. The company targets scaling up Semi manufacturing to 50,000 by 2024.

Tesla shared on its official Twitter account a link to vote for supercharger locations, and those with a Tesla account can cast their votes. The company said that in every three-month voting cycle, voters can cast multiple votes to help it decide on new locations for its superchargers.

Tulipshare, a retail shareholder platform, called upon Tesla to link executive pay to environmental, social and governance factors, Reuters reported. The group said it plans to submit a shareholder resolution on the matter during the EV maker’s annual meeting of stockholders in 2023. So far, CEO Musk’s compensation is tied to the company’s financial performance.

With the Twitter, Inc. TWTR deal deadline approaching, analysts, including Gary Black of Future Fund, expect Musk to offload more Tesla shares next week. Black predicts a rally in Tesla shares once the Twitter deal overhang lifts.

GM’s Cadillac Unveils $300,000 EV: General Motors Corporation’s GM Cadillac announced an ultra-luxury EV named Celestiq priced at a whopping $300,000-plus, which would go into production by the end of next year. Not many are confident that there will be takers for the pricier car and began drawing parallels with Apple, Inc.'s AAPL now-defunct 18K Gold Apple Watch Edition.

Automakers To Double Spending? Spending on EVs as well as batteries and battery materials is expected increase to $1.2 trillion through 2030, Reuters reported, citing public data and projections released by automakers.

Automakers are looking to build 54 million battery EVs by the same time frame, accounting for about 50% of total vehicle production, the report said.

Rivian Almost Through With Fixing Recalled Vehicles: Rivian Automotive, Inc. RIVN CEO R.J. Scaringe said at a TechCrunch conference that the company has fixed a significant majority of the more than 12,000 vehicles that it recalled this month.

The recall was initiated to fix a loose fastener connecting the front upper control arm and the steering knuckle.

He also suggested that Rivian is excited about the e-bike space. The CEO suggested it is going to play an important role in transportation, both for the movement of goods for commercial purposes and also for the movement of people.

Canoo’s Order Book Abounds: Canoo Inc. GOEV announced a binding order for 9,300 EVs from Kingbee, a van rental provider, with an option to increase to 18,600 vehicles. Kingbee will upfit, wrap and deliver Canoo vehicles as work-ready fleets solutions for enterprise and small- and medium-size business customers across the U.S.

It’s the historical capital of Upper Silesia, and today it has a population of around 127,000. Opole is the capital of Opole Voivodeship (that’s Polish for “province”) and the seat of Opole County. Even though it’s the smallest city in Poland, it’s still the largest city in its province. But its small size doesn’t mean they don’t have big dreams, and those dreams just got a little greener.

According to a recent press release, Opole’s public transport operator Miejski Zakład Komunikacyjny (aka “MZK”) just signed a contract with Solaris Bus & Coach to receive eight e-buses. This is great news for the environment and consistent with Opole’s investment in emission-less public transport vehicles. MZK’s e-buses in Opole are top of the line city buses that come with a wealth of features. The 12-meter bus can hold up to 75 passengers, 28 seated, while the articulated 18-meter bus will be able carry 110 people, 36 seated.

Opole’s buses come standard with features that include a passenger information system with voice announcements, electronic destination blinds, and a ticket vending machine. In addition, there will be USB charging ports and disinfectant dispensers mounted on handrails for the passengers’ comfort. Furthermore, air conditioning with a heat pump has been installed to ensure thermal comfort in both hot and cold weather.

They also come with some cool safety features. The air-conditioning unit will have UV technology to kill viruses. To ensure the driver and passengers are safe, there will be a Mobileye Shield+ system installed on the bus exterior with cameras to give the driver better visibility. The CMS (Collision Mitigation System) has been designed to automatically put the vehicle into braking mode if it detects head-on collision is likely.

The new buses will feature energy-efficient batteries and a central electric motor. They can be quickly charged during the day by lowered pantograph, or at night using a standard plug-in connection.

What’s more, the e-buses headed for Opole will have a preconditioning function during charging. This will not only lengthen the driving range, but also cut down on the time needed to start up the bus and reach an optimal temperature for passengers. They also have regenerative braking.

Solaris Bus & Coach first partnered with the city of Opole in 2019 when it placed an order for 10 low-floor Urbino 12 buses. In 2021, the partnership was extended to include zero-emission drives after the city ordered 5 e-buses along with charging infrastructure. After completion of the latest order, Opole will boast a fleet of 13 electric buses.

Solaris Bus & Coach has been one of the leading city bus manufacturers in Poland for over 19 years, supplying a total of over 7000 vehicles, including 550 e-buses.

281,TeraWatt Plans High Power Charging Corridor From Long Beach To El Paso,https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/10/terawatt-infrastructure-station.jpg,22/10/2022,Terawatt Infrastructure is planning a fast charging network from Long Beach to El Paso for electric heavy duty trucks.,https://cleantechnica.com/2022/10/22/terawatt-plans-high-power-charging-corridor-from-long-beach-to-el-paso/,"TeraWatt Infrastructure, the EV charging company started in May of 2021 by former Google energy strategist Neha Palmer, has raised a billion dollars from investors in its initial funding round. Now it has announced what it plans to do with some of that money. In a press release on October 20, it said it will “site, develop, and operate multiple charging centers for heavy duty electric trucks across the Interstate 10 highway. ”

Well, not all of Interstate 10, which stretches from Santa Monica in California to Jacksonville, Florida. What TeraWatt has in mind is providing charging plazas from the Port of Long Beach to El Paso that are focused on meeting the needs of long haul truckers, although any drivers in need of high power chargers will be welcome as well. The TeraWatt facilities, as shown in the graphic above, will feature pull-through charging bays that are able to accommodate tractor trailers (as well as families pulling boats and camping trailers).

“Long-haul trucking electrification represents a significant opportunity to reduce transportation sector emissions, but hinges on the rapid scale up of specialized charging infrastructure,” said TeraWatt CEO, Neha Palmer. “Our real estate and energy infrastructure development platform uniquely positions TeraWatt to solve the ‘charging problem’ for trucking operators, making freight electrification achievable within their operations.”

The TeraWatt Charging Centers along I-10 will be purpose-built to serve heavy duty and medium duty electric truck fleets and will featuring dozens of DC fast chargers, pull-through charging stalls, onsite driver amenities, and reliable operations including resiliency generation and zero carbon electricity options. TeraWatt will offer access to these sites both for the purposes of long-haul and local electric trucking operations, the company says.

The TeraWatt Charging Centers will be located approximately 150 miles apart to support the mileage range of commercially available electric trucks. Each site will range in size from four to 100 acres and will be located less than a mile from highway exits.

With TeraWatt, trucking companies have a dedicated partner to manage all operations related to charging infrastructure along the I-10 corridor. TeraWatt will operate and maintain its Charging Centers to the highest standards of reliability as well as incorporate advanced technology as commercially appropriate, such as renewable energy with battery back up and megawatt charging stations.

Electrive adds that the TeraWatt business model includes acquiring real estate in locations strategically relevant to fleets and plans to develop the energy and charging infrastructure required to operate commercial vehicles on a large scale. For the I-10 network, TeraWatt is banking on partnering with local and state governments and utilities and says it is planning to leverage various grants and incentives.

According to Palmer, part of TeraWatt’s strategy is to start the development process early enough to work with utilities from the beginning. “There will have to be a lot of collaboration between stakeholders, including grid owners, operators, utilities, regulators and end users, to ensure that the grid can evolve alongside the shift to electric transportation.”

The Takeaway

There aren’t all that many battery-electric heavy duty trucks on the road today, partly because the charging infrastructure to support them is lacking. It’s a chicken or egg situation, but clearly TeraWatt sees a business opportunity here. And its investors must agree, since they just ponied up a billion dollars to make this happen.

The funding and tax incentives made possible by Congress and the Biden administration are a big part of getting projects like this off the ground and moving forward — something for Americans to consider when they step inside the voting booth in a few weeks. Nothing like this will ever happen if the opposition party has its way.

Rivian anticipates a multimodal approach to transportation will be beneficial and that's why there isn't a single focus on just developing consumer EVs.

Rivian's ambitions related to e-bikes aren't necessarily new, as the company has had a rather busy 2022 in preparation for the future. In January, the company filed a patent related to e-bike manufacturing, with CEO RJ Scaringe implying e-bikes could have a major role.

Following the patent filing, Rivian recruited Chris Yu, former chief transformation & innovation officer at Specialized Bicycles, to become its VP of future programs.

Here is what Scaringe recently had to say to Electrek during TechCrunch Disrupt 2022:

""The e-bike space is something we're super excited about. We haven't announced anything or said anything there. But I do think it is going to play an increasingly important role for transportation, both in the movement of goods for commercial purposes, but also for the movement of people.""

In a similar manner to the disruptive nature of EVs in the auto industry, bike manufacturers also have noticed a greater interest in e-bikes. German luxury carmaker Porsche unveiled two e-bikes last year, while BMW also is working on e-bikes for customers. Automakers should find e-bike R&D to be easier than manufacturing EV cars and trucks, serving as another method to gain attention to their main product portfolios.

It's perfect timing as e-bike sales are increasing, with riders getting some fresh air and exercise, or e-bike commuting. Ideally, more people in urban areas will rely on e-bikes to help make short-distance deliveries, adding another possible customer base. The US market had 463,000 e-bike imports in 2020, though that drastically climbed up to 790,000 units imported in 2021 - and there is no shortage of e-bike models to choose from.",electric vehicles,tweaktown

Between launching four astronauts and 54 satellites into orbit, unveiling an electric freight truck and taking over Twitter this month, Elon Musk made time to offer unsolicited peace plans for Taiwan and Ukraine, antagonizing those countries’ leaders and irking Washington, too. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Musk, the richest man in the world, then irritated some Pentagon officials by announcing he didn’t want to keep paying for his private satellite service in Ukraine, before later walking back the threat.

As Musk, 51, inserts himself into volatile geopolitical issues, many Washington policymakers worry from the sidelines as he bypasses them.

A two-decade partnership between Musk and the federal government helped the United States return to global dominance in space and shift to electric cars, and made the tech geek an internationally famous CEO. But many in Washington, even as they praise his work in areas of national security, now see Musk as too powerful and too reckless.

Citing Musk’s public ridicule of those who snub him — the billionaire has called President Biden a “damp sock puppet” and said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) reminds him of “my friend’s angry mom” — many of the two dozen top government officials interviewed for this article would only speak about Musk on the condition of anonymity. But nearly all described him as being as erratic and arrogant as he is brilliant.

“Elon, The Everywhere” is what one White House official called him. “He believes he is such a gift to mankind that he doesn’t need any guardrails, that he knows best.”

“He sees himself as above the presidency,” said Jill Lepore, a Harvard historian who hosted podcasts on Musk.

On Oct. 27, Elon Musk completed his purchase of Twitter and began taking control of the social media company, firing several key executives. (Video: Jonathan Baran/The Washington Post)

Musk declined to comment for this story, but he says he weighs in on important problems and described his mission as “enhancing the future of humanity.” He said his Ukraine plan could avert possible nuclear war, and that his Taiwan proposal could ease dangerous regional tensions.

But Musk’s freelance diplomacy is angering allies at the same time he takes over a media platform with hundreds of millions of users.

“The bottom line is that people hang on his every word because he has delivered so many times,” said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.). “I hope he shows some respect for that responsibility.”

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called Musk’s plan for Ukraine an “affront” to its people, and even suggested federal subsidies that help makers of electric cars might be better spent.

Musk’s relationship with Washington started out strong. “I love you!” Musk blurted out when a NASA official called to tell him in 2008 that he got a $1.6 billion contract at a time when he was heavily in debt. Washington then poured billions more into Musk’s company as it developed its rockets and space capsule. SpaceX delivered, rebuilding the flagging U.S. space program.

His bipartisan efforts once helped him win over Washington. He dined with President Barack Obama and joined President Donald Trump’s economic councils. He donated to candidates of both parties. Now, he bashes Biden and says he plans to vote for a Republican president in 2024.

These days, the eccentric entrepreneur rarely visits Washington and is increasingly critical of the federal government. He does talk to foreign presidents and prime ministers, according to people who work directly with him. Musk sells his state-of-the-art rockets and aerospace technology to South Korea, Turkey and a growing list of other countries. He has Tesla factories in Germany and China. He also owns and controls more than 3,000 satellites circling the Earth — far more than any nation, including the United States.

In May, Brazilian officials said Musk met with Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing ultranationalist who lost his bid for reelection as president this week. Musk said he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin 18 months ago, but denied a report that he talked to Putin just before offering his Ukrainian peace plan that was widely condemned as pro-Russian.

Though Musk needs Washington less now that he is a global powerhouse, Washington continues to depend on him. The U.S. military uses his rockets and satellite communications services for its drones, ships and aircraft. NASA currently has no way to get American astronauts to the International Space Station without his space capsule. And, at a time when climate change is a top White House priority, he has more electric cars on U.S. roads than any other manufacturer.

Several top government officials said they are working on decreasing their reliance on Musk, including partnering with and nurturing competitors with government contracts and subsidies. “There’s not just SpaceX. There are other entities that we can certainly partner with when it comes to providing Ukraine what they need on the battlefield,” Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, told reporters last week.

A key concern now that Musk has completed his purchase of Twitter is his web of overseas holdings and foreign investors, including his massive Tesla factory in China, and possible leverage others could have over Musk now that he controls a platform where some users have spread misinformation and ratcheted up political divisiveness. As a U.S. defense contractor, Musk has been vetted, but several top officials said they wanted a more thorough review, including of any expansion plans in Russia and China. Warren and others have called his Twitter purchase a “danger to democracy.”

Washington has dealt before with powerful tycoons who dominated railroads, oil or a key economic sector, said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “But what’s a bit different here is Musk’s ability to project his political agenda and the fact that now that we have technology and media that allows individuals to essentially become their own network or channel,” Haass said.

Because Musk has business investments in China, and, according to Russian and other news reports, said last year at a Kremlin-sponsored event for students that he was planning one in Russia, several top U.S. government officials wonder if Musk’s business interests affect his views on foreign affairs.

The economic turmoil since the Ukraine war began has dented the fortunes of many people including Musk, whose personal wealth dropped by tens of billions, to about $210 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index.

Two people who know him well said Musk is impulsive and that makes him say things that harm his own interests — a tendency that makes it difficult for government officials to count on Musk. Musk himself has said he has Asperger’s, a form of autism, and no one should expect him to be a “chill, normal dude.”

“He shoots himself in the foot all the time. He should not be getting into politics,” said one person who has worked with him for years.

“I have been as shocked as anyone these last few months at some of the things he has waded into,” said Lori Garver, former deputy administrator at NASA. She worries about the consequences. SpaceX restored U.S. leadership in space, but his politically charged comments attract critics who are starting to ask, “Why is taxpayer money going to this billionaire?”

“It’s disappointing,” she said.

Shifting power

Musk set his sights on D.C. 20 years ago. A South African who moved to Silicon Valley, Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002 — the year he used his payment from the sale of PayPal, the electronic payment firm he helped found, to start SpaceX. It was a big risk, and he needed high-dollar government contracts to survive. In early 2003, Musk announced he would have a “significant presence” in the nation’s capital so that he could build a “close working relationship with the federal government.”

He invested in Tesla around the same time and soon took over running it, tapping into financial subsidies and tax credits Washington was offering to wean the country off gasoline. California alone gave Tesla $3.2 billion in subsidies, according to figures provided by the office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).

A review of public disclosure forms show that for brief periods of time, Musk hired dozens of lobbyists, many of them former staff members of powerful members of Congress. Rohan Patel, who worked on energy and transportation in the Obama White House, runs Tesla’s regulatory and legislative affairs in Washington.

SpaceX has spent more than $22 million to lobby Washington over the years, according to OpenSecrets, a research group tracking money in politics. Musk, himself, proved a savvy political operator. He flew into Washington 40 times between 2008 and 2013, according to flight records obtained by Musk biographer Ashlee Vance. He knocked on doors and invited officials to breakfast.

When backroom persuasion didn’t get results, he learned that publicity helps.

On a sunny Wednesday in June 2014, Musk parked his new “space taxi” a few blocks from Capitol Hill. He had hauled the capsule designed to carry seven astronauts into orbit across the country from his California factory and invited TV cameras, along with government officials, to check it out.

“Great job, Elon!” yelled Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican member of Congress, as he climbed out of the sleek spacecraft. Democrats applauded, too, that day. Musk was beaming. He was about to get richer.

The United States then relied on Russia to carry American astronauts to the International Space Station, paying Moscow tens of millions of dollars for each seat. Musk promised he would put an end to that and rebuild the American space program. Obama was in the White House and wanted to let private companies like SpaceX try. Weeks after Musk brought his space taxi to D.C., NASA awarded him a $2.6 billion contract.

Musk also pursued Pentagon contracts and found public confrontation helped. In a sparsely attended Capitol Hill hearing in 2014, he made headlines by slamming the joint venture between aerospace giants Lockheed Martin and Boeing that supplied rockets to the Air Force. He called it a “monopoly” and said it was vastly overcharging taxpayers.

“Elon was saying, ‘Give me a chance,’ ” said Scott Pace, a former NASA official who spoke at that hearing.

The Pentagon did, and Musk delivered. His game-changing, partly reusable Falcon rockets were considerably less expensive.

Now, just eight years later, Musk is the goliath of the space industry. And Musk’s success has shifted the dynamic with Washington.

Democrats are more vocal on the need to rein in Musk.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) calls Musk “my good friend,” and Musk spoke at his August fundraiser. In June, Musk, who recently moved from California to Texas, announced he voted for Mayra Flores in a congressional primary — and said it was the first time he voted for a Republican. He also bashed Democrats as too extreme and too controlled by unions and publicly predicted a “massive red wave” in November.

But some Republican lawmakers are skeptical Musk’s new coziness with the GOP will last. “He’s another bullshit artist” is how former president Donald Trump described Musk at a July rally in Alaska.

A rare area of bipartisan agreement is that for certain vital issues, especially national security, the United States should not depend on any one person or company, and the federal government is making moves to lessen dependence on Musk.

NASA has funded Boeing’s Starliner capsule to compete with SpaceX to transport astronauts. (Blue Origin, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, is also a competitor for NASA contracts.) NASA officials said Starliner’s delays and higher cost show why SpaceX is so dominant. “But still, we need a second option,” said one influential member of Congress.

The Federal Communications Commission in August decided it would not give SpaceX’s Starlink — which is now operating in 40 countries — a $900 million subsidy to bring broadband to rural areas even though that money had been provisionally granted in the waning days of the Trump administration. The FCC said the $600 satellite dish a home would need to purchase from SpaceX was a factor. A top SpaceX official called the rejection “unreasonable” and “grossly unfair.”

Congress also has been encouraging Ford and other automakers to build electric cars. A new condition on a federal $7,500 rebate is that the price of the new car cannot top $55,000. Most Tesla models cost more.

But Musk will be eligible for many subsidies and incentives, including for his electric charging stations. He just announced his Superchargers are now in 46 countries.

Musk hates “a false narrative out there that he is a grifter who survived off government handouts,” said Eric Berger, author of “Liftoff,” a history of SpaceX. “He sees the government as a double-edge sword,” Berger said. It can help but its bureaucracy slows him down. “He is really frustrated by the dizzying array of federal agencies that he has to deal with — and the bigger he gets the more there is.”

“Those bastards” is how Musk refers to officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC fined Musk and Tesla $20 million each after Musk tweeted that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share, after finding that was not true. The SEC is also now investigating Musk in connection with his Twitter takeover, including whether he complied with disclosure laws. Musk’s lawyer told a judge that the SEC was trying to “muzzle and harass” the businessman because he is an “outspoken critic of the government.”

Musk believes Tesla’s driver assistance system will save many lives and has said he is irritated by the publicity around the federal safety investigation into his Autopilot system. But government officials say it’s worth looking into whether the self-driving system was a factor in crashes, including some that were fatal.

Avoiding confrontation

Few want a head-on confrontation with Musk.

Biden got into one after Musk was not invited to a White House conference on electric vehicles in August 2021. Musk tweeted that the snub was the “next level of insanity,” and that Biden was controlled by unions. Musk also has been drawing attention to any Biden misstep, including when he mistakenly read instructions meant only for him on his teleprompter.

Apart from not wanting to get on his bad side, many in Washington admire his accomplishments and want to work with him. At the Pentagon, there are many who see Musk as a secret weapon. His Starlink satellite systems mean Ukrainian soldiers have real-time information about military targets, and other countries are looking at how it can help their defense efforts.

In April, the White House said Musk was invited to a discussion about electric cars and charging stations and did make an appearance by teleconferencing.

“We used to be on the same page. Now, we are not always. It’s great when we are,” said one member of Congress. “One thing is clear: Musk believes he knows best, and he will do whatever he wants — and that can be good and it can be bad.”

Meanwhile, Musk is also working on an ever-growing number of ventures, from building robots that can cook dinner to plans for colonizing Mars.

Lepore, the historian, said Musk’s power is not like anything the country has seen before. “We should be worried, not because it’s inevitable that his influence would be malignant, but it’s inevitable that it would be a huge influence.”

The Morning Meeting with Al Tompkins is a daily Poynter briefing of story ideas worth considering and other timely context for journalists, written by senior faculty Al Tompkins.

When Americans are worried about their own economy, we tend not to pay much attention to the rest of the world’s problems. And then we seem surprised when their problems also become our problems. The pandemic certainly taught us a lesson that countries are interdependent, not independent. And the inflation rates of countries around the globe are causing havoc afar, how many times are U.S. House and Senate candidates even talking about global issues? How often are journalists asking? It is tempting for candidates to embrace an “America First” agenda when voters demand lower inflation. But foreign policy also includes how much aid to send to Ukraine and how to help the economies of Central and South America. The next Congress, for example, will deal with foreign policy issues including:

Energy and environmental policy, whether to maintain the Paris Accord agreements or shift back toward fossil fuel production and dependance.

Immigration, including whether to address what the Biden administration calls the “root causes” of migration away from crumbling economies in Central and South America. Candidates too often are getting off the hook by saying they want to stop the border crisis. Beyond building a wall, what would stop desperate people from risking their lives to come to America? What would give them a better alternative than leaving their families and homes?

International organizations: To what extent will the United States stay connected to the World Health Organization and NATO? The current administration has attempted to patch up those relationships, but backing off again might feel like the relationship is unreliable long-term.

The Middle East: what should our policies be toward Saudi Arabia and Iran? The drones used to bombard Ukraine this week came from Iran. The Saudis pump a lot of oil and influence with OPEC+, but do we look past human rights atrocities to maintain the oil supply?

China appears to be getting chummy with Russia while at the same time remaining a huge global economic and military influence. There will be a time, maybe not so far away, when China will make a play for Taiwan. What will America’s position be?

A global food crisis: The drumbeat is getting louder warning against a potential global food crisis. Russia was a global supplier of fertilizer before Russia invaded Ukraine. European fertilizer plants have been closed because of the high price of natural gas. Yesterday, I told you about millions of chickens and turkeys that have been destroyed because of the avian flu. The UN World Food Program says we are heading for another year of record hunger.” Foreign food importers can’t afford American products because of the high price of the U.S. dollar.

Journalists could ask candidates:

If China takes military action to control Taiwan, what American response would you support? What would you unconditionally oppose?

Under what conditions would you support direct American military action to support Ukraine against Russia?

What are three Congressional actions that you would support to control the flow of immigrants seeking to enter the southern U.S. border?

This week, I taught journalists from a couple of dozen countries who told me about the astonishing rates of inflation in their home countries of Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, Iran and Turkey. How can people survive in an economy that is running 300%-plus annual inflation?

The implications are that such a crisis will force people to flee and will destabilize governments. And as history tells us, when economies crash, there are always people with radical ideas who emerge offering simplistic solutions blaming one group for the problems.

You know what is happening to food costs in the U.S. They are worse in Europe, a direct reflection of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Bread prices rose 20% in the last year and will increase even more as we enter winter.

The New York Times reported:

The squeeze has been sharpest in countries nearest to the conflict zone, especially Hungary, where the cost of a basic loaf surged in September by 77 percent from a year ago, according to Eurostat. In Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia, bread prices are up over 30 percent. The whirlwind has come as a shock in Germany, where the cost of bread has shot up over 18 percent in a year, as overall inflation has zoomed into the double digits, too, reaching 10.9 percent in September.

Look over this map and you can see the current inflation rates posted by Eurostat. Ukraine’s inflation rate is 24%. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are not far behind. The Netherlands’ inflation is 17%, and Romania and Serbia are running around 14%. It is going to be a rough and, for some, desperate winter.

The most recent Pew polling on this issue found 45 percent of registered U.S. voters ranking foreign policy as critical compared to the 77 percent who identified the economy as critical. And yet, in so many ways, the two are connected.

I heard a candidate for a Florida state representative seat promise this week that she would stop the fentanyl crisis. Respectfully, no she won’t. Another state house candidate said she would fight inflation. I doubt she will have a lot to say that would affect inflation. Maybe a state rep could make specific promises about specific measures that could give people a break on sales tax or gasoline tax or increase a property tax exemption.

My point is that I am frustrated that journalists are allowing the candidates to set the agenda of what we are covering. The journalists’ job is to press candidates to state positions on important issues that they will likely vote on in the coming term. Campaign coverage is largely about documenting what candidates promise to do so we can hold them accountable when they are in office.

Here are some other questions journalists could ask a midterm candidate:

What would you support to lessen, prevent and/or reverse the effects of climate change?

A 55% American majority opposes phasing out the production of new gasoline cars and trucks by 2035, while 43% are in favor. Where do you stand? Background from Pew: “Americans lean against the idea of phasing out gas-powered vehicles by 2035: 55% say they oppose phasing out the production of new gasoline cars and trucks by 2035, compared with 43% who support this proposal. The Biden administration has proposed regulatory efforts on emission standards that would increase the sale of electric vehicles so that half of all new cars and trucks sold in the U.S. are electric by 2030. The European Parliament supported a proposal to effectively ban new gas cars and trucks by 2035. Support for phasing out gas-powered vehicles in the U.S. is down slightly from last year, when 47% of Americans favored this idea and 51% were opposed. Democrats and Republicans continue to be deeply divided over whether to end the production of cars and trucks with internal combustion engines. About two-thirds of Democrats favor phasing out gasoline-powered cars and trucks by 2035 (65%). In contrast, just 17% of Republicans support this idea, while an overwhelming majority (82%) oppose it.”

42% of U.S. adults say they are very or somewhat likely to seriously consider purchasing an electric vehicle. What role should the U.S. government have in encouraging the move away from gasoline powered vehicles?

A majority (63%) says the federal government is doing too little to protect the water quality of rivers, lakes and streams. What should we be doing to protect waterways that we are not doing?

By a 53% to 45% margin, Pew Research finds Americans are more likely to view stricter environmental laws as worth the cost than to say such laws cost too many jobs and hurt the economy. How will you weigh these competing pressures?",electric vehicles,poynter

While wealthy nations’ citizens tend to have very high per capita emissions, the sheer number of people in India presents a unique global challenge. Not only do we (at least those of us who care about people) want India’s citizens to have a higher standard of living, but we also want to stop the harmful effects of climate change from getting any worse than they have to. It’s a real “Catch-22.”

But, as Henry J. Kaiser said, “Problems are only opportunities in work clothes.”

With cleaner technologies coming earlier in India’s development curve, they have a great opportunity to “leapfrog” wealthier countries and not make the mistakes we did (at least from my American perspective). By leapfrogging, I mean they can go straight to the best technologies available instead of using older technology.The mobile phone is an excellent example of how “leapfrogging” happens. Much of the developing world skipped fixed-line technology and went directly to 21st century mobile technology. By leapfrogging, it’s possible that these nations will escape the hazardous stages of development evident in industrialized societies, at least to some extent.

Two recent press releases by Tata Motors, a leading Indian automotive company, shows that this could be reality.

Taking Rideshare Straight To Electric

In order to further expedite the transfer to sustainable transportation, Tata Motors signed an agreement with Evera a few days ago. Evera is one of the first ride-hailing platforms in Delhi NCR that focuses exclusively on EVs. The 2,000 XPRES T EVs that have been ordered by Tata will be added to the existing fleet of its vehicles present with this aggregator.

“With the XPRES-T EV Sedan we have created a new benchmark in the fleet market, and it is heartening to see renowned fleet aggregators joining the green mobility wave with us. Evera has been associated with us since a long time, and we are delighted to further strengthen this tie-up, by signing an agreement of delivering 2000 EVs to them,” said Mr. Shailesh Chandra – Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd. “X-PRES T EV offers enhanced safety, fast charging solution, a premium interior theme along with dynamic performance at an affordable price. We hope to continue our association with Evera and jointly work towards offering greener and safer mobility options to our customers.”

In July 2021, Tata Motors launched the XPRES electric sedan. This vehicle comes with 2 range options – 213km and 165km (ARAI certified range under test conditions). It packs a high energy density battery of 21.5 kWh and 16.5 kWh and can be charged from 0- 80% in 90 mins and 110 mins, respectively, using fast charging or any 15 A plug point that is easily available.

The Tata comes with many features that set it apart from other cars on the market. These include zero tail-pipe emission, single speed automatic transmission, dual airbags, ABS with EBD as standard across variants. The premium black theme interior with standard automatic climate control and Electric Blue accents across its interior and exterior will give it a differentiated presence from other Tata cars.

“We are glad to announce our collaboration with Tata Motors. This association aligns with the Government of India’s National Electric Mobility Mission Plan and demonstrates our commitment to provide eco-friendly yet most efficient, comfortable, and sustainable mobility solutions to the customers,” said Mr. Nimish Trivedi, Co-founder & CEO, Prakriti E-Mobility, Parent Company of Evera. “With this fleet of Tata Motors’ EVs, our start of the airport services at the Terminal 3 of the Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, is around the corner and will propel us further towards this goal. We are also looking to expand to other cities to fast-track the EV adoption in the country by creating an end-to-end ecosystem. This collaborative approach with Tata Motors, shall further our vision and allow consumers to access a network of safe-mobility solutions across the country. We will continue to lead shaping the EV fleet industry with more such strategic partnerships.”

Today, Tata Motors says it’s revolutionizing the Indian automotive market and leading the charge on e-mobility. With a commanding 89% share of the market (YTD), over 45,000 EVs on road to date in personal and fleet segments, “we are committed to making EVs even more accessible to everyone through our EV ecosystem called ‘Tata uniEVerse’.” This includes working closely with other Tata Group companies like Tata Power, Tata Chemicals, Tata Auto Components, etc.

An Electric Bus Deal

Leapfrogging ridesharing to electric doesn’t mean that it isn’t still important to electrify existing transportation systems running on fossil fuels, too.

In another recent press release, Tata that it won the electric bus tender for Jammu and Srinagar, announced by Jammu Smart City Limited. As part of an initiative by Housing and Urban Development Department to establish a sustainable network of public transport, Tata Motors will be deploying electric buses in the twin capital cities of Jammu & Kashmir.

The Government of Jammu & Kashmir has commissioned Tata Motors to provide it with 150 9-meter and 50 12-meter electric buses as part of their initiative for more environmentally friendly public transportation. For the next 12 years, it will be Tata Motor’s responsibility to operate and maintain these Starbus electric buses.

“With a major paradigm shift towards clean public transport, the citizens of Jammu and Srinagar need a green mobility solution,” said Shri. Arun Mehta, Chief Secretary, Govt. of Jammu & Kashmir. “We are happy to reinstate our association with Tata Motors for our public transportation needs. These electric buses will not only be a medium to commute, but will also be an enabler towards creating an eco-friendly Jammu & Kashmir.”

Tata Motors’ 40 electric buses have been running in Jammu & Kashmir since 2019. In India, they have supplied a total of 715 electric buses to multiple cities. These buses have driven more than 40 million kilometers and had an uptime of 95%.

Tata Motors has received orders for 1,500 electric buses from Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), 1,180 electric buses from West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) and 921 electric buses from Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) as part of a tender floated by Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL). Tata Motors’ state-of-the-art research and development facilities have steadily worked to engineer innovative mobility solutions powered by alternate fuel technology, including battery-electric, hybrid, CNG, LNG and Hydrogen Fuel Cell technology.

286,"The World According To Musk, Q3 2022",https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/03/tesla-model-y-unveiling-elon-musk-3-e1647867438985.png,22/10/2022,Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told analysts on a conference call there was excellent demand ahead in the fourth quarter. His strong stance was a foil to investors' concerns that buyers might be adversely influenced by a shaky global economy and high…,https://cleantechnica.com/2022/10/21/the-world-according-to-musk-q3-2022/,"The world according to Musk — the Tesla-centered world, that is — continues to be robust and adaptable, even in light of global supply chain and inflationary pressures. During the Q3 2022 Tesla conference call, the Tesla CEO responded to various questions. Tesla reported adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share, topping analysts’ estimates of 99 cents per share. The company’s quarterly revenue came in at $21.45 billion, missing analysts’ expectations of $21.96 billion. The company has lost 45% of its market cap this year, but it remains more than 50% higher than a year ago.

While this Tesla earnings report may have some dark spots according to some analysts, CEO Elon Musk continued to affirm positive forecasts for Tesla’s future during the Q3 2022 earnings report.

Musk continually downplayed concerns about softening demand during the October investor call after Tesla’s revenue missed Wall Street estimates in the third quarter.

Resilience: Musk expressed full confidence in the ability of the company to continue to produce electric vehicles at a substantial rate. “To be frank, we’re very pedal to the metal come rain or shine,” according to Musk. “We are not reducing our production in any meaningful way, recession or not recession.” Tesla, like many other car manufacturers, has been hit this year by supply chain shortages and backlogs, as well as the rising cost of materials. In the past two quarters, the company said supply chain issues have been exacerbated by its Shanghai factory shutting down due to COVID and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Nonetheless, it achieved record quarterly production and deliveries.

On factory capacity: Tesla reported a solid jump in its quarterly profit as its EV sales in the 3 months that ended in September rose. Tesla is expanding fast despite global economic concerns, the CEO insisted. “I can’t emphasize enough we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see,” Musk said. “The factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong.” Demand for Tesla cars has resulted in a wait list for back-ordered vehicles as the company regularly sets new sales records. Tesla’s appeal over other automakers is driven in large part by consumer preference for its sleek, contemporary design, its high tech capacity, and digital dashboard with touch-sensitive display.

Meeting IRA requirements: Tesla’s CEO said during the company’s third quarter earnings call that the company expects to fully meet the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) requirements that would allow consumers to receive a $7,500 EV tax credit to most Tesla vehicles starting on January 1st, 2023. The passage of the IRA, a more than $430 billion health, tax, and climate package, is “a significant boost towards accelerating our mission,” Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn confirmed to analysts during the call.

Mass adoption of EVs: Musk envisions the next decade as having a major automotive shift from internal combustion engines to EVs. “The public at large realizes that the world’s moving towards electric vehicles, and it’s foolish to buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low,” Musk said. “So, we’re in a very good spot.” Musk added, “I wouldn’t say it’s recession-proof but it’s recession-resilient, because basically the people of Earth have made the decision in large part to move away from gasoline cars.”

On the Federal Reserve: Musk has been critical of the Fed, which has been lifting its benchmark interest rate to try and tamp down soaring inflation. He continued with that theme on Wednesday. “The Fed’s decisions make sense if you’re looking in the rear-view mirror, not if you’re looking out the windshield,” Musk critiqued. Tesla has been unwilling to slow the transition to sustainable energy, even given such constraints, and the company is working with existing suppliers to determine how to accelerate the production of raw materials as quickly as possible.

Recession abroad is possible: Decades high inflation, rising energy bills in Europe, and signs of a weakening China market have raised doubts among some analysts about whether Tesla can stymie an economic slowdown and continue to raise prices without hurting its sales. “China is experiencing a recession of sorts,” mostly in the property markets, Musk said, “and Europe has a recession of sorts driven by energy.” The US, he noted, “is actually pretty healthy.” According to Musk, even though an energy crisis looms in Germany this winter, “We have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production plans” at Giga Berlin.

On Tesla stockholder angst over Musk’s Twitter acquisition: The roller coaster ride that has been Musk’s desire to buy, then back out of, acquiring Twitter has highly unsettled investors. Musk attempted to allay these concerns. He said he is “excited about the Twitter situation” and that the company has “sort of languished for a long time but has incredible potential. … The long-term potential for Twitter is an order of magnitude greater than its current value.” Wall Street’s most heavily traded stock, Tesla has tumbled over 17% since October 2, partially as the result of the Twitter sale uncertainty. Then again, the S&P 500 has recorded daily gains or losses of more than 2 percent 39 times so far in 2022, compared to 7 times last year and 44 times in all of 2020.

On Tesla stock valuation: “I’m of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple’s current market cap,” Musk remarked. “In fact, I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. That doesn’t mean it will happen or will be easy,” he admitted. According to Musk, this calculation completely excluded Optimus — the potential for Tesla to make money on AI-boosted robots. Tesla stock fell sharply to a 52 week low this week before trimming its losses on Thursday and coming in at $207.28 to start the day on Friday. The bigger picture looking ahead is that better vehicle and factory designs have smoothed company manufacturing concerns.

The future is rosy: Tesla investors, on the whole, are more concerned about its long-term potential than short-term financial pressures. “Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% annual growth in vehicle deliveries,” Musk outlined. Tesla doesn’t disclose the split in sales between its Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle, but the Model Y continues to gain ground in popularity and sales, supporting Musk’s expectation for continued company growth. Moreover, the average US selling price of Tesla’s Model 3 has risen about 24% since January last year, helping the EV maker’s revenue in the third quarter. Tesla’s 4680 battery cells promise better range and lower production costs in future vehicles.

287,Vauxhall Partners With Octopus Energy For EV Charging Improvements,https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/10/vauxhall-home-charging-e1666424585433.png,22/10/2022,"Selling families, businesses, and organizations an EV is one thing.

Making sure the initial experience isn’t painful is another thing entirely. In most industries, they call this “service after the sale,” but when it comes to EV charging, it historically hasn’t been a manufacturer’s job to take care of fueling the vehicle. But, EVs change the game. Instead of just pulling up to a gas station, swiping a card, and pumping fuel into the vehicle, you can have an even easier experience: plugging in at home and letting the car charge while you sleep.

But that convenience doesn’t always come easy, or cheap. Most homes and commercial properties already have the electricity available, but that power needs to get into the car somehow. Getting expert help installing a charging station (and the wiring it needs) isn’t a process most people are familiar with.

Some manufacturers are starting stepping up to help. When I bought my Bolt EUV recently, I learned about GM’s promise to pay for installation if you buy a GM EV. The Bolt EUV includes a double-layer EVSE with both a NEMA 14-50 plug and standard household plug (NEMA 5-15) that are interchangeable. GM plans to offer more plugs in the future, like the NEMA 5-20 or TT -30, similar to Tesla’s Mobile Connector kit.

GM’s program provides a NEMA 14-50 receptacle instead of an EVSE installation, and the included charger is for Level 2 use at home. While this may not be the cheapest option upfront, it will save you money in the long run by preventing issues down the road. However, not everyone will want that kind of a setup. The company also provides up to $1,250 for “non-standard” installations that don’t use a receptacle (which I’ve heard can be more difficult to install). If people don’t want or need help with an installation, they’ll give you $500 in EVgo credit (usable at ChargePoint stations too).

I don’t know whether Vauxhall was watching this unfold, or if it has been planning it for a while, but it is going to do something similar for its customers in Europe, and is going even further to help, according to a recent press release.

Octopus Energy, a pioneer in green tech, has partnered with Vauxhall to improve the UK electric vehicle ownership experience overall. This includes reducing charging costs and using more renewable energy sources on the road and at home. The strategic partnership between Vauxhall and Pod Point will give customers more options for home charging, as well as expanded access to public charge points across the UK and Europe. Customers will be able to use one single payment card and app to access all of these services, as well as new smart energy tariffs.

Vauxhall is committed to electrifying Britain and becoming an electric-only brand by 2028. As part of this commitment, Vauxhall is working to make owning an electric car or van as easy as possible for drivers. This includes ensuring that drivers have the best access to a variety of charging solutions.

Vauxhall’s new partnership with Octopus Energy not only allows new customers to install a home wallbox charger, but also gives existing Vauxhall owners the option to do so. This charger is linked to the UK’s first flexible charging tariff called Intelligent Octopus. Furthermore, Electric Universe is a platform run by Octopus Energy that provides drivers access to over 300,000 public chargers across the UK and Europe from a single card and app.

“Vauxhall is committed to electrifying Britain and by partnering with a highly-respected brand like Octopus Energy, we’re giving our electric vehicle drivers the ability to ensure that they charge at home in the greenest and most affordable way possible as well as simplifying public charging by providing access to many networks across the UK with just one card,” said James Taylor, Managing Director, Vauxhall.

The Ohme wallbox charger, available through Vauxhall as part of the Plug & Go offer, comes with a three year warranty and can be controlled via smartphone app. Linked to the UK’s first flexible charging tariff, Intelligent Octopus, this is an ideal way to make sure you’re maximizing your tariff.

“It has never been a better time for drivers to go electric. With the range of vehicles, chargers, flexible tariffs like ‘Intelligent Octopus’ and roaming services like ‘Electric Universe’ available now, making the switch has become an absolute no-brainer,” said Rebecca Dibb-Simkin, Chief Product Officer, Octopus Energy Group. “We are incredibly excited to be working with such a forward-thinking brand as Vauxhall, helping its customers switch to electric faster and more comfortably. Going electric is not only good for the planet, it’s also cheaper than fueling gas-guzzlers and has the added benefit of helping to end our dependence on fossil fuels.”

The Intelligent Octopus tariff offers electricity from 100% renewable sources, with new customers getting an initial £25 off their bill. The flexible Intelligent Octopus tariff charges the vehicle using renewable energy when it is at its cheapest – offering customers savings compared to a standard variable rate and helping to balance demand on the grid. It will also offer a guaranteed lower rate per kWh during an off-peak time window of 11:30pm to 5:30am.

Vauxhall teams up with Octopus Energy to give electric vehicle customers access to the Electric Universe platform. The partnership offers a Plug & Go bundle or the option to sign up individually. All new Vauxhall electric vehicle customers receive an Octopus Universe card, as well as £10 introductory credit on their account.

The app and card were designed to make public charging more convenient, providing access to chargers from multiple providers in the UK and Europe. With a single account and one monthly bill, drivers have access to more than 300,000 chargers.

What About People Who Can’t Put A Charger In?

Vauxhall’s announcement also expands on its pre-existing partnership with JustPark, which it previously announced. This deal helps more British people switch over to driving electric vehicles by making it easier for them to find convenient charging locations near where they live. People who own an electric car and have a charger that goes unused can earn extra money by renting out their charger when not in use, thus helping even more of Britain go green!

So, they seem to be working to cover not just the harder things, but all of the bases (to use an American baseball metaphor) when it comes to after-sales service. That’s pretty impressive.

289,2024 BMW X2 Rendering Shows How The Sleek SUV Could Look,https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bmw-x2-rear2.jpg,22/10/2022,"The BMW X2 is dead, long live the X2.

Indeed, the first-generation model has been discontinued but spy shots have revealed work is underway for a successor. While the M Performance version was spotted the other day flaunting its quad exhaust, this speculative rendering attempts to see into the future of the non-M35i model. There will be some significant changes on the outside by adopting a sleeker profile with a more coupe-like roofline echoing the X4 and X6.

Pictured here in the new Cape York Green color, the 2024 X2 has been envisioned with 20-inch wheels and in the xLine trim level, which sits above the base model but below the M Sport. The front half of the car should be virtually identical to the new X1, but the other half will be less hatchback and more Sport Activity Coupe (SAC) compared to the old X2.

Although not immediately noticeable in the adjacent renderings, the second-generation X2 will likely be substantially larger than the original model. The conventionally styled X1 is now 177 inches (4.5 meters) long, and this growth spurt should be carried over by the X2 as well. Using the same logic, BMW is planning a fully electric iX2 to mirror the iX1 xDrive30 launched earlier this year.

The speculative design exercise depicts the 2024 X2 with the new door handle design BMW is implementing in more production vehicles. It’s more than just for the sake of style as flush door handles enable a smoother side profile that pays dividends in terms of efficiency, especially for the future electric X2. Elsewhere, practicality will take a hit over the X1, but that’s the price to pay for having a more sloped roofline.

Although the first-gen X2 is no more, BMW won’t start production of its replacement until November next year. It can only mean deliveries are scheduled to start in early 2024 and should include the iX2 as well. The spicy X2 M35i will arrive slightly later, possibly with an updated B48 engine making somewhere in the region of 315 horsepower.

Now, they’re proving out that quickness again by rolling out a production-ready electric truck of its own: the Foxconn Model V.

A lot has changed since Tesla first introduced the world to the Cybertruck back in ::checks notes:: 2019. Back then, there was no Ford F-150 Lightning. No Silverado EV or GMC Sierra, either. Rivian still wasn’t in production and Lordstown still looked like a viable thing. When the Cybertruck landed, it was walking onto an empty playing field — now? Now it’s still months (if not years) away from production, while Ford and GM are sitting waiting lists hundreds of thousands of vehicles strong.

And that playing field is only getting more crowded, as this latest truck debut shows.

Pride of Taiwan

The first electric pickup truck designed and developed in Taiwan, Foxconn’s Model V is promises a payload of up to 1 ton, and a towing capacity of up to 3 tons with various chassis configurations to maximize the on or off-road needs of the driver.

The electric pickup also features a 5-seat crew cab body about the size of the Ford Maverick’s, with electronic camera rearview mirrors similar (in concept, if not execution) to the Lucid Air’s.

Foxtron (the brand that Foxconn is planning to sell the trucks under) claims 30 percent climbing capability (16.7 degrees), and a base range of 420 km (about 265 miles). The Model V should be able to charge from 20 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, with bed dimensions of of 1.5 x 1.45 meters putting it right in line against Ford’s compact trucklet.

The truck was shown this week as part of Foxconn’s Hon Hai Tech Day, which saw two other compact EVs and a suite of high tech bits on offer to other carmakers as well.

As more and more EVs get sold, we’re going to have to come up with enough raw materials, refining capacity, and cell production lines–and that’s all before a manufacturer puts the cells in battery packs. But, that’s far from the only difference between an ICE vehicle and an EV. Many production lines for both manufacturers and their suppliers are going to have to either close or shift to make parts useful for EVs.

With all this in mind, you can get a pretty good idea of how serious a manufacturer is about EVs by how many production lines are either getting built or getting retooled for EV components. If they’re doing almost nothing, they’re probably building a few compliance cars. If they’re opening/swapping multiple production lines at a time, they’re making a serious effort.

Fortunately, a recent press release from BMW shows us that it is the serious type, and this is all for battery production alone. Non-battery components are probably a whole other story going on behind the scenes. But, back to its battery component plans:

The BMW Group revealed plans to up its e-component production by eight lines at its Leipzig base by 2024. The news was revealed on 20 October during the Green Day celebration held at BMW Group Plant in Leipzig. In the next year, the two existing battery module lines will be getting a boost with one additional line and five cell coating lines. By 2024, there will also be two new high-voltage battery assembly lines operational. These batteries will power electric models such as the MINI Countryman, which is also assembled in Leipzig.

“The BMW Group has always been a pioneer in the transformation to electric mobility,” said Milan Nedeljković, BMW AG Board Member for Production, “and we intend to remain the leader in the future. Plant Leipzig will be of special importance in this regard, as it’s the birthplace of the BMW i3.”

From 2013 until summer of 2022, Leipzig had manufactured over 250,000 fully electric BMW i3 vehicles and 20,000 plug-in hybrid BMW i8 sports cars. The additional available spaces and the skillsets of its employees will now be devoted to producing e-components. By 2024, more than 1,000 production staff will work in battery component production at Plant Leipzig–700 are working there presently.

“We are working consistently to advance the transformation to electromobility,” said Markus Fallböhmer, Head of Engine at E-Drive Production at BMW AG, “and we continue to develop our e-drive production network to make it happen. From 2024, the entire process chain for high-voltage battery production will run not just at Dingolfing but at Leipzig as well.”

BMW Is Putting Some Serious Money Behind This

This isn’t a cheap effort. BMW’s announcement threw around some big numbers.

The BMW Group tells us that it has invested more than 800 million euros to establish e-component production in Leipzig, which will active by 2020 and occupy around 150,000 square meters on the site. The BMW Group has plans to invest more than 1 billion euros in the Dingolfing Competence Centre for E-Drive Production by late 2022. This investments allows for the production of electric motors. In addition, between 2020 and 2022, there will be an investment of 250 million euros specifically for e-drive component production that takes place in Regensburg.

For the rest of the article, let’s look at what exactly BMW is doing with these investments.

Five New Cell Coating Lines

The first of five new battery cell coating systems will be operational at the Leipzig site by the end of 2023, with another four launching throughout that year. The battery cells will be manufactured by external suppliers to BMW Group specifications. First, the lithium-ion cells will be plasma-cleansed before being coated with specially developed systems for optimum insulation.

A Third Battery Module Line

After being coated, the cells are assembled into larger units known as battery modules. In Leipzig this is done on two existing module lines, with a third set to go live in summer 2023.

Two High-Voltage Battery Assembly Lines

After the battery modules, connectors, control units and cooling aggregates are assembled, they’re placed in an aluminum casing. The number of modules as well as the size and shape of the casing depend on which vehicle model it will be used for so that each car gets a bespoke high-voltage battery. In 2024, two Plant Leipzig assembly lines will also be designated for high-voltage battery production.

A Global Production Network

The BMW Group is utilizing its worldwide production network to meet the rising demand for e-drive component production capacity. High-voltage batteries and battery components for electric vehicles under the BMW and MINI brand will be produced not only in Leipzig but also Spartanburg, USA, and Shenyang, China. With the help of a partner company, high-voltage battery production has been localized at Plant Rayong in Thailand.

The BMW Group is making large investments in electric car technology and infrastructure. In Munich, it has the E-Drive Pilot Plant and the Battery Cell Competence Centre which are constantly improving battery cell production processes. BMW is also launching a Competence Centre for Battery Cell Production just outside of Munich. This new center will allow for the mass-production of high quality lithium-ion batteries at an affordable cost.

Manufacturers at the BMW Group’s Competence Centre for E-Drive Production in Dingolfing produce electric motors, while those at Plant Landshut create casings for the newer, fifth-generation electric drive.

A Solid Continuing Effort

For a full EV transition of the global automotive industry, BMW is obviously going to need a lot more lines. How many? I can’t give you an exact number, but a quick Google search says it builds around 2.5 million cars annually. So, multiply whatever Tesla is doing by around 2.5. That’s a TON of EV production, and a ton of components (well, multiple tons, but it’s a figure of speech).

But, this does show that the company is serious about upping EV production and not just making a few limited-production EVs to satisfy regulatory requirements and give the public a side-show while they crank out even more SUVs.

When General Motors first unveiled the Chevy Silverado EV earlier this year, one thing was certain: the GMC Sierra EV wouldn’t be too far behind. The two trucks have pretty much been twins throughout the years. But now, GMC wants to change that. Friends, I give you the 2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1. While it’s a close cousin to the all-electric Silverado, it’s here to change the way you think about GMC.

2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali From the Outside

Photo: GMC

The first thing you notice about the Sierra EV is the size. GMC isn’t revealing exact exterior dimensions until the vehicle is closer to production, but we can make a few assumptions based on the Silverado EV, which is 233 inches long and 76 inches tall. We don’t have an official width measurement, but since the Chevy and GMC electric pickups don’t have DOT-required marker lights, it’s safe to assume the twins are less than 80 inches wide, though probably not by much.

Unlike GMC’s other electric pickup, the Hummer EV, the Sierra gets a somewhat more useful bed that measures 5’11” with the tailgate closed. As with the Silverado EV, the GMC gets GM’s MultiPro Midgate, which lets you flip down the back seats and open the rear wall of the passenger compartment to create a 9’1” bed. If that’s still not enough, you can configure the MultiPro tailgate to extend the bed floor to 10’10”.

Up front, the Sierra EV has a big faux grille, illuminated around its outer rim. Within it is a very large, illuminated GMC badge. Flanking the grille are some really large LED running lights that greet you when you walk up to the vehicle. You may be fooled into thinking those are the headlights, but they’re not. The actual headlights are housed in small openings right below the DRLs.

Pop the hood, and you’re welcomed by a massive frunk, just like you’d find on the Silverado EV or Ford F-150 Lightning. All in all, it’s a very brawny piece of equipment. A GM spokesperson described it to me as “a fist flying through the air.”

From the side, the Sierra EV has a relatively simple design, with a few flowing character lines that break up the bulk. GM says all of the Sierra’s sheetmetal is unique from the Silverado EV, but the two look very similar.

Photo: Andy Kalmowitz

Above the wheel arches are amber LED lights, which a GMC representative told me are a new design staple for the brand. They’re not federally required, but customers like them, so GMC added them.

All that being said, the most notable thing about the Sierra EV is the massive 24-inch rims with available 35-inch tires. GM’s electric pickup truck twins will be the first production vehicles to offer 24s from the factory, though 22s will also be available if you’re a loser.

2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali: Tech and Power

We haven’t driven the Sierra EV yet, but according to GM’s estimates, this is going to be one fast truck. With two motors and GM’s Ultium battery platform, the Sierra EV will produce a total of 754 horsepower and 356 kg-ft of torque in “Max Power Mode,” enough to get this massive thing from 0-60 in under 4.5 seconds according to GM.

Photo: GMC

The Denali rides on adaptive air suspension that can raise or lower the truck by as much as 2 inches, and offers four-wheel steering with “Crab Walk,” which angles all four wheels so the truck can drive diagonally. GMC says the Sierra EV will tow up to 9,500 pounds, and haul a payload of up to 1,300 pounds, besting the electric Ford F-150 Lightning by 816 kg on towing, but falling short of the Ford’s 1,014 kg payload rating.

Despite the fact the Sierra EV is a “fist flying through the air,” it still manages a GM-estimated 644 km of range on a full charge. That beats the Lightning’s 483 km EPA-estimated range, though the EPA has not published final figures for the GMC just yet.

The Sierra EV will be equipped for 250-kW DC fast charging, able to add up to 100 miles of range in just 10 minutes. Like the F-150 Lightning and Chevy Silverado EV, you’ll be able to plug electrical equipment into the Sierra EV, or even use it to power your house during a utility outage.

Like all current high-end GM vehicles, this fella comes with Super Cruise, an excellent advanced driver-assistance program that I love very much. This version is even trailer-capable, a feature shared with GM’s current generation of pickup trucks.

2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali: Interior

Photo: GMC

The interior really seems to have been the focal point for GM designers working on the Sierra EV. It’s dominated by two very large screens: a 16.8-inch Google-powered vertical display in the centre of the dash and an 11-inch horizontal screen for the gauge cluster. The GMC also has a 14-inch multi-colour heads-up display that projects onto the windshield.

Photo: GMC

Soft leather and open-pore wood can be found throughout the interior. You’ve got other niceties, too, like wireless phone charging and laser-etched stainless steel trim. If you look up you’ll see a full panoramic roof. One thing the Sierra EV doesn’t have is a starter button. Simply get in the vehicle, put your foot on the brake, shift into Drive and get going. When you get out, the vehicle turns itself off. It’s pretty nifty, if you ask me.

2024 GMC Sierra EV: Everything Else

Reservations for the 2024 GMC Sierra EV are now open, with production set to begin soon at GM’s Factory Zero – the company’s first dedicated EV production facility, located in Detroit. Electric GMCs should begin arriving at dealers in early 2024.

Photo: Andy Kalmowitz

At the start, GMC will only offer fully-loaded Sierra EV Edition 1 models, with an eye-popping starting price of $US107,000. That’s mighty steep for a pickup truck, but GMC says lower-tier Sierra EVs, like the AT4 and Elevated trims, will start around $US50,000, a bit more in line with the F-150 Lightning.

So, GMC now has three entrants in the EV truck space: The Hummer SUV and pickup, and the Sierra EV. When this truck hits dealers next year, we’ll start to see the electric truck market really heat up.",electric vehicles,gizmodo australia

It’s no longer a secret that electric vehicles (EVs) are expensive to buy and maintain. In fact, a survey published in July revealed that many Americans are still not interested in owning or leasing EVs due to high costs (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and other concerns. Canadians may become less interested, too, after reading these accounts.

From Western Journal:

Electric Vehicle Owners in Shock After Learning Battery Replacements Cost $20,000+

By Bryan Chai

“Get an electric car,” they said.

“You’ll save so much money on gas!” they said.

Well, whoever “they” are, “they” are leaving out some pretty large caveats about all those money-saving benefits of being an electric vehicle owner.

Will you spend a little less on gas if you drive an electric vehicle? Of course you will! At the end of the day, the simple fact does remain that electric vehicle owners will, on average, save $800 to $1,000 a year on fueling costs over an equivalent gasoline-powered car, according to Consumer Reports.

That amount is nothing to sneeze at, especially in the current economic climate. So let’s start there: “They” are correct that if you own an electric vehicle, you will, in fact, save money on gas. No problems with the facts of that statement.

Now let’s get to a very pricey caveat. Let’s visit America’s red-headed step-child to the North, Canada.

As CTV News Toronto reported, local resident Phyllis Lau got a nasty surprise when she took her 2018 KIA Soul electric vehicle in for a new battery.

The final price tag for Lau after parts, labor and taxes? A cool $23,000. Yes, as in the cost of some new cars altogether.

Lau faced that hefty price tag after learning that because her KIA exceeded the 160,000 km (99,419 miles) warranty limit, she would have to pay for it herself. KIA did offer the ever so gracious opportunity to cover half the cost, leaving Lau on the hook for “only” $11,500.

If you do the math, you can clearly see why “they” don’t like to bring this up. Those $800 to $1,000 savings every year? You would have to own your electric vehicle for 11 years minimum to have that offset Lau’s cut-in-half bill.

CTV News also spoke to another Canadian resident, Ken Edwardson, about his 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid. Edwardson had bought his MKZ about four years ago, and when that battery died, he went through a similar experience as Lau.

“At the dealership, he looked it up online and said you’re not going to like this. It was about $15,000 for the battery plus labor and taxes,” Edwardson said. CTV notes that after labor and taxes, Edwardson’s bill was much closer to $20,000.

Of course, “they” already had planned for this line of thinking, and provided that thinking to CTV as well. University of Toronto Electric Vehicle Research Centre Director Olivier Trescases told CTV that complete battery failure is “rare” and should not deter anyone from buying an electric vehicle.

“Those very unfortunate owners of EVs that have to have their batteries replaced, yes it will be very expensive. It all comes down to whether the degradation of the battery is within the warranty clause or not,” Trescases added.

Trescases dismissive attitude towards “those very unfortunate owners” isn’t exactly a surprise. There’s almost a gleeful response from the elites when discussing the proliferation of electric vehicles. That glee makes a lot more sense when you start seeing those price tags (all that money ends up in someone’s pockets).

Both Lau and Edwardson ultimately decided not to spend the annual salary of most servers on battery replacements.

But don’t worry! CTV noted that a new EV company, VinFast, is making EV batteries with a twist: They come with a monthly subscription so you don’t have to buy those $20,000 replacements! Of course, the price of that subscription ranges from $3,108 a year to $4,188 a year.

Quick math: Whether you’re paying a $20,000 one-time fee or paying $4,000 annually, you are vastly outpacing the “additional” $800-$1,000 a year savings you’d otherwise be enjoying.

No wonder “they” don’t like talking actual numbers.

In addition to being costly, EVs have been associated with battery fires, fires that are difficult to extinguish, investigations, and recalls due to fires (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Even flooded EVs have been bursting into flames!

Other issues that have been identified with EVs include:

We can only hope that someday investing in an EV won’t be such a gamble. In the meantime, there’s a lot to consider.

296,"King: Electric utilities face more demand, less generation",https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IWSLK7AHFDPBNKFQF6SHUABV54.jpg?w=800&h=533,22/10/2022,The nation’s electric utilities are facing revolutionary changes as big as any they have faced since Thomas Edison got the whole thing going in 1882.,https://www.bostonherald.com/2022/10/22/king-electric-utilities-face-more-demand-less-generation/,"The nation’s electric utilities are facing revolutionary changes as big as any they have faced since Thomas Edison got the whole thing going in 1882.

Between now and 2050 – just 28 years — practically everything must change. The goal is to reach net zero, the stage at which the utilities stop putting greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.

But in that same timeframe, the demand for electricity is expected to at least double and, according to some surveys, to exceed doubling as electric vehicles replace fossil-fueled vehicles and as other industries, like cement and steel manufacturing, along with general manufacturing, go electric.

Just eliminating fossil fuel alone is a tall order — 22% of the current generating mix is coal and 38% is natural gas.

Half of the generation will, in theory, go offline while demand for electricity soars.

The industry is resolutely struggling with this dilemma while a few, sotto voce, wonder how it can be achieved.

True, some exciting technological options are coming along: Hydrogen, ocean currents, small modular nuclear reactors, so-called long-drawdown batteries, and carbon capture, storage, and utilization. The question is whether any of these will be ready to be deployed on a scale that will make a difference by the target date of 2050.

There are other schemes — still just schemes — to use the new electrified transportation fleets as a giant national battery. The idea is that your electric vehicle will be charged at night, or at other times when there is an abundance of power, and that you will sell the power back to the utility for the evening peak when we all fire up our homes and electricity demand zooms.

That is just an idea and no structure for this partnership between consumer and utility exists, nor is there any idea of how the customer will be compensated for helping the utility in its hours of need. It is hard to see how there will be enough money in the transaction to cause people to want to help the utility as besides the cost of charging their vehicles, the batteries will deteriorate faster.

The West generates plenty of renewable power electricity during the day, some of which goes to waste because it is available when it is not needed in the region, but when it would be a boon in the East.

The simple solution is to build more long-distance transmission. Forget about it. To get the many state and local authorizations and to overcome the not-in-my-backyard crowd, most judge, wouldn’t be possible.

Instead, utilities are looking to buttress the grid and move power over a stronger grid. In fact, there isn’t one grid but three: Eastern, Western and the anomalous Texas grid, ERCOT, which is confined to that state and, by design, poorly connected to the other two, although that may change.

Advocates of this strengthening of the grid abound. The federal government is on board with major funding. Shorter new lines between strong and weak spots would go a long way to making the movement of electricity across the nation easier. They would also move the nation nearer to a truly national grid. But even building short electric connections of a few hundred miles is a fraught business.

The task of the utilities — there are just over 3,000 of them, mostly small — is going to be to change totally while retooling without shutting off the power. The car companies are totally changing, too. But they can shut down to retool. Not so the utilities. Theirs must be a revolution without disruption, the light that doesn’t fail.

Ola CEO and founder Bhavish Aggarwal believes the era of ICE (internal combustion engine) two-wheelers will be over soon, thanks to disruptive products like the S1 Air scooter launched by his company at Rs. 79,999 (introductory offer).

Despite Ola Electric earning the ‘Tesla of India’ sobriquet, he’d rather that the Ola brand be recognised globally. He feels India will become the EV capital of the world, and a company like Tesla should set up a manufacturing facility here to build products for the entire world.

“We believe India can lead the world’s EV market and that is our mission. Indian companies should be the world’s leading EV firms. Not just Ola, there are other good companies that can be a part of the EV revolution,’’ said Aggarwal during his interaction with reporters.

Asked for his views on Tesla demanding tax breaks, he maintained, “It is the government’s prerogative to set the rules and policies for what should happen when a particular company enters India. I will only say that if Tesla wants to do business here, it should make products for world markets. That is what we are doing by leveraging India’s strengths and taking our products global.”

The Indian government has not softened its stance regarding taxes on Tesla cars imported from China . While the government is adamant that it will not compromise on its policy of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), the American electric carmaker is not keen to manufacture products locally unless it is allowed to first sell and service its cars in the country.

Nearly a month back, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had urged German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz to produce more cars locally, and emphasised that such a move would reduce costs and increase affordability. Gadkar had also said that there was a huge market for electric vehicles in the country.

Ola Electric believes its low-cost e-scooter, the S1 Air, will make it the largest two-wheeler player in the country. A senior Ola official had told Moneycontrol that the price point will be close to or even less than the bestselling scooter, Honda Activa, which is petrol-driven.

“We absolutely expect the S1 to be a gamechanger for the scooter market in India. We expect this to completely change the paradigm and consumer preference when it comes to mass-market scooters. There are two or three established scooter brands with decent volumes (Activa), etc. Our ambition is to eat up that market and provide consumers a much better choice,"" added Aggarwal.

Without sharing numbers he said, “With the kind of price points, features, and specifications we have, we will absolutely end the ICE age in those segments.”

Reacting to recent reports about his “abrasive style of management,”, Aggarwal said that his company plays by its own set of rules, which may not be agreeable to a certain kind of people.

“We’re a company on a mission and are not here to build ‘me-too’ products. My personal style is probably more aggressive than the average new-age entrepreneur. We have a culture of impact, merit, high quality, and high execution,” Aggarwal said.

“There are so many examples of people who have done really well in our environment. We would like others to judge us by our impact.” he added.",electric vehicles,moneycontrol
298,CATL Taps The Brakes On North America Battery Factory Plan,https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/03/Kirin-Battery-from-CATL.jpg,22/10/2022,"The on again, off again plan by CATL to build a battery factory in North America is off again because of concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act.",https://cleantechnica.com/2022/10/22/catl-taps-the-brakes-on-north-america-battery-factory-plan/,"Reuters is reporting that CATL, the largest battery manufacturer in the world, is reconsidering its plan to build a battery factory in North America, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. The company has been exploring possible sites for a factory in Mexico or in the US in either South Carolina or Kentucky.

While the Inflation Reduction Act is creating a tidal wave of investment in battery materials and manufacturing by several companies, it also requires half of those materials to come from sources in North America or countries with most favored nation trade status by 2024. That requirement rises to 80% by 2026. Senator Joe Manchin, who was a primary architect of the IRA, has said it was intended to drive companies to mine and process materials for batteries in North America and break the industry’s reliance on China.

CATL isn’t opposed to manufacturing batteries in the US (or Mexico), but those sources tell Reuters complying with the requirements of the IRA will make the cost of materials higher than the cost of producing them in China and shipping them to North America, even if CATL were to receive federal incentives to build a battery factory in the US.

CATL supplies the batteries for a third of all electric vehicles produced in the world and has built a vast supply and processing infrastructure in China that allows it to be very competitive on the price of its batteries. The planned battery factory in the US or Mexico would supply batteries to major customers like Ford and BMW, the sources said.

The provisions of the IRA have stirred a lot of push back from automakers in South Korea and Europe. Reuters reports that executives from Volkswagen, BMW, and Hyundai have urged US legislators to give automakers operating in the United States more time to meet the required battery sourcing targets that will qualify them for tax incentives. But the change in thinking by CATL represents the first known example of an automaker or major supplier rethinking an investment because of the new law.

CATL sees North America as a crucial market, the sources said, but the new US rules on sourcing battery materials have become a “banana peel” that has slowed the company’s investment plans. It was not immediately clear how much of a delay CATL was considering in any North American expansion or whether it could make other adjustments to its approach to narrow the cost gap.

The Takeaway

The IRA giveth and it taketh away. On one hand, it has turbocharged investments in renewable energy and battery storage. On the other hand, it has put significant hurdles in the path of automakers who want their vehicles to qualify for the new tax incentives.

The Europeans are not happy. The South Koreans are not happy. There are rumblings of challenges via the World Trade Organization. And as a backdrop to all this drama, if control of either house of Congress changes as a result of the US election in a few weeks, the odds of making any significant changes to the IRA will be close to zero.

CATL could be a potent factor in the effort to bring more affordable electric cars to market in the US, but current policies may convince it to pass up participation in the EV battery market in North America. Politics is a delicate dance and a small disruption over here can lead to a large disruption over there. Stay tuned. The last chapter of this story has yet to be written.

300,3 Spectacular Stocks Down 58% to 82% to Buy on the Dip,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/705343/a-person-pointing-to-two-arrows-outperforming-another-arrow-with-a-cityscape-below.jpg,22/10/2022,Investors looking for long-term growth in this challenging market might want to consider these three stocks.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/22/3-spectacular-stocks-down-58-to-82-to-buy-on-dip/,"Bear markets are never easy to navigate, and the Nasdaq 100 technology index is on pace for the worst annual decline since the 2008 global financial crisis. But one hallmark of every market downturn is opportunity: High-quality stocks often overshoot to the downside amid broader declines which are driven largely by fear.

A panel of Motley Fool contributors have identified Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -1.73%), Datadog (DDOG -7.82%), and Shopify (SHOP -3.68%) as three opportunities investors should consider buying on the dip, as each stock is trading at a steep discount to its all-time high. Let's explore the details.

A best-in-class semiconductor stock trading at a 65% discount

Anthony Di Pizio (Advanced Micro Devices): Semiconductors are the advanced computer chips essential to our most prized electronics, and the cloud computing technology that hosts our online experiences. Advanced Micro Devices is a world-class semiconductor producer, and it's one of the most diverse in the entire industry.

The company makes hardware for both the Sony PlayStation 5 and the Microsoft Xbox gaming consoles, and its chips are responsible for powering the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles. But that's not all: It also works with all the top providers of cloud services, from Amazon Web Services to Microsoft Azure to Alphabet's Google Cloud.

Now, AMD is set to take a leadership position in high-performance computing thanks to its $49 billion acquisition of Xilinx earlier this year. Xilinx is a pioneer in adaptive computing, which could be the future for advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). Mainstream semiconductors are often in a solid state, meaning they need to be swapped out for new ones when it's time to upgrade. But adaptive chips can adjust to the user's needs in real time and can be reconfigured even after the manufacturing process -- shortening the upgrade cycle.

AMD just reported disappointing preliminary results for the third quarter of 2022, booking $5.6 billion in revenue, for growth of just 29% year over year. However, the data center segment continued to shine with $1.6 billion in revenue and a growth rate of 45%. The company's greatest opportunities over the long run could be in the data center, especially when it comes to applying adaptive technologies, so it's promising to see the segment remaining strong.

Plus, according to analysts' expectations, the company remains on track to grow total sales by 45% for the whole of 2022, to $23.8 billion. With AMD stock down 65% from its all-time high, this could be a prime opportunity to take a position.

An appealing balance between growth and profitability, now at a 58% discount

Jamie Louko (Datadog): Technology and software companies have fallen out of favor with investors lately, but that doesn't mean there aren't high-quality businesses in the space. While many investors have fled from the tech sector, companies like Datadog have continued to post stellar adoption rates and profits.

Datadog operates application observability and performance monitoring software, which helps customers ensure that their digital applications and tech infrastructure are running smoothly and effectively. This is a must-have service for customers, so it makes sense that demand has remained relatively stable this year, despite the concerning economic backdrop. According to Gartner, Datadog is a leader in the space; this helped the company achieve 74% year-over-year top-line growth in Q2, reaching $406 million in revenue.

Importantly, Datadog has profit and cash flow coming in, signaling that it isn't sacrificing profits to achieve artificially higher growth rates. Over the trailing 12 months, Datadog generated almost $354 million in free cash flow -- for a 26% margin -- while keeping net income at $6.5 million.

This cash flow can help the company do something critical to continue thriving in this space: innovate. Competition is fierce in the application performance monitoring space, with immense pressure from established rivals like Dynatrace. For Datadog to maintain its leadership status, it must continue to build and release new products for customers, and the company has done that. As of August, Datadog had announced the rollout of six products in 2022, and it expects to roll out even more by year's end.

With shares down 58% from all-time highs, Datadog's valuation has fallen from an egregious multiple to a much more acceptable one; shares trade at 74 times free cash flow. While that's still expensive on an absolute basis, it's far lower than earlier this year, when the stock was valued as high as 200 times free cash flow.

Considering the company's leadership and flawless execution in an industry expected to be worth $53 billion in 2025, Datadog looks worth paying up for.

The market leader in e-commerce software, at an 82% discount

Trevor Jennewine (Shopify): Shopify makes it easy for merchants to manage an omnichannel business. Its software helps sellers build direct-to-consumer (D2C) websites, and it also integrates with online marketplaces like Amazon and social media like Alphabet's YouTube. Shopify sweetens the deal with adjacent services including discounted shipping, financing, and payment processing.

The comprehensive nature of its offerings has made it popular with small businesses, though Shopify Plus -- a more customizable option for larger businesses -- is also gaining traction. In fact, Shopify and Shopify Plus rank as the top two e-commerce platforms in terms of market presence, according to G2 Grid, and Shopify powered 10.3% of online retail sales in the U.S. last year, second only to Amazon.

Despite that strong market position, Shopify has struggled with high inflation this year, as evidenced by its disappointing financial results. Revenue climbed just 16% in the second quarter, and the company posted a non-GAAP (adjusted) loss of $0.03 per diluted share, down from a non-GAAP profit of $0.22 per diluted share in the prior year. As a result, Shopify has seen its share price plunge 82% since last peaking in November 2021.

However, investors need to focus on the big picture. Shopify actually continued to gain market share in U.S. retail, both online and offline, through the first half of 2022. Moreover, temporary economic headwinds leave the long-term investment thesis unchanged: Shopify is the leading e-commerce software vendor, and it has a particularly strong foothold in the U.S. That bodes well for the future, as online retail sales in the U.S. will grow faster than 12% annually to approach $1.7 trillion by 2026.

But Shopify is also working to strengthen its position and expand its market opportunity. For instance, it recently added business-to-business (B2B) commerce tools to Shopify Plus, so Plus merchants can now sell D2C and B2B from the same platform. That could be a game changer for a couple of reasons. First, it makes Shopify a more compelling option for larger sellers. In fact, management says more than half of existing Plus merchants could utilize B2B tools. Second, it should allow Shopify to capitalize on the massive B2B market. For context, global B2B e-commerce sales are expected to grow at nearly 20% annually to reach $33 trillion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.

Currently, Shopify is bouncing off a 52-week low, and shares trade at an inexpensive 7.5 times sales. That's why this beaten-down growth stock is worth buying now.",electric vehicles,motley fool

Alef bills its still-in-development electric vehicle, the Model A, as the first true flying car – a vehicle that it hopes will look like a sleek electric car but be capable of vertical take-off, and able to fly for 110km (68 miles).

According to a BBC report, the firm hopes to compete in a market occupied by well-advanced rivals, such as AirCar and the Pal-V gyrocopter that are already flying and driving.

But Jim Dukhovny, Alef’s chief executive and co-founder, argues most existing vehicles are not strictly flying cars in his opinion.

“A flying car has to be a car, which means it can drive on a regular street, park in a regular parking space. And it also should have vertical take-off,” he told the BBC.

“If you require an airport to take-off, what problem are you solving? And why is this a flying car?”

The top surface of the Model A’s car-like exterior is a mesh so that air can pass through to eight propellers inside the body which provide lift.

But flying any distance using these alone, without the assistance of wings, would require prohibitive amounts of power.

Alef’s proposed solution is novel – for longer flights the Model A transforms into a biplane.

After a vertical lift-off, the Model A will turn onto its side, the two-person cockpit swivels so the driver remains facing forward, and the car becomes a biplane with the long sides of the vehicle forming the top and bottom wings.

The classic biplane shape, with two wings, one on top of each other, is easier to see in the Model A if you imagine the mesh in-between the solid sides being removed. Alef has also produced a video visualising the transition.

A screen capture of the launch video showing an illustration of the Alef in flight

Forbes observed that the way it would fly resembles the Opener Blackfly, an existing vertical take-off electric aircraft.

Bringing flying and driving together adds weight, electric power also means heavy batteries.

“The design is right on the ragged edge of what the physics and technology can do, which is where you would expect it to be,” says aeronautical engineer Professor Steve Wright of the University of the West of England.",electric vehicles,the punch

Maybe.,https://www.zdnet.com/article/taco-bell-just-tried-to-excite-customers-with-a-new-kind-of-drive-thru/,"Will this work? Rendering by ChargeNet/Diversified Restaurant Group

If there are words in a press release that really, truly motivate, among them are words like ""revolutionary,"" ""killer,"" and ""first.""

Each time I see those appear in my email inbox -- or anywhere where finer press releases hang out -- I leap to learn more.

So it was the other day that I saw not only the word ""first,"" but also a true rarity: The word ""electrified.""

Here's what truly threw me. The next two words after ""first"" and ""electrified"" were ""Taco"" and ""Bell.""

Let's run them together. First electrified Taco Bell.

Also: We wanted to make things worse, says McDonald's, but it costs too much money

What could this be about? A Taco Bell only staffed by robots was my first inclination. Or a Taco Bell that gave you an electric shock as you waited for your order.

Sadly, I wasn't even close.

Instead, this was the announcement that a large Taco Bell franchisee was installing its first ""ultra-fast, solar-powered EV charging station."" This, in partnership with ChargeNet Stations. The location? San Francisco, of course.

Should you be a Tesla owner -- or perhaps you have an EV from a company run by a lesser luminary -- you'll surely be delighted that, for around $20, you'll be able to buy 100 miles of travel while indulging in a fine chalupa. (You have to pay for the chalupa separately.) And the charging will take just 20 minutes.

I wanted to be excited on behalf of all fast-food loving EV drivers who will surely adore this new kind of drive-thru. But then I paused and wondered about the future of fast food.

Also: The 5 best home EV chargers

It's been easy to get the impression that most fast-food brands are somewhat keen not to have anyone actually sit inside their restaurants any more. It's been hard to hire staff. It's been even harder keeping them. And the likes of McDonald's and the rest made quite a lot of money during the pandemic with drive-thru and delivery.

It feels a touch odd that they might install this new technology to encourage customers to hang around -- even for twenty minutes.

Perhaps there are nuances here.

SG Ellison, president of electrified Taco Bell franchisee Diversified Restaurant Group, put it like this: ""As the popularity of electric cars grows, especially in California, we are excited to offer our customers in the Golden State this service. They can quickly charge their vehicles and fuel themselves with our Mexican-inspired fan favorites at the same time.""

So you want them to stay, but not for very long?

Also: Best affordable electric cars

ChargeNet Stations CEO and co-founder Tosh Dutt offered another perspective: ""An estimated 120 million Americans eat at quick-serve restaurants every day. About half of our locations are in marginalized communities across California, providing charging access to people who may not have the luxury of a home charging station. Our goal is to democratize EV charging across California and beyond.""

No, many in marginalized communities may not have the luxury of a home charging station. Some may wonder if they may also not have the luxury of an EV. The average price of one is currently around $66,000.

Taco Bell isn't, though, alone in flirting with offering EV charging stations. A Burger King franchisee has worked with Blink Charging, a McDonald's franchisee with Tesla charging.

It could be that, in the very near future, fast-food restaurants will become the new gas stations -- places where you fill your car up, as you fill yourself up.

Some might dream of the day when the likes of Taco Bell or McDonald's make more money out of electricity than out of chalupas and burgers.

China's increasing influence in the region has spurred the need for greater cooperation.

Japan and Australia on Saturday signed a new security pact aimed at countering China's growing influence.

After talks with his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese in the western Australian city of Perth, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida hailed ties between the two allies, which he said had reached a new level. The two countries vowed to share more sensitive intelligence and conduct joint war games.

Kishida told a news conference, ""As one of the biggest achievements of this visit, I and Anthony signed a new joint declaration on security cooperation.""

He said the new deal would be a ""compass that shows the direction of bilateral security and defense cooperation for the next 10 years.""

The new deal updates a 15-year-old agreement that focused more on issues of counterterrorism and North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs.

Japanese, Australian forces to train together

As well as intelligence sharing, Australia's armed forces and Japanese self-defense forces will also conduct exercises together in Northern Australia.

Some analysts believe the pact will help Japan to join the powerful Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance between Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.

Neither Australia nor Japan has overseas intelligence operatives and foreign informants on par with major Western intelligence organizations. But they do reportedly have formidable signals intelligence capabilities and high-tech satellites that provide invaluable intelligence on adversaries.

Albanese noted the ""landmark declaration sends a strong signal to the region of our strategic alignment.""

Without citing China or North Korea by name, the Japanese leader said the agreement was a response to an ""increasingly harsh strategic environment.""

China flexing muscles in region

In recent years, China has built the world's largest navy, revamped the globe's biggest standing army, and amassed a nuclear and ballistic arsenal right on Japan's doorstep.

Beijing also stepped up its threats to invade Taiwan, an island China considers its own, while territorial disputes continue to rage with other Asian neighbors.

China's relations with Australia nosedived two years ago when Canberra demanded an international probe into the origins of the COVID pandemic.

Energy ties strengthened

The two leaders promised greater cooperation on energy security and discussed climate change, expressing support for boosting investment in cleaner energies.

Japan is currently a major buyer of Australian iron ore, coal and gas for its high-end manufacturing sector and will require more rare earth minerals to aid the energy transition, including the move to electric vehicles.

Tokyo has also made a series of big bets on green hydrogen produced in Australia with renewable energies.

307,6K Has A New Formula For Sustainable EV Batteries,https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/10/EV-batteries-microwave-plasma-6K.png,22/10/2022,"6K's new microwave plasma process takes on multiple sustainability challenges for EV batteries including carbon emissions, energy use, water conservation, waste management, supply chain security, and equitable workforce development.",https://cleantechnica.com/2022/10/22/6k-has-a-new-formula-for-sustainable-ev-batteries/,"Electric vehicle makers have been leaning on longer range EV batteries for an edge over the competition, but range can only get you so far. Sustainable manufacturing is also gaining traction, as automakers seek to cut the long tail of energy, water, and waste dragging behind their zero emission rides.

Sustainable Manufacturing & The EV Batteries Of The Future

There is plenty of room for improvement in EV battery manufacturing, sustainably speaking. The US firm 6K provides a good illustration. The Massachusetts startup just won $50 million in funding from the Biden administration to manufacture more sustainable EV batteries domestically, deploying a proprietary high tech process it calls UniMelt®.

The federal dollars will go towards the construction of a $107 million manufacturing plant to be located somewhere in the southeastern US. The aim is to demonstrate that the US energy storage industry can leave overseas competitors behind in the dust, and produce EV batteries that cost less, perform just as well if not better, and leave behind a smaller manufacturing footprint for energy, water, and waste.

The manufacturing model adopted by 6K does not involve the need to invent brand new battery architecture. For example, its new facility can work with NMC 811 lithium-ion EV batteries, referring to the now-familiar nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode formula.

NMC sparked much talk around EV battery circles a couple of years ago, when manufacturers like SK Innovation and LG Chem began tweaking the standard formula to include more nickel. As explained by Research Interfaces, NMC 811 was “meant to be the next-generation cathode – ‘better and cheaper’, pushing electric vehicles beyond a 500 km (~300 mi) driving range and soon to price parity with the internal combustion engine.”

According to 6K, its new UniMelt process can produce the latest generation of NMC 811 batteries while generating 70% less greenhouse gases than conventional battery manufacturing. 6K also states that its processes only uses 10% of the water and 30% of the energy used in conventional methods.

The All-Important Domestic Supply Chain

Concerns have been swirling around the availability of lithium for EV batteries. The US domestic lithium industry has yet to gather speed (more on that in a second), but manufacturers like 6K are not waiting for the grass to grow under their feet. They are counting on lithium mined from spent EV batteries and other end-of-life energy storage devices.

“6K will demonstrate the ability to leverage feedstock sources domestically, freeing the US from its current dependency on conflict nations. This will be accomplished first by upcycling recycled materials sourced from end- of-life batteries followed by the digestion of 6K’s own metals,” 6K states.

The company also points out that responsible sourcing is part and parcel of sustainable manufacturing. In addition to avoiding materials from conflict zones, that means adhering to the Biden administration’s goals for equity and environmental justice.

“Over time, the project will create up to 150 well-paying jobs and through education, recruitment, training, and retention initiatives, it is anticipated that at least 40% of the employees will come from disadvantaged communities and that the workforce will reflect the diversity of the community,” 6K states.

How Does It Work?

You might be able to DIY your own UniMelt-er at home if you have a microwave oven and a few other tools at your disposal suitable for pushing the boundaries of plasma chemistry, but keep in mind that you’ll need to reach a temperature of 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit. UniMelt is a production-scale, high efficiency, high throughput microwave plasma process.

“A combination of high heat, highly reactive ions, and designed chemistries create the perfect environment to collapse processes into previously unattainable periods of time,” 6K explains.

“For additive manufacturing the UniMelt process precisely spheroidizes metal powders while controlling the chemistry and porosity of the final product,” 6K notes. “For battery material, the same sustainable process is used to synthesize chemical elements and control particle size and microstructure to produce advanced battery material at a fraction of the time and cost as conventional processes.”

Shorter version: Conventional production processes involve multiple steps and different batches that suck up time and energy. Batch-type methods are also vulnerable to contamination and loss at various stages.

6K states that its microwave plasma process is a single, continuous flow operation that takes about 2 seconds, or 1/100,000th the time of today’s conventional, batch-based production technologies.

More EV Batteries For The US Southeast

So far, 6K has been mum on the exact location of its new plant, but the idea of situating a sustainable manufacturing facility for EV batteries in the southeastern US may seem a bit counterintuitive at first glance, mainly because the region as a whole has been lagging behind other states in renewable energy capacity.

UniMelt or not, 6K will have some ‘splaining to do if its new manufacturing facility for more sustainable EV batteries runs on natural gas or coal power.

Part of the problem for renewable energy developers in the southeast is a technology challenge, as wind speeds across the region are less than optimal for harvesting inland wind energy with conventional turbines. The US Department of Energy has been trying to pick that apart with support for taller wind turbine towers and longer turbine blades.

The offshore wind industry encounters a similar wind speed obstacle in the Gulf of Mexico, though the emergence of green hydrogen and green ammonia have helped improve the economic conditions for exploiting offshore wind resources there.

The Atlantic coast is a different story altogether. Political fortunes have been the main obstacle among Atlantic coast states since 2010, when South Carolina, Georgia and Florida all declined to join a new multi-state effort aimed at coordinating and accelerating offshore wind development along the Atlantic.

Solar Power To The Rescue

The southeast’s record on solar energy is mixed, but looking brighter. Georgia and Florida are currently among the top 10 states in installed solar capacity, as are the nearby states of Virginia and North Carolina. South Carolina is also catching up and currently owns the #14 slot.

Other southeast states are much farther down in the solar pecking order, including Alabama (#31), Tennessee (#28), Louisiana (#38), and Mississippi (#37), with Kentucky bringing up the rear at #46.

Kentucky might not remain a regional laggard for long. Last year, GM engineered a new solar power deal for its Corvette factory in the Bluegrass State. The Tennessee Valley Authority is lending an assist, as part of its pivot into renewable energy. A movement is also afoot to convert spent coal mines in the region for solar arrays and energy storage.

Ford is another automaker seeking more solar power for EV batteries and other manufacturing facilities in the southeast. Wherever 6K ends up, the prospects for a solar-powered manufacturing plant look a lot better now than they did just a few years ago.

A significant shift in the makeup of Congress would mostly involve delays rather than major legislation being rescinded. But time is of the essence as scientists continue to warn that without immediate and deep emission reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will soon be ""beyond reach.""

Democrats have set up several major climate change initiatives at the national level that Republicans would like to roll back. To do so, they will need a landslide victory — and even then hitting the undo button will be a challenge.

Five major climate initiatives are at stake as voters decide who controls the House and Senate, along with governor's races and ballot initiatives across the nation.

Here's a look at what the midterms mean for the climate:

'Undo' of Inflation Reduction Act still possible

Coming just 85 days after the most consequential piece of climate legislation ever passed in the United States, the outcome of the midterm elections are unlikely to erase key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act unless Republicans gain a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT:Answering your common questions about the legislation

INFRASTRUCTURE ACT:The massive 2021 infrastructure act aimed to fight climate change. Is it living up to Biden's pledge?

The sweeping legislation includes record spending on clean energy initiatives. It also has measures to reduce prescription drug prices and to ensure large corporations pay income taxes.

The law was approved by the Senate on Aug. 7 in a party-line vote. To dismantle it would require passage of a new law to either repeal or replace it, a virtually impossible task given current political realities.

To overcome a veto by President Joe Biden, Republicans would have to gain a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress, which is seen as unlikely.

The other truth in politics is that once a major bill such as the IRA is passed, the longer it is in effect, the less likely it is to be overturned.

""It’s hard to do big things and it’s hard to undo big things,"" said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president for governmental affairs with the League of Conservation Voters.

'Shouting distance': That's how close the Inflation Reduction Act would get US to its climate goals

Critical water rights decisions hang in the balance amid megadrought

Two governors’ races could affect the 40 million Americans who get their water under the century-old Colorado River compact.

A megadrought that’s lasted for 22 years has pushed the mighty Colorado River well beyond its limits. Scientists estimate about 40% of the drought is attributable to human-caused climate trends.

To deal with the extreme lack of water, the Department of the Interior took an unprecedented step earlier this year, demanding governors of the seven states that get water from the river come up with an emergency plan to drastically reduce use.

Interior was clear: If the governors of Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, and California didn’t come up with a proposal, the agency’s Bureau of Reclamation would do it for them.

VIDEO:Climate change made drought 20 times more likely

There’s been no deal and things are now on hold as all of the states but Utah have governors' races on November 8.

How things play out in two of those states, Arizona and Nevada, could delay a state-run plan, causing the Department of the Interior to step in.

In both states, Republicans with unorthodox water plans are polling well and could end up calling the shots.

In Arizona, Republican candidate Kari Lake wants to prioritize finding additional water supplies rather than conservation. Her major proposals to deal with the state's water shortages are building a pipeline to bring water from the Missouri and Mississippi rivers or constructing seawater desalination plants.

But desalinization would raise costs significantly and a pipeline is likely politically unworkable.

Conservation is really the only option, said Eric Kuhn, former general manager of the Colorado River District.

“The water’s just not there,” he said.

In Nevada, Republican candidate and political firebrand Joe Lombardo says California gets too much water under current rules and the entire Colorado River Compact should be renegotiated.

WATCH:Mississippi River's low water level reveals shipwreck

VIDEO:Millions of Americans still drink unsafe tap water. Here’s why.

That seems unlikely to happen. The Compact was ratified in 1922. To create a new one would require the approval of Congress, state legislatures and governors.

Whatever humans do, in the end Mother Nature calls the shots, said Kuhn, the co-author of “Science Be Dammed: How Ignoring Inconvenient Science Drained the Colorado River.""

“You can’t deliver more water than you have.”

Plan to make companies disclose climate data not finalized

In the financial world, a historic climate change rule that could significantly change what investors are told about companies' risk is set to be finalized next year. A shift in the composition of Congress could throw up roadblocks, though might not derail it.

The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed the rule in March. It would require public companies to disclose the risks they face from global warming as well as disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions. The rule doesn't require companies to change what they're doing, only to make it known to potential investors.

Already at least 16 Republican state attorneys general have contested the proposed rule and it's anticipated that multiple lawsuits will be brought against it.

Others believe it will survive opposition.

""This rule was built to survive legal challenges,"" said Elizabeth Small, head of policy for CDP, a nonprofit that runs a voluntary climate disclosure system for companies.

Two states propose landmark climate initiatives

While several states and numerous counties and cities have various climate initiatives, two stand out because of the size and economic importance of the states contemplating them.

In California, Proposition 30 would increase by 1.75% the tax on people who make more than $2 million. The resulting money – as much as $5 billion per year by state estimates – would go toward building electric and hydrogen vehicle charging stations and wildfire suppression and prevention programs.

If California were a country, it would have the world's fifth-largest economy, so what the state does matters. If it passes, the initiative could spur the adoption of zero-carbon vehicles and construction of infrastructure to support them, both electric and hydrogen, not just in California but across the United States.

Across the country in New York state, Proposal 1 would allow the state to issue $4.2 billion in bonds for environmental, natural resources, water infrastructure, and climate change mitigation projects.

The Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act would pay for environmental improvements across the state, including $1.5 billion for climate change mitigation, $1.1 billion to restoration and flood risk reduction, $650 million to conserve open spaces and $650 million for water quality in resiliency infrastructure.

If the historically large measure results in the jobs and cleaner, healthier environment supporters say it will, it could encourage other states to take similar steps.

Agriculture at the center of another, bigger fight ahead

How these climate issues play out could set the stage for an even bigger fight expected to begin in earnest after the midterms.

Every five years since 1933, Congress passes a piece of legislation that touches almost every aspect of America's agriculture and nutrition policy: the farm bill. Formally known as the Agriculture Improvement Act, in 2018 it cost $428 billion and is an enormous driver of what American grows and eats.

Agriculture accounts for 11% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Conservation and sustainability are expected to be big issues as the details of the next farm bill are hashed out.

""It could be a huge opportunity for advancing climate solutions,"" said Sittenfeld. ""There's no overstating the potential for the farm bill as we have very ambitious goals for cutting climate emissions.""",electric vehicles,usa today

Bloomberg News had a bombshell scoop Thursday night reporting that Biden administration officials, viewing Musk as a little too Russophilic, are weighing security reviews for his various ventures. Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, could be an obvious target, as could that social media platform he is about to buy. But what about the big kahuna, Tesla Inc.?

It seems far-fetched that this could actually derail the Twitter deal and it’s unclear which agency would even have the authority to conduct such a review, although the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, is cited as an oblique vector. On the other hand, Twitter’s stock is down 5% Friday morning. And these are paranoid times in the US. So if the Feds did squish the deal on national security grounds, it could raise the stakes for Musk’s car company.

Because, as Musk never tires of explaining, Tesla isn’t just a car company. By his telling, it is an energy, technology and artificial intelligence powerhouse all rolled into one. That is the logic-adjacent justification for Tesla’s $650 billion market cap. Besides batteries, over-the-air software updates and the expanding suite of driver-assistance technologies, dubbed Autopilot and Full Self Driving, Tesla touts the development of a humanoid robot called Optimus. Indeed, should Tesla ever actually crack autonomous driving, its cars would essentially be a specialized type of robot.

Autonomous vehicles and AI go hand in hand and have long been of interest to strategic planners around the world. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, began work on unmanned ground vehicles in the 1980s. Apart from wheels with a mind of their own, AI touches an expanding range of applications, both military and civilian; everything from vacuum cleaners to drones. As vehicles become more connected and more intelligent, they not only become a source of national competitive strength but also a target for potentially hazardous hacking and mass surveillance. Remember how China banned Teslas from military installations last year?

If that all sounds a bit paranoid, welcome to the US, where paranoia is a resilient political virus: never dead, sometimes dormant, occasionally virulent. An agency like CFIUS, originally empowered to reject deals in the 1980s when Japan had Washington hyperventilating, is the very embodiment of paranoia. Two recent landmark pieces of legislation, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, are predicated to varying degrees on countering China. Plus, of course, there’s that proxy war with the old adversary, Russia.

It still seems a stretch to think that Musk’s apparent gamesmanship around Ukraine’s access to the Starlink satellite-internet service and his palling around with Kremlin officials on Twitter — however morally repugnant — would lead to his deal being blocked. Again, it is unclear to me who would even conduct these reviews. But the question, as so often, is why does Musk court such needless risk in the first place? His previous tussles with the Securities and Exchange Commission and various state and federal traffic safety agencies have been entirely self-generated.

Of all the arms of government to tweak, the national security complex is probably the riskiest. While the never-ending game of eight-dimensional chess that plays out on Twitter throws up the possibility that Musk is hoping the cavalry will ride to his rescue on Twitter, cavalries tend to ride roughshod over much else. Regardless of whether that happens here, Musk’s prominence and fortune are bound up in the promise of him developing and owning technologies that will define 21st century life — and geopolitical rivalry. He is a person of interest to security hawks by default. His Twitter habit, be it financial or just the expression of his incontinent thumbs, provides them with gratuitous openings.

The SoftBank-backed firm said this is a big push towards taking India closer to ending the era of petrol vehicles.

""Our objective has been to transform the Indian mobility landscape to electric. The next logical step for us is to launch a mass-market scooter, and that's what we've done today,"" said Bhavish Aggarwal, Founder and CEO, Ola. ""The specs and the price point of this product will shake up the market. I think that's an understatement.""

The Ola S1 Air will come at an introductory price of Rs 79,999 for everyone who reserves the scooter for Rs 999 on or before Diwali, i.e. October 24, 2022. After that, the price will be raised to Rs 84,999.

The purchase window for the Ola S1 Air will open in February 2023, and deliveries are scheduled to commence in early April next year.

S1 Air is Ola's third product in the electric two-wheeler category. Its top-tier S1 Pro is priced at Rs 139,000, without the festive discount, and Ola S1 costs Rs 99,000. Honda Activa, one of the largest-selling petrol in the country, is priced at around Rs 90,000.

From 4000 units a month before Ola's entry into electric mobility, Aggarwal said electric vehicles (EVs) now stand for 15 per cent of the entire scooter segment. He said in cities like Delhi, Bengaluru and Pune, it is even higher at 40 per cent of the new scooter sales.

""The Indian EV industry has really accelerated over the last one-and-a-half-years. Last year in June, only 4000 electric two-wheelers were sold. Last month 50,000 were sold. This month, I think 60,000-70,000 vehicles will be sold,"" said Aggarwal. ""Among all (premium) priced about Rs 1 lakh on the road, Ola has almost 50 per cent of the market.""

The firm said the new S1 Air would have a real-life range of 100 kilometres on a full charge when used in eco-mode. It is built on the S1 platform and retains the same design. But Ola has re-engineered the powertrain and battery pack. Powered by a 2.5KWh battery pack and a 4.5KW hub motor, the S1 Air weighs only 99 kgs, delivers a top speed of 85 Km/hr, and goes from 0-40 in just 4.3 seconds.

Aggarwal said many engineering improvements are continuing over the last eight months at the firm, which helped to reduce the weight and cost of the S1 Air.

""We follow a continuous engineering process versus an annual or a waterfall engineering process which most global traditional OEMs (adopt),"" said Aggarwal. ""We make more software style approach where the product is a little different from the inside every month and the customer doesn't realise it.""

For instance, Ola announced its third major software upgrade within a year, MoveOS 3. The latest over-the-air upgrade adds more than 20 new features and comes with a bunch of improvements on performance. Some of the newly launched features in MoveOS 3 will include Proximity Unlock, Party Mode, Moods, and compatibility with Ola's Hypercharger network. With Ola Hyperchargers, users can now charge their up to 50km in 15 minutes at a charging speed of 3km per minute. In addition, the latest MoveOS 3 update will also introduce many more features, such as Hill Hold, Profiles, and Vacation Mode.

Ola has also announced the launch of two of the accessories that add to the core vehicle platform. These include a buddy step for passengers who prefer to sit sideways and a centre stand for hassle-free parking in small, tight spaces.

The S1 Air is available in colours such as coral glam, neo mint, porcelain white, jet black, and liquid silver. The scooter would be rolled out in neighbouring Nepal later this year. Ola also has plans to launch it in Europe and Latin America by early next year.",electric vehicles,business standard

Significant macroeconomic challenges remain, but investors may have reason to believe that Europe passed peak pessimism. Russia does not have much energy leverage left, and following the massive selloff in European assets in recent months, most of the energy supply shock looks priced in. Europe appears to be serious about curbing stubborn energy inflation, evidenced by a potential price cap on natural gas needed for electricity.

The UK government’s decision to reverse its proposed tax cuts helped assets rebound somewhat. While the Bank of England (BoE) is expected to hike by over 200 basis points (bps) before year-end, we believe there is an increasing chance that the bank postpones quantitative tightening (QT) until 2023. Reducing gilt buying by £80 billion over the next year at a time when gilt supply is expected to rise dramatically would not bode well for the BoE’s financial stability objective.1

In Italy, the electoral victory of the far-right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni resulted in a limited market reaction, with the bund/btp spreads widening by only 8bps following the results. The market reaction may be more significant come the end of October when the new government is formed and its key fiscal programs become clearer, which is important given that the country’s 150% debt-to-GDP ratio.2

Outside Europe, China’s 20th Party Congress indicated that China is preparing more aggressive easing and growth-oriented policies, even with leadership hesitant to abandon its zero-COVID policies. Recent declarations from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) indicated a shift toward increased liberalization, pointing to greater monetary independence and an unwillingness cap the yuan’s weakness.3

It’s the opposite in the U.S., where the dollar remains strong, to the benefit of domestically oriented U.S. companies, particularly those in the middle of the Biden administration’s push to decarbonize infrastructure. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) could stabilize at its high in the coming weeks, but it seems poised to weaken as monetary conditions become restrictive. Neither the labor market nor inflation will derail the Fed’s tightening. We expect the Fed to remain on its tightening path and increase the fed funds rate as long as there is no sign of a marked slowdown in hiring, wage growth, and core inflation.

Investment strategies highlighted this month:

Renewables Benefit from Europe’s Likely Move To Cap Gas Prices – Capping gas prices to help curb inflation can preserve superior profit margins for renewable energy producers. More broadly, Europe’s energy security and decarbonization goals will spur R&D in cleantech, solar in particular.

20th Party Congress Policy Agenda Positive for Chinese Equities – We expect further easing of monetary and fiscal policies to boost growth prospects and earnings expectations, and possibly trigger a rebound in Chinese equities.

Technology to Help U.S. Firms Navigate Difficult Conditions – Tech stocks have been battered this year, but we believe bright spots will emerge as U.S. companies invest in productivity-enhancing and cost-saving technology.

Europe’s Renewables: Energy Security and Decarbonization Push Spurs Investments

We believe investors have reason to be slightly more optimistic about Europe as it progresses in its energy transition. The region’s dependence on Russian gas is now just 9%, down from 40% before the invasion of Ukraine. Gas reserves are at about 88% full, within range of the European Commission’s (EC) requirement of maintaining reserves at 90%, though most European countries still need to save 10–15% of their gas consumption to comply with the EC’s targets.4,5

In the real economy, consumers, companies, and governments must make do with less and more expensive energy. Countries such as France, Portugal and Spain have it easier, as they were hardly dependent on Russian energy. The situation is different in Eastern and Central Europe, given their reliance on Russian gas, but countries are pivoting. Germany unveiled a new €200 billion stimulus package, which should help support consumers and business activity over the winter months and improve the outlook for the region overall.6 The outlook is less optimistic for Italy and the UK, where political uncertainty compounds the economic uncertainty and fiscal and financial risks are rising.

Further coordinated measures seem likely, including a price cap on natural gas. If implemented at the EU level, this measure would partially subsidize energy consumption, relieving some of the burden on consumers and companies. The exact structure remains unclear, including the financing and whether fossil energy companies’ profits will be tapped. Also, we expect changes in the energy pricing system that decouple natural gas prices from other electricity sources, including liquified natural gas (LNG), wind, solar, and nuclear.

However, the EU is unlikely to drastically change the “pay-as-clear” mechanism in the European energy market, where the most expensive energy source dictates the price of a kilowatt-hour of electricity. Under this pricing model, producers of cheap electricity, such as renewables, sell their electricity at the highest price, which is often the gas price. This model is positive for renewable energy producers because it can result in high margins. The net profit margin for European renewable energy producers is 11.6% currently, versus 7.4% for the rest of the world.7

For investors, what should be increasingly clear is that Europe will not return to its 2021 energy mix. Europe’s expedited moves to secure its energy and decarbonize have spurred numerous initiatives. Notably, REPowerEU is the EC’s plan to cut make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030. The plan includes a rapid rollout of solar and wind energy projects combined with renewable hydrogen deployment. The EC estimates that 780 gigawatts (GW) of solar and 510GW of wind power must be installed across the region by 2030 to meet REPowerEU’s objectives. As part of the REPowerEU’s plans under the modified Recovery and Resilience Fund, the EU announced a €300 billion investment in renewables and cleantech and the electrification of infrastructure and transportation.8

In addition, urgent needs include new grid balancing and back-up power sources, currently provided mainly by fossil fuels, hydro, and nuclear. Other large-scale projects include geothermal and nuclear fusion studies. Also, the European Space Agency (ESA) proposed a research and development (R&D) program to develop commercial solar power stations in space. Dubbed the Solaris project, European science ministers are set to evaluate its feasibility in November. In 2050, solar is expected to be the single largest contributing energy source to the EU, accounting for 40% of the EU’s energy.9

We view companies that manufacture, operate, or supply components for renewable energies such as solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear components, and hydrogen as attractive given the demand prospects. Raw materials like nickel, cobalt, copper present opportunities for the long term. In the short to medium term, uranium is core to renewed focus on nuclear energy.

Chinese Equities: Rebound Can Materialize Amid Easing Policies

China started on its path to easier monetary and fiscal policy due to the Omicron variant, which resulted in several long lockdowns this year. With dampened consumption and business activity amid the government’s zero-COVID policy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts China’s economy to grow just 3.2% in 2022.10 The strong U.S. dollar reducing global demand and the risk-off environment created a challenging investment backdrop for Chinese equities. However, positive signs include industrial production and manufacturing production improved slightly in in September.11 For 2023, the IMF forecasts China’s growth to accelerate to 4.4% in 2023, outpacing global GDP growth forecasts of 2.7%.12

The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in October, at which President Xi unveiled new party leadership for the next five years, offered additional reasons for optimism about China’s growth trajectory. The government seems determined to boost growth and achieve three key targets: common prosperity, technological and manufacturing self-reliance, and liberalization of market access. However, Xi’s declarations at the Congress about prioritizing national security and stronger military alongside the reaffirmation of opposition to Taiwan independence point to elevated geopolitical uncertainties in the region. These factors could weigh on investment sentiment for Chinese assets and cap near-term growth prospects.13

First, China’s objective to reduce inequality and shift to a consumer economy, so-called “common prosperity”, could benefit consumer discretionary-oriented sectors and themes as easing measures take hold. The effects of these measures depend on the number of COVID cases and resulting lockdowns, as Xi reiterated the government’s commitment to the zero-COVID strategy.14

Second, China’s push to develop its domestic semiconductor market illustrates the country’s goal of technological and manufacturing self-sufficiency. The focus on semiconductors is likely to accelerate following President Biden’s announcement of additional export control restrictions on chip companies. Chinese hardware technology companies could gain domestic market share as a result and increase profits for chip companies like SMIC, China’s largest semiconductor manufacturer.

The People’s Bank of China is likely to help the corporate landscape by cutting banks’ reserve requirement ratio by at least 25bps by year-end. With accommodative monetary conditions and increasing tax refunds and tax cuts and deferrals, corporate loans rose to 1.35 trillion yuan in September, nearly double from a year ago.15 We expect most of this funding to be directed to infrastructure developments.

And for the third objective, recent PBOC policy decisions indicate a reluctance to intervene heavily to cap the yuan’s weakness. The central bank’s preference for a market-driven approach to stabilize the currency point to greater monetary policy independence and exchange rates liberalization.

From a market standpoint, Chinese stock valuations are compelling, in our view. Following the large selloff since early 2020, Chinese stocks captured in the MSCI China index are trading at 10x forward earnings, close to their 2011 lows.16 Chinese stocks’ return on equity (ROE) could beat expectations in 2023, should China implement additional easing measures to boost economic growth. Sectors that are likely to outperform in the next year include Tech, Industrials amid higher defense spending, and Consumer Discretionary, led by automobiles and electric vehicles. Consensus aggregated by Bloomberg shows that analysts expect the combined earnings of companies in the Hang Seng Tech index to rebound over 10% in 2023 and close to 40% over the next two years. In comparison, analysts forecast the combined earnings for the broader MSCI China Index to grow 6% in 2023 and 11% over the next two years.17

Themes that look well-positioned to benefit from this upside potential in Chinese stocks include Renewable Energy, including solar, an industry where more than half of the constituents are produced by Chinese companies, and wind. Other themes that can benefit include Lithium & Battery Technology, Disruptive Materials, and E-commerce. These themes should not only benefit from the global structural push for digitization and decarbonization, but also local tailwinds from Chinese policies to stimulate growth.

U.S. Tech: Productivity Enhancers and Cost Savers Are Bright Spots

While high inflation, slowing growth, and market volatility may make investors skittish, these dynamics can create compelling investment opportunities as companies adjust to this challenging operating environment. Investing in technology is one way for companies to achieve higher productivity gains, especially in the U.S., where the job market is likely to remain tight and wage growth elevated.

In September, the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, despite the Fed’s tightening.18 The growth in average hourly earnings remained at a monthly pace of 5.0% yoy, which is not consistent with the Fed’s 2% inflation target.19 We expect the supply of workers to keep pressuring the job market, due in part to a large group of U.S. workers set to reach retirement age. The possibility of a downward trend in the participation rate will not help bring down wage growth in the medium term.

We expect cost-reducing technologies will be in greater demand as price levels rise. Longer-term, technology’s role in cost reduction is likely to increase significantly in the next decade, given the likely reversal of globalized manufacturing that led to decades-long deflation. For example, developed economies’ heightened focus on economic resilience through energy security and end-to-end supply chain controls, coupled with the prospect of stubbornly higher inflation, suggest greater investments in robotics and automation. In our view, dampened valuations in the Tech sector currently offer attractive entry opportunities in companies active in these technologies.

Some of the top disruptive themes that will enable productivity gains and cost reduction are trading at a discount to the broader market while providing better risk-adjusted returns. Renewable Energy, U.S. Infrastructure Development, Cybersecurity, Lithium & Battery Technology, and Disruptive Materials have been relatively defensive compared to the broader market while also standing out as key drivers of growth for the next decade among the clean energy and digital transition.

KHIRBET AL-FAKHEIT, West Bank — Faced with expulsion from their villages and the demolition of their homes by Israeli authorities, hundreds of Palestinians are trying to stay by reverting to an older form of shelter: living in underground caves.

The residents of Abu Sabha’s village and surrounding herding communities, whose forbears long lived in the caves that dot the area, have been fighting efforts to displace them from homes where their families have lived for decades. Some have deeds to their land from before the modern establishment of Israel in 1948.

But in May, the Israeli Supreme Court approved the expulsion of some 1,200 Palestinians in the villages so the Israeli army could use the land for a live-fire military training ground. That could set the stage for one of the biggest mass expulsions of Palestinians since 1967, which the United Nations says could amount to a war crime.

Residents in the villages scattered across the rolling hills in the area known as Masafer Yatta have been waiting anxiously to see what happens — and preparing their caves.

Israel says that the Palestinians living there were not permanent residents, and that it has the right to declare the area a closed military zone. Israeli authorities have long demolished homes and other structures in the area, citing violations such as a lack of building permits, which the Israeli government rarely gives to Palestinians. The residents have always rebuilt.

But after the third time Abu Sabha’s home was demolished, her family moved temporarily into an unused clinic and began readying a cave under their village to live in.

Access to the cave is through a pen where the family keeps their sheep, and down slippery stone steps made smooth by the passage of time and feet.

Abu Sabha’s cousin, Inshiraah Ahmad Abu Sabha, 58, walked into the cave recently, seemingly upbeat, as if she were playing the part of interior decorator on a reality TV home makeover show.

“This needs work,” she said, waving toward the stone walls and suggesting the addition of a row of shelves. Looking up at the low, cobwebbed ceiling, from which an electric light hung, she said, “It needs a vent up there.”

Sitting on a boulder and wearing a purple robe and a red and white kaffiyeh as a hijab, the cousin looked over at a nook, the smallest of the three areas of the cave.

“That’ll be a room for Zainab,” she said, turning to Abu Sabha’s 3-year-old granddaughter, who was playing on the dirt floor. “What do you think, Zainab? A room for you?”

Ahmad Abu Sabha remembers what the caves used to look like in her adolescent years when her family last lived in them. In the 1980s, residents moved above ground, first erecting tents and then, in the 2000s, building homes.

“They say we weren’t here before the ’80s, but I was born here in 1964 in another cave,” she said.

The Israeli military declared much of Masafer Yatta a restricted firing zone in the early 1980s, saying it had unique characteristics that no other area had, according to a court decision in the army’s favor. Israel has long maintained that the Palestinians in the area were not permanent residents before that designation.

Beyond the demolitions, Israel has engaged in what the United Nations calls “coercive measures” to make life difficult for Palestinians in the area, confiscating vehicles, restricting access by aid groups, and setting up checkpoints between villages that can make it difficult for children and teachers to reach schools, local leaders and aid groups said.

“Forcible transfer is contrary to the Geneva Conventions, and transfer does not always mean packing people up in trucks and taking them away,” said Noa Sattath, executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. “A slow mistreatment of the population in order to motivate them to leave is also considered forced transfer.”

The Palestinian Authority has said that evicting residents of the area would amount to ethnic cleansing, a charge often leveled by Palestinians and their advocates in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as land and building laws push them out in favor of Jewish settlers and settlements.

Two years ago, community leaders decided the caves could be the only option for villagers to stay in Masafer Yatta. While they would still be under expulsion orders, it would be harder for the Israeli military to remove them.

Work to renovate the caves has been slow and expensive for most families. Many caves lack access to electricity or spaces with vents for cooking. Aid groups have helped, pouring concrete over dirt floors, covering stone walls and dividing caves into rooms.

The villagers say Masafer Yatta is Palestinian land, a claim they say is backed by property deeds some residents have that date back to before the state of Israel was established in 1948.

Lawyers for the residents submitted aerial imagery to Israeli courts that they said showed continuous settlement of the villages over the past 45 years, including vehicle tracks leading to the caves.

But the Israeli Defense Ministry said the pictures did not show that the Palestinians were there permanently before 1980, saying they lived in the area only seasonally. The court agreed.

“Over the years, the closure order was violated by Palestinians, who began building illegally in the area,” the Israeli military said in response to questions sent by The New York Times. “The court ruled that the petitioners acted in bad faith and illegally built in the area while an interim order was issued, and rejected any attempted compromise offered to them.”

The Defense Ministry has said that declaring the area a firing zone is consistent with international law governing military occupation.

However, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator, Samer Abdel Jaber, said during a visit to Masafer Yatta in May that “as the occupying power, the Israeli authorities’ responsibility is to protect Palestinian civilians.”

He added, “Forcing 13 communities out to make room for military trainings is contradictory to that imperative, and simply inhumane and illegal.”

The U.S. government is watching developments in Masafer Yatta closely, according to the U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs, and has raised its concerns about evictions of Palestinians and demolitions of their homes with the Israeli government.

Under the Oslo Accords, the 1990s peace agreement that was supposed to lay the path for Palestinian statehood, two-thirds of the West Bank fell under what was supposed to be temporary Israeli control. Israel was meant to gradually withdraw from most of that area and transfer control to the Palestinians.

Instead, Israel has maintained its military occupation and allowed the building and expansion of settlements, illegal under international law, in the area it controls while pushing Palestinians out. Palestinians say this represents a creeping annexation of the West Bank.

“This is a clear plan to make people flee the area,” said Jaber Ali Dababseh, standing on the concrete foundation on which he built and rebuilt his home five times in the Masafer Yatta village of Khalet al-Dabe. “But we won’t be cowed.”

Around him was a small orchard of almond and apricot trees and olive vines. Dababseh, who lays tiles for a living and is a father of five, said his family has Ottoman-era deeds proving its ownership of the land.

In July, the Israeli military carried out military training with live fire and explosions in the valley below Dababseh’s orchard.

During the drills, a large bullet from a heavy machine gun hit the roof of a home while the family was inside, according to B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group. The Israeli association leading the legal battle petitioned the court for an emergency injunction to stop the training. It was rejected.

Lawyers say that with all legal avenues exhausted, they hope diplomatic pressure will help.

Now even as village residents continue to prepare caves for habitation, they keep a watchful eye on the roads for approaching bulldozers.

“If we don’t do the caves, where will we live?” Dababseh said. “They can demolish a home and they can confiscate a tent. Those sons of bitches have returned us to how our ancestors lived.”",electric vehicles,the boston globe

By Rob Garver October 21, 2022

The Biden administration's announcement earlier this month that it would ban the transfer of advanced U.S. semiconductor technology to China continues to reverberate through global markets. The ruling by the Department of Commerce affects not only U.S. firms that sell to China but any company whose products contain American semiconductor technology.

In mainland China, according to Bloomberg News, officials from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology have been summoning executives from domestic semiconductor manufacturers to assess how being deprived of high-tech manufacturing tools from overseas would impact their businesses. And companies that rely on imports of high-end semiconductors are assessing the viability of their businesses going forward.

In the U.S., semiconductor companies and other tech firms that count China among their largest single markets are facing potentially severe damage to their revenues. Other companies that manufacture tech products in China are having to recall U.S. employees because the ban also bars ""U.S. persons"" from supporting technology covered by the ban.

Internationally, large chipmakers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and South Korea's Samsung, as well as Netherlands-based ASML, which makes chip manufacturing equipment, are reassessing their business with China as they explore how deeply the new rules will cut into their sales.

""It really is reshaping the market,"" said James Lewis, senior vice president and director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The Koreans, the Taiwanese and some American companies are really nervous about it. I mean, everyone's asking, 'What can I still sell to China?' And in some cases, the answer is 'nothing,'"" he told VOA.

Targeting China's military

The Biden administration has characterized the ban as a national security measure, saying that withholding highly sophisticated semiconductors from China will hamper the development of Chinese weapons and surveillance technology.

The trouble is that the same technology that goes into Chinese weapons systems is also necessary for other goods, including electric vehicles, an area in which China is significantly further advanced than the U.S.

It remains unclear precisely how U.S. authorities will enforce the ban. It primarily targets the most advanced chip technology available, meaning that ""mature"" chip technology â€” older and less sophisticated chips â€” will not be affected.

Where the U.S. draws that line, however, could determine whether Chinese businesses such as smartphone manufacturers and commercial aerospace companies are left alone or devastated.

'Cold war' tactic

Experts and pundits saw the imposition of the tough new ban as a dramatic escalation of the Biden administration's efforts to keep China from being able to advance toward technological parity with the U.S.

Writing for the American news publication Foreign Policy, Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the move ""looks increasingly drawn from the Cold War playbook."" He also noted that ""the new restrictions, which will be fully implemented as soon as Oct. 21, go well beyond any previous measures by seeking to freeze China at a backward state of semiconductor development and cut Chinese companies off from U.S. industry expertise.""

In the Financial Times, U.S. national editor and columnist Edward Luce wrote that ""Joe Biden this month launched a full-blown economic war on China.""

""His escalation ... marks a final break with decades of U.S. foreign policy that assumed China's global integration would tame its rise as a great power,"" he added.

China reacts

Speaking at the start of the Chinese Communist Party's five-year congress Sunday, during which he is expected to be named to an extraordinary third term as party leader, Xi Jinping did not address the ban directly. However, he did promise to step up investment in areas that would help his country achieve ""technology self-reliance.""

""China will move faster to launch a number of major national projects that are of strategic, big-picture and long-term importance,"" Xi said.

In a statement provided to VOA by the Chinese embassy in the U.S., spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that he was not aware of any specific meetings being held in China.

""I would like to note that what the U.S. is doing is purely 'sci-tech hegemony.' It seeks to use its technological prowess as an advantage to hobble and suppress the development of emerging markets and developing countries,"" Liu said. ""The U.S. probably hopes that China and the rest of the developing world will forever stay at the lower end of the industrial chain. This will disrupt the global supply chain and industrial chain, and the final result will hurt itself and others alike.""

Industry concerned

Semiconductor companies have reacted carefully to the Biden administration's decision. Although they are acknowledging the government's concerns, they are signaling frustration that they were neither given clear guidance about how the ban will be applied nor given an opportunity to consult with the Commerce Department before it was put into place.

In a statement provided to VOA, SEMI, a trade group representing the semiconductor industry, said that its members understand the United States' national security concerns. In addition, it said, ""We are currently evaluating the potential effects of the Commerce Department's unilateral controls on the semiconductor industry in the U.S. and abroad. We plan to provide feedback to the government on these rules, as they were not previously published for public comment.""

""We believe it is vitally important that the U.S. government implements these rules in close collaboration with and input from our key international partners in order to limit unintended adverse consequences that could reverberate through the domestic supply chain of this critical industry.""

318,It’s Electric: Consumers Power up Interest for Various Modes of Transportation,https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Microlino_Pressefotos2020-10.jpg?w=1024,22/10/2022,"From electric scooters to electric-powered flying taxis and record-breaking electric speedboats, alternative transportation is taking shape in many forms.",https://wwd.com/eye/lifestyle/its-electric-consumers-power-up-interest-for-avant-garde-modes-of-transportation-1235392577/,"Centuries after Benjamin Franklin first discovered electricity with his kite experiment, electric-powered vehicles are giving consumers — and companies — new ways to take flight.

Whether landlocked or on the open waters, commuters, tree-huggers and adrenalin seekers alike are leaning into fuel-saving and planet-loving ways to get around. Elon Musk may have led the charge into electric vehicles (without leaving behind the add-on of striking design) but other innovators are powering up in different ways. Here’s a sampling of what is debuting and what lies ahead.

Last month, Eviation Aircraft completed the first maiden voyage for its all-electric aircraft “Alice” — an eight-minute journey at an altitude of 3,500 feet. What sets the aircraft apart is that it produces no carbon emissions, reduces noise and is more affordable to operate per flight hour compared to light jets or high-end turboprops. Geared for commuter and cargo transportation, Alice is expected to routinely run flights ranging from 150 to 250 miles.

Two domestic carriers — Cape Air and Global Crossing Airlines — have placed orders for 75 and 50 Alice aircraft, respectively. DHL Express is Eviation’s first cargo customer, having ordered 12 Alice eCargo planes.

Electric flying taxis are also on the horizon. Last month, United invested $15 million in Eve Air Mobility through United Airlines Ventures, which supports new technologies that are geared for sustainability and decarbonizing air travel. United’s alliance with Eve includes plans to a purchase 200 four-seater electric aircraft, with the first deliveries expected as early as 2026. Apparently, George Jetson was onto something as flying taxis or electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) are being eyed to try to revolutionize the commuter experience in cities internationally.

In lieu of combustion engines, eVTOL aircraft use electric motors for carbon-free flights. The Embraer S.A.-backed Eve has dreamt up “air taxis” that rely on conventional fixed wings, rotors and pushers for a lift-then-cruise design. The vehicle is supposed to be easy on the environment and on the ears — with a range of 60 miles and noise levels that are said to be 90 percent lower than conventional aircraft.

In addition to the Eve deal, United had already banked on electric-powered transportation. Last August, United gave a $10 million deposit to a California-based eVTOL company for 100 aircraft.

Electric-powered boats are also gaining interest. More than 100,000 people were watching from the land and the water when the world speed record for an electric-powered boat was smashed at 109 miles an hour at the Lake of the Ozarks Shootout. F1 H20 world champion Shaun Torrente was at the helm of the V32, Vision Marine’s widebody 32-foot catamaran that was designed by Vision Marine and Torrente’s STR. He first reached a speed of 104 mph and then cranked things up to 109 mph in a second run. Doing so topped the former world electric speed boat record that had been set by Jaguar with its Vector boat. So confident is Vision Marine in the V32 that the company has vowed to race anyone and anywhere in order to prove its propulsion technology is the world’s most powerful.

With multiple automotive companies chasing Tesla to roll out electric vehicles, GMC partnered with the shopping platform NTWRK to try to entice consumers with exclusive products. The hook-up was to draw attention to the Oct. 20 reveal of the first GMC Sierra EV Denali edition 1, its latest all-electric vehicle. Fashion designer Dao-Yi Chow was initially on board with a collaboration for an item that was designed to reflect Sierra EV’s technology, but that fell through.

Another of the custom items was transportable in a different way. The National Hockey League’s Auston Matthews, the league’s most valuable player for the 2021-22 season, presented four convertible traveler garment bags.

Thrill seekers of varying speeds are also finding options that aren’t exactly brand new. Some urban commuters have discovered the Vinghen Ti1, a cross between a stand-up electric scooter and an electric bicycle. Picture a two-wheeler with handlebars but no seat and no peddling required. Riders step onto a plywood deck and activate the electric power with a thumb throttle to make haste like riding a scooter. Initially rolled out through crowdfunding in fall 2020, the Vinghen Ti1 has since been updated and will be sold via Indiegogo for $1,549. There is also a VIP offer of $1,099 for the European-made Vinghen Ti1, which is billed as a “smart push-bike.”

The Swiss family-owned Micro uses less components for its toylike-designed cars to make eco-friendly vehicles. First conceived by Swiss inventor Wim Ouboter and his sons Merlin and Oliver, production started in a joint factory with the Italian company CECOMP in Turin this past summer. Customers in Switzerland have gotten behind the wheel of the Microliner sooner than most through a Pioneer series. More than 35,000 people have already reserved a Microlino, according to the company. The stylish vehicles cost about 15,000 euros and deliveries will start shipping in France and other European countries next year. Gucci chief executive officer Marco BIzzarri was among the first to land one.

Micro is also cooking up the Microlino Lite geared for younger customers without driver’s licenses, due to its maximum speed of 45 kilometers an hour. That model is expected to go into production next year. The company is also polishing up other categories, such as the Microletta, a three-wheeled e-moped that was first shown in 2020. It has a removable battery, can easily cover more than 100 kilometers on a single charge and can be recharged with normal electrical sockets at home. Classified as a tricycle in Europe, the Microletta can also be used without a driver’s license. Thousands have already lined up to order that one online, even though a production date has not yet been set.

One other addition to the Micro family is the Microlino Spiaggina Concept, which was inspired by legendary ’60s-era compact cars like the Fiat 600 Jolly or the Citroen 2CV. With a canvas white-and-blue striped roof and open on the sides and the rear, the car is meant to be conducive to passengers enjoying gentle breezes at the height of summer.",electric vehicles,wwd

An eco-friendly technological miracle that will allow us to continue our lifestyles without any guilt. But in reality, they may not be the solution to our climate woes.

Even if they aren’t the only transportation method on the market, electric cars (and other electric vehicles) will almost certainly be a major part of personal transportation in the future. They’ve been backed by governments worldwide, with tax incentives, infrastructure projects, and laws set to ban the sale of “gas-powered” vehicles across several countries. Almost all major automotive manufacturers are also on board with the concept. For example, Ford has begun producing electric versions of its more famous gas-guzzling models — like the F150 pickup truck and the Mustang. But if you read between the lines, the likes of Ford are hedging their bets. Ford isn’t aiming to go “all-electric” in Europe from 2035, though its electric vehicle output is undoubtedly part of the plan. The company wants its vehicle output to only involve “zero emissions” vehicles, which could mean a few things.

But EVs aren’t a golden bullet, they have some glaring issues that mean they may not be the green transport solution we’re actually looking for.

Infrastructure is Improving, But Not Enough

There is currently a huge drive to improve EV infrastructure in the United States, with the government and private businesses committing billions of dollars to various projects. One of those projects involves installing thousands of charging stations across the country. The technology that goes into those chargers, and the batteries they’re powering, is also massively improving. Some commercially available electric vehicles can now go over 500 miles on a single charge and pack in a few hundred miles of range from half an hour of charging time. Humanity hasn’t hit the wall on any of those technologies, and they will continue to improve at the top end while things like the 500 mile range will trickle down from extremely high-end vehicles to those within an average person’s price bracket.

From an environmental perspective, there’s also the question of where the electricity powering EVs comes from. If you live in the US, over 60% of it is from fossil fuels. Coupled with the vehicle’s batteries, which are an environmental nightmare to manufacture, EVs are far less green than they first appear.

Then there are other infrastructure issues, like the strain EVs would put on the power grid if everyone bought and had to repeatedly charge one. The adoption of EVs is a gradual thing, not everyone is going to head out and buy one tomorrow and even if they wanted to — that many cars would take years to manufacture. So there is time to get the power grid ready to take on the extra demand. However, this would involve politicians working together and doing something for the good of the country, so don’t hold your breath there.

Some of the Skeptics Will be Hard to Win Over

There will always be some limitations inherent to any technology. With electric vehicles, running out of juice is a significant problem. In an extreme case involving a regular car, you can walk to a gas station, fill a gas can, walk back, and put enough fuel in the vehicle to get it started and drive it to the gas pump. The same scenario in an EV will leave the driver waiting by the roadside until a recharging service shows up to put some juice into their vehicle. This issue isn’t too common, it accounts for roughly 4% of EV breakdowns, but that’s still a few thousand cases per year as things stand and will only grow as more people get EVs.

Then there’s the charging infrastructure itself. A level three charger will give you a few hundred miles of range in around half an hour. Couple that with the argument that a driver should be taking a 30-minute rest every few hundred miles anyway, and a long road trip in an EV suddenly becomes more than feasible. However, that’s a level three charger, and despite current EV infrastructure plans being very ambitious, many of the chargers that will be installed are Level Two. Those take far longer to charge a vehicle. Not everyone goes on road trips often, but range and charging times are two significant concerns EV skeptics repeatedly bring up. Even with the improvements in technology and infrastructure, many people will be looking for alternatives. And those alternatives already exist.

What about Hydrogen?

Hydrogen fuel cells, capable of turning the universe’s most abundant element into a clean fuel source, were arguably in the same bracket as nuclear fusion. Always five to ten years away and the perfect solution to one of the world’s biggest problems. But they aren’t five years away; they’re here and they’re here, and they work as advertised. The cells work by combining hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen, which as anyone who has done even the most basic science class will know, creates water.

The process also generates electricity, which charges a battery, which then powers the vehicle. This is around three times more efficient than burning gas and has zero emissions beyond water vapor. Refueling takes around the same amount of time as filling a car with gas, and if you break down, a canister of hydrogen would be all you need to get moving again.

Unfortunately, Hydrogen runs into some of the same issues EVs do, and in the case of infrastructure those issues are on a more extreme level. The US has fewer than 50 hydrogen fuel stations, and almost all of those are in the state of California. This lack of infrastructure prevents people from buying one of the few hydrogen cars available, as there’s no point in buying something you can’t fuel. This, in turn makes manufacturers say there is little demand and refrain from producing hydrogen cars.

Then there’s the hydrogen itself. Although it’s the most common element in existence, getting pure gas can be tricky. Most of it comes from subjecting natural gas to a high temperature in a process known as “steam reforming.” The process is energy-intensive, and the gas then needs to be captured and stored so it doesn’t float off into the upper atmosphere. Filling a hydrogen-powered car’s tank costs around $65, and that can get you anywhere up to 400 miles. Hydrogen cars are relatively expensive, but tax incentives can drop costs to around $35,000. There is also a chance vehicle and fuel costs would drop sharply if hydrogen became popular.

Biofuel Could Be a Greener Option

The majority of gasoline is made from oil, a fossil fuel. When fossil fuels are burned, a whole host of gases are released into the atmosphere. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) gets the most press but isn’t the only “greenhouse gas” released when you burn fossil fuel. Your car’s catalytic converter deals with most of them, but no oil-based fuels are particularly gentle on the environment. The difference between biofuel and a fossil fuel can be staggering, with some burning 86% cleaner than regular gas.

The case for biofuels may get even better when consider that some scientists claim the fuels are de facto carbon neutral. Those scientists argue that the CO2 released when you burn a biofuel was already present in the atmosphere before the plant used to create the biofuel was growing. It is stored in the plant, and then the fuel, for a relatively short time before being released back into the air. If we used nothing but biofuel, there would be no transport-related impact on atmospheric CO2 levels. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, gained their carbon thousands of years ago when the atmosphere was quite different. That carbon was removed from the equation and buried deep underground. The fact we’re drilling for it, then releasing it, is why gas adds to CO2 levels in the atmosphere.

You’re also more than likely filling your tank with some form of biofuel already. Most gas you’ll buy in the US contains around 10% ethanol, most of which comes from corn. Ethanol burns hotter than gas, so you couldn’t just fill your car with pure biofuel and be on your way as things stand, but you can convert an engine to run on fuel with a high ethanol content if you want to. Couple this with the fact manufacturing a car is incredibly energy intensive, and we have an out-of-the-box solution to climate change. With current manufacturing methods and logistics, it takes around two years before the average EV is more climate friendly than a regular car. Suppose you remove the manufacturing process for a standard car entirely by converting an existing vehicle to run on a highly efficient biofuel. In that case, there’s a chance it might be the greener solution over a vehicle’s lifetime.

Biofuels aren’t a total no-brainer, though. They tend to be made from things we eat, things that we feed to animals we eat or at least things that use farmland we could be growing food on. As a result, the amount we could produce without damaging food production is limited. However, combining biofuels with another popular vehicle could make them go a lot further and increase their level of practicality.

There is Another Option

There is a type of vehicle that isn’t affected by the issues facing both EVs and hydrogen cars, and has also been available for a long time. With a hybrid, you get many of the positives of EVs, but with a gas tank to back you up if charging isn’t an option for whatever reason. You can even use a plug-in hybrid the same way you would use an electric vehicle. Okay, the range on a plug in isn’t as impressive, but it’s usually more than you need for everyday use.

While some people will argue hybrids aren’t a “zero emissions” vehicles, they are a compromise, and they do make up for almost every shortcoming an electric vehicle has. From an environmental standpoint, driving a hybrid is still far better than even the most economical gas-powered cars. And there are ways to make a hybrid even greener.

Even if you don’t want to keep a car on the road, biofuel could be a way to make hybrids the environmental golden child of the vehicle world. One of the shortcomings of biofuel is its reduced range compared with pure gasoline, and limits on the overall availability. A gallon of gas will move your car further than a gallon of ethanol. An average hybrid will more than balance this out.",electric vehicles,reviewgeek.com
320,Guangdong: The Chinese province with more EV chargers than all of the US,https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2022-10/22/full/1666408163-9012.jpg,22/10/2022,"The coastal region, which borders Hong Kong, has built hundreds of thousands of public charging points - the EV equivalent of gas pumps - over the past few years",https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/this-chinese-province-of-guangdong-has-more-ev-chargers-than-all-of-the-us-122102200115_1.html,"Range anxiety is a thing of the past for electric vehicle owners in the Chinese province of Guangdong.

The coastal region, which borders Hong Kong, has built hundreds of thousands of public points — the EV equivalent of gas pumps — over the past few years. With 345,126 public chargers and 19,116 stations as of the end of September, Guangdong has the largest EV network in China, one that has more than doubled from a year ago, according to the Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Promotion Alliance. That’s around three times as many public chargers in the whole of the US, according to BloombergNEF data.

In a push to electrify their nations’ car fleets, governments around the world are trying to roll out and scale their public charging infrastructure swiftly enough to service new battery-powered cars. President Joe Biden’s infrastructure law devotes $5 billion to building a nationwide network of EV charging ports along major travel corridors in the US, while has spent or pledged $6.4 billion to support the charging industry. But both the US and have fallen well behind in building out their networks. A BloombergNEF analysis counted 112,900 public chargers deployed across the US and 442,000 in by the end of 2021, compared with 1.15 million in .

That gap is only growing. In just the past 12 months, China added 592,000 public chargers — more than the total number the Biden administration wants by 2030. The government plans to build enough charging stations for 20 million by 2025, according to a January document by the National Development and Reform Commission and nine other ministries.

These charging pylons are installed by third-party utility operators, state-owned electric companies — the two biggest of which are State Grid Corp. of China and China Southern Power Grid — as well as EV automakers like Inc. and China’s Nio Inc. and Xpeng Inc. operates more than 8,700 Supercharger stalls across 370 cities in China — roughly a quarter of its global Supercharger network.

China’s efforts to forge a green infrastructure are paying off: domestic demand for cleaner cars now dramatically dwarfs that of and the US. A quarter of all new cars purchased in China are new-energy vehicles, and NEV sales are forecast to hit a record 6 million this year.

In Guangdong, ubiquitous charging is also boosting ownership. EV sales jumped 151% in the first half of the year, according to the Guangdong Bureau of Statistics. The province now has over 1.4 million electric vehicles, the highest share in the country, according to the National Monitoring and Management platform for New-Energy Vehicles.

“With more chargers, there’s less range anxiety. EV sales therefore go up,” said David Zhang, an automotive analyst who is also dean of the Jiangxi New Energy Technology Institute. “Having so many chargers is definitely a breakthrough, but we’ve got to remember that charging still takes a lot longer than refilling the gas tank. That’s now the real obstacle.”

Guangdong’s provincial government is also doubling down on EV manufacturing. One-in-eight electric cars sold in China is now made in Guangdong. From January to July, local EV production jumped more than two-fold from a year before. Strong production capabilities can have a spillover effect, improving customer experience and aftersales service and even lowering pricing within the province, said Zhang.

Yoyo Gu, a 40-year-old housewife from Guangdong, traded in her Dongfeng Citroen C4 internal-combustion sedan for a GAC AION V Plus electric SUV earlier this year as part of a provincial subsidy program to bolster EV adoption.

“I got around 8,000 yuan off the bill,” said Gu. That’s on top of the EV purchase-tax exemption, which the government has extended until the end of 2023.

For the first few months, she recharged her SUV overnight at public charging stations in her neighborhood, before finally installing a private charging outlet in the parking lot of her residential complex.

“When my friends talk about buying an electric car, no one worries about charging anymore,” said Gu. “The car park below our apartment added five new chargers in the past couple of months and we can easily find one on the road.”",electric vehicles,business standard

The past two years have seen subdued capital spending by the private sector as well as the government owing to the pandemic and lockdowns.This is now expected to change. Even the RBI is expecting a revival in the capacity expansion (capex) cycle. Lately, we have witnessed major capex announcements across sectors. Private capex is now witnessing a boom as the demand revives.Let us first understand how a CapEx Cycle will favour investorsAs shown above, if there is an increase in the demand for a product then companies are unable to match the supply. This leads to companies increasing their capacities to expand production. An increased supply then leads to increased sales which in turn creates value for its shareholders.In the short-term horizon, a company might see margin compression due to investments in capex. The same starts easing as soon as a company starts production from new factories. This makes that company value accretive for its shareholders in the medium to long term.The Indian cpaex cycle currently is driven by a couple of reasons. First, globally the focus has turned from China to India for their manufacturing needs. This has been favourable for domestic companies.As the world eyes India for its next order, domestic businesses are ramping up their manufacturing and capex to meet the global supply.In Budget FY23, the government stepped up the capital expenditure by 35.4% to Rs 7.50 lakh crore in 2022-23 from the previous Rs 5.54 lakh crore. This makes it 2.9% of the GDP. This measure was taken to support the development for which heavy capital expenditure is required.More companies are qualifying for the Government’s Product Linked Incentive push for domestic manufacturing. It varies across fields from electronics to defence to electric vehicles.Deleveraged balance sheets of companies coupled with healthy profits are key growth factors for capex to increase. Auto, consumer durables, and infra are among those sectors which have announced major expansions. As this is the beginning of the cycle, it is the right time to invest in these companies.An investor needs to remain mindful and analyse where the company is investing. An important question to ask yourself is whether the company is generating incrementally higher returns on capex investments. If yes, then you have a stock that can be a big compounder.After three weeks of consolidation, the benchmark index witnessed a range breakout and prices are trading above its 21-day exponential moving average which is placed at 17,320 levels.The overall range for Nifty in the broader time frame is still showing a sideways trend as prices are trading within the range of 16,800 to 17,900 levels from the past more than 2 months.The momentum oscillator RSI (14) is hovering near the 50 level and indicating a flat trend without any jerks.The immediate support for the NIFTY is at 17,330 and below the 17,250 level. The resistance for the NIFTY stands at 17,800 levels followed by 17,900 levels.Globally, investors will be closely watching China’s GDP numbers which are slated to release early next week. The series of economic indicators also include industrial production, quarterly retail sales, and monthly unemployment rates. Further, market participants will also observe US GDP Growth Rate QoQ Advance data.Back home, movements in INR/USD will be closely monitored as Indian Rupee depreciated to a record low. In addition, quarterly results will drive market sentiment as they gather pace. Any management insights that might help predict the future outlook of the earnings trajectory would be much appreciated by D-Street.",electric vehicles,the times of india
322,Extinction Rebellion activists infiltrate Paris Motor Show to glue themselves to Ferrari supercars,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/10/22/08/63738715-0-image-a-22_1666424931441.jpg,22/10/2022,The dozen members of XR were protesting against the 'individual car model' that is promoted by the industry.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11343053/Extinction-Rebellion-activists-infiltrate-Paris-Motor-glue-Ferrari-supercars.html,"Activists from Extinction Rebellion last night glued themselves to Ferrari supercars at the Paris Motor Show.

The dozen members of XR were protesting against the 'individual car model' that is promoted by the industry.

An image showed the eco activists clutching a banner which said 'Global of self-destruction'.

The banner was held above three red sports cars that were covered in black paint.

Of the dozen, four of the activists sat on the floor with their hands glued to the hoods of the cars.

Footage shows the protesters chanting as groups of people at the Motor Show watched on and walked past.

XR said that eleven people were arrested after the protest last night.

The group wrote a series of tweets after the event and explained that they had glued themselves to the stand at the Paris Motor Show for several minutes.

XR said: 'The activists denounce a polluting industry which seeks to wash away its image with the help of green vehicles but continue to promote the individual car as the transport of the future.

The group also stated that they want companies to stop advertising individual vehicles and are asking that there is an improvement in public transport to reduce what they described as 'mobility precariousness.'

Activists from XR say that promoting individual vehicles as transport of the future is 'absurd' due to the current prices of electricity and fuel.

The group estimated that at the moment, cars currently cost 350 euros per month to run.

XR also stated that motors and batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles are made from materials where exploitation is 'extremely costly' in terms of human lives, energy and pollution.

It comes days after a separate group of eco activists glued themselves to the floor of a Porsche showroom in Germany.

They had vowed to remain there until their demands for the government to decarbonise the German transport sector were met but were removed and arrested yesterday.

The group of 9 activists from the Scientist Rebellion group glued their hands to the floor of the Autostadt, a Volkswagan museum in the northern city of Wolfsburg, Germany.

The eco activists, most of whom wore white lab coats, remained sitting on the floor - surrounded by the Porsches - for nearly 24 hours and were refusing to leave after spending the night there.

Some of the activists were on hunger strike, while others complained that Volkswagen had denied their request to have a bowl so that they could go to the toilet 'in a decent manner' while they were glued to the floor.

Meanwhile, other Scientist Rebellion protesters threw red ink on the steps in front of the VW factory in Wolfsburg before holding up signs which read 'no new car factory'.

One of the activists, PhD student Teresa Santos, tweeted that the activists remained inside the showroom after 19 hours stuck to the floor.

'We're not doing this because we like it,' Santos said. 'We don't, but business as usual isn't enough to face the climate and ecological crisis. We're acting like we're in an emergency because we are in an emergency.'

Gianluca Grimalda, a researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy who is part of the protest, said in a video from the floor of the Porsche showroom that the activists are there to 'denounce the responsibility of Volkswagen in the climate emergency that we are facing'.

He continued: 'Volkzwagan is the largest car manufacturer in Europe and the second largest in the world and the car sector has a huge responsibility in the climate emergency - 12 per cent of CO2 emissions that come from the car sector.'

The group are calling for an introduction of a speed limit on motorways in Germany and an introduction of a pass that would allow the public to travel on public transport in the country for nine euros.

Grimalda added that 'we must stop CO2 emissions and we must decarbonise'.

Climate protesters have been wreaking havoc across Europe as they demand governments act on addressing climate change.

In Knightsbridge, central London, Just Stop Oil protesters glued themselves to a road outside the world-famous Harrods after the activists sprayed orange paint across the building.

Earlier this month, protesters from Just Stop Oil tried to block another road and sprayed paint over an Aston Martin showroom.

And last week, two protesters appeared in court a day after throwing tomato soup over the van Gogh painting at London's National Gallery.

The painting itself was protected by a screen but damage was caused to the frame, according to the gallery in Trafalgar Square.

In Rome, furious drivers have resorted to dragging away a group of eco protesters who sparked fury by halting traffic on a busy motorway in Rome.

Rush hour motorists were blockaded on the Grande Raccordo ringroad outside the Italian capital on Monday by Last Generation activists who unfurled large banners protesting fossil fuels.

The disruption led to angry scenes as drivers got out of their vehicles to remonstrate with the eco-zealots and plead with them to get out of their way.

Some took matters into their own hands, physically dragging protesters out of the way.

But a female activist refused to grant him permission to get through without seeing his medical identification and demanded he handed it over.

He eventually brandished his ID card and the demonstrator allowed him to bypass the human barricade.",electric vehicles,daily mail

Well, traffic could soon be a thing of the past as a company has claimed their ‘world’s first flying car’ will be able to - literally - fly you out of crowded situations. Check out the futuristic vehicle here:

Loading…

California-based company Alef Aeronautics claim the Model A uses the existing urban infrastructure for driving and parking, except it can fly.

Their vision for the vehicle, which will set wannabe pilots back £270,000, is for it to potentially travel on futuristic road highways in the sky.

The brand plan to make their first deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2025 - just three years away - and state that their model is the only one able to both drive on roads and vertically take-off, almost like a helicopter.

The Model A is described as a ‘solution to the issues of modern congestion’ and has a driving range of 200 miles and a flight range of 110 miles.

But if you want to be one of the first to snap up one of these incredible vehicles, you’d better get in quick as pre-sale beganon 19 October, with £135 to be in the regular queue for the car, or £1345 to be in the priority queue deposit.

Alef CEO Jim Dukhovny said: ""The Alef Model is a modern solution for both urban and rural transportation needs in the 21st century because it is the fastest and most convenient transport ever created from the point of origin to the final destination.

""By enabling consumers to choose driving or flying mode, the Alef flying car allows the optimal path depending on road conditions, weather and infrastructure.""

Alef says they have been (bravely) test-driving and flying a full-size prototype since 2019.

They explained: ""It has a distributed electric propulsion system, no exposed propellers, extensive software flight stabilisation and safety system, elevon stabilisation system, and all-wheel driving.

""Key safety components include triple to octuple redundancy of all key components, real-time thousand point diagnostics, pre-flight reject start diagnostics, obstacle detection and avoidance among others.""

The company have been working on the flying car since 2015, with the founding team of Constantine Kisly, Pavel Markin, Oleg Petrov and Jim Dukhovny having over 70 years of experience in engineering and technology development under their belt.

Alef also have further models in the works, including a four-person sedan, Alef Model Z, scheduled for introduction in 2035 priced at £31k.",electric vehicles,ladbible
325,We are not here to have a nice time: CEO Aggarwal about Ola's work culture,https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2022-10/17/full/1665971324-3769.jpg,22/10/2022,"The yardstick at which the firm would like to be judged is the impact it is creating, said Ola CEO",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/we-are-not-here-to-have-a-nice-time-ceo-aggarwal-about-ola-s-work-culture-122102300008_1.html,"is a place for truly ambitious and aspirational people, said Bhavish Aggarwal, founder and CEO of Group, while responding to the reports about the alleged toxic work culture at the company.

is for people who want to leave behind a legacy by being part of the electric vehicle revolution in the country, said Aggarwal. The yardstick at which the firm would like to be judged is the impact it is creating, he added.

""We are a very hardworking company,"" Aggarwal told reporters during an event at the Ola Campus in Bengaluru. ""We are not here to build me-too product or company. We're not here to have a nice easy time and make money, obviously, all those things will happen. But we are here to follow our dreams and follow our mission.""

A Bloomberg report alleged a hostile work culture at Ola and propagated by Aggarwal. The Bloomberg report quoted some former and current employees alleging that Aggarwal has often lost his cool, and they had to bear the brunt of his ire. This included tearing up presentations because of a missing page number and calling the staff useless and crooked paper clips or the quality of printing paper.

The report alleged that an employee at Ola Future Factory had been asked to run three laps around the several-acre plant after the founder spotted a shuttered entryway that should have been left open.

""I don't need to address those people (employees) who are no longer here,"" said Aggarwal. ""True business creation is very similar to sports. And a sports environment is not where you have a nine-to-five (work). Ola is a place for truly ambitious and aspirational people who want to leave behind a legacy for themselves and, after a few years tell stories about how they were part of an (EV) revolution.""

He said this is the company's proposition for the employees, and there are many people for whom it works well. There are also workers who may not like the management and part ways in a mutually respectful manner.

""My style is more aggressive than probably the average new-age entrepreneur,"" said Aggarwal. ""We have a culture of impact, merit, high quality, and execution. Many examples of people who have done well in our environment.""

He said the opportunity given to the firm is immense in creating a future and paradigms which the world will follow.

""That is what drives me, and Ola and the right kind of people resonate with that,"" said Aggarwal.

When asked if Ola is cutting down spending amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment, Aggarwal said the firm has already tightened its belt and is comfortable with its cost structure. ""We don't feel the need to do any major tightening of our businesses significantly,"" he said.

Regarding profitability in the two-wheeler business and plans to raise new funding, Aggarwal said the firm has a strong balance sheet and capital partners. He said Ola's business model also doesn't consume a lot of capital as it is a direct-to-customer brand. ""You would be surprised how quickly we would achieve profitability,"" said Aggarwal.

Ola Group spans the ride-hailing platform and Ola Electric. Overall the company at a group level has a total workforce of around 10,000 people. The firm has about 2,000 engineers across the ride-hailing platform and Ola Electric. The company recently said it aims to increase its engineering talent pool to 5,000 over the next 18 months.

Ola has built the world's largest women-only factory in the Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu. It is being expanded to become the largest two-wheeler factory in the world, with an annual production capacity of 10 million units, contributing to one of every seven two-wheelers sold in the world.

The firm is also planning to launch an electric sports car in 2024. The plan will compete with Indian players, such as the Tata group and Mahindra & Mahindra, and global giants like Tesla and Hyundai.

It is already in direct competition with electric two-wheeler makers like Ather Energy, Hero Electric, Bajaj, and TVS Motor Company.

Ola Electric has been working to have a full-fledged electric vehicle ecosystem at a single site at its 'Future Factory'. At full scale, the company facility ""will produce a million cars, 10 million two-wheelers, and 100 gigawatt-hour of cells every year"".

The company on Saturday launched its new S1 Air electric scooter at an introductory price of Rs 79,999. The firm will also make a foray into electric motorcycles by next year.

Aggarwal said the firm had sold upwards of a lakh units since the company made a foray into the electric two-wheeler space last year in August. t is already producing more than 1,000 vehicles a day at the future factory. At present, the company has plans to scale that up. The firm expects that in the next 6-8 months, it will exhaust the current installed capacity, and it is, in parallel, expanding the capacity in the future factory.

""We can't share numbers, but we had a festive bumper season,"" said Aggarwal. ""Consumer demand is very high for our products, and their preference for EVs is skyrocketing.""",electric vehicles,business standard

That's thanks to the ""star power"" of the Tesla brand and the significance of the Roadster to electric-car history.

Tesla only made around 2,450 Roadsters from 2008-2012.

When a little California upstart named Tesla Motors released a limited-production, electric sports car in 2008, nobody could have predicted that the same company would someday be the most valuable carmaker in the world and be credited with sparking the electric-vehicle revolution.

Now Tesla's earliest cars are becoming hot collectibles, skyrocketing in price in recent years as Elon Musk's empire has exploded.

Tesla made roughly 2,450 Roadsters between 2008 and 2012, selling them for around $100,000 and up. The quirky two-door convertibles depreciated over time, with one changing hands for $38,000 on the car-auction site Bring a Trailer in 2018.

What a difference a few years makes. According to Hagerty, which provides insurance and other services to owners of collector cars, Roadster values have nearly doubled in the last two years, rising from an average of $69,000 in May 2020 to $127,000 this year. That's based on values provided by owners looking to insure their vehicles and largely reflects what they paid.

Some examples with particularly low mileage or desirable options have raked in much more than that. In January, a 2011 Roadster 2.5 Sport sold for $190,000. In May, someone paid $212,000 for one of the first 100 Roadsters built.

The run-up in prices lined up with a pandemic-induced frenzy in the collector-car market as enthusiasts turned to their vehicles as an escape, Brian Rabold, vice president of automotive intelligence at Hagerty, told Insider. A sexy, quick, and fun-to-drive car that's become an important piece of EV history, the Roadster also has a distinct appeal among fans of Tesla and of the wider electric-car movement, he said.

""It was Tesla's first product, so it has that special place in history. As Tesla's fortunes have grown and as it's become the company that it is today, a lot of that gets rooted back to the Roadster,"" he said.

In just the last five years, Tesla has matured from a shaky startup to a $700 billion company with a global presence and an army of loyal fans. Its CEO Elon Musk has become a celebrity and the richest person on the planet. All of this has helped catapult the Roadster to new heights, experts said.

Randy Nonnenberg, CEO of Bring a Trailer, chalked up the Roadster's recent success to the ""star power of the Tesla brand.""

Dan Richland, a retired literary agent who lives in California, owned a string of fast gas-powered cars over the decades but became sold on EVs after driving a Tesla Model S in 2020. Since then, he's bought multiple Teslas and plunged much of his net worth into the company's stock, he told Insider. He wanted to own the car that started it all and bought a 2010 Roadster for $140,000 in May.

""My thinking on it was: This is the original Tesla. It is a miracle that this car actually came to market,"" he said.

Part of the Roadster's appeal is that it's unlike any new electric car available today, said Pete Gruber, who runs Gruber Motor Company, an independent Tesla repair shop in Phoenix, Arizona that specializes in Roadsters. ""You've got four-door grocery-getters all day long,"" he said. ""Nothing out there is a brightly colored, two-seater sports car.""

Gruber launched an online marketplace that connects Roadster sellers and buyers in late 2020 and is planning to open a Roadster storage facility to capitalize on the boom in sales. In the last couple of years, he's seen more serious collectors buying up Roadsters as investments.

According to Hagerty, Roadster values have leveled off slightly, reflecting a slowdown in the broader collector-car market. Both Rabold and Nonnenberg expect prices to rise for the foreseeable future.

""Will it be a rocket ship and they'll be worth 20x what they are now? Probably not. But are they a very solid and appreciating investment? I think so,"" Nonnenberg said.

But will this become the norm for automakers in the U.S.? As new all-electric vehicle ranges require an expansive supporting network – including battery production, mineral mining, charging stations and much more, automakers are looking to expand their role and break into the energy industry to future-proof their vehicle businesses. The EV company Tesla Motors is viewed by many as more than just an automaker, crossing over into the energy and tech industries with its products and services. From early on, Tesla launched a charging network, now with over 30,000 Global Superchargers where drivers can charge their Tesla cars in around 15 minutes, to support EV uptake at a time when it was less common. Tesla established its energy generation and storage business in 2015, launching a range of home batteries, which could be charged using solar power, providing a backup to the main grid. In addition, Tesla has developed a series of solar panels and full solar roofing.

Tesla also decided to buck the trend of traditional automakers by selling its vehicles directly to consumers, rather than through franchised dealerships. Tesla’s founder Elon Musk has gained a wide following for his innovative designs and decisive leadership, much in the same way as several major tech companies. His foray into space travel has made him more popular than ever, with people watching to see what he’ll create next. Related: What To Expect For Q3 Energy Earnings

As the first automaker to notably transition into the energy business, Tesla has laid the groundwork for other car manufacturers to build upon. But, while it was the first to launch a comprehensive range of EV and energy products, it will not be the last, as other companies are hot on its tail. General Motors (GM) announced this month that it has plans to launch its energy business through its GM Energy unit, in competition with Tesla.

Travis Hester, GM head of EV growth operations, stated of the move, “We’re getting into the entire ecosystem of energy management.” He explained, “Our competition in this space on the [automaker] side is really only Tesla, which is a strong energy management company… There are a lot of analogies you can draw with Tesla.” Tesla’s energy business lost $129 million on revenues of $2.8 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, GM is hoping its business development will help it double its annual revenue to $280 billion by 2030.

GM believes the market potential for energy storage and management stands at between $120 billion and $150 billion. The automaker will launch its Ultium Charge 360 public charging service alongside Ultium Home and Ultium Commercial. Its Ultimate Home service will offer stationary storage batteries, solar panels, and hydrogen fuel cells. The model is similar to Tesla’s Powerwall home energy service. GM expects to launch this product towards the end of 2023 alongside the introduction of its first Chevrolet Silverado EV truck. The new EV truck is expected to be capable of sending electricity back into the home supply in the case of a blackout, as has already been seen with Ford’s F-150 Lightning following its partnership with Sunrun.

The major automaker hopes to establish a system of micro-grids that connect to hydrogen fuel cells, to provide zero-carbon power. GM is also partnering with SunPower to offer consumers solar panels to boost renewable energy generation. The firm will also work closely with Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and Con Edison, with plans to rapidly develop more partnerships to ensure it has all areas of energy expertise represented.

GM’s adoption of hydrogen technology sets it apart from Tesla, with Musk having openly stated his opposition to hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cells, calling the technology “extremely silly.” Major automakers entering the renewable energy market could become highly competitive with Tesla, particularly if they expand their energy businesses to include green hydrogen as well as solar power and other renewable energy sources.

While GM is the latest, and maybe one of the most notable, automakers to shift into the energy industry, other car manufacturers have already established energy businesses in recent years. German luxury automaker Mercedes-Benz created its U.S. energy division in November 2017, with BMW, Ford, and other auto companies also launching their own energy storage and vehicle-to-grid pilots that same year. Mercedes-Benz Energy Americas partnered with solar panel distributor Vivint Solar, with Vivint’s COO Brian Christensen explaining “As I look at how industries are evolving, I think there is a really good fit between the automotive industry and the home.”

After years of Tesla leading the U.S. EV-energy market, GM, and other automakers are now looking to compete with the EV giant by expanding their businesses through strategic partnerships with energy and tech companies. With the potential to profit not only from the auto business but also from the associated battery storage, charging, and renewable energy sectors, we can expect many more automakers to replicate this model over the next decade.

On Wednesday, Hyundai's global chief operating officer Jose Munoz told Reuters Korea's top automaker is investigating child labor violations in its U.S. supply chain and plans to ""sever ties"" with Hyundai suppliers in Alabama found to have relied on underage workers.

A Reuters investigative report in July documented children, including a 12-year-old, working at a Hyundai-controlled metal stamping plant in rural Luverne, Alabama, called SMART Alabama, LLC.

The UAW said Friday Hyundai's decisions to sever ties with some suppliers ""will likely result in job losses for hundreds of workers, without doing anything to address what appears to be a systemic problem."" The union called on Hyundai to instead ""improve working conditions for the U.S. workers who make Hyundai vehicles.""

Hyundai said it ""does not tolerate illegal employment practices in any Hyundai entity. Our investigation remains ongoing, and we are working with authorities in their inquiry of this matter.""

The White House did not immediately comment.

Hyundai Motor Group on Tuesday plans to break ground on its $5.5 billion electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturing facilities in Georgia -- and Biden administration officials are expected to attend.

The automaker is expected to begin commercial production in the first half of 2025 with an annual capacity of 300,000 EV units.

Hyundai is lobbying the Biden administration to revise a law approved in August that immediately barred electric vehicles outside North America from receiving $7,500 consumer tax credits. That made all Hyundai EVs currently for sale in the United States ineligible.

The law includes tens of billions of dollars in new loan, tax credit and grant programs for automakers to build cleaner vehicles.

The UAW has previously sparred with Hyundai and unsuccessfully sought to organize workers at its Alabama plant and at other foreign-owned auto plants.",electric vehicles,autoblog

The past two years have seen subdued capital spending by the private sector as well as the government owing to the pandemic and lockdowns.This is now expected to change. Even the RBI is expecting a revival in the capacity expansion (capex) cycle. Lately, we have witnessed major capex announcements across sectors. Private capex is now witnessing a boom as the demand revives.Let us first understand how a CapEx Cycle will favour investorsAs shown above, if there is an increase in the demand for a product then companies are unable to match the supply. This leads to companies increasing their capacities to expand production. An increased supply then leads to increased sales which in turn creates value for its shareholders.In the short-term horizon, a company might see margin compression due to investments in capex. The same starts easing as soon as a company starts production from new factories. This makes that company value accretive for its shareholders in the medium to long term.The Indian cpaex cycle currently is driven by a couple of reasons. First, globally the focus has turned from China to India for their manufacturing needs. This has been favourable for domestic companies.As the world eyes India for its next order, domestic businesses are ramping up their manufacturing and capex to meet the global supply.In Budget FY23, the government stepped up the capital expenditure by 35.4% to Rs 7.50 lakh crore in 2022-23 from the previous Rs 5.54 lakh crore. This makes it 2.9% of the GDP. This measure was taken to support the development for which heavy capital expenditure is required.More companies are qualifying for the Government’s Product Linked Incentive push for domestic manufacturing. It varies across fields from electronics to defence to electric vehicles.Deleveraged balance sheets of companies coupled with healthy profits are key growth factors for capex to increase. Auto, consumer durables, and infra are among those sectors which have announced major expansions. As this is the beginning of the cycle, it is the right time to invest in these companies.An investor needs to remain mindful and analyse where the company is investing. An important question to ask yourself is whether the company is generating incrementally higher returns on capex investments. If yes, then you have a stock that can be a big compounder.After three weeks of consolidation, the benchmark index witnessed a range breakout and prices are trading above its 21-day exponential moving average which is placed at 17,320 levels.The overall range for Nifty in the broader time frame is still showing a sideways trend as prices are trading within the range of 16,800 to 17,900 levels from the past more than 2 months.The momentum oscillator RSI (14) is hovering near the 50 level and indicating a flat trend without any jerks.The immediate support for the NIFTY is at 17,330 and below the 17,250 level. The resistance for the NIFTY stands at 17,800 levels followed by 17,900 levels.Globally, investors will be closely watching China’s GDP numbers which are slated to release early next week. The series of economic indicators also include industrial production, quarterly retail sales, and monthly unemployment rates. Further, market participants will also observe US GDP Growth Rate QoQ Advance data.Back home, movements in INR/USD will be closely monitored as Indian Rupee depreciated to a record low. In addition, quarterly results will drive market sentiment as they gather pace.

Read more here.",https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/sustainable-investing/sustainable-investing-align-returns-with-higher-aspirations/,"Introduction

For many investors, it is no longer just a matter of setting financial goals for their portfolios. Increasingly, it may also be as important for them to ensure that how their money is invested reflects their values and concerns.

For some, these may revolve around the challenges posed by a rapidly increasing world population, leading to concerns about food supply. And, if agricultural output must significantly increase to feed an increasing population, how can we ensure that the world’s resources are used responsibly?

For others, it may be climate change that resonates. Their focus may be on achieving carbon neutrality and ensuring that there are enough raw materials to support the energy transition.

We believe that for such investors, the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, and how available investment solutions may align with them, can offer a useful way to help gauge whether their portfolios reflect their values and concerns.

What are the UN Sustainable Development Goals?

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) represent a globally agreed upon framework that can help investors understand and measure how their portfolios are contributing to addressing critical global sustainability issues.

An overarching principle of the SDGs is to provide a viable model for economic growth that does not come at the expense of certain societies or the environment. SDGs comprise 17 broad, complex and interconnected environmental and social goals, with detailed targets representing a global consensus on sustainable development priorities through 2030.

Sustainable Development Goals

Source: United Nations

A Framework to Guide Investment Decisions

SDGs have gained widespread support across a broad constituency, including corporations, international development organizations and governments. Asset managers and asset owners are increasingly looking to align investment processes with these goals, as interest in and demand for responsible investing continues to grow.

SDGs can provide a framework to mobilize the trillions of dollars needed to achieve these goals, and also to identify opportunities for social, environmental and financial returns. The cost of achieving SDGs is enormous, but so are the potential economic benefits. In addition, the costs of failure have the potential for, in our opinion, large economic consequences.

Investors can use SDGs in several ways, depending on their specific objectives. From a purely financial perspective, SDGs can help investors understand the sustainability issues that can create material risks within a portfolio. Similarly, they can help identify investments that can benefit from offering solutions to sustainability challenges. At a more macro level, SDGs can help identify systemic risks as well as emerging long-term megatrends that may drive financial returns in the future. For investors looking to measure both societal and financial returns, SDGs offer a framework to measure impact. Providing a common language among investors and companies, SDGs also serve as a platform for engagement on sustainability issues.

LUXURY WOMEN TO WATCH 2023



Amy Astley

Global editorial director and U.S. editor in chief

Architectural Digest

New York

""My proudest achievement in luxury is definitely breathing new life into the sleeping beauty that was Architectural Digest""

What do you like most about your job?

There is no doubt that my favorite part of my job is the day the photo-shoot film — and/or the video — arrives.

As the team and I spend months — even years — tracking projects, it is very gratifying to have the final results in our hands.

I am always excited to share these images with our audience on all our many platforms: print, social, web and video.

Usually, the photographs exceed my expectations. It is always a moment where I feel great pride in our team, as it takes a village to produce content of this quality.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Communication is so important, especially as Architectural Digest is a global brand and we work closely with our fellow ADs in many other markets and time zones.

Architectural Digest is so much more than simply magazines now. Fresh content is appearing daily on the sites, the many social accounts and YouTube, along with in-real-life events, so there are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of platforms.

The operations are complex and there is a lot of content being shared. Fortunately, our teams have a lot of goodwill toward one another and we are very nimble. That helps tremendously.

What is your work priority for 2023?

My top priority for 2023 is to continue to develop Architectural Digest globally as one unified team sharing content seamlessly and efficiently.

I have big digital goals for each of Architectural Digest's seven markets, especially around traffic, audience and video. So this process has to be perfect.

Architectural Digest's buzzy videos and features often go viral, and for 2023 I am really focusing on creating major cultural moments that resonate with consumers along with the industry.

What is your proudest achievement?

My proudest achievement in luxury is definitely breathing new life into the sleeping beauty that was Architectural Digest.

I feel that we have preserved and, in fact, increased the prestige and authority of the product, while also creating cultural buzz and relevance with a fresh and inclusive editorial vision and a thriving digital presence which have won Architectural Digest an ever-increasing and younger digital audience.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

In 2023, luxury is certainly evolving to include meaningful experiences.

At Architectural Digest, especially post-pandemic, we see a real hunger for special in-real-life events, both for consumers and trade.

I am very focused on how Architectural Digest can offer this to readers and to the trade.

I think you see the extension of this in high-end home design, too. People want special pools, gardens, spas, gyms, Pilates studios, screening rooms, yoga and meditation spaces — places to either gather or to be alone and to have a transformative experience.

Stephanie Bennett

Cofounder/president

Diamond Spas Inc.

Frederick, CO

“My priority will be the same as it has been for the past 26 years: making sure Diamond Spas is producing an exceptional, quality product that stands out from other pool and spa manufacturers in the industry”

What do you like most about your job?

Diamond Spas offers a customized product built to client specifications. Therefore, no one project is like the next.

It is incredibly rewarding to walk through the fabrication department and witness the amazing products being built.

Seeing the collaboration between the clients and our design team, then moving forward through engineering and fabrication is an added bonus. The end result is a stunning hand-crafted aquatic product, unique like each one of our clients.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

As with all businesses, supply chain issues were complicated to navigate through during the pandemic.

Diamond Spas fared well, but it was a constant stress ensuring we had metal, jets, pumps, spa controls, et cetera.

We utilize the best manufacturers in the industry for all of our pool and spa equipment. These manufacturers worked closely with us and made Diamond Spas a priority in getting the product needed to build our product. I feel fortunate to say we never missed a ship date.

Thankfully, our inventory stock is back up to 100 percent. Keeping a close eye on the supply chain will be an ongoing task and will continue through 2023.

What is your work priority for 2023?

My priority will be the same as it has been for the past 26 years: making sure Diamond Spas is producing an exceptional, quality product that stands out from other pool and spa manufacturers in the industry.

Our product line is artistic, sophisticated and caters to the needs and stylish preferences of our clients. Our goal has always been to exceed client expectations.

What is your proudest achievement?

My proudest achievement is manufacturing an upscale aquatic product that is sustainable.

The entire Diamond Spas’ product line is produced from recycled sheet metal, stainless steel or copper. The recycled content for new stainless-steel sheets lies between 75 to 80 percent.

Our copper sheets come from 95 to 99 percent recycled copper. All Diamond Spas vessel shells are 100 percent recyclable making them fully sustainable.

Stainless steel and copper are wonderful materials to work with. They are eco-compatible, aesthetically appealing and highly durable.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

I believe high-end consumers will continue to invest in outdoor living. These living areas are becoming more extravagant with deluxe outdoor kitchens, multiple pools, spas, cold therapy pools, swim spas, fire features, water features and audio systems.

I believe our clientele will continue to want luxury aquatic products designed and fabricated to meet their personal wants and needs.

Diamond Spas can fabricate any shape, depth, seating arrangement, infinity edges, glass walls, et cetera. The list of what we are capable of fabricating is endless.

I have found that our clientele appreciates the numerous possibilities made available to them when working with the Diamond Spas’ team. We admire their creativity and look forward to making their visions become a reality.

Lucrezia Buccellati Wildenstein

Co-creative director

Buccellati

New York

“Using unique sources of inspiration and working to see them come to life through our one-of-a-kind pieces is a true testament to luxury craftsmanship”

What do you most like about your job?

I love expressing myself through design. I also love finding inspiration in the beautiful jewelry I am surrounded by: recent collections, pieces from the archives or new designs that I am working on.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

While it is exciting to continue to find ways to inspire younger generations, it is certainly a balancing act to retain the timeless DNA of Buccellati, while also adapting to the latest trends.

What is your work priority for 2023?

For 2023, our goal is to further expand the market in the United States and strengthen the awareness of Buccellati among new, engaged audiences and clients.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

My proudest achievement so far has been working to bring masterpieces from the art world into our jewelry.

Using unique sources of inspiration and working to see them come to life through our one-of-a-kind pieces is a true testament to luxury craftsmanship.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

In 2023, I believe that offering a unique client experience will continue to be a great focus for luxury.

With that, I foresee a higher demand for custom and bespoke pieces, with a celebration of extraordinary, one-of-a-kind and special luxury items at the forefront of client desires.

Brisa Carleton

CEO

Grace de Monaco

New York

""Luxury connoisseurs are no longer simply focused on products that meet the highest standards of design and creativity, but are now demanding sustainability, transparency and a greater global conscience from the brands they love and choose to purchase""

What do you most like about your job?

It is a privilege to lead a purpose-driven luxury brand that represents such an iconic legacy.

Princess Grace's impact and influence live on not only through her timeless style, which inspires Grace de Monaco, but also through the example she set as a philanthropist and humanitarian.

We have an incredible team at the Grace de Monaco who are equally passionate about our exquisite products, and we take great pride in the fact that all revenues from the sale of Grace de Monaco products support Princess Grace’s wish to nurture the brightest stars of tomorrow in theater, dance and film through the Princess Grace Foundation.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

The biggest challenge we faced was creating an entirely new luxury brand that lives alongside established, centuries-old luxury houses globally.

It's incredibly important to us that we stay true to Princess Grace's ethos. During her lifetime she was passionate about supporting young artists and pursuing modern design, so we spent a lot of time ensuring that our fragrances and silks reflect a modern aesthetic that she would have wanted for today, rather than staying tied in the past.

We are fortunate to be working with top French luxury designers, many of whom have a personal link to Monaco, so we are able to obtain real authenticity in everything we create.

What is your work priority for 2023?

2023 is going to be an exciting year for us.

The Grace de Monaco team has worked tirelessly to produce our initial product offering and bring it to market in record time, despite the industry being upended due to inventory and supply chain issues over the last two years.

We launched initially with Neiman Marcus and have a roster of the world’s renowned luxury retailers to follow.

Our priority is the global expansion of our brand as our new partnerships come to life in the U.K., Middle East and Asia.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Launching the first-ever luxury brand created entirely for good is our greatest achievement to date.

We created a new business model as a modern way to continue to fund the Princess Grace Awards program whose mission is to uphold her legacy and her passion for supporting emerging artists.

Grace de Monaco is wholly owned by the Princess Grace Foundation, overseen by Prince Albert of Monaco, [and] which supports emerging artists in theater, dance and film.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

Luxury connoisseurs are no longer simply focused on products that meet the highest standards of design and creativity, but are now demanding sustainability, transparency and a greater global conscience from the brands they love and choose to purchase.

I see this emphasis on purpose and positive impact becoming even more important in 2023 and into the future.

Ayesha Coker

Vice president of marketing

Porsche North America

Atlanta

“Even during the current transformational push for electrification and new technologies within the automotive industry, we prioritize our customers, meaning we must continue to meet and exceed their expectations”

What do you most like about your job?

There is nothing like seeing the excitement and joy of someone after having taken the wheel of a Porsche for the first time. Without exception, it warms my heart to see that instant emotional connection that people feel from driving our sports cars.

So, for me, the most gratifying part of the role is creating those unique and memorable luxury brand experiences that’ll last a lifetime.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Since assuming my new role overseeing marketing for the U.S., one challenge I have encountered is balancing my new executive committee duties with staying closely engaged with my team, dealers and customers.

While navigating this new territory, I have been fortunate to have a strong and dependable team, which has given me the leeway to prioritize what requires my input while delegating other responsibilities where needed.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Next year marks our 75th anniversary. To celebrate this milestone, we are planning several events that will excite our customers and fans of the brand.

Most noteworthy is our signature event, Rennsport Reunion VII, which is a family reunion of sorts, where we will all gather at Laguna Seca near Monterey, California to celebrate the racing heritage, new products and experiences of Porsche.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

After building a 12-year career with a brand and team you love, I would have to say my recent promotion to vice president of marketing for Porsche Cars North America is one of my greatest professional achievements. To achieve this goal with a global luxury brand that you believe in and have grown with over the years is truly a privilege.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

For Porsche, taking the customer experience to the next level is the benchmark that we continue to push in a competitive luxury segment.

Even during the current transformational push for electrification and new technologies within the automotive industry, we prioritize our customers, meaning we must continue to meet and exceed their expectations.

Emilie Cotter

Chief communications officer

Audi of America

Washington, DC

“Luxury is at its best when we curate the meaningful connection points between our values, our products and our people”

What do you most like about your job?

Audi of America and the automotive industry, at large, is in the middle of a massive transformation.

I love that my job gives me the opportunity to create new pathways forward and build teams to advance such significant progress.

Audi’s focus is to lead the way to an electric, more sustainable future, and communications is a powerful catalyst for that change.

Not only are we driving customers to an entirely new experience with electrification, we are also bringing together key stakeholders and acting as a bridge to drive meaningful progress in the business.

Working in the premium category means that we get to do all of that while delivering unique experiences.

One of the great joys of my job is delivering moments that make people feel special and cared for. I want them to remember Audi as a brand that brings a little memorable magic as well as a fantastic experience through our vehicles.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Without challenge you cannot grow, so I spend a lot of time thinking about the current roadblocks as well as what might be ahead.

My job is to guide teams, to do the right things at the right time, to push the business on the right path and also looking forward to steer the strategic direction that will set the communications framework for the longer term.

That balance of solving immediate business needs while setting the stage for the future is an ongoing challenge that I really love.

What is your work priority for 2023?

My top priority for 2023 is sustainable acceleration – moving at speed and scale while taking care of my team. As a brand, our goals and objectives are bold, and we want to push forward aggressively.

I am really aware we need to achieve these ambitions in a way that also places a premium on our people.

Now more than ever, teams need explicit support to build in time and space to create, think and rejuvenate while managing the needs of the business.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I am proud to work for Audi and there are so many programs I could mention – from Monterey Car Week to our exceptional dinner series with noma, the launch of our Malibu Design Loft and the creation of our first-ever Audi City Guide.

But what I am really most proud of is that our work has a purpose.

Luxury is at its best when we curate the meaningful connection points between our values, our products and our people.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

There is no singular definition of luxury. It evolves and morphs with trends, cultural moments, economic shifts and individual perspectives. Sometimes it is scarcity, other times it is badging or even the freedom of time and space.

In 2023 I believe “discovery” will play a big role in luxury – as time continues to be limited and digital algorithms dictate much of what we see online.

I think experiences, artists and creators off the beaten path will become even more coveted. And as someone who loves to seek out the unexpected, I cannot wait.

Senior vice president of operations

Highsnobiety

New York

“Working with incredible brands like Gucci, Saint Laurent, Burberry and many more, I am proud to say each production and project we execute continues to innovate from the previous season to evolve with our audience.”

What do you most like about your job?

As the general manager and U.S. lead in operations, being able to nurture, grow and support talent across the organization is my passion. Connecting the right individuals across the organization to collaborate and cultivate our best work with brands and editorially.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Highsnobiety, as a rule, never stops looking to the future and, as a result, is continually evolving as a business. It is the best kind of challenge to continue to match that evolution at every step.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Being connected to more brands that are searching for their brand to be rediscovered, and reach the cultural pioneer.

We have had some amazing projects with a variety of brands and have had the opportunity to show up in culture and encourage discovery of the story behind the brand and we would like to continue fostering that growth.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Each story we cover and brand we help reach the cultural pioneer becomes our proudest achievement.

Our team continues to innovate and push the envelope for each project we deliver.

Working with incredible brands like Gucci, Saint Laurent, Burberry and many more, I am proud to say each production and project we execute continues to innovate from the previous season to evolve with our audience.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The evolution of luxury is something our team is constantly thinking about. A few years ago, we launched a white paper called ""The New Luxury,"" taking a look at some of these pretty seismic shifts which have been taking place in the space.

The work was really well-received by the industry, which was fantastic to see, and so we partnered with Boston Consulting Group to continue to put out forecasting and observations about the luxury space, most recently releasing the ""Luxury 3.0"" white paper earlier this summer.

REALM Global

Jackson, WY

“At the end of the day, REALM’s commitment is to ensure that we are providing tools and connections that optimize the results for our constituents and their clients and producing those outcomes will stay strongly in our purview through 2023”

What do you most like about your job?

I love being a community builder.

Enabling connections that help people thrive in their personal and professional lives is so exciting.

I think that the power and importance of networking has never been more profound and we have a unique opportunity to define how future communities assemble, interact and influence.

The REALM membership is not only a very unique community, but it is also comprised of other “builders” who inspire me with their creativity and desire to shape the future of belonging.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

I think that we are in a period where technology is exacerbating the speed and pace of change more than ever and the importance of connection and communication is critical.

Working in a virtual environment, keeping up with the demands of growth across multiple geographies in tumultuous times is challenging.

Our membership performs at the highest level of service in our industry, and they are constantly elevating. Maintaining those same standards within REALM is our commitment and we take that responsibility very seriously.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Our focus is bringing REALM to other luxury verticals that help to support the purpose and network of trusted advisors.

We have had so much fun in 2022 as we have been able to physically convene again and we are excited to welcome other complementary disciplines to the community, both in-person and virtually.

At the end of the day, REALM’s commitment is to ensure that we are providing tools and connections that optimize the results for our constituents and their clients, and producing those outcomes will stay strongly in our purview through 2023.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I am humbled that I have had the opportunity to manifest an idea into something that no longer is being shaped by only me and my perception of luxury.

For me, REALM is the luxury achievement that has resulted in connections with people that inspire me and challenge me to be better in all respects of my life – what a gift.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

There are so many divisive factors that have shaped our latest chapter in history.

Now, as we are all emerging from a truly transformational time, luxury has an opportunity to bring people even closer together, convening communities and taking down silos.

I see luxury as being technology and innovation-enabled but more human than ever.

Jennifer Fay

Owner

Linen Alley

Jackson, WY

“My priority is fine tailoring the balance between the unparalleled innovation in design and the mastery and sophistication of crafting your own personal sanctuary with the unique combination of luxury bedding and luxury mattresses”

What do you like most about your job?

My favorite part of my job always has been and is still discovering and sourcing the world’s finest, most inspired products. Never settling for the ordinary, daily striving to achieve and maintain our legacy as a luxury brand, our distinctive sense of place in Jackson Hole.

My enduring mission: supplying form and function, beauty and comfort together. I cocreated Linen Alley 18 years ago, crafted to provide an elevated shopping experience that is today still rooted in my personal ethos on styling.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

The biggest challenge by far is market volatility and waning consumer confidence.

Coming off the supply chain issues in 2021 and one of the hottest economies, there was huge motivation to maintain a backstock of inventory to meet immediate demand.

But in 2022, with global turmoil and recession fears, it is finding balance. How much and what to inventory to meet these two conflicting demands is very challenging.

What is your work priority for 2023?

I sell the crafted luxury of the everyday. My priority is fine tailoring the balance between the unparalleled innovation in design and the mastery and sophistication of crafting your own personal sanctuary with the unique combination of luxury bedding and luxury mattresses.

As restful sleep takes center stage, the importance of spoiling your senses in dreamy comfort is my everyday priority.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

The story of Linen Alley is a history of serving the community I was born in and love. A store built by women, run by women, beauty and comfort are woven into every fiber of what Linen Alley has to offer.

We have achieved the finest selection and most exquisite collection of products available; impeccably curated by my dream team of capable women with a combined 50-plus years of textile experience. This unparalleled combination is my proudest achievement.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

Luxury has always been synonymous with quality. As prices climb for lower-end pre-luxury items, customers are more conscious about the value of what they buy.

Luxury providers like Linen Alley have a prime opportunity to legitimize and define the authenticity of what luxury is and why the investments in craftsmanship and quality are not just for the most exclusive population. [It is about] form and function, everyday luxury that makes your life better.

In some spaces, like your home, luxury items that perform as exceptionally as they look are being realized as a crucial part of a more healthy and happy life.

Candice Fragis

Luxury brand consultant

London

“We were at the forefront of what is now called the circular economy with the aim of de-stigmatizing older season product and re-educating the consumer about quality versus seasonality”

What do you like most about your job?

The diversity of working across a range of businesses and brands, working from the start of the creative process through to the commercial growth strategies. This has evolved within my clients from traditional retail and brands to digital fashion and AI technology.

Sustainability has always been a passion and focus for me from the start of my career. I am now able to be selective with which clients I onboard and only engage with businesses who share that passion, so we are ultimately working towards a common goal of making the industry more conscious and responsible.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

As a consultant, my role is now to advise and help rally teams to make changes and move in new directions without having the full accountability of actioning those changes.

Having notoriously been in very hands-on roles, it can be difficult to step aside and watch how that advice lands.

That said the upside is I too am always learning, from how different teams and businesses navigate change and interpret these strategies, which provides growth and opportunity for me personally.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Helping brands and businesses be more authentically conscious in their product strategy, their core DNA and subsequent messaging whilst incorporating truly sustainable endeavors to their existing and upcoming roadmap.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Being a founding member of launching The Outnet back in 2009 with Natalie Massenet and Stephanie Phair.

We were at the forefront of what is now called the circular economy with the aim of de-stigmatizing older season product and re-educating the consumer about quality versus seasonality.

This is something that is now very well understood and a core proposition for most brands and luxury businesses, yet at the time it was incredibly disruptive within luxury fashion.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The continued focus on unique brand experiences whilst creating community, direct customer focused service, personalization and digital authentication coupled with digital-twin NFTs.

Linsey Gallagher

President/CEO

Visit Napa Valley

Napa, CA

“The biggest challenges for our organization and our nearly 500 hospitality partners often come in the form of circumstances out of our control, such as the pandemic, wildfires and earthquakes, but it is how we respond to these outside influences that makes me proud to be part of Napa Valley’s travel and hospitality industry”

What do you most like about your job?

There are many aspects of this role that keep me challenged and motivated.

I have the great privilege of working with a broad range of partners all working at the top of their professions at our resorts, hotels, our country’s leading wineries and restaurants to tell the story of Napa Valley.

I feel honored to be a steward of the Napa Valley brand on the world stage. And there is nothing more rewarding than getting to work and contributing in a positive way where I live — and play.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

The biggest challenges for our organization and our nearly 500 hospitality partners often come in the form of circumstances out of our control, such as the pandemic, wildfires and earthquakes, but it is how we respond to these outside influences that makes me proud to be part of Napa Valley’s travel and hospitality industry.

It never ceases to amaze me how our community comes together during these times with a common goal to respond with a solutions-oriented mindset.

Most recently, we combined efforts with our Napa Valley wine and agriculture industries to fund 24/7 wildfire sensor cameras to help keep our community safe during the remainder of this year’s wildfire season.

It is the type of collaborative approach that preserves Napa Valley as the world class destination that it is.

What is your work priority for 2023?

The hospitality industry, in general, was one of the hardest hit during the pandemic and has yet to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels for many destinations.

As a rural, four-season destination with a reputation for a best-in-class hospitality experience, Napa Valley fared better than many destinations and was a bright spot in California’s overall recovery.

So, in 2023, my priority for our organization is focused on accelerating Napa Valley’s continued economic recovery. That includes not only promoting Napa Valley with marketing initiatives that reach our ideal visitor, but also supporting the industry with smart and thoughtful programs that inspire careers in the Napa Valley, shine a light on the sustainability efforts undertaken by our county, hospitality industries and contribute to solutions that make our community a better place to live and work, such as housing, transportation and recreation.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Coming out of the pandemic, the strength of the Napa Valley brand on the world stage allowed us to recover ahead of the curve, winning back more than our fair share of visitors.

Simply put, today’s consumer is willing to pay a premium for the Napa Valley experience and we cannot take that for granted.

For the luxury-minded traveler, Napa Valley was their first, and often their second, trip once they felt ready to travel. But it is often the surprise and delight of our rustic elegance and experiences when visitors come here that creates loyal consumers, who count Napa Valley among their favorite repeat destinations.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

There were several silver linings coming out of the pandemic.

In today’s world full of unknowns, time spent with family and friends is the new luxury.

With its scenic beauty and slower pace, Napa Valley is ideally situated to be the backdrop for those meaningful luxury experiences.

Kimberly Grant

Global head of restaurants/bars and senior vice president of food and beverage

Four Season Hotels and Resorts

Washington, D.C.

“What is relevant today may or may not be as relevant in the future and our job is to always differentiate between trends that are fleeting versus ones that will stand the test of time”

What do you most like about your job?

I love the relentless pursuit of excellence – taking what is very good to great, and what is great to epic.

As the global head of restaurants and bars at Four Seasons, I am fortunate to lead and inspire the best team of hospitality craftspeople in the world.

To be honest, it is hard for me to call it a job, it is more like a life-long passion – I rarely think of myself as “having a job.”

Working hard and excelling have been my life’s craft and fashion.

Beginning my career as a server, where I ultimately became president of the publicly traded restaurant company after 21 years there, helped foster an appreciation and focus on deeply entrenched culture and standards of excellence.

I am proud of my journey and love that I get to play a small part in helping others do the same.

There is tremendous pride and passion in the Four Seasons mission and value system, it is simply wonderful to be a part of.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

There are many near-term challenges in the hospitality industry, especially now post-pandemic.

However, long-term my team’s biggest challenge is anticipating the future needs of our guests.

In most of our projects, we begin working on the curation of the restaurant and bar portfolio within the hotel as early as five years before opening.

Our success is driven by our ability to be forward thinking, bold and innovative in not only the design of the food and beverage outlets, but also the cuisines they feature and the format they are provided.

What is relevant today may or may not be as relevant in the future and our job is to always differentiate between trends that are fleeting versus ones that will stand the test of time.

What is your work priority for 2023?

We are focused on improving the single view of our guests from a restaurant and bar perspective.

Our restaurants and bars are an important gateway to the Four Seasons brand and serve as the heartbeat of many of our hotels around the world.

That said, many of our restaurants and bars also compete directly in the local dining scene and have become dining destinations in their own right.

Our efforts in 2023 focus around understanding the needs of not only guests staying in our hotels, but also guests who travel and live in the market and frequent our restaurants and bars. These groups are equally important to our overall business model and may not always have the same needs or communication preferences. This is a capability we want to further refine, and plan to do so through tech capabilities, CRM, data and insights, and more.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Leading by example.

I have been fortunate along my career journey to have had many mentors that saw potential in my abilities and gave me the opportunity to learn and grow.

My most trusted mentor exposed me to the luxury sector and offered me the opportunity to serve as a friend, advisor and board member to Blackberry Farm.

But he also demonstrated early in my career that women have no career limits.

By the 1990s, he already had accomplished women on our board of directors, and most of his executive team, of which I was a part, were women.

For the last five years, I have been serving on the board of PFGC, a Fortune 200 public company.

And now at Four Seasons, I feel like I have joined yet another industry-leading organization that is committed to valuing inclusivity and belonging as a key differentiator in our success.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The concept of frictionless experiences is something I see emerging and evolving in 2023.

Luxury and ultra-luxury products and experiences are more costly than ever. The Cost of Living Extremely Well Index (CLEWI) took the biggest jump since 2008 and is nearly double the U.S. Consumer Price Index.

The luxury consumer is paying more for the same products and experiences, and frictionless moments are what will differentiate and balance the value equation in my opinion.

People with means are willing to pay for quality and excellence, but the need and expectation for accessing the product, service or experience easily and seamlessly – that is what money cannot always guarantee.

At Four Seasons, luxury is truly our love language – and that means delivering experiences that minimize friction and create those “forever” moments for our guests.

Rani Grube

Managing director

Chateau du Sureau

Fresno, CA

“Providing luxury service requires staying two steps ahead of the guests who consistently create hospitality challenges through their diverse personalities and expectations”

What do you most like about your job?

There is a degree of gratification that can only be achieved by leading a team that garners respect [by] providing exceptional hospitality. This is ongoing and consistent and the satisfaction it brings me never gets old.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Providing luxury service requires staying two steps ahead of the guests who consistently create hospitality challenges through their diverse personalities and expectations. But this is what true world-class hospitality is all about, and as the leader of a team of service professionals, it is my duty to inspire them to do the best that can be done.

What is your work priority for 2023?

The future of hospitality does not rely on the physical amenities that a hotel provides. One can find the facilities, services and amenities that they require at numerous establishments throughout one’s travels.

What differentiates properties now, and in the future, lies in the hands of the personal attention bestowed upon every guest. I believe in 2023 this will become more and more apparent, and I intend to continue to make it my mission to staff and train my team with this as my top priority.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

My proudest achievement is to be able to receive my returning guests who insist on including me as part of the special moments and anniversaries they celebrate with us. It is a heartwarming privilege.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

As stated earlier, the personal service provided by the property will become more prominent when one defines true luxury travel.

Marci Hirshleifer Penn

Global personal shopping director/women’s buyer

Hirshleifers

Manhasset, NY

“Nowadays, a new campaign shoot or collection is not just that – it is a huge story that the brand is telling”

What do you most like about your job?

I love the way a great outfit can really transform a person’s self. It adds this little spark when it is done right, so I love seeing that moment in my clients and being there for a lot of their special life moments.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

My job is very on, on, on and I love that about it.

I love working with my family every day and making sure my clients are happy with their purchases and the help we give them.

That being said, my biggest challenge is knowing when I need to switch off and take a second with my family or myself.

Now, I am incredibly lucky to have a team of two women and myself who really love what we do as much as I do and we are able to share that load.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Getting back to fashion week.

This year is the first year since COVID-19 we have traveled for fashion week and we are slowly getting back into that routine. I miss it so much and my clients really love that inside access, so next year is all about that.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

My proudest achievement in luxury is how incredibly driven and strong my family is as a unit.

This is around the 112th year our store has been operating and it is such a testament to my mom and her two sisters and my uncle and cousins.

We all work really hard in our respective fields throughout the store, and we all take such pride in how the store operates. Here’s to another 112 years.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

I think luxury is evolving in storytelling, which is organically what Hirshleifer has always been about.

Nowadays, a new campaign shoot or collection is not just that – it is a huge story that the brand is telling.

I think a big reason why a lot of physical retail stores did not work out in the past is because there was not that storytelling.

My family and I are in the store five days a week, we are on the floor, we are talking to clients and I think that really shows.

Renyung Ho

Senior vice president, brand HQ

Banyan Tree Group

Singapore

“The luxury industry expresses the highest values of a society at any one time – the more we spend on investing in our own growth, the better choices we will make”

What do you most like about your job?

Designing and bringing experiences to life in beautiful nature-based settings around the world.

Our brand of hospitality is about discovering magic in everyday life and evoking a sense of greater interconnectedness.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Defining and executing our vision of “good growth” – growing our footprint and positive impact at the same time, whilst minimizing the negative impact of our operations and the travel industry.

Given our founding origins in the tin mine transformation of Laguna Phuket, we aim to be an exemplar for the “green transition” of our generation.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Evolving our branded experiences and business model into the digital arena and creating purposeful value for our loyal Banyan Tree community.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Defining it in the light of personal growth, and conscious choice and consumption.

The luxury industry expresses the highest values of a society at any one time – the more we spend on investing in our own growth, the better choices we will make.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

Nature as luxury, a return to the wild and harnessing the mind are megatrends we see continuing, and which we have begun to create with Banyan Tree Escape and Banyan Tree Veya.

Guia Llamas

Hotel manager

Baccarat Hotel

New York

“My focus will be on maintaining — or better yet, surpassing — the results we achieved this year and coming up with ideas and initiatives that will add value and continuously differentiate Baccarat Hotel New York from other luxury hotel groups”

What do you like most about your job?

I have been very fortunate to have found what I love to do at the very beginning of my career and even more fortunate to have met individuals who held my hand and walked me through this journey.

In my current role, there are many things that I truly enjoy, but most particularly, building a brand and setting the stage for future Baccarat hotels and resorts, the entrepreneurial spirit and the opportunity to make a difference and to give back.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

The balancing act of making all stakeholders equally happy. I know this is rarely possible but getting to at least 85 percent would be ideal. This keeps me on my toes — heels, actually.

Staying true to the values I was taught and the discipline that I developed certainly helps.

What is your work priority in 2023?

My focus will be on maintaining — or better yet, surpassing — the results we achieved this year and coming up with ideas and initiatives that will add value and continuously differentiate Baccarat Hotel New York from other luxury hotel groups.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I am most proud of being part of the pre-opening team of Baccarat Hotel New York. Everything I experienced there was truly special including working with the designers, going to the maison and manufactory in France, seeing the artists install their work, listening to the Baccarat craftsmen passionately talk about the crystals, collaborating with the team in putting the standards together and witnessing the hotel come to life as each chandelier and all crystal pieces were installed.

I have previously opened hotels under different brands but nothing compared to the extent of this opening. I still get goosebumps when I look back at this experience eight years ago. It was indeed rewarding, both personally and professionally, and it has stayed with me after all these years.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The traditional definition of luxury in terms of quality and value will remain.

However, the audience will be wider or may be different considering the younger generations that have emerged in the top-tier market segment. The focus will continue to shift to include social responsibility.

While we all believe human contact is important in the luxury world, increased digital services and technology will undoubtedly come into play.

I anticipate more collaborations amongst luxury brands.

We have started seeing this evolution now and I can only imagine this becoming stronger and more evident in the coming years. I am excited.

Jennifer Locke

CEO

Crimson Wine Group

Napa, CA

“There is very little tolerance or room for missteps, so we are hyper-focused on brilliant execution on all aspects of commercial business and increasing our wine quality”

What do you most like about your job?

I like creating and being part of high-performing teams that galvanize around a shared mission, goal or objective.

I have worked in siloed, blame-game companies, and I much prefer working with talented, collaborative and kind coworkers, like the ones I have at Crimson.

We put the physical and mental wellness of our people first — not reopening wineries unless it is safe to do so, allowing employees to work remotely as needed, et cetera.

This emphasis on wellness and collaborative culture has helped us grow our business significantly and execute major structural changes to wholesale partnerships and commercial teams during the COVID-19 era, when a lot of our competitors have lost share. And, of course, our wines.

It is an honor to steward the properties in our portfolio, and I take great pride in knowing that what we create brings our customers joy.

Our wines are shared across family dinner tables, uncorked in Michelin-starred restaurants, carefully saved by collectors for special occasions and glasses are raised at important milestones.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

I started at Crimson two months before the COVID-19 lockdown and not long before major California wildfires impacted our team and harvest, threatening both the lives and livelihoods of our people.

As CEO, my job is to look forward and prepare for the future — to focus on the organization’s vision and mission.

It has been challenging to lead the team through the external pressures of the last few years, while also gearing up the company for the future.

All the change, hardships and uncertainty have helped build our resiliency, though, and made restructuring our teams and wholesale route-to-market perhaps a bit easier, or at least not as daunting, in retrospect.

I am pleased with our overall performance and am focused now on implementing our long-term strategic plan.

What is your work priority for 2023?

The number one commodity in the luxury space is time. We want our customers to feel like their time with us is well-spent and enjoyable.

To bring our unique brand identities to life, we design luxury experiences online, in stores and in-person that all share the same brand DNA and messaging.

It seems simple, but executing at a high level takes the entire team to be aligned, including our external partners.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

While the wine segment is under a fair amount of pressure from premium spirits and RTDs, the high-end, luxury wine segment is growing.

At Crimson, we are investing and repositioning our core luxury brands, and taking share from competitors in the process.

While some in our industry have stalled or retrenched, we have invested in and upgraded our tasting rooms, vineyard properties, wine quality, customer-service technology and wholesale partnerships.

I am proud of how we have leaned into our luxury brand proposition and made sure it is delivering.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

In the wine space, the next 24 months will be a defining time for many brands.

Many wineries are coming off shorter vintages and significant channel swings, from off-premise to ecommerce and then to on-premise, as customers returned to restaurants and bars.

Those wineries that have strong brand affinity and reacted to the consumer’s desire to channel-shift over the last two-and-a-half years should have, hopefully, built brand equity.

That was our goal at Crimson. We have taken prices in line with our categories but are carefully watching our re-order rates by channel and account.

Our more established brands, like Pine Ridge Vineyards and Seghesio Family Vineyards, tend to do very well in times of turmoil.

With inflation and uncertainty in the economy, the well-established brands that best deliver on the value proposition usually prevail.

There is very little tolerance or room for missteps, though, so we are hyper-focused on brilliant execution of all aspects of commercial business and increasing our wine quality.

Molly Melville

Brand ambassador

The Macallan

New York

“Getting to be a part of a movement which challenges mindsets and pushes boundaries of centuries old traditions is also something I thrive at and I am proud to be a part of that journey”

What do you most like about your job?

The Macallan has given me so many opportunities to connect with people from all walks of life through my storytelling, whether it be introducing individuals to The Macallan or sharing a dram of whisky with lifelong fans.

Educating those not only about a passion of mine, but also [about] my home of Scotland is a dream come true.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Being a young female in a male-dominated industry has been my biggest challenge.

However, getting to be a part of a movement that challenges mindsets and pushes boundaries of centuries-old traditions is also something I thrive at, and I am proud to be a part of that journey.

What is your work priority for 2023?

My work priority for 2023 is to continue finding new ways to be inclusive in an exclusive industry. Using social media is a great tool that allows me to make new connections.

I aim to bring fresh ideas and new opportunities to introduce The Macallan to an evolving and diverse clientele.

I am also very lucky to have the opportunity to partner with inspiring individuals and look forward to partnering with more in 2023.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

Launching our exclusive Distil Your World New York in the iconic Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Plaza is my proudest achievement in luxury.

Originating from a rural area in Speyside, Scotland, I never imagined I would be center stage of one of New York's major landmarks toasting to over 200 people with an awe-inspiring skyline view featuring the Empire State Building as the backdrop. It is a memory I will cherish forever.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

Luxury is constantly evolving and in order to engage with a new generation of luxury consumers, a strong focus on sustainability is vital. I am grateful to be part of The Macallan whose recent sustainability efforts reflect these values.

For example, The Macallan has a new energy efficient distillery in Speyside which helps protect the environment and supports biodiversity. We now have 90 percent electric vehicles on the estate and electric car chargers for our guests and employees.

Additionally, sustainability continues to be at the forefront for The Macallan through their global partnership with Bentley Motors, where the two work together to create a more sustainable future by unveiling their first product collaboration concept: The Macallan Horizon, the inspirational and highly innovative limited-edition single malt whisky.

Tina Necrason

Executive vice president for residential

Montage International

Irvine, CA

“There is a transformation occurring within luxury between both the classic and established consumer and a new luxury consumer”

What do you most like about your job?

What I like most about my job is having the opportunity and flexibility within my residential business discipline to work autonomously, which allows for growth and is a stimulant to challenge ourselves to think outside the box – whether it is related to processes, implementing new programs, enhancing our offerings or working with our talented teams on their development. It can all be achieved while being fully supported by our core business partner within our hospitality enterprise. It is incredibly inspiring and dynamic to work within this type of environment.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

The greatest challenge in my work is managing business growth and mitigating risks of volatility in our luxury real estate environment. It is critical to the success of our overall business to maintain the integrity of our core service standards and practices to enrich the lives of our owners.

Each day having the agility to move between strategic and tactical initiatives as we continue to grow our portfolio — all within a competitive landscape — while carefully managing all of the daily and critical aspects of my role, can be difficult to delicately balance, alongside all of the unexpected situations that might arise in the midst of it all.

Every significant challenge, however, brings opportunity.

I thrive in tackling every new situation with laser focus to deliver solutions that will address needs both short and long term.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Looking ahead to 2023, my work priority is planning for new innovations by implementing new real estate offerings.

Each year I look at ways to increase our benchmarks of success, leveraging momentum coming from recent events like Pendry Residences West Hollywood, where we achieved record-breaking real estate prices this summer and going into next year is no exception.

I am planning with our team for the launch of a new real estate product geared towards enhancing the luxury lifestyle offering, but with a fresh view and alternative to our more traditional residential projects. It will provide a new way for brand loyalists and those seeking a personalized approach to fully serviced living, a way to enjoy the benefits of ownership, commensurate with their personal desire for time with their families.

My aim is to try and bring to market a new concept with precision and thoughtfulness around leveraging our core business model.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I was fortunate in the early days of my career to be part of the core team in the concept, creation and execution of a luxury brand extension at The Ritz-Carlton Club, which afforded me the opportunity for an invaluable foundation, that has served me well in every capacity throughout my career in the luxury space.

It truly fueled my passion for luxury and the lessons learned and the great responsibility early on to protect the integrity of an iconic brand. To nurture it, grow it and appreciate all that comes with it has resulted in my proudest achievement to date.

If not for having a role at that time at the inception of the business line, I do not think I would have been exposed or supporting the drive of those valuable lessons and experiences which allowed me to grow. That perspective rooted me in my beliefs and understanding of luxury in many unexpected ways.

This has been an important milestone that I am so grateful to have recognized many years ago and look forward to another pinnacle achievement in the future, whereby I can impact and contribute much more to the world of luxury.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

Based on luxury global trends and the continued demand for goods and services within every sector of luxury, I believe 2023 will bring some new perspective, particularly within some of the more established brands.

The focus over the past few years has been to create more personalized relationships with customers and strengthen brand affinities and experiences.

As the basis related to these movements, I think 2023 might include an enhanced view of focusing perhaps on quality versus quantity and an elevated focus on loyalty, along with customized products and services to meet the needs and desires of the luxury consumer and the insight as to what drives their lifestyle.

In addition, I think we will see the value and interest in perhaps a younger demographic and seek ways to take the principles of a brand and speak to what resonates with a new luxury buyer focused on both short-term and long-term aspects.

There is a transformation occurring within luxury between both the classic and established consumer and a new luxury consumer.

“In a soft market, the brokers who truly know the business are the ones who are going to shine”

What do you like most about your job?

There is always something new around the corner. Every phone call is an opportunity to meet someone new and work with them.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

There is never enough time. Everybody gets 24 hours and you have to be organized and focused to fit in all the showings, marketing, advertising and socializing.

What is your work priority for 2023?

To continue to stay in touch with all my previous clients and friends. To continue on the same path.

I am so blessed, I cannot complain. Business is always a good and I want to find a way to continue serving the people I have worked for in the past 35-plus years.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I have sold some of the most iconic homes and represented some of the most amazing clientele.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

I think there is going to be a correction in the market. It is already starting.

I sell more in the worst market because that's when agents are really able to hone in on their skills.

In a soft market, the brokers who truly know the business are the ones who are going to shine.

“Ironically, the biggest challenge is probably what keeps our work exciting: the dynamic pace at which beauty and wellness moves”

What do you like most about your job?

I am privileged that my job is centered around meaningful storytelling.

I have the unique opportunity to reflect consumer experiences back to them through the lens of prestige beauty, which changes how beauty is represented to everyone.

Developing inspiring campaigns that have a cultural connection to your community is always fulfilling.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Ironically, the biggest challenge is probably what keeps our work exciting: the dynamic pace at which beauty and wellness move.

Staying relevant in such a competitive landscape requires creativity and the ability to meet the growing expectations of consumers.

You not only have to provide exceptional products and services, but your content surrounding that has to be consistent, engaging, authentic – and quick.

What is your work priority for 2023?

Luxury consumers are younger, more financially independent and much better informed, which allows them to often see through the marketing noise.

So, my priority for 2023 is finding new ways to excite and expand our base, focusing on authentic storytelling, enriching retail experiences and technologically-integrated touch points.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I have had a few important moments in my career, but the launch of our Texture Series at Aveda was an especially proud one.

A long history of Eurocentric beauty standards has impacted the way in which Black women relate to, care for and love their hair. This project focused on the expansion of Aveda’s education on textured hair and explored the range of journeys of Black haircare.

To me, Black women seeing themselves reflected lovingly in beauty spaces brings healing and truth.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The face of luxury is certainly evolving, and millennials and Gen Zers are becoming critical growth levers in this sector.

Moving forward, brands will need to provide emotionally engaging, bespoke experiences, both digital and physical, for a younger generation of consumers.

“More of the industry will take building digital and hybrid experiences with their customers to the next level. This trend accelerated during the pandemic out of necessity, but there will be even more innovative ways to do so”

What do you like most about your job?

The people I work with every day and the relationships I have built. I am so grateful to work on products that I love with so many thoughtful people.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

This is such a dynamic industry. Every day is different and the biggest challenge is juggling so many priorities, but it is a lot of fun.

What is your work priority for 2023?

To respond quickly to a changing environment, always keeping the customer at the center of everything we do.

Tastes, trends and behaviors are evolving more rapidly than ever, and we have to be willing to be flexible.

Just because something has always been done a certain way does not mean it is still the ""right"" way.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

At Whatnot, we are building a new way for customers and communities to interact with their favorite products and brands through exciting live auctions. It is rewarding to see people connect over a shared passion.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

More of the industry will take building digital and hybrid experiences with their customers to the next level. This trend accelerated during the pandemic out of necessity, but there will be even more innovative ways to do so.

More of the industry will also continue to embrace sustainability, something that is especially top-of-mind for today's young consumers.

Conversation Couture

Austin, TX

“The reason why companies choose Conversation Couture is because they understand we are part of the future of luxury, where technology is one piece and education and upskilling their sales team is the other missing piece of the puzzle”

What do you most like about your job?

For me, it is about the results – the empowerment for the sales specialist that directly affects the sales for the business.

We are empowering the sales specialist to upskill in virtual retail sales.

It is something that has never existed before, and it is giving them the confidence individually where it is so impactful for the businesses. So it is two-fold.

You have the empowerment of your sales specialist knowing how to sell in a one-to-one virtual setting, driving sales in a virtual environment and taking advantage of this new opportunity that directly impacts the business in a positive way. They can see upwards of 30 percent sales increase month-over-month just by upscaling their sales individuals.

If the sales specialists feel confident in their ability to sell in a virtual environment – through live streaming, chat box or virtual in-store experiences or a virtual meeting – it will empower them to want to use the technology that the company has already invested in.

So to me, it is truly a win-win. It is what I love about my job the most, seeing that in action and seeing how positively it affects businesses and individuals.

What is your work priority for 2023?

We are focused on getting as many sales specialists trained and certified as possible.

Luxury is a feeling and customers need virtual experiences that emulate the in-person experience, so they can gain trust in the virtual sales channel.

Our goal is to become the house of retail education, and that is no small adventure.

We are focused on building out our programs and bringing on partners to enhance the programs.

Also, we will continue working with technology companies and partnering with them to educate sales specialists on where the market is moving and provide the skills they need to be successful moving forward in the virtual sales channel. This includes:

Bringing on industry professionals to enhance the coursework and the certification programs.

Matching where technology is going, partnering with technology companies, and continuing to grow the education offerings.

Making sure that the retail sales specialists and companies have the necessary training and development to make sure that they stay relevant in this space of what the customer is demanding in regards to the interactions they're having with the sales specialist in a virtual environment.

My biggest priority is matching all of those things together.

For the retail sales specialist, there is an ample amount of programs in every other facet it seems, like data analytics and marketing. However, virtual retail sales is such a new and exciting piece of where the market is moving.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

My proudest achievement is definitely the fact that I found a gap in the marketplace and created a solution. When I was doing my own shopping online, I realized that the experience was so, so hard, and I knew it could be better.

Finding that gap, executing a solution and delivering that to retail sales specialists and businesses is something that I am going to be proud of forever.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

The future of luxury is something that's part of my daily conversations. I think about it this way:

In-person interaction with customers is unlike no other. However, in my world, I interface with technology companies on a daily basis that are creating ways to facilitate human interaction as if it were in-person.

In 2023, we are going to see a really big shift in what the customer expectations are and the experience they're expecting to receive in a virtual setting. I believe it is going to be essential for the luxury sales specialist to be educated on how they can maximize the new virtual sales channel.

There is a lot of talk about the new-age shopper and Gen Z. Right now, the luxury market has a unique opportunity to set the industry standard, including how the interactions in a virtual sales environment will go for those customers: that one-to-one personalized, luxurious, memorable shopping experience.

The reason why companies choose Conversation Couture is because they understand we are part of the future of luxury, where technology is one piece and education and upskilling their sales team is the other missing piece of the puzzle.

It will be exciting to be part of the transformation.

“Coming out of the pandemic we saw the idea of wellness take precedence. Now that’s expanding to the idea of wholeness, creating environments where wellbeing and happiness and connecting to other people are central elements”

What do you most like about your job?

I relish the process of creating a new style language for each project, which involves an exciting stage of exploration and discovery.

Finding a talented local artisan or being inspired by unique regional architecture brings me great joy.

Pulling from a wide range of sources, the resulting design vocabulary builds a visual story that is distinct to that place, to the people and the culture that defines them.

I approach every project, whether a luxury resort in Bora Bora, a high-rise residential tower in Bangkok, or a beach house in California, with a fresh curiosity.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

Bringing something unexpected to each project is a challenge I put on myself.

Exceeding a client’s expectations, by understanding their needs better than they were able to put into words, is my goal.

Personally, though, not having enough hours in the day is my biggest challenge.

The design industry is constantly reinventing itself and designers need to stay on top of what’s happening in order to stay informed and relevant.

That makes my job challenging, but continually fascinating.

There are so many things I could do, need to do and want to do, that it is important to prioritize how my time is spent.

My work can be consuming, but I am careful to balance that with downtime, relaxing with family and friends.

What is your work priority for 2023?

We have all had this collective “reset” and have come out the other side with new priorities, values and motivations.

At a high level, I am focused on the growth of BAMO, leading the firm into the future.

It is a good point in time to explore new directions. Clients are looking at crossover markets, resetting their own brands and everyone is aligning how we feel internally with how we live externally.

At a micro level, I am excited about traveling again, exploring new artists and resources that may have been developed over the past few years, but remain yet untapped.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

We have worked with so many incredible clients over the years, and my proudest achievements are when a client returns to us for a renovation or a new project.

My first project leading the charge as a principal at BAMO is the Waldorf-Astoria Miami Hotel & Residences, which has been a huge success in terms of both design and in the real estate market with record-breaking sales.

Because of the shared vision and mutual respect developed through that project, I am now working with the same client on several other developments.

Gaining the trust of international luxury clients and elite brands such as Waldorf-Astoria is a great honor.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, a few years ago, BAMO was invited to design space for the Ronald McDonald House at Stanford, which is a home-away-from-home and a cost-effective lifeline for families of children with life-threatening illnesses receiving treatment at the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital.

Not only was this an opportunity to provide pro bono, luxury services for the greater good, but it was a moving experience to talk to the families, and understand how design could impact their emotional wellbeing, to provide comfort, support and inclusivity.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

We have been shifting away from the “traditional” notion of luxury for a while.

Coming out of the pandemic, we saw the idea of wellness take precedence. Now that’s expanding to the idea of wholeness, creating environments where wellbeing and happiness and connecting to other people are central elements.

I think this idea will continue to evolve, and we will look to create opportunities for people to form human connections, travel with purpose and use design as a conduit to enhance and live a more meaningful life.

Vice President of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)

Saks

“In DEI work, particularly in luxury, the biggest challenge is demystifying what luxury looks like and who it is for across communities who may have been historically excluded”

What do you most like about your job?

As vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) at Saks, I love being part of a team that values both my presence and voice at the table.

I am empowered to show up to work as myself every single day, and I see that level of authenticity across the company.

Saks has made tremendous progress in DEI, but also recognizes that this is a journey and there is always room for more growth, development and advancement.

Saks CEO Marc Metrick and fellow leaders’ support of our DEI strategy give me the inspiration I need to be innovative and fearless. It is the Saks way.

What is the biggest challenge in your work?

In DEI work, particularly in luxury, the biggest challenge is demystifying what luxury looks like and who it is for across communities who may have been historically excluded. There is a lack of trust that extends well beyond the last two years of civil and social unrest.

This means being willing to think outside of the box as we do at Saks, continuing to educate ourselves even in positions such as DEI leader and formulating our strategy in ways that will encourage collaboration and inclusion along the journey.

What is your work priority for 2023?

My work priority for 2023 is continuing to execute Saks’ three-year DEI roadmap, which is focused on our purpose, people, culture and brand.

I am also working toward the next phase of our DEI strategy overall, placing a greater emphasis on advancing equity.

While equality is making things fair, equity is leveling the playing field across luxury, which we are working to do at Saks. This includes how we enact change in policies, metrics and the ways in which we communicate and operate to keep momentum and reinforce our goals in inclusivity and belonging, retention and development and recruiting and hiring.

What is your proudest achievement in luxury?

I am proud to have joined a company that is committed to advancing its pipelines, amplifying racially and ethnically diverse brands, elevating its community service efforts and expanding learning and development opportunities for employees.

Working to further develop our programs, initiatives, onboarding, talent development and recruiting for our most impacted diversity segments and communities in partnership with our marketing, merchandising and people leadership teams has been as inspiring as it is rewarding. Looking ahead, I am excited to see it all unfold.

How do you see luxury evolving in 2023?

As the face of luxury continues to change, so will the way companies define impact in order to stay relevant.

Now and in the future, there is greater demand for fearlessness, accountability and clear definitions of success in support of communities that have been historically marginalized and underrepresented in luxury.

In 2023 and beyond, the industry will need to continue championing evolving DEI efforts to demonstrate to employees, consumers, brands and the entire industry that DEI is not sporadic – and it is more than heritage months and hashtags.",electric vehicles,luxurydaily.com

Foxconn, the company that produces the iPhone and iPad for Apple, has unveiled an electric pickup truck it plans to build in the U.S.

The tech contract manufacturer owns a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, where it plans to build a series of electric vehicles for itself and other companies that want to license the platform.

Full details on the pickup have not been announced, but it is a midsize truck, similar to the Chevrolet Canyon or electric Rivian R1T, with seating for five.

Foxconn did say that the vehicle will be able to tow up to 6,600 pounds and carry up to 2,200 pounds, but its power and driving range were not announced.

As expected from a tablet maker, the Model V has a digital instrument cluster and a touchscreen infotainment system with just a single control knob on the center console.

It's also equipped with side-view cameras that display their images on the screen in front of the driver instead of mirrors. This technology is not yet allowed by law in the U.S., but it has been approved for use in other countries.

Charlie Crist (D-FL) appears to be fundraising on the assertion that Gov.

Charlie Crist (D-FL), who is challenging Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in Florida’s gubernatorial race, appears to be fundraising on the assertion that DeSantis “utterly failed to respond” to Hurricane Ian.

“Folks, DeSantis utterly failed to respond to the devastation caused by Hurricane Ian,” a Crist fundraising email, shared by the DeSantis War Room, reads.

“Hurricane Ian was a devastating storm that required REAL leadership — something that DeSantis is incapable of,” the email continues, asking to find 362 Americans “willing to agree with Charlie” and ultimately force DeSantis to “reckon” with his supposed failures:

It remains unclear what failures, exactly, the Crist campaign is referring to. Prior to the storm’s landfall, for example, DeSantis announced tens of thousands of linemen ready to respond to the storm, and within a matter of days, 99 percent of Floridians had power “other than some of the LCEC [Lee County Electric Cooperative] pockets,” DeSantis explained earlier this month:

#HurricaneIan is making landfall now. Florida is ready to respond. We have fleets of highwater vehicles, 42,000 linemen, 7,000 National Guardsmen and 179 aircraft prepared to help. — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) September 28, 2022

Florida has more than 42,000 linemen already staged for power restoration efforts across the state. Thank you for being prepared to power up our state.

Within a matter of days, DeSantis announced the construction of a temporary bridge connecting Pine Island to the mainland, providing access for first responders, linemen, and residents. This occurred in three days:

Further, the DeSantis administration announced it was flying in engineers to repair the Sanibel Causeway, which the Category 4 storm damaged in multiple areas. Last week, DeSantis announced it was open to emergency vehicles, and on Wednesday, the bridge opened to residents.

“Three weeks ago, Hurricane Ian destroyed the Sanibel Causeway in three places, leaving the island of Sanibel isolated. Today, we have re-opened the causeway for our residents after completing temporary repairs more than a week ahead of schedule. Way to go!” the governor said:

It remains unclear which of these three achievements, specifically, the Crist campaign takes issue with. Meanwhile, Crist made it clear during a recent appearance on MSNBC that any hurricane response must include addressing climate change.

.@CharlieCrist explains why addressing the climate crisis must be a crucial part of our response to #HurricaneIan:

""We also need to address climate change… You could have put three Hurricane Charleys—which hit the same part of Florida—inside the eye of Ian."" pic.twitter.com/dKdd56zvsl — Climate Power (@ClimatePower) October 3, 2022

Recent surveys do not indicate any sort of negative ramification for DeSantis in the aftermath of Ian, despite the establishment media salivating over the possibility. A FAU BEPI Florida poll, for example, found 63 percent overall approving of DeSantis’s hurricane response, and according to that survey, 41 percent of Democrats share that sentiment.

Energy Minister Todd Smith announced this month that Ontario will be procuring 1,500 megawatts of new natural gas generation with contracts that run to 2040.

His ministerial directive specifies that if there is a future law requiring the plants to capture all their carbon emissions — like the federal government is currently proposing — but they can’t do so and have to close, they’ll get paid anyway.

“This government is contracting gas plants that they anticipate will have to be paid to not produce power — and they’re having consumers pick up the tab,” says Keith Brooks, programs director at Environmental Defence.

It’s not the first time Ford has done this, Brooks said, citing the 2018 decision to cancel hundreds of renewable energy projects at a cost of $231 million.

“This government has been waging a very expensive ideological battle against climate policy, carbon trading and renewable energy,” he said. “Instead, we need to see that this is where the puck is going and skate in that direction — for the climate and for the jobs and our economy.”

Smith declined an interview request, sending instead an emailed statement.

“An unreliable and unaffordable grid is a non-starter for our government. We are building the 4,000 MW of electricity generation and storage resources needed to support our success in driving economic growth and electrification,” the statement read.

The minister did not say how paying for plants that can’t generate electricity would keep prices down and address the province’s electricity shortage.

Decarbonizing electricity makes up the backbone of efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions around the world.

As we transition away from fossil fuels, virtually everything from transportation to heating to manufacturing and mining will have to switch to running on electricity.

If the electricity isn’t carbon-free, it will undermine efforts to decarbonize almost everything else.

The federal Liberals were elected on a promise to make the electricity grids from coast to coast net zero by 2035. They have said a law — called the Clean Electricity Standard (CES) — will be introduced before the end of the year.

Meanwhile, Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) has identified a looming electricity supply crunch and the Ford government is moving to get new generation online quickly.

While Queen’s Park is exploring prolonging the life of the Pickering nuclear plant, and put out a call for battery storage (which can capture excess power from wind and solar and dispatch it later when the power is needed), it has also — controversially — put out a call for new gas plant construction.

The hope is that these new plants can be retrofit in the future to eliminate their emissions with carbon capture — a largely unproven and untested technology.

“They’re putting a pretty risky bet on natural gas being acceptable and allowable in the long term, when every indication from the federal government is that’s not going to be the future,” said Bryan Purcell, vice-president of policy and programs at The Atmospheric Fund. “With this move, according to the IESO’s own projections, we’ll be adding eight megatonnes of carbon emissions to our electricity, both by ramping up the gas plants we have and building new ones.

“These plants only make sense if they don’t have to be shut down in 2035. The federal standard would likely require them to undergo an expensive conversion to continue beyond that,” he said.

That conversion would involve some form of carbon capture and storage (CCS).

Carbon capture is the unicorn of the fossil fuel industry. Without it, decarbonizing the oil and natural gas industries will be impossible. Yet, other than several prototype plants — including one in Saskatchewan — the technology doesn’t exist and has not been able to capture anywhere near the carbon necessary to offset oil and gas production.

Smith seems to acknowledge that carbon capture is far from a done deal. In his directive, he states that contracts for the new gas plants will include a provision for a hypothetical future law, much like the proposed federal CES.

“If a project is unable to comply with such laws or regulations,” the contract will “allow such project(s) to suspend operations for the balance of the contract term while retaining payments under the Contract,” Smith states in the directive.

The directive has already made it into the draft request for proposals put out by the IESO this week:

“(If) compliance with the Proposed Clean Electricity Standard will have a material adverse effect on the Supplier, the Supplier may elect, on a one-time basis, to either: (A) place the Facility in Safe Standby State; or (B) carry out CES Decommissioning.

“If the Supplier elects to place the Facility in Safe Standby State, Monthly Payments will continue unchanged for the remainder of the Term and … If the Supplier elects CES Decommissioning, the Fixed Capacity Payment will be reduced by 25 per cent and Monthly Payments will be calculated on that basis for the remainder of the Term,” the draft states.

These kinds of guarantees are necessary to convince investors to build in the face of uncertainty around the CES, said David Butters, president and CEO of the Association of Power Producers of Ontario.

“This ensures that investors have the comfort that the asset won’t be at risk and they’ll be able to recover at least some portion — maybe not all — of their investment,” he said.

He was unable to say, however, whether the government’s incentives were sweet enough to convince companies to build gas plants when they could become stranded assets, or become more expensive to operate if the carbon tax is extended to electricity generation (which is now mostly exempt).

“The test will be what comes forward in the bidding process. We’ll have to wait and see.”

When Ford was first elected in 2018, he embarked upon a campaign of eliminating environmental and climate-friendly policies under the rationale that they were expensive, but his moves ended up costing the public billions.

Ford ended the cap-and-trade system for carbon credits (at a cost of $3 billion, according to the Financial Accountability Office). He sued the federal government for imposing a federal carbon price (which cost another $30 million) and lost at the Supreme Court.

He campaigned against rising electricity prices, blaming them on renewable energy projects. One of his first acts in office was to spend $231 million to cancel 758 wind and solar projects, which deprived the grid of 443 MW of generation capacity.

Beyond those cancelled contracts, Ford stopped the pipeline of new renewables being built each year. More than 30,000 new renewable projects were completed between 2010 and 2018. Not one has come online since 2019, according to the IESO.

As a result, emissions from the electricity sector, which fell by 93 per cent under his Liberal predecessors, began climbing again, and are now slated to rise by 400 per cent in the next 20 years.

It was a similar story with electric vehicles. Ford ended the public funding of EV charging stations and cancelled subsidies for buyers.

Now, in hopes of reinvigorating the emaciated auto manufacturing industry, Ford has become a champion of EVs, pledging hundreds of millions of dollars for EV battery mining and manufacturing plants.

“Initially this government ripped out EV charging stations and removed the EV buyer incentives,” said Environmental Defence’s Brooks. “Now they’ve seen the light on this. And they see the jobs and economic opportunities and have belatedly and begrudgingly come to see that this isn’t the environment vs. the economy.”

The fact that the gas plant announcement came before the IESO made public its plan to get to net zero is troubling to The Atmospheric Fund’s Purcell.

“There are clearly other alternatives that don’t seem to be getting a fair shake. Decisions are being made without any public discussion of the costs and the benefits.”

Prime ministers Fumio Kishida and Anthony Albanese signed the accord in the Western Australian city of Perth, revamping a dusty 15-year-old accord drafted when terrorism and weapons proliferation were the overriding concerns.

Under the deal, the countries' defense forces will train together in Northern Australia, and ""expand and strengthen cooperation across defense, intelligence sharing"" and a raft of other areas, Australian officials said.

""This landmark declaration sends a strong signal to the region of our strategic alignment"", said Albanese, hailing the ""Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation.""

Kishida said the agreement was a response to an ""increasingly harsh strategic environment,"" without citing China or North Korea by name.

Neither Australia nor Japan has the ranks of overseas intelligence operatives and foreign informants needed to play in the major leagues of global espionage.

Japan does not have a foreign spy agency equivalent to America's CIA, Britain's MI6 or Russia's FSB. Australia's ASIO is a fraction of the size of those organizations.

But according to expert Bryce Wakefield, Australia and Japan have formidable signals and geospatial capabilities -- electronic eavesdropping tools and high-tech satellites that provide invaluable intelligence on adversaries.

Wakefield, director of the Australian Institute of International Affairs, said the agreement is another signal that Japan is becoming more active in the security arena.

""It is a significant agreement in that Japan hasn't overtly worked with partners outside the United States on security,"" he said. ""It may actually end up being a template for cooperation with other countries, for example, the United Kingdom.""

Some even see the accord as another step toward Japan joining the powerful Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance between Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.

It is ""an epoch-making event that Japan can share SIGINT with a foreign nation except for the United States,"" Ken Kotani, an expert in the history of Japanese intelligence at Nihon University, told AFP.

""This will strengthen the framework of the Quad (Australia, India, Japan and the United States) and is the first step for Japan to join the Five Eyes,"" he added.

'Leaked like a sieve'

Such a suggestion would have been unthinkable a few decades ago, but events in Japan's neighborhood have forced a rethink of the country's pacifist policies established in the wake of World War II.

In recent years North Korea has repeatedly lobbed missiles over and around Japan, while China has built the world's largest navy, revamped the globe's biggest standing army, and amassed a nuclear and ballistic arsenal right on Japan's doorstep.

But hurdles remain for Tokyo's closer security cooperation with allies.

Japan's intelligence sharing with allies has been hampered by longstanding concerns about Tokyo's ability to handle sensitive confidential material and transmit it securely.

""To put it bluntly, Japan has traditionally leaked like a sieve,"" said Brad Williams, author of a book on Japanese intelligence policy and a professor at the City University of Hong Kong.

Laws have been introduced to more severely punish intelligence leaks, but for now, Australia will likely be forced to scrub any intelligence it passes to Japan for information gleaned from the Five Eyes network.

Earths, wind and fire

Prime ministers Kishida and Albanese also vowed more cooperation on critical minerals, the environment and energy.

Japan is a major buyer of Australian gas and has made a series of big bets on hydrogen energy produced in Australia as it tries to ease a lack of domestic energy production and dependence on fossil fuels.

""Japan imports 40% of its LNG from Australia. So it's very important for Japan to have a stable relationship with Australia, from the aspect of energy,"" a Japanese official said ahead of the meeting.

A memorandum of understanding on critical minerals will see Japan tap Australia's supply of rare earths, which are crucial in producing everything from wind turbines to electric vehicles.

China currently dominates world production of critical minerals, leading some to worry that supplies could be cut for political reasons.",electric vehicles,voa news

Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) Penang chapter chairman Datuk Lee Teong Li said these companies had to run at full capacity to meet backlog orders.

“People are cautious about the future,” he said.

“Companies are watching their inventories closely because of the fear of inflation and recession.

“That is why everybody is very careful when making more inventories,” he added.

When asked if the industries were slowing down, Lee denied this, adding that production output was normal and factories were currently focusing on clearing the backlog of orders that had accumulated during the pandemic.

“Although new orders are coming in, the priority is to clear the backlog and existing orders for their customers in the next three to six months,” he explained.

Lee said there were some manufacturers who were doing well with new orders coming their way, while others were just fulfilling their orders.

He also said that he foresaw a positive future for the manufacturing sector as it would be a more digitally-oriented market in the future.

“The outlook is good because we are going into the era of electric vehicles and we will be moving towards a digitalisation effort,” he said.

Asked if there would be retrenchments, Lee said they were merely rumours and the industries were coping well with the existing labour.

Recently, the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research head of research, Dr Shankaran Nambiar, said that semi-conductor manufacturing companies in Malaysia would not be spared by China’s decelerating economic growth.

He reportedly said the growth, which is about 3%, would not meet the government’s target of 5.5%.

He said that China’s sluggish growth would negatively impact the global demand for consumer electronics products.

He also stated that any plans for companies to expand, acquire innovative technologies, or hire new employees would be on hold.",electric vehicles,the star online

President Biden gathered his advisers, with mounting frustration, as televised images and classified cables tracked in real time the unraveling of his long-planned withdrawal from Afghanistan. Even fellow Democrats, friends he had known for years, had begun to criticize the chaotic withdrawal — the frenzied mobs at the airport, the desperate Afghans clinging to planes — and he didn’t understand why they weren’t appearing on television to defend him and his decision.

“Call them. Call their offices,” an exasperated Biden ordered his aides in August 2021, according to someone familiar with the president’s demand. “See why they’re not out there.”

What the president did not understand was that the problem was not a lack of television bookers. The problem instead was that most of his allies were unwilling to publicly defend him against the images from overseas.

Just months earlier, Biden had been riding high, predicting “a summer of freedom, a summer of joy.” His approval ratings hovered in the mid-50s, the coronavirus was in retreat and economic expectations were rising.

But that was all about to come undone.

Now, with the delta variant spreading, staff were once again wearing masks in the White House. Inflation was proving less transitory than the administration had insisted. The legislative gears were grinding to a halt amid Democratic infighting. Americans in the country’s longest war were dying once again — undermining Biden’s signature promise of strong, steady, stable leadership in contrast to former president Donald Trump. And Biden felt isolated.

“That was when the s--- hit the fan,” recalled a person who was part of the response. “That was the beginning of the darkness.”

The story of Biden’s first term so far is a roller coaster — complicated and contradictory, with remarkable achievements and enormous disappointment. His administration oversaw the most successful vaccine rollout in history, ushering in a post-pandemic sense of normalcy — yet the country is gearing up for new worrisome variants as it heads into winter. And Biden helped mitigate Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — while also strengthening the transatlantic alliance and growing NATO — but he did so against a backdrop in which rising prices, fueled in part by his policies, formed the fabric of Americans’ daily lives.

For the man who had promised to heal the soul of the nation, the presidency proved a test of his own.

Some people closest to the president describe an administration that achieved significant victories while repeatedly running up against the limits of the federal bureaucracy, a tissue-thin majority in Congress and a deeply divided nation. Aides also often failed to anticipate and plan for worst-case scenarios and regularly set expectations above what they could achieve. Biden and his team were elected on the promise of a new era of competent governance, only to find that the most rigorous science and best expert advice could not protect the country from new waves of disease and economic hardship.

Biden — a tactile, retail politician — found himself stuck in a bubble, both of covid beyond his control and insularity of his own making. The president remains surrounded by a coterie of longtime allies, most of whom have worked for him for decades. Even those with senior titles in the White House say there remains a clear stratification between Biden’s trusted inner circle and the rest of the team.

This portrait of Biden’s presidency as it approaches the two-year mark is the result of interviews with 80 senior White House officials, Cabinet secretaries, outside allies and Democratic lawmakers and strategists, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly share private details. Many of the scenes and details have not been previously reported.

Ultimately Biden achieved much of what he promised as a candidate. He appointed the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, amid a record pace of judicial appointees that placed more Black women on appellate courts than all prior presidents combined. With the narrowest control of Congress in decades, he passed laws on covid relief, infrastructure, climate change, manufacturing, gun regulation and prescription drug prices that in most cases had spent years on Democratic wish lists.

A precision strike he ordered killed the long-standing head of al-Qaeda, and he continues to hold together a jittery coalition of nations to support Ukraine against Russian aggression, bolstering his promise to restore American leadership abroad.

But as inflation rose and coronavirus variants battered the country, he also lost the support of the public, with his approval rating plummeting to below 40 percent this summer — landing him among the presidents with the all-time lowest ratings at the same point during their first terms — before rebounding somewhat in September to match the approval ratings of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton at the same point in their presidencies.

A Washington Post-ABC News poll last month found 56 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted the party to nominate someone other than Biden as its candidate in 2024. At the same time, 75 percent of Democratic leaners said they approved of Biden, and 94 percent of Democratic voters said they would support Biden in a 2024 matchup against Trump.

Just weeks before his first midterm elections, it remains too early to fully assess the accomplishments and defeats of these trying 21 months. Despite Biden’s calls for national healing and warnings about existential threats to the nation’s democratic institutions, the GOP — a party the president recently lamented was underpinned by “semi-fascism” — appears poised to take control of the House and has a coin-flip chance of winning the Senate, which would force a new political reality on his presidency.

But for those closest to Biden, the trials ultimately vindicate the promises he made to the American people. The senior team around him, which has begun preparations for a reelection campaign, remains confident that his first term will be remembered as a historic success.

“It was true in the campaign and it’s true in the White House: Comebacks are always sweeter and more satisfying because of the character they reveal,” said Bruce Reed, Biden’s deputy chief of staff.

“Washington is a fickle town, politics is a fickle business, and it’s easy to move on when the chips are down,” Reed continued. “But during the campaign and as president, Biden has hung in through thick and thin, when it was easy to stop believing, and it paid off in ways that it might not have with someone else.”

The Warnings

The warning signs appeared early in England.

Weeks after Biden had given a June 2, 2021, speech declaring a summer of relief in the fight against the coronavirus, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a delay of “Freedom Day,” a celebration of the easing of restrictions in his country. The delta surge, identified months earlier in India, was spreading rapidly.

But inside the White House, planning for an “independence from the virus” July Fourth celebration barreled inexorably forward. There would be a cookout on the South Lawn, replete with red-white-and-blue crepe lanterns and a fireworks display. Cabinet officials were dispatched to take photos and video of themselves out in the country on the holiday, doing something that conjured a post-covid world — part of a White House strategy to demonstrate that Americans had the tools to live with the virus.

Scientific advisers to the White House were growing increasingly nervous. But there was too much momentum behind the idea of a patriotic celebration of victory over the virus. “If we could have canceled it, we would have canceled it,” said one top covid adviser.

From the start, Biden’s covid response was anchored around two ideas: He would follow the science, and the science would show the way to ending the pandemic. After his first meeting with his covid team, he gave them a pep talk.

“I know this is going to be hard,” the president told his aides. “I know there will be ups and downs. Things will not always go smoothly. But promise me this — you will tell me when there’s a problem. You will put it on the table and together we can solve it.”

For months afterward, he had a catch phrase he would use. “Tell me what to do, docs,” the president would frequently say.

But the reality was more complicated. Pfizer-BioNTech announced after the 2020 elections that their vaccine was more than 90 percent effective at preventing infection. Weeks later, Moderna announced over 94 percent efficacy at preventing infection.

Nearly everything the president and his scientific advisers assumed for the next six months hinged on those numbers, even though it would become clear that summer that the vaccines — though highly effective at stopping death and hospitalization — did a far worse job of blocking infection than originally expected, as potency waned and new, more transmissible variants emerged.

Still, the political imperative remained. As the July Fourth celebration drew closer, Biden flagged to his staff that they needed to add some caveats to his remarks, echoing the warnings he had been issuing about potential variants in the weeks prior. His top advisers worked to scale back the tone — cutting several overly triumphant lines — and added some fine print, with cautions such as “covid-19 has not been vanquished.”

But the event went on as planned, and the message delivered was ultimately one of victory: “We are emerging from the darkness,” Biden declared in remarks titled, in part, “Independence from COVID-19.”

Just three weeks later — spurred, in part, by a delta outbreak among a highly vaccinated population in Provincetown, Mass. — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that even fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors.

Sixty-two percent of the nation approved of how Biden was handling the coronavirus pandemic in late June, shortly before he gave his speech. But that number fell 10 percentage points, to 52 percent approval, in late August and September and to 47 percent by November, dragging down his overall rating, according to Washington Post-ABC News polling.

“We go with what we know at the time, with the best possible information, with what the experts are telling us, and do our best,” said Mike Donilon, a senior Biden adviser.

The Collapse

Heading into August, Biden advisers were exhausted but optimistic, eager to take a week of summer vacation. “No one,” said one former White House aide, “expected Afghanistan would become a huge political nightmare.”

But that’s exactly what happened.

In a meeting immediately before Biden’s July announcement of an August deadline for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, one of the president’s senior military advisers had assured him that the drawdown would not be like that of Vietnam, where desperate South Vietnamese refugees had tried to cling to helicopters departing Saigon in 1975.

Just moments later, unplanned and unscripted, Biden repeated that phrase in an exchange with reporters, much to the chagrin of his advisers. “There’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy in the — of the United States, from Afghanistan,” he said.

Kabul would fall just over five weeks later, forcing a helicopter airlift to the nearby airport and resulting in a cascade of devastating images and news bulletins: Desperate Afghans rushing Kabul International Airport, clinging to the wings of departing planes. Human remains recovered in the wheel well of a U.S. military C-17 after it landed at a Qatari air base. And several other Afghans — including a teenage soccer player — plummeting to their death as the planes lifted into the sky.

One former senior administration official said that inside the White House there was an immediate realization that the images looked “very bad,” and aides began privately likening the situation to Saigon. Another person familiar with the dynamic recalled a senior official laying out newspaper front pages from the day — which all featured nearly identical photos from Kabul — as aides were stunned into silence, horrified by the loss of life.

And it would only get worse.

The initial reports of the Aug. 26 bombing outside Kabul airport’s gates came around 9 a.m., when Biden was already headed to the Situation Room for a daily meeting on Afghanistan.

Gen. Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie, who oversaw the American departure as the head of the U.S. Central Command, broke in every few minutes as he got more news. About 30 minutes into the meeting, McKenzie told the president, “We have KIA,” referring to members of the military killed in action.

The number of U.S. service members who had been killed ticked up throughout the meeting — with McKenzie providing updates every few minutes. Biden told McKenzie and others still in Kabul to let him know what they needed, and he’d get it to them. He also told them to make whatever decisions they needed to keep their troops safe. In the end, the bombing killed more than 170 people, including 13 U.S. service members.

To the rest of his staff, Biden offered an acknowledgment of the tragedy and an admonition to stay the course: The worst thing that can happen has happened, the president said, and now we move forward.

Although Biden never wavered in his decision to bring U.S. troops home, he was livid, advisers said, with the intelligence community for having underestimated how quickly Kabul would fall. A spokesperson for the intelligence community declined to comment.

Several officials recalled much of the White House grinding to a halt as — for the first time since taking office — even Democrats seemed to abandon the administration. Two chiefs of staff at key agencies, both political appointees, independently fretted that they were witnessing the beginning of the end of Biden’s presidency.

Ultimately, the administration took credit for airlifting more than 120,000 people out of Kabul, successfully resettling roughly 80,000 Afghans in the United States. White House officials argue that the withdrawal also likely saved American lives.

But the fear in Biden’s ranks was that the damage had been done.

“ ‘Forget about the midterms,’ ” a Cabinet secretary’s chief of staff said, according to an administration official. “ ‘This is it.’ ”

The Bottom

Although the Afghanistan debacle would soon fade from headlines, the withdrawal undermined Biden’s image as calm and competent — an anti-Trump — and its shock waves lingered.

Meanwhile, a new political danger was emerging, one that had been magnified as the delta surge began to disrupt the global manufacturing supply chain. The prices of necessities such as apartment rents, milk jugs and cartons of eggs began to creep up, while computer-chip shortages sent automobile prices rocketing.

Biden had come to office with a green light from many of the nation’s top economists to spend heavily. During his campaign, both of the former chairs of the Federal Reserve — Ben Bernanke and Janet L. Yellen, his future treasury secretary — had advised him that when it came to pandemic response, there was greater risk in going small than going big. Economists at Wall Street banks were also on board. As late as March 2021, Federal Reserve governors were so confident that they predicted no interest rate increases until 2024 — a date, it would soon turn out, that was off by 21 months.

In retrospect, the risks to kicking off an inflationary spiral were evident all along. Biden’s first legislative success, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, amounted to an injection of money equal to about 9 percent of the U.S. economy, following two previous injections in 2020 worth 15 percent combined, according to the International Monetary Fund.

American bank accounts grew, leading to historic drops in child poverty, a rebound in the labor market, and a drop in evictions. But when coronavirus variants spiked later in the year, the extra cash ran headlong into new supply chain disruptions — problems that were only exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that winter.

Just how much Biden’s legislation contributed to the higher prices remains a debate, with administration officials arguing that inflation is a global phenomenon and a smaller covid relief package would not have fundamentally limited domestic inflation. Still, there is broad agreement it added some fuel to the fire.

Inside the White House, even Jared Bernstein, a longtime Biden economic adviser known for his left-leaning views, had concerns over the summer about what impact the massive infusions of printed money — about $500 billion in 2021 alone — would have on inflation.

“It’s getting pretty hot in the kitchen,” he warned one colleague, according to a person familiar with the statement. (Bernstein said he does not remember making the comment.)

As the inflation rate continued to tick up into the fall, Biden’s frustration mounted. He repeatedly asked aides why no one was out on television defending him and his administration against Republican attacks on the issue.

A debate formed inside his inner circle about how they spoke of inflation. Though many economic experts had initially believed inflation would prove “transitory,” it was an easily mocked phrase. Biden allies both inside and outside the White House had begun pushing for Biden to give a speech addressing head-on the new reality of rising prices.

But officials said White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain resisted, preferring to focus on the good economic indicators like the strong jobs numbers. If the White House didn’t tell its own positive story, he argued in meetings, no one else would. Several senior administration officials — including Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council — said no one, including Klain, ever urged Biden not to directly address inflation.

Later, Biden himself would also come to believe that he personally needed to address inflation more directly. He fixated on a virtual speech that Yellen had delivered to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, regularly reading large chunks of the speech aloud to aides and arguing that he needed to deliver something similar. His aides eventually convinced him that Yellen’s speech — which contrasted what she termed the administration’s “modern supply-side economics” with Keynesian and traditional supply-side approaches — was good for a global economic conference but not for American voters.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg recalled watching as Biden worked to mitigate supply chain disruptions. The president, Buttigieg said, simultaneously requested highly detailed and tactical updates about ports and private delivery companies, while also repeatedly asking about the impact on Americans.

Now, some of that work was finally coming to fruition.

“It was challenging because this was before we could ensure it was going to be a smooth Christmas shopping season,” Buttigieg said. “But he wanted to know what the likelihood of success was, and if I’m ordering a bike for my kid, what’s going to happen.”

The White House shifted into crisis mode, seeking ways to unstick global commerce, as the administration waited for the Federal Reserve to tackle the problem of too much demand with rising interest rates.

By the end of his first year in office, inflation was widely seen inside the White House and among Democratic operatives as the biggest political problem facing the party and the administration as they headed into the 2022 midterm elections.

“If you talk to voters, what they saw was a president who seemed very focused on his own agenda and not things that were affecting them — like inflation, like ‘I’m feeling nervous about the economy,’ ” Cook Political Report’s Amy Walter said.

Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), the linchpin of Biden’s legislative agenda, was even more stark in November: “DC can no longer ignore the economic pain Americans feel every day,” he tweeted in response to the rising inflation numbers. Days later, he pulled his support from the next big piece of Biden’s legislative agenda.

The White House reacted with fury. In a sharply worded, 10-paragraph statement put out under then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki’s name but partially drafted by Klain, the White House excoriated Manchin, describing his turnabout as a “sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position, and a breach of his commitments to the President and the Senator’s colleagues in the House and Senate.”

The statement infuriated Manchin, and White House advisers later admitted that the blistering attack on a Democrat whose vote was critical was an unforced error.

Meanwhile, more challenges emerged as the delta surge gave way to a new variant: omicron. The new variant was even more contagious, spreading rapidly among the vaccinated, who continued to enjoy protection against hospitalization and death. The White House raced to respond, enacting travel restrictions over Thanksgiving weekend when most of the world had not even heard of the latest mutation.

Yet another problem emerged: As people struggled to protect their families before the holidays, they found store shelves barren of tests. The White House, as one senior administration official put it, had been “caught flat-footed.”

Biden was furious. In meetings in the Oval Office, an exasperated Biden repeatedly asked, “Why didn’t we order enough tests? Why didn’t we order enough of what we needed?”

That summer, as covid had seemed to recede, testing manufacturers had slowed their production of at-home tests. Covid modeling at the time had anticipated that vaccines would lower the rate of new infections, and Abbott Laboratories had even destroyed millions of rapid tests and laid off employees during that stretch.

One former administration official involved in the process, however, said the problem was not one of a failure to plan, but one of capacity: There weren’t enough at-home tests available to order for the winter months ahead, even had the administration wanted to. A second administration official added that there were no at-home tests available to consumers on the market when Biden took office, so the administration was forced to play catch-up — yet still managed to go from zero to at least a dozen brands in his first year, with 19 currently on the market.

Either way, the mistake proved costly.

“Coming in after Trump, regarding covid, we knew we had to lead with competence, and the testing debacle undermined that competence,” said someone involved in the response.

Other unexpected challenges were also bedeviling the administration, including a nationwide shortage of baby formula, which became a full-blown political crisis for Biden by May. Although industry leaders knew of a coming shortage as early as February, there was a breakdown in communication between the Food and Drug Administration and the White House about the issue. Biden did not learn of the crisis until April.

As questions about the baby formula shortage dominated the daily White House news briefing, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to help ramp up formula production at home and also authorized the airlifting of formula from foreign countries.

White House aides asked Vice President Harris to meet the first shipment of formula from abroad — a symbolic photo opportunity, but one that would inadvertently link her to yet another administration crisis.

The request illustrated the ongoing tension between the West Wing and the vice president’s office, stemming from the inherently ill-defined role of a president’s No. 2.

Biden’s selection of Harris made history, elevating the first Black and Indian American woman to the role of vice president. But her tenure has been marked by concerns about her management style — fueled by an almost complete turnover of her senior staff — a nebulous portfolio leaving her without signature policy accomplishments, and persistent doubts about her ability to lead the Democratic Party into the future.

Ultimately, Harris refused to meet the baby formula shipment, so Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack went instead. A Harris aide said she greeted a later shipment of baby formula.

The vice president’s office disputed the characterization of Harris’s contributions, touting her work in Central America to coordinate the response to a surge in migration, how she shaped an infrastructure law to expand broadband access, and her leadership role on reproductive rights and expanding access to abortion.

In a statement, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said, “The Vice President has been core to our historic successes and the President is grateful for her leadership and full partnership every day.”

The Bounce Back

By March, the administration began to take steps to regain its legislative footing. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo held a private dinner that month at her Georgetown home, personally preparing a pork roast for Manchin and Klain.

At the meal, Klain apologized to Manchin for how the White House had handled the breakdown of legislative negotiations, which included the blistering statement.

“I’m sorry if those statements offended you, or made you feel like we were coming after you,” Klain told Manchin, according to one person familiar with the comments. “We didn’t mean any offense.”

The detente repaired the fractured relationship. And, more important, it laid the groundwork for an eventual 11th hour deal that capped an eight-week stretch of propulsive legislative successes for the administration: The first federal gun safety bill in 28 years. Billions of dollars to spur the development of a domestic semiconductor industry. A significant expansion of health care for veterans. And a sweeping bill that invests billions of dollars to combat climate change and aims to reduce the costs of prescription drugs.

White House aides argue the fixation on Democratic infighting early in Biden’s tenure obscured the delicate political work they were engaged in behind the scenes, managing the sometimes-competing interests of the liberal and moderate wings of the party, with little room for defections.

Biden himself, for instance, spent time whipping votes, calling a list of reluctant liberal House lawmakers and highlighting the projects that would benefit their states and districts ahead of the passage of the infrastructure law, one senior adviser said.

Ultimately, White House advisers argue their success in getting nearly every Democrat to vote for the president’s legislative agenda should be celebrated.

“What I see was a strategy we ran that succeeded in us getting more legislation passed in two years than any administration in modern times, with the narrowest majority in the history in both the House and the Senate,” a senior White House adviser said.

Millions of veterans who were exposed to burn pits are now eligible for expanded health care. Starting next year, senior citizens on Medicare will not have to pay more than $35 a month for insulin. Americans can now purchase hearing aids over the counter at pharmacies. The infrastructure law will spur repairs of 65,000 miles of roads and 1,500 bridges this year and, over time, expand broadband access across the country. The new climate law could save Americans thousands of dollars through rebates and tax credits for using renewable energy, electric vehicles and making other climate-friendly improvements to their homes.

As Biden kept racking up wins, the president’s mood lifted — and White House aides felt the darkness that had clouded much of their first year dissipate. Inside the West Wing, aides obsessively followed the FiveThirtyEight average of national polls, their moods rising with the tiniest shifts upward.

Gone were the headlines of Democratic infighting. Now, Biden touted campaign promises fulfilled. Even casualties of that first year, like former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who last fall lost his bid to reclaim his office in a state Biden had won by 10 percentage points, began to see the shift.

“Going through the fall, the Democrats looked like they were just constantly fighting one another, and they couldn’t get bills passed,” McAuliffe said. “And I think the American public looked at — these guys got control of the House, Senate, White House. If they can’t get anything done, why should they have any power?”

In early spring, Biden sat in his private dining room with senior advisers and eviscerated the Republican Party. He expressed his concerns about the party’s continued embrace of election conspiracy theories, and lamented how the extremist and far-right factions had overtaken their party to drown out more-moderate Republicans.

Biden made clear he wanted to distinguish more sharply the different factions of the Republican Party and build on an argument he had been making for years: “This is not your father’s Republican Party.”

Biden and his aides eventually settled on describing the Republicans as pushing an “ultra-MAGA” agenda, a reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. The ultra-MAGA phrase was the result of a six-month research project led by Anita Dunn, who rejoined the White House as a senior adviser in the spring, and the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal group.

But the most seismic shift for Biden and the Democrats — and arguably the country — came from the third branch of government: the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

At first, Biden and his top aides were slow to act.

White House officials had a two-month head start to plan for the post-Roe landscape, after a draft opinion of the decision was leaked. But as senior aides sat in the president’s office on June 23, two White House officials said they believed they had an extra week to put into action the plan they were hoping to finalize, wrongly believing the court would wait until the end of its session to rule.

Instead, the court ruled the next day, setting off a scramble inside the West Wing. Biden had already approved his remarks for the decision, but all of the executive actions were not ready.

Jen Klein, director of the Gender Policy Council, denies that the White House was caught off guard, saying in a statement, “We were absolutely prepared.” In an interview, she said advisers were unsure whether the draft opinion would be identical to the final ruling, and needed time make sure any executive actions could withstand legal challenges.

“We were just trying to do all of the work we could do to be ready, while holding and waiting for the opportunity to actually read the decision and respond to it adequately,” she said.

Many Democrats were disappointed by Biden’s initial response. And even inside the White House, staffers — including some of the president’s top advisers — thought the speech lacked the forcefulness needed at that moment.

Biden, a devout Catholic, has long been out of step with his party on abortion and has often struggled to lead on the issue. But Donilon, Biden’s longtime adviser — who is also Catholic and who Biden trusts deeply — urged the president to take a more forceful stance. Donilon also counseled aides not to worry about Biden’s initially lackluster response, arguing that the overturning of Roe was a tectonic event, fundamentally altering the political landscape and mobilizing Democrats.

Donilon’s insight proved to be prescient. In August, voters in Kansas, a reliably conservative state, turned out in droves to reject an amendment that would have stripped away the state’s abortion protections.

As the election was getting closer, Biden’s standing continued to slowly rise. Inflation and covid were still present, but fading, and the president found himself again with a clear direction and message.

“Across every measure of how you respond to a pandemic, we’ve seen dramatic improvements to get the virus under control,” said Ashish Jha, the White House covid coordinator, noting that deaths from the virus are down 90 percent and the economy and schools are fully reopened.

White House officials also argue that their success on fighting the pandemic came despite stiff opposition from leading Republicans, who undermined confidence in vaccines and blocked funding for the response.

During the 2020 campaign, Biden would brim with confidence, telling advisers there were only three ways he would lose to Trump: “I screw up, he steals the election, or I get covid.”

By early last month, aides again believed the national environment was tacking back in their direction: The decision to overturn Roe. The public Jan. 6 hearings. The FBI search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and the discovery that the former president took more than 700 pages of classified documents from the White House.

Biden’s vow to restore American leadership on the world stage also came to fruition in the months following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in late February, in what aides attribute to steps that had been taken before the war began.

In the run-up to the invasion, the White House debuted creative intelligence-sharing strategies, unified European allies against Russia, readied military and financial aid for Ukraine, and prepared some of the harshest and most severe sanctions ever levied against Russia.

A pivotal moment came at the end of last October, during a meeting Biden requested with the leaders of Britain, France and Germany during the Group of 20 summit in Rome. In a private room, Biden walked the leaders through new U.S. intelligence, explaining in granular detail what the Russians were planning and contemplating.

“It was eye-opening for his counterparts, and it was really at that meeting that there was agreement to start work immediately to do two things — one was to try to prevent Russia from going forward with their aggression, but at the same time to prepare for what to do if they did so anyway,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. “We were able to plan and prepare.”

After the invasion, Biden strengthened the transatlantic alliance and united much of the world against Russia. NATO is now set to expand by two countries: Finland and Sweden.

Biden also took executive actions aimed at younger voters: canceling up to $20,000 of student debt — more than 8 million people have already applied — and offering mass pardons for anyone convicted of a federal crime for simply possessing marijuana, while urging governors to do the same.

Many aides privately admit they wish all the recent successes came sooner and easier — without the messy Afghanistan withdrawal, without the Democratic infighting, and without the cascade of coronavirus variants. Biden himself eventually succumbed to the virus, testing positive in July, though he recovered without incident.

“Part of what’s in the DNA of the team is that he’s had to play through some really rough moments, for a long period of time,” Donilon said. “Obviously we went through a long period of time during the campaign when it didn’t look so good. It was true during the campaign and it’s true during the presidency.”

Xinhua) 09:23, October 22, 2022

This photo taken on Oct. 19, 2022 shows the autonomous Q-Trucks at the Laem Chabang Port in Chonburi Province, Thailand. The Q-Trucks are built by Shanghai Westwell Information and Technology Company Ltd., a Chinese company specializing in AI development for commercial and industrial settings. Equipped with advanced AI machine-learning technology and a wireless charging system, the trucks are able to operate non-stop for more than 24 hours or can travel as far as 140 kilometers. (Xinhua)

LAEM CHABANG, Thailand, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- Suttirat Tosak was happy to see his new partners from China, 20 electric and autonomous Q-Trucks, join in support loading and unloading activities at Laem Chabang port, Thailand's largest deep sea port.

Arriving from Shanghai, China, the trucks would be tested before working at the container yard terminal D of the port.

Suttirat, 45, has been working as the assistant operations manager of Hutchison Ports Thailand for the autonomous heavy truck project since September 2020. The project aims to give full play to automation, including autonomous driving vehicles, to achieve eco-efficiency and safety in the port's operations.

""Q-Trucks are smart trucks with no drivers required, they operate with AI, sensors, and GPS. Since they arrived two years ago, they have been integrated with the existing conventional fleet of trucks to transport containers between the quay and the yard,"" said Suttirat.

With safety training, drivers of more than 30,000 vehicles entering terminal D were soon able to get acquainted with the trucks.

""Most drivers understand that the autonomous trucks can instantaneously 'see' everything in its vicinity, and make an emergency stop when faced with unavoidable obstacles,"" said Suttirat, whose team is providing safety training.

The Q-Trucks are built by Shanghai Westwell Information and Technology Company Ltd., a Chinese company specializing in AI development for commercial and industrial settings.

Equipped with advanced AI machine-learning technology and a wireless charging system, the trucks are able to operate non-stop for more than 24 hours or can travel as far as 140 kilometers.

In the past 25 months, the Q-Trucks fleet has been deployed for daily operations and has successfully transported more than 150,000 containers, according to Hutchison Ports Thailand, the operator of terminal D.

""(With) the autonomous Q-Trucks along with our other already and soon-to-be-implemented innovations, we are rapidly approaching our goal of becoming the nation's first fully-developed 'smart port,"" said Stephen Ashworth, managing director for Thailand &Southeast Asia of Hutchison Ports Thailand.

""We will take a further look at the development of autonomous truck technology at terminal D and explore how it will benefit the group's network of ports around the world and future plans,"" Ashworth told Xinhua.

Thailand is transforming Laem Chabang port into a regional hub, improving safety and efficiency of terminal, while lowering costs and delivering greener solutions, according to the port authority.

The plan is in line with Westwell's aspiration to promote automation.

""Thailand is our first overseas market in terms of commercial autonomous driving,"" said Tan Limin, founder &ceo of Westwell.

""Working in the port helps us understand potential challenges in the yard, we can leverage our experience in autonomous driving applications in China and tailor solutions to local conditions,"" Tan said.

The post Original Survivor: A Toyota Land Cruiser LJ73 LX Turbodiesel 5-Speed appeared f…",https://silodrome.com/toyota-land-cruiser-lj73/,"This is an original 1992 Toyota Land Cruiser LJ73 LX, it’s fitted with the bulletproof 2.4 liter turbodiesel inline-four cylinder engine which sends power back through a 5-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case.

As far as indestructible vehicles go, this LJ73 sits high up on the list. It’s a member of the 70 series Land Cruiser family that has been in continuous production since 1984, making up the backbone of the agricultural, industrial, and military 4×4 fleets in nations around the world.

Fast Facts – The Toyota Land Cruiser LJ73 LX

The Land Cruiser LJ73 is a member of the Toyota Land Cruiser 70 series platform that has been in production for 38 years and counting, with the first examples rolling off the production line back in ’84.

The 70 series was developed as a replacement for the wildly popular 40 series Land Cruisers, a model range that included the venerable FJ40.

70 series Land Cruisers were more of a design evolution rather than a blank slate reengineering of the 40 series, they both have steel ladder frame chassis, leaf springs front and back as well as live axles, and a simple steel body designed for toughness. Later examples of the 70 series would receive front coil springs.

The Land Cruiser LJ73 LX you see here is a 2.4 liter inline-four cylinder turbocharged model, it has a 5-speed manual transmission and a two-speed transfer case. This vehicle was delivered new to France and has since been imported into the USA. It’s now being offered for sale out of Triumph, Idaho.

The 70 Series Toyota Land Cruiser

When it was released in 1984 the 70 series Land Cruiser had gigantic shoes to fill. It was tasked with replacing the 40 series Land Cruisers that had been almost singlehandedly responsible for establishing the rock solid reputation the model family had acquired.

Rather than starting from scratch on the new design, Toyota instead took all the elements of the 40 series that had made it popular and rolled them into the new 70 series model family.

Both the 40 and 70 series would be fitted with a strong ladder frame chassis, leaf springs front and back, lives axles at both ends, with simple steel bodies and a range of indestructible engines and transmissions.

This isn’t to say that no improvements were made of course, the 40 series was 24 years old by 1984 after all and it was showing its age both inside and out.

The 70 series Land Cruiser body was far more modern and angular, it also offered more room for occupants, more comfortable interiors and much improved NVH, or noise, vibration, and harshness.

Though it wasn’t known at the time of the new model’s release, it would prove to be such a successful successor to the 40 series that it would remain in production for 38 years as of 2022, with no end in sight.

One reason the 70 series isn’t particularly well known in the United States is that Toyota never officially imported it into the country, or into countries like India, Mexico, Brazil, and Korea.

This has left unofficial grey market imports very popular, as they offer Americans a chance to own what is a rare and highly desirable four-wheel drive in the United States.

The Land Cruiser LJ73 LX Turbodiesel Shown Here

The vehicle you see here is an original 1992 Toyota Land Cruiser LJ73 LX that was delivered new to France.

As mentioned in the introduction its powered by the bulletproof 2.4 liter turbodiesel inline-four cylinder engine, which sends power back through a 5-speed transmission and a two-speed (high/low) transfer case to either the rear axle only or both the front and rear axle.

The spec sheet on this LJ73 isn’t half bad, with four wheel disc brakes, air conditioning, electric windows, a CD stereo system, power steering, 32″ tires on chrome steel wheels, an internal roll cage, and a tow hitch in the rear. It’s finished in red with a classic white roof, and tricolor stripes down each side.

This Land Cruiser is a survivor not a restored trailer queen, so it does show signs of age and use, however true fans of the model wouldn’t have it any other way.

344,Hydrogen-powered startups shine at the Paris Auto Show,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Olivier-Lombard-with-Machina-760x380.jpg,22/10/2022,An SUV with removable hydrogen-filled pods and a stylish sedan caught our attention.,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/hydrogen-powered-startups-shine-at-the-paris-auto-show/,"PARIS—Among the chief attractions at this year’s Paris Auto Show were hydrogen-powered vehicles developed by startups: the stylish and innovative Hopium Machina, a 500 hp (373 kW) car with a 621-mile (1,000-km) range reaching a maximum speed of 143 mph (230 km/h); and the NAMX SUV, the world’s first car partially powered by removable tanks.

Considering that Hopium was founded by a former Le Mans 24 hours winner, it isn’t a surprise that Machina is performance-focused. Olivier Lombard, who won in the LMP2 category in 2011 at Le Mans, also had a stint as a development driver of H24’s hydrogen-powered prototype that is set to run in future Le Mans races. “As a racing driver, for many years, I developed a race car with hydrogen technology. That is why I went for a performance car that also had range and took between three to four minutes to refuel,” Lombard, who is also the CEO of Hopium, told Ars Technica.

Lombard elaborated on the inspiration behind Machina. “When you are a race car driver, you have a close proximity with your car. You need to understand the car and feel its every move. We have the same closeness with Machina, whether it’s the car’s behavior on the road or the interactions inside, like tactiles with haptic feedback,” he said.

According to Remi Voisin, a senior engineer at Hopium, what also made Machina stand out was its state-of-the-art fuel cell technology. “Ours is the most powerful fuel cell (200 kW peak power) ever produced, which can deliver exclusive performance in terms of range, power, and energy availability,” Voisin said.

Voisin added that they are aiming to start production of Machina by the end of 2025 or beginning of 2026.

A tank and six pods

For the Paris-based NAMX (New automotive and mobility exploration), the motivation behind designing an SUV with removable tanks was to find a new solution for hydrogen mobility. “Our CapXstore system costs much less than the price of building a hydrogen fuel station,"" Thomas de Lussac, co-founder and head of design, told Ars Technica.

The high-end NAMX ‘HUV’ (Hydrogen Utility Vehicle) will generate 550 hp (410 kW) and have a maximum speed of 155 mph (250 km/h) with a maximum range of 497 miles (800 km). Of that total, 311 miles (500 km) will be provided by the main fixed tank, while the car will be able to run for an additional 186 miles (300 km) thanks to removable ""CapX"" capsules filled with hydrogen. “The NAMX HUV will have six such capsules, each with a 31-mile (50 km) range,” de Lussac said.

He added that these CapX capsules can be exchanged at the CapXstores that the company plans to install by the beginning of 2026. “Our objective is to create a network of CapXstores where these capsules will be available. We plan to put a CapXstore every 45 km,” he said. He added that the capsules can be filled at hydrogen stations. However, NAMX won't be producing its own hydrogen but will rather purchase it from existing commercial suppliers.

De Lussac said their aim was to extend the concept beyond cars to all kinds of mobility as well as for boats and machine works.

The other hydrogen-powered vehicles on display included a Citroen light commercial van with an 8.8-lb (4 kg) tank capacity, a range of 249 miles (400 km), and refueling time of three minutes. “The van uses a hybrid system of hydrogen and battery power. The battery, which provides a range of 50 km, is charged by the fuel cell,” Thierry Pinot of Stellantis told Ars Technica.

According to Pinot, the hydrogen hybrid system allows the van to have the same payload capacity as that of its internal combustion engine counterpart.

Finally, the Paris Auto Show also featured a concept car with striking design called Alpenglow. Developed by the French sports car manufacturer Alpine—essentially Renault's sporting division—it's a futuristic single-seater powered by a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine.

Alpine says the Alpenglow ""embodies the brand's revival, in terms of design and technology"" and that it ""sets the tone as a source of inspiration for all future Alpine models."" That said, it is not destined for production, and while Alpine has plans for lightweight electric sports cars developed together with Lotus, it would be surprising to see an Alpine with a hydrogen internal combustion engine go on sale any time soon, given the very low power and efficiency that such engines generate.",electric vehicles,ars technica

Example video title will go here for this video

SAN DIEGO — A new study finds that gas stoves in California homes are leaking dangerous chemicals, including benzene.

While more research is needed to determine exactly how many homes have leaks, a previous study has shown that these leaks can occur even when the stoves are turned off.

Gas stoves

This most recent study found that every year here in California, over four tons of the cancer-causing chemical benzene are leaked into the atmosphere from outdoor pipes sending gas to homes and other buildings. That's the equivalent to the benzene emissions from 60,000 vehicles.

Just as concerning is what this study found inside California homes with gas appliances, building on data from that previous study.

""We measured before gas stoves while they were off, while they're on, while they're turning on and off. and we found that natural gas can be leaked at any one of those points. even when they're off, they are emitting small amounts of gas into your home even if you can't smell it,"" said Eric Lebel, the study's lead author and a senior scientist at PSE Healthy Energy, an energy research and policy institute in the Bay Area.

In this new study, gas samples from 159 homes throughout California were collected, including in San Diego.

""Every sample of gas had levels of hazardous air pollutants in the gas,"" Lebel told CBS 8.

These include compounds which the EPA has determined to be potentially dangerous to human health. The most concerning among these is benzene, which was detected in all but one of the samples collected.

""Benzene is a known human carcinogen, it's a reproductive toxin, and it could cause blood disorders,"" he added.

There is no safe recommended level of benzene exposure, according to the World Health Organization.

Some of the worst cases with the highest levels of gas emission and largest concentrations of benzene were comparable to living in a home with a smoker, according to Lebel.

Los Angeles

Homes in the greater Los Angeles, the North San Fernando Valley, and the Santa Clarita Valley areas had the highest benzene in gas levels.

San Diego's concentrations, compared to the rest of California, were among the lowest.

""Just to say that they were lower than other parts of the state doesn't mean that they were low overall,"" Lebel cautioned. ""They were still higher than what we found in Boston, for instance.""

Protection

So what you can you do to protect yourself, short of phasing out gas appliances in favor of electric ones?

Increasing ventilation is key. Lebel recommended turning on the exhaust hood, if you have one, when you're cooking.

""The next best thing is to open a window near where you are cooking, and perhaps put a fan in your window,"" he added.

Three years ago, Berkeley was the first city to ban gas hook-ups in new homes and buildings. Since then, dozens of other cities have followed suit, including San Diego.

Last August, San Diego City Council voted to ban natural gas in new construction while electrifying nearly all existing buildings over the next 12 years.",electric vehicles,cbs news 8
346,What Idaho's rejected vanity plates say about the Gem State,https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/08cbbc46-227c-4735-b0b5-7860f2273c58/08cbbc46-227c-4735-b0b5-7860f2273c58_1140x641.jpg,22/10/2022,"""Every day something new comes through and we just do the best we can to keep up on what's out there in the world.""",https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/idaho-press/what-idahos-rejected-vanity-plates-say-about-state-of-idaho/277-4167fa8f-1a56-4dea-8245-85e85fdc7b39,"""Every day something new comes through and we just do the best we can to keep up on what's out there in the world.""

BOISE, Idaho — This article originally appeared in the Idaho Press.

An Idahoan submitted an application for a personalized license plate, saying in their comments “I have 7 kids and they each picked a letter or number to go on the plate.” Their choices evidently spelled zero followed by a variation of a four-letter word.

Agents saw right through it. In their reason for rejection, they wrote that the plate was clearly an “obscenity.”

When asked if she was ever surprised by what people submit, Acting DMV Administrator Lisa McClellan laughed.

""That's a trick question, right?"" McClellan said. ""Every day something new comes through and we just do the best we can to keep up on what's out there in the world.""

At the end of the day, many Idaho license plate applications reveal something about who we are as Idahoans and the current political climate.

But some rejected plates are audacious — for example, one applicant submitted “U DAH0” with the justification, “Honoring my uncles Dave, Alan, Howard and Omar.”

That application is one of 256 obtained by the Idaho Press via a public records request — and for the first time the Idaho Press has the comments by the applicants and the reasons for rejection.

The application on the department’s website carries a warning:

“Personalized plates, in any language, may not carry a sexual term that is vulgar, obscene, or in poor taste, and may not consist of a term that is considered to be one of obscenity, contempt, prejudice, hostility, insult, racial degradation, ethnic degradation, profanity, or vulgarity,” the application said.

But people still tried to get plates like that through, often with flimsy attempts to explain why their application requested words like “8008IES."" (Apparently, 80 was the birth year of a family friend who died in '08, and his name was Ian Edward Smith.)

The system automatically checks the text of the plate against a database. If it makes it past this step, an agent will look at the application and do another review, McClellan said. Agents use sources like Urban Dictionary, The Online Slang Dictionary, an acronym dictionary and Google.

Of the 256 rejected, 36% had sexual content or bodily parts or functions, 29% had something profane, 13% had something political (usually involving the F word) and a stunning 8% included either the number 69 or the number 420. Just 5% included drug or violence references, including someone who requested “KUSHH” and said it was their dog’s name. One was a mistake and one didn't appear to fit into the other categories.

The plates raise the question: Why do human beings try to put irreverent and sometimes political messages on our cars? The answer has to do with identity and belonging.

“People like to personalize their cars. It's a huge investment and it's very much part of 'this is my identity,'” said Scott Draper, College of Idaho associate professor of sociology. “It's the good feelings of one's own identity, connected with their experiences with their own people, in contrast with who they're not.”

So for example, if someone attends a political rally, they might feel a sense of social solidarity with others who attend. So the phrase “Let’s Go Brandon,” which initially became known as a euphemism for a phrase including an expletive and the name of the president, can remind someone of those feelings. This phrase was included six times in the applications.

“These symbols are reminders of our people,” Draper said. “You might imagine why you want to put them on your car.”

An important part of this is that people can tend to get their identity from feeling like their group is different from others. A liberal Idaho driver may see a conservative message and want to counter it with their own, because it would give them good feelings of solidarity with their own people.

“It’s really all about belonging,” Draper said.

The plates are part of how people want others to see them, Draper added. Plus, people want others to see the things they care about. For example, one of the rejected plates said “EFGAS,” a clear message about the benefits of electric vehicles.

“There's a purpose here, which is to spread the word about the values and the policies that you believe in and that you care about,” Draper said.

However, almost 8% included hateful, mean, discriminatory or insulting language.

Vanity plates can be controversial — some have written articles and blog posts expressing their distaste for vanity plates.

For example, one writer on the car-related news and opinion website Jalopnik complained that the whole point of license plate is that they’re meaningless.

“The whole fun part about a license plate is that it’s a random collection of letters and numbers. You have to memorize it, and that’s a pain, so you have to ascribe some meaning or rhythm to it,” Raphael Orlove wrote.

Someone with a vanity plate misses out on that bond, he wrote.

But officials stopped some genuinely controversial license plates from going through, including variations of ACAB (a derogatory saying against cops), Let’s Go Brandon, (expletive) Joe Biden and ban ATF (the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms).

As politics have become more polarized, people have been using more visual expressions in order to broadcast their views or as a protest, said Jaclyn Kettler, a political scientist with Boise State University.

Typically with cars, people use things like bumper stickers, which have long been popular with campaigns, she said.

It’s hard to tell what the license plate applicants were thinking or if they’re representative of the whole population. However, the messages they tried to broadcast align with current political trends.

Greens Upper House candidate for South-East Metropolitan Alex Breskin used last week’s Metropolitan Transport Forum held at Bunjil Place to put forward his vision for an environmentally friendly transport network in the South East.

Coinciding with National Ride to Work Day on Wednesday 19 October, Mr Breskin announced plans for the party’s Big Bike Build, which will see $2.5 billion invested in hundreds of kilometres of safe and separated bike ‘superhighways’ across the state, if the Greens win government at the upcoming election.

It was one of four solutions he put forward on the night to combat rising numbers of emissions caused by cars and trucks on the roads, in the hopes that cycling would provide a valid alternative to driving.

“Transport is victoria’s biggest growing source of carbon emissions,” Mr Breskin said.

“We in the South East suburbs are in a major growth corridor for Greater Melbourne and no council is bearing that brunt more than the City of Casey.

“There are some serious challenges we need to address, so I come her with a very clear message for the council on transport.

“To tackle the climate crisis, Victoria needs to rapidly cut emissions from the transport sector, and at the heart of our transport policies.

“The State Government needs to support people to make that shift out of polluting petrol vehicles and into cleaner, cheaper climate-friendly forms of transport.”

Along with the funding for bike paths, Mr Breskin suggested an upgrade of the current public transport network, a push for more electric vehicles and a clean transport action plan, that would set “mandated targets” for emissions reduction targets.

“Without (a clean transport action plan), we’re seeing billions spent on transport projects, which means 200 kilometres of new widened freeways that are going to lock in more carbon pollution, put thousands more cars into our suburbs, and that is simply not compatible with dealing with the climate crisis.”

In contrast, Liberals have commmitted $10 billion to improving Victoria’s roads over 10 years and $175 million to the upgrade of Berwick-Cranbourne Road, which was announced by Gembrook MP Brad Battin at the forum.

He did, however, commend the council’s advocacy for the Clyde Rail extension, which the Liberals committed to completing, if they win government.

The Labor Party completed an upgrade of the Cranbourne line in February 2022 and continue to forge ahead with their level crossing removal project, with plans to make the Pakenham line level-crossing free by 2025.

The forum was attended by Mr Breskin, Mr Battin and Labor South-East Metropolitan candidate Michael Galea.

Each representative was given six minutes to address their party’s stance on the topic before fielding questions from the audience.
