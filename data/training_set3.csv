Smartphones and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have granted the average citizen access to resources once reserved only for folks with money. Need a personal chef? Sign up to have gourmet meal kits delivered to your door. Need a chauffeur? There are more rideshare apps than you can shake a stick at. And now, lawyers.

Having a lawyer—in the sense of having some law firm on retainer that you can call at any time—is definitely a Rich Person Move. Most of us can’t afford to have an attorney sitting around waiting for our call, and to be fair, most of us don’t need one. That means when we do need legal advice, it’s a stressful process of finding a lawyer (and the finding the money it takes to hire one). But now we have the growing category of legal apps—tools like DoNotPay, a “robotic process automation (RPA)” app—that help people do things like file lawsuits, fight parking tickets, and regain access to social media accounts. For a relatively small monthly subscription, you can be walking around with a lawyer in your pocket. But do these apps actually work?

How AI is being used in the legal profession

One thing to note is that AI is being used in the legal profession—big time. Law firms all over the world have already incorporated AI and machine-learning into their processes because these technologies are custom-made to crunch through the incredible volume of text that legal processes like discovery generate. AI tools are used to review contracts automatically, search for relevant documents—even to simulate trials and predict outcomes based on a judge’s record.

The reason AI works so well for lawyers is that AI and machine-learning excel at crunching data quickly and accurately, and so much of the law is dealing with reams of documents and hard drives packed with data. When it comes to navigating legal codes and courtrooms, AI can be effective because the law is essentially the world’s most confusing and poorly constructed algorithm. Every step in a legal process triggers a finite number of potential other steps, so AI can speed up the process of figuring out what the next steps are in a legal action.

How useful and effective is a “pocket lawyer”?

While AI’s prodigious effectiveness in data-crunching makes it extremely useful for trained, experienced attorneys, does that translate to the “lawyer in your pocket” power of an app? The answer is a mixed bag.

G/O Media may get a commission up to $200 off Price-matched Roombas Roombas: Price Matched!

Prime Day is but a distant memory, however, Crutchfield is price-matching iRobot Roombas until October 16. You can save up to $200 and save yourself hella time by letting a smart little robot vacuum clean for you. Here are some choice vacuums below. Buy at Crutchfield Advertisement

DoNotPay, for example, works by breaking the law down into automated tasks that can be strung together as needed. This makes the app more flexible than, say, Trust & Will, which only creates (you guessed it) trusts and wills, because it can add bits of legal work as your suit or case proceeds; DoNotPay claims it provides hundreds of services, including providing fake virtual credit cards to sign up for free trials and canceling subscriptions with companies that make it incredibly difficult to do so.

But despite this flexibility, all of these legal apps are limited, and your success with them will be a sliding scale depending on the complexity of your legal needs. Fighting a parking ticket? That’s a pretty straightforward legal algorithm with a very limited number of steps and potential complications, so something like DoNotPay is fairly effective at it: The national success rate for challenging parking tickets is just 40%, but DoNotPay claims it is successful about 70% of the time.

Similarly, when using an app to create a will, you’ll do just fine as long as your needs are relatively straightforward. If you have a complicated financial situation or unusual plans for your estate, you will run into the hard limits of the apps’ algorithms sooner rather than later. This is reflected in DoNotPay’s reviews, which aren’t all great—and its low F rating at the Better Business Bureau.

The other consideration is how far your legal needs take you, because court proceedings still require human beings to show up. Could you use a legal app in order to represent yourself? It’s actually not unlikely that a judge would forbid you from doing so, as reliance on an app might be considered evidence that you’re not competent to defend yourself.

The bottom line? A legal app on your smartphone can replace human lawyers for simple, straightforward legal actions that don’t require trials or other lengthy court appearances. But if your legal needs have even a hint of complexity, you’re much better off shelling out for an actual lawyer—or, at minimum, using a legal app that offers real lawyers as part of its service, like Rocket Lawyer.

The chain has unveiled a slew of technology updates that include moving the Miso Robotics-made Chippy robot to a real restaurant. The machine will start cooking tortilla chips in a Fountain Valley, California location in October. Feedback from customers and workers will help the company decide on a national rollout.

Artificial intelligence will influence some human cooks, too. Chipotle is piloting a demand-based cooking system that uses AI to tell staff what and when to cook based on forecasts for how much they'll need. In theory, this lightens the load for employees while making sure there's enough freshly-cooked tacos and burritos when you show up for dinner. The pilot is underway at eight Orange County, California restaurants.

There's also an upgrade for tech you can use. An opt-in program in the Chipotle App lets you know when your order's ready, reminds you to scan your rewards code and can even warn if you show up at the wrong pick-up location. The experiment is in progress at 73 restaurants in Cleveland, Ohio.

The Chippy and kitchen AI projects may be well-timed. While there are concerns that AI and robotics may automate people out of jobs at restaurants like Chipotle and McDonald's, the deployments come as retail continues to struggle with staff shortages. This theoretically frees workers to concentrate on serving customers, rather than handling drudgery behind the scenes.",artificial intelligence,engadget

BRUSSELS, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Individuals and companies that suffer harm from drones, robots and other products or services equipped with artificial intelligence software will find it easier to sue for compensation under EU draft rules seen by Reuters.

The AI Liability Directive, which the European Commission will announce on Wednesday, aims to address the increasing proliferation of AI-enabled products and services and the patchwork of national rules across the 27-country European Union.

Victims can sue for compensation for harm to their life, property, health and privacy due to the fault or omission of a provider, developer or user of AI technology or was discriminated in a recruitment process using AI, the draft rules said.

The rules seek to lighten the burden of proof on victims by introducing a ""presumption of causality"", which means victims only need to show that a manufacturer or user's failure to comply with certain requirements caused the harm and then link this to the AI technology in their lawsuit.

Under a ""right of access to evidence"", victims can ask a court to order companies and suppliers to provide information about high-risk AI systems so that they can identify the liable person and find out what went wrong.

The EU executive will on Wednesday also update the Product Liability Directive which sets out the scope of manufacturers' liability for defective products ranging from smart technology to machinery and to pharmaceuticals.

The proposed changes will allow users to sue for compensation when software updates render their smart-home products unsafe or when manufacturers fail to fix cybersecurity gaps.

Users with unsafe non-EU products will be able to sue the manufacturer's EU representative for compensation.

The AI Liability Directive will need the green light from EU countries and EU lawmakers before it can become law.

GET3D can generate characters, buildings, vehicles and other types of 3D objects, NVIDIA says. The model should be able to whip up shapes quickly too. The company notes that GET3D can generate around 20 objects per second using a single GPU.

Researchers trained the model using synthetic 2D images of 3D shapes taken from multiple angles. NVIDIA says it took just two days to feed around 1 million images into GET3D using A100 Tensor Core GPUs.

The model can create objects with ""high-fidelity textures and complex geometric details,"" NVIDIA's Isha Salian wrote in a blog post . The shapes GET3D makes ""are in the form of a triangle mesh, like a papier-mâché model, covered with a textured material,"" Salian added.

Turn on browser notifications to receive breaking news alerts from Engadget You can disable notifications at any time in your settings menu. Not now Turned on Turn on

Users should be able to swiftly import the objects into game engines, 3D modelers and film renderers for editing, as GET3D will create them in compatible formats. That means it could be much easier for developers to create dense virtual worlds for games and the metaverse. NVIDIA cited robotics and architecture as other use cases.

The company said that, based on a training dataset of car images, GET3D was able to generate sedans, trucks, race cars and vans. It can also churn out foxes, rhinos, horses and bears after being trained on animal images. As you might expect, NVIDIA notes that the larger and more diverse the training set that's fed into GET3D, ""the more varied and detailed the output.""

With the help of another NVIDIA AI tool, StyleGAN-NADA , it's possible to apply various styles to an object with text-based prompts. You might apply a burned-out look to a car, convert a model of a home into a haunted house or, as a video showing off the tech suggests, apply tiger stripes to any animal.

The NVIDIA Research team that created GET3D believes future versions could be trained on real-world images instead of synthetic data. It may also be possible to train the model on various types of 3D shapes at once, rather than having to focus on one object category at a given time.",artificial intelligence,engadget

Head over to the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions here.

SAS is one of the old guards in the data analytics space. Its first tools were developed at North Carolina State University in the late 1960s and commercially launched in 1976. Throughout the last fifty years, it has maintained a strong lead in analytics tools for the enterprise, with an extensive lineup of more than two-hundred analytics and data processing components.

It has launched its first cloud analytics software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering of Viya on Azure. This marks a significant milestone for the company to help enterprises transition their analytics processes to the cloud.

“This is SAS’ first wave of making its powerful, trusted analytics platform available in a pay-as-you-go deployment model through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace,” said Alice McClure, director of artificial intelligence and analytics at SAS . “The strategy behind this offering is to provide an easy way for new customers to purchase and try SAS.”

Data analytics for everyone

SAS Viya includes machine learning (ML), visual analytics, data mining and model management components. The platform offers extensive capabilities across data preparation, statistics, augmented analytics, model deployment and management, artificial intelligence (AI) and ML, optimization, econometrics and more.

Built-in tools help users to interpret, understand and share analytics results. It allows users to solve business problems by combining multiple approaches with drag-and-drop or programming tools in various languages. Users across the organization can collaborate with others on a single unified platform.

Easing the installation process

The new Azure offering includes the same analytics capabilities available in other cloud or on-premises deployment types. SAS also offers hosted deployment of SAS Viya via the SAS Cloud.

A big goal was to ease the deployment process compared to other deployment models.

“The user does not need to have extensive IT knowledge or expertise in cloud infrastructure to execute the deployment process,“ McClure explained.

McClure said they intend to make similar offerings on other public cloud marketplaces in the future, but have no official launch date for these other offerings.

Beginning to end in the cloud

Terri Sage, CTO at 1010data, a provider of analytical intelligence to the financial, retail and consumer markets, told VentureBeat, “SAS’s new Azure Viya offering is significant, as it is truly one of the first beginning-to-end cloud and data center analytics services.”

It helps enterprises flesh out the entire dataops pipeline in a single platform with support for automated data management, model management, data preparation, blending, analytics, machine learning and drag-and-drop services.

She expects the new offering to allow organizations to develop essential data analytic applications for sharing and solving business problems without the need for a large team of IT resources to build, deploy, operationalize and maintain these applications.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

On Wednesday the company behind it, OpenAI, accepted everybody on the Dall-E waiting list.

Already the service was in widespread use, with 1.5 million people making more than 2 million images a day, OpenAI said in a blog post. Now others who requested access should have it granted, and anyone can sign up.

Artificial intelligence technology today generally refers to systems trained to recognize patterns in immense quantities of real-world data. The approach is revolutionizing computing, producing useful results in recognizing images, screening spam, preventing fraud and controlling self-driving cars.

Dall-E, though, brings some creative flair to the idea. Text prompts like ""a painting of hipster dogs playing poker, in the style of Tomma Abts"" can produce entertaining and sometimes intriguing results. It's a powerful illustration of the growing capability and utility of AI.

Though opening broader access should increase use of Dall-E, people have had alternatives, like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney.

Dall-E also could be spreading to other apps and services. OpenAI has begun working on a programming interface that could let businesses incorporate its results, it said Wednesday. That's already happening elsewhere, for example with a Stable Diffusion plugin for Adobe's Photoshop image-editing software.

Tech giants are investing deeply in AI technology. Later this week, Tesla plans to hold an AI Day event where it's expected to detail its Optimus humanoid robot and FSD technology it hopes will lead to self-driving cars.

Trying to prevent AI image abuse

OpenAI, which says its mission is ""to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,"" emphasizes controls designed to prevent people from abusing Dall-E's capabilities. That means no sexual or violent content or attempts to create images of public figures. OpenAI has a whole system to help moderators detect problems automatically.

Not all tools have those kinds of limits. That's raised hackles in some quarters. US Rep. Anna Eshoo, a Democrat representing much of Silicon Valley, called for controls on generative AI art tools after Stable Diffusion was used ""to create photos of violently beaten Asian women and pornography depicting real people,"" she said in a Sept. 22 letter.

Stable Diffusion creator Stability AI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Another illustration of the difficulty came when a Colorado man won a digital art contest with an AI work from Midjourney. Getty Images, a business that licenses imagery, banned AI-generated creations in September.",artificial intelligence,cnet

U.S. President, Blinken had backed U.S. candidate















GENEVA, Sept 29 (Reuters) - A U.S. candidate decisively beat her Russian rival to become the next head of the main U.N. technology agency on Thursday in an election seen as a test of how many countries are still siding with Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine.

Doreen Bogdan-Martin won the election for Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) - the U.N. body that sets standards for new technologies - with 139 votes out of 172, defeating Russia's Rashid Ismailov who got 25.

In a sign of the significance of her campaign to Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Anton Blinken wrote an endorsement in her brochure and President Joe Biden issued a supportive statement.

""I've worked for this moment for more than three decades,"" Bogdan-Martin said after her win in the secret ballot held in Bucharest.

The ITU veteran pledged to improve digital connectivity and use technology to address challenges such as the climate crisis, food security and the gender divide.

""It's a symbolically very important election,"" Olaf Wientzek, director of the Geneva office of the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation, said. ""It's a way to measure how many countries are still siding with Russia,"" he added, describing the outcome as a ""heavy defeat"" for Moscow.

Ismailov, who has held posts at Huawei and Nokia as well as Russian government roles, ran on a commitment to make technology more “human-centric” and to bridge digital divides.

A Russian mission spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

Some observers had depicted the vote as a battle over the control on the internet, between open standards and countries seeking to step up controls over communications.

""It's a good story line but not really realistic. The Secretary-General doesn't determine policy,"" ITU Deputy SG Malcolm Johnson told Reuters.

He said the agency's 193 member states made the high-level decisions while most of the standardisation work was done by private sector members.

Bogdan-Martin is the first woman to head the Geneva-based agency which allocates global radio spectrum and satellite orbits and sets standards for artificial intelligence and other new technologies. She replaces China's Houlin Zhao.

China is utilizing a range of civilian ships to bolster its naval power, AP reports.

The country already boasted the biggest navy in the world by ship count and launched its first home-grown aircraft carrier in June.

But a fleet of scientific ships, fishing boats, and ocean ferries also offer a military dimension.

Gregory Poling, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, told AP that in the hotly contested Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, Chinese authorities pay trawlers large sums of money, more than they can make through fishing, to anchor for at least 280 days a year to enforce Beijing's claim on the islands.

He said there are about 300 to 400 vessels deployed there at any given time.

""China is able to use nominally civilian vessels that are clearly state-directed, state paid to eat away the sovereignty of its neighbors, but then plausibly deny that the state is responsible,"" Poling told AP.

Poling added that the use of civilian vessels for military purposes complicates military interactions.

""You don't want to treat every Chinese fishing boat as if it were an armed combatant, but, in fact, some of them may well be armed combatants,"" Poling said.

This growth project is happening in tandem with increasing military activities around Taiwan.

Chinese authorities have commanded civilian fishing trawlers for military purposes for decades. Still, they have rapidly increased the numbers recently with the creation of a ""Spratly Backbone Fleet,"" according to AP.

China has also launched ships for ostensibly civilian purposes that could potentially be converted to military use quickly.

All ferries built in China since 2016 must be able to accommodate tanks and military vehicles, according to Mike Dahm, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer who has written on the topic for the U.S. Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute, per AP.

In June, it was reported that China had launched the world's first crewless drone carrier that uses artificial intelligence to navigate autonomously in open water.

Beijing officially described it as a maritime research tool, but some experts have said the ship has the potential to be used as a military vessel.

China's rapid naval expansion — both in size and in activity — has alarmed rivals and been closely watched by the U.S. military, chiefly the ships and aircraft of the US Navy's Japan-based 7th Fleet.

Insider's Chris Woody recently reported that US Navy ships are operating close to Chinese warships in the Western Pacific and gathering intelligence on China's navy, but US officials worry that rising tensions could lead to riskier encounters at sea.",artificial intelligence,business insider

Sept 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) plans to expand the Intel Developer Cloud to allow customers to try a range of new chips before they hit the market, a move it hopes will lure more application developers to use its processors, the company said on Tuesday.

Chip companies are increasingly enabling software and hardware developers to test out chips virtually in the cloud before they are shipped to save time.

A strong software developer ecosystem is increasingly becoming a competitive edge for semiconductor hardware manufacturers. It is one reason many artificial intelligence researchers say they use Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) chips for AI computing work, because its CUDA software platform has a large user base.

""In some ways Intel is the biggest software company that you've never heard of,"" said Nick McKeown, who leads Intel’s Network and Edge group, adding that there are over 20,000 software developers at Intel. ""What we’ve done in the past is tend to do the software that just enables the low-level silicon to shine, but it's kind of invisible.""

He said Intel is trying to make the developer cloud easier to use and also trying to hook the next generation of developers to make applications for Intel chips.

To that end, four years ago Intel hired Ria Cheruvu, a child engineering prodigy who joined the company at 14 with a bachelor's degree in computer science from Harvard. Cheruvu said young developers face a lot of pain points in understanding the technology and experimenting with them, and that the developer cloud was helping to address some of the issues.

Intel on Tuesday at its developer conference also unveiled its 13th-generation Intel Core desktop processor to help improve gaming experiences and the Intel Geti platform to help customers develop and use AI for computer vision.

The company also said its Arc A770 GPU for gamers will be available on Oct. 12 starting at $329, with Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger saying Intel is fixing the problem of gamers complaining of higher prices.

17,Why A.I. will never rule the world,https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Superintelligence.jpeg?p=1,25/09/2022,"Despite fears that A.I. will one day take over the world, some experts contend that our existing A.I. systems are incapable of surpassing human intelligence",https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/why-ai-will-never-rule-the-world/,"Call it the Skynet hypothesis, Artificial General Intelligence, or the advent of the Singularity — for years, AI experts and non-experts alike have fretted (and, for a small group, celebrated) the idea that artificial intelligence may one day become smarter than humans.

According to the theory, advances in AI — specifically of the machine learning type that’s able to take on new information and rewrite its code accordingly — will eventually catch up with the wetware of the biological brain. In this interpretation of events, every AI advance from Jeopardy-winning IBM machines to the massive AI language model GPT-3 is taking humanity one step closer to an existential threat. We’re literally building our soon-to-be-sentient successors.

Except that it will never happen. At least, according to the authors of the new book Why Machines Will Never Rule the World: Artificial Intelligence without Fear.

Co-authors University at Buffalo philosophy professor Barry Smith and Jobst Landgrebe, founder of German AI company Cognotekt argue that human intelligence won’t be overtaken by “an immortal dictator” any time soon — or ever. They told Digital Trends their reasons why.

Digital Trends (DT): How did this subject get on your radar?

Jobst Landgrebe (JL): I’m a physician and biochemist by training. When I started my career, I did experiments that generated a lot of data. I started to study mathematics to be able to interpret these data, and saw how hard it is to model biological systems using mathematics. There was always this misfit between the mathematical methods and the biological data.

In my mid-thirties, I left academia and became a business consultant and entrepreneur working in artificial intelligence software systems. I was trying to build AI systems to mimic what human beings can do. I realized that I was running into the same problem that I had years before in biology.

Customers said to me, ‘why don’t you build chatbots?’ I said, ‘because they won’t work; we cannot model this type of system properly.’ That ultimately led to me writing this book.

Professor Barry Smith (BS): I thought it was a very interesting problem. I had already inklings of similar problems with AI, but I had never thought them through. Initially, we wrote a paper called ‘Making artificial intelligence meaningful again.’ (This was in the Trump era.) It was about why neural networks fail for language modeling. Then we decided to expand the paper into a book exploring this subject more deeply.

DT: Your book expresses skepticism about the way that neural networks, which are crucial to modern deep learning, emulate the human brain. They’re approximations, rather than accurate models of how the biological brain works. But do you accept the core premise that it is possible that, were we to understand the brain in granular enough detail, it could be artificially replicated – and that this would give rise to intelligence or sentience?

JL: The name ‘neural network’ is a complete misnomer. The neural networks that we have now, even the most sophisticated ones, have nothing to do with the way the brain works. The view that the brain is a set of interconnected nodes in the way that neural networks are built is completely naïve.

If you look at the most primitive bacterial cell, we still don’t understand even how it works. We understand some of its aspects, but we have no model of how it works – let alone a neuron, which is much more complicated, or billions of neurons interconnected. I believe it’s scientifically impossible to understand how the brain works. We can only understand certain aspects and deal with these aspects. We don’t have, and we will not get, a full understanding of how the brain works.

If we had a perfect understanding of how each molecule of the brain works, then we could probably replicate it. That would mean putting everything into mathematical equations. Then you could replicate this using a computer. The problem is just that we are unable to write down and create those equations.

BS: Many of the most interesting things in the world are happening at levels of granularity that we cannot approach. We just don’t have the imaging equipment, and we probably never will have the imaging equipment, to capture most of what’s going on at the very fine levels of the brain.

This means that we don’t know, for instance, what is responsible for consciousness. There are, in fact, a series of quite interesting philosophical problems, which, according to the method that we’re following, will always be unsolvable – and so we should just ignore them.

Another is the freedom of the will. We are very strongly in favor of the idea that human beings have a will; we can have intentions, goals, and so forth. But we don’t know whether or not it’s a free will. That is an issue that has to do with the physics of the brain. As far as the evidence available to us is concerned, computers can’t have a will.

DT: The subtitle of the book is ‘artificial intelligence without fear.’ What is the specific fear that you refer to?

BS: That was provoked by the literature on the singularity, which I know you’re familiar with. Nick Bostrom, David Chalmers, Elon Musk, and the like. When we talked with our colleagues in the real world, it became clear to us that there was indeed a certain fear among the populace that AI would eventually take over and change the world to the detriment of humans.

We have quite a lot in the book about the Bostrum-type arguments. The core argument against them is that if the machine cannot have a will, then it also cannot have an evil will. Without an evil will, there’s nothing to be afraid of. Now, of course, we can still be afraid of machines, just as we can be afraid of guns.

But that’s because the machines are being managed by people with evil ends. But then it’s not AI that is evil; it’s the people who build and program the AI

DT: Why does this notion of the singularity or artificial general intelligence interest people so much? Whether they’re scared by it or fascinated by it, there’s something about this idea that resonates with people on a broad level.

JL: There’s this idea, started at the beginning of the 19th century and then declared by Nietzsche at the end of that century, that God is dead. Since the elites of our society are not Christians anymore, they needed a replacement. Max Stirner, who was, like Karl Marx, a pupil of Hegel, wrote a book about this, saying, ‘I am my own god.’

If you are God, you also want to be a creator. If you could create a superintelligence then you are like God. I think it has to do with the hyper-narcissistic tendencies in our culture. We don’t talk about this in the book, but that explains to me why this idea is so attractive in our times in which there is no transcendent entity anymore to turn to.

DT: Interesting. So to follow that through, it’s the idea that the creation of AI – or the aim to create AI – is a narcissistic act. In that case, the concept that these creations would somehow become more powerful than we are is a nightmarish twist on that. It’s the child killing the parent.

JL: A bit like that, yes.

DT: What for you would be the ultimate outcome of your book if everyone was convinced by your arguments? What would that mean for the future of AI development?

JL: It’s a very good question. I can tell you exactly what I think would happen – and will happen. I think in the midterm people will accept our arguments, and this will create better-applied mathematics.

Something that all great mathematicians and physicists are completely aware of was the limitations of what they could achieve mathematically. Because they are aware of this, they focus only on certain problems. If you are well aware of the limitations, then you go through the world and look for these problems and solve them. That’s how Einstein found the equations for Brownian motion; how he came up with his theories of relativity; how Planck solved blackbody radiation and thus initiated the quantum theory of matter. They had a good instinct for which problems are amenable to solutions with mathematics and which are not.

If people learn the message of our book, they will, we believe, be able to engineer better systems, because they will concentrate on what is truly feasible – and stop wasting money and effort on something that can’t be achieved.

BS: I think that some of the message is already getting through, not because of what we say but because of the experiences people have when they give large amounts of money to AI projects, and then the AI projects fail. I guess you know about the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. I can’t remember the exact sum, but I think it was something like $10 billion, which they gave to a famous contractor. In the end, they got nothing out of it. They canceled the contract.

(Editor’s note: JAIC, a subdivision of the United States Armed Forces, was intended to accelerate the “delivery and adoption of AI to achieve mission impact at scale.” It was folded into a larger unified organization, the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer, with two other offices in June this year. JAIC ceased to exist as its own entity.)

DT: What do you think, in high-level terms, is the single most compelling argument that you make in the book?

BS: Every AI system is mathematical in nature. Because we cannot model consciousness, will, or intelligence mathematically, these cannot be emulated using machines. Therefore, machines will not become intelligent, let alone superintelligent.

JL: The structure of our brain only allows limited models of nature. In physics, we pick a subset of reality that fits to our mathematical modeling capabilities. That is how Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, or Schrödinger obtained their famous and beautiful models. But these can only describe or predict a small set of systems. Our best models are those which we use to engineer technology. We are unable to create a complete mathematical model of animate nature.

Head over to the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions here.

Nothing is hotter than retail AI startups that can help stores win big this holiday shopping season.

According to eMarketer, retailers are turning to artificial intelligence to tackle everything from supply chain challenges and price optimization to self-checkout and fresh food. And retail AI is a massive, fast-growing segment filled with AI startups looking to break into a market that is estimated to hit over 40 billion by 2030.

These are seven of the hottest retail AI startups that are helping retailers meet their holiday goals:

Afresh: The retail AI startup solving for fresh food

Founded in 2017, San Francisco-based Afresh has been on a tear this year, raising a whopping $115 million in August. Afresh helps thousands of stores tackle the complex supply chain questions that have always existed around the perimeter of the supermarket — with its fruits, vegetables, fresh meat and fish. That is, how can stores make sure they have enough perfectly ripe, fresh foods available, while minimizing losses and reducing waste from food that is past its prime?

According to a company press release, Afresh is on track to help retailers save 34 million pounds of food waste by the end of 2022. It uses AI to analyze a supermarket’s previous demand and data trends, which allows grocers to keep fresh food for as little time as possible. The platform uses an algorithm to assess what is currently in the store, with a “confidence interval” that includes how perishable the item is. Workers help train the AI-driven model by periodically counting inventory by hand.

AiFi: retail AI-powered cashierless checkout

Santa Clara, California-based AiFi offers a frictionless and cashierless retail AI-powered solution deployed in diverse locations such as sports stadiums, music festivals, grocery store chains and college campuses. Steve Gu cofounded AiFi in 2016 with his wife, Ying Zheng, and raised a fresh $65 million in March. Both Gu and Zheng have Ph.D.s in computer vision and spent time at Apple and Google.

AiFi deploys AI models through numerous cameras placed across the ceiling, in order to understand everything happening in the shop. Cameras track customers throughout their shopping journey, while computer vision recognizes products and detects different activities, including putting items onto or grabbing items off the shelves.

Beneath the platform’s hood are neural network models specifically developed for people-tracking as well as activity and product recognition. AiFi also developed advanced calibration algorithms that allow the company to re-create the shopping environment in 3D.

Everseen: AI and computer vision self-checkout

Everseen has been around since 2007, but 2022 was a big year for the Cork, Ireland-based company, which offers AI and computer vision-based self-checkout technology. In September, Kroger Co., America’s largest grocery retailer, announced it is moving beyond the pilot stage with Everseen’s solution, rolling out to 1,700 grocery stores and reportedly including it at all locations in the near future.

The Everseen Visual AI platform captures large volumes of unstructured video data using high-resolution cameras, which it integrates with structured POS data feeds to analyze and make inferences about data in real-time. It provides shoppers with a “gentle nudge” if they make an unintentional scanning error.

It hasn’t all been smooth sailing for Everseen: In 2021, the company settled a lawsuit with Walmart over claims the retailer had misappropriated the Irish firm’s technology and then built its own similar product.

Focal Systems: Real-time shelf digitization

Burlingame, California-based Focal Systems, which offers AI-powered real-time shelf digitization for brick-and-mortar retail, recently hit the big time with Walmart Canada. The retailer is rolling out Focal Systems’ solution, which uses shelf cameras, computer vision and deep learning, to all stores following a 70-store pilot.

Founded in 2015, Focal Systems was born out of Stanford’s Computer Vision Lab. In March, the company launched its FocalOS “self-driving store” solution, which automates order writing and ordering, directs stockers, tracks productivity per associate, optimizes category management on a per store basis and manages ecommerce platforms to eliminate substitutions.

According to the company, corporate leaders can view any store in real-time to see what their shelves look like and how stores are performing.

Hivery: Getting store assortments right

South Wales, Australia-based Hivery tackles the complex challenges around battles for space in brick-and-mortar retail stores. It helps stores make decisions around how to use physical space, set up product displays and optimize assortments. It offers “hyper-local retailing” by enabling stores to customize their assortments to meet the needs of local customers.

Hivery’s SaaS-based, AI-driven Curate product uses proprietary ML and applied mathematics algorithms developed and acquired from Australia’s national science agency. They claim a process that takes six months is reduced to around six minutes, thanks to the power of AI/ML and applied mathematics techniques.

Jason Hosking, Hivery’s cofounder and CEO, told VentureBeat in April that Hivery’s customers can make rapid assortment scenario strategies simulations around SKU rationalization, SKU introduction and space while considering any category goal, merchandising rules and demand transference. Once a strategy is determined, Curate can generate accompanying planograms for execution.

Lily AI: Connecting shoppers to products

Just a month ago, Lily AI, which connects a retailer’s shoppers with products they might want, raised $25 million in new capital – no small feat during these tightening times.

When Purva Gupta and Sowmiya Narayanan launched Lily AI in 2015, the Mountain View, California-based company looked to address a thorny e-commerce challenge – shoppers that leave a site before buying. Now, the company’s product attributes platform injects an enriched product taxonomy across the entire retail stack, improving on-site search conversion, personalized product discovery and demand forecasting.

For customers that include ThredUP and Bloomingdales, Lily AI uses algorithms that analyzes the retailer’s existing and future product catalog. For example, Lily will capture details about a brand’s product style and fit and expand the taxonomy to ensure that products are easily found, recommended and purchased.

Shopic: One of several smart cart retail AI startups

Tel Aviv-based Shopic has been making waves with its AI-powered clip-on device, which uses computer vision algorithms to turn shopping carts into smart carts. In August, Shopic received a $35 million series B investment round.

Shopic claims it can identify more than 50,000 items once they are placed in a cart in real time while displaying product promotions and discounts on related products. Its system also acts as a self-checkout interface and provides real-time inventory management and customer behavioral insights for grocers through its analytics dashboard, the company said. Grocers can receive reports that include aisle heatmaps, promotion monitoring and new product adoption metrics.

Shopic faces headwinds, though, with other AI startups in the smart cart space: Amazon’s Dash Carts are currently being piloted in Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh, while Instacart recently acquired Caper AI.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Head over to the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions here.

Data labeling is one of the most fundamental aspects of machine learning. It is also often an area where organizations struggle – both to accurately categorize data and reduce potential bias.

With data labeling technology, a dataset used to train a machine learning model is first analyzed and given a label that provides a category and a definition of what the data is actually about. While data labeling is a critical component of the machine learning process, recently it has also proven to be highly inconsistent, according to multiple studies. The need for accurate data labeling has fuelled a bustling marketplace of data labeling vendors.

Among the most popular data labeling technologies is the open-source Label Studio, which is backed by San Francisco-based startup Heartex. The new Label Studio 1.6 update being released today will provide users with new features to help better analyze and label data inside of videos.

According to Michael Malyuk, cofounder and CEO of Heartex, the challenge for most companies with artificial intelligence (AI) is having good data to work with.

“We think about labeling as a broader category of dataset developments and Label Studio is a solution that ultimately enables you to do any sort of dataset development,” Malyuk said.

Defining data labeling categories is a challenge

While the 1.6 release of Label Studio has a video player capability as the primary new feature, Malyuk emphasized that the technology is useful for any type of data including text, audio, time series and video.

Among the biggest issues with any labeling approach for all types of data is actually defining the categories used for data labels.

“Some people can name things one way, some people can name things a different way, but they essentially mean the same thing,” Malyuk said.

He explained that Label Studio provides taxonomies for labels that users can choose from to describe a piece of data, be it a text, audio or image file. If two or more people in the same organization label the same data differently, the Label Studio system will identify the conflict so that it can be analyzed and remediated. Label Studio provides both a manual conflict resolution system and an automated approach.

Vector database vs. data labeling?

The process of data labeling can often involve manual work, with humans assigning a label or validating that a label is accurate.

There are a number of approaches to automating the process, startup Lightly AI is using a self-supervised machine learning model that can integrate with Label Studio. Then there are vendors that will use a vector database to convert data into math, rather than using data labeling to identify data and its relationships.

Malyuk said that vector databases do have their uses and can be effective for doing tasks such as similarity searches. The problem, in his view, is that the vector approach isn’t as effective with unstructured data types such as audio and video. He noted that a vector database can make use of identification types for common objects.

“As soon as you start deviating from that common knowledge to something that is a little bit different, it’s going to become very complicated without manual labeling,” Malyuk said.

How data labeling can identify and mitigate AI bias

Bias in AI is an ongoing challenge that many in the industry are trying to combat. At the root of machine learning is the actual data, and the way that data is labeled can potentially lead to bias as well. Bias can be intentional, and it can also be circumstantial.

“If you’re labeling a very subjective dataset in the morning before coffee and then again after coffee, you may get very different answers,” Malyuk said.

While it’s not always possible to make sure that data labeling processes are only executed by those that are fully caffeinated, there are processes that can help. Malyuk said what Label Studio does on the software side is it provides a way to build a process so that everyone contributes individually. The system identifies and builds all the matrices where it matches people with each other and how they label the same items. It’s an approach that Malyuk said can potentially identify bias for a specific label.

The open-source Label Studio technology is intended to be used by individuals and small groups, while the commercial project provides enterprise features for larger teams around security, collaboration and scalability.

“With open source, we focus on the user and we are trying to make the individual user’s life as easy as possible from a labeling perspective,” Malyuk said. “With the enterprise, we focus on the organization and whatever the business needs, there are.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

For years, U.S. defense officials and Washington think-tankers alike have debated whether the future of our military could — or should — look a little less human.

Already, the U.S. military has started to rely on technology that employs machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data — raising ethical questions along the way. While these technologies have countless beneficial applications, ranging from threat assessment to preparing troops for battle, they rightfully evoke concerns about a future in which Terminator-like machines take over.

But pitting man against machine misses the point. There’s room for both in our military future — as long as machines aid human decision-making, rather than replace it.

Military AI and machine learning are here

Machine learning technology, a type of AI that allows computer systems to process enormous data sets and “learn” to recognize patterns, has rapidly gained steam across many industries. The systems can comb through massive amounts of data from multiple sources and then make recommendations based on the patterns it senses — all in a matter of seconds.

That makes AI and machine learning useful tools for humans who need to make well-thought-out decisions at a moment’s notice. Consider doctors, who may only have a few minutes with each patient but must make potentially life-altering diagnoses. Some hospitals are using AI and machine learning to identify heart disease and lung cancer before a patient ever shows symptoms.



The same goes for military leaders. When making a strategic choice that could have a human cost, officials must be able to process all the available data as quickly as possible to make the most informed decision.

AI is helping them do so. Some systems, for example, can take two-dimensional surveillance images and create a detailed, three-dimensional model of a space. That helps officials chart a safe path forward for their troops through a previously unexplored area.

A human thumbs-up

Whether in an emergency room or on the battlefield, these machine learning applications have one thing in common. They do not have the power to make an ultimate decision. In the end, it’s the doctor’s decision to make a diagnosis — and the officer’s decision to give an order.

Companies developing new military AI or machine learning technologies have a responsibility to help keep it that way. They can do so by outfitting their innovations with a few critical guardrails.

For one, humans must have the power to override AI at any point. Computer algorithms may be able to analyze piles of data and provide helpful recommendations for action. But machines can’t possibly grasp the complexity or novelty of the ever-changing factors influencing a strategic operation.

Only humans have the ability to think through the long-term consequences of military action. Therefore humans must be able to decline a machine’s recommendations.

Companies developing military AI should give users options to make decisions manually, without technological support; in a semi-automated fashion; or in a fully automated manner, with the ability to override. The goal should be to develop AI that complements — rather than eliminates the need for — uniquely human decision-making capabilities that enable troops to respond effectively to unforeseen circumstances.

A peaceful transfer of power

Military machine learning systems also need a clear chain of command. Most United States military technologies are developed by private firms that contract with the U.S. government. When the military receives those machines, it’s often forced to rely on the private firm for ongoing support and upkeep of the system.

That shouldn’t be the case. Companies in the defense industry should build AI systems and computer algorithms so that military officials can one day assume full control over the technology. That will ensure a smooth transition between the contractor and the military — and that the AI has a clear sense of goals free of any conflicts of interest.

To keep military costs low, AI systems and machine learning programs should be adaptable, upgradeable and easy to install across multiple applications. This will enable officials to move the technology from vehicle to vehicle and utilize the its analysis at a moment’s notice as well. It will also allow military personnel to develop more institutional knowledge about the system, enabling them to better understand and respond to the AI’s recommendations.

In the same vein, companies can continue working on algorithms that can explain why they made a certain recommendation — just as any human can. That technology could help to develop a better sense of trust in and more efficient oversight of AI systems.

Military decision-making doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. With the right guardrails, AI systems and machine learning algorithms can help commanders make the most informed decisions possible — and stave off a machine-controlled future in the process.

A doctor walks into a bar…

What does the setup for a likely bad joke have to do with image bias in DALL-E?

DALL-E is an artificial intelligence program developed by OpenAI that creates images from text descriptions. It uses a 12-billion-parameter version of the GPT-3 Transformer model to interpret natural language inputs and generate corresponding images. DALL-E can generate realistic images and is one of the best multi-modal models available today.

Its inner functioning and source are not publicly available, but we can invoke it through an API layer by passing a text prompt with the description of the image to generate. It’s a prime example of a popular pattern called “model-as-a-service.” Naturally, for such an amazing model, there was a long wait, and when I finally got access I wanted to try out all sorts of combinations.

Event Low-Code/No-Code Summit Join today’s leading executives at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit virtually on November 9. Register for your free pass today. Register Here

One thing I wanted to uncover was the possible inherent biases that the model would exhibit. So, I input two separate prompts, and you can see the results associated with each in the above illustration.

From the text prompt “Doctor walks into a bar” the model produced only male doctors in a bar. It intelligently places the doctor, dressed in a suit with a stethoscope and a medical chart, inside a bar, which it gave a dark setting. However, when I input the prompt “Nurse walks into a bar” the results were exclusively female and more cartoonish, highlighting the bar more as a children’s playroom. Besides the male and female bias for the terms “doctor” and “nurse,” you can also see the change in how the bar was rendered based on the gender of the person.

How responsible AI can help tackle bias in machine learning models

OpenAI has been extremely quick to notice this bias and made changes to the model to try and mitigate it. They have been testing the model on under-represented populations in their training sets — a male nurse, a female CEO, and so on. This is an active approach to hunting for bias, measuring and mitigating it by adding more training samples in biased categories.

While this activity makes sense for a widely popular model like DALL-E, it might not be implemented in many enterprise models unless specifically asked for. For example, it would take a lot of extra effort for banks to hunt for biases and actively work on mitigating these in their credit-line approval models.

A discipline that helps organize this effort and helps make this study part of model development is called Responsible AI.

Just as DevOps and MLOps focus on making development agile, collaborative and automated, Responsible AI focuses on the ethics and bias issues of ML and helps actively address these problems in all aspects of the ML development lifecycle. Working on bias early can help save the exponential effort required to hunt for bias as OpenAI had to do after DALL-E’s release. Also, a Responsible AI strategy gives customers much more confidence in an organization’s ethical standards.

A responsible AI strategy

Every company building AI today needs a Responsible AI strategy. It should cover all aspects including:

Checking training data for bias

Evaluating algorithms for levels of interpretability

Building explanations for ML models

Reviewing deployment strategy for models

Monitoring for data and concept drift

Attention to these aspects will ensure that the AI systems developed are built with reproducibility, transparency and accountability. Even though all issues cannot be mitigated, a model card should be released to document the AI’s limitations. My experimentation with DALL-E showed an example that was seemingly benign. However, unchecked image bias in ML models applied practically across a variety of industries can have significant negative consequences. Mitigating these risks is definitely no joke.

ManageEngine commissioned Vanson Bourne to conduct a global study to examine the role of IT and how it will continue to evolve in the future of work. The report discovered that everyone across the enterprise, not just IT, has a stake in how technology is chosen, deployed, configured and used.

Most departments outside IT — particularly quality control (24%) and finance (21%) — are using artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML). In addition, 76% in North America agree that their organization encourages non-IT employees to develop their own applications using low/no-code platforms — the highest of any other region surveyed — with marketing as the top department creating their own applications.

Despite agreeing that non-IT employees are more knowledgeable about IT now than they were pre-pandemic (76%), business decision-makers believe that a lack of training (48%) and basic technical knowledge (47%) are key barriers for employees when it comes to taking advantage of the technologies available.

IT decision-makers (ITDMs) feel that other departments need more technical skills training, particularly marketing (52%), finance (45%) and sales (43%). This indicates these teams may be misusing these technologies and need greater support from IT to course-correct.

Decentralization of IT could lead to increased collaboration and the benefits may outweigh the drawbacks. 74% of ITDMs in North America stated that their organizations have already successfully decentralized their IT structure, the highest of any other region surveyed.

Despite this, nearly all ITDMs surveyed (99%) stated their organization faces challenges if they continue to decentralize. Their top three concerns are centered around maintaining IT security levels (56%), maintaining quality levels (41%) and the reliability of ongoing support (37%).

Regardless, decision-makers believe the importance of IT’s role in the business will become more acknowledged as a result of decentralization (57%), with 89% agreeing that an IT department’s success is directly correlated with the organization’s overall success.

Marketers know customers don’t just crave personalized content — they expect it in the business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) brands with which they interact. In fact,

80% of customers are more likely to make a purchase from a brand that personalizes experiences.

Organizations using advanced personalization generate 17% more revenue through their campaigns.

71% of consumers feel frustrated with impersonal experiences.

When trying to execute highly personalized email campaigns, however, marketers encounter many barriers. More than 40% of marketers cite a lack of resources — time, people, and money — as a significant challenge.

Additionally, more than 90% of marketers identify marketing as critical to their company’s overall success. In 2022, over 40% of companies plan to increase their investment in email marketing. Dynamic content automation is finding its moment to shine.

Dynamic content automation combines data, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to create incredibly personalized, consumer-directed touchpoints. It enables marketers to integrate dynamic content templates into an email’s code. This allows them to seamlessly track on-site activity and subscriber behaviors, leveraging the data to instantly recommend personalized products in emails customized to subscribers’ unique needs.

With an increased reliance on email in marketing, it has become critical for revenue generation that companies use highly targeted, personalized marketing initiatives and programs. Customers base their purchase decisions on brands able to provide them with connected experiences whenever and wherever they want. With the tools to leverage comprehensive data and dynamic content, marketers are better equipped to predict what their buyers want in specific scenarios.

Dynamic content automation pulls the latest data from a company’s CRM, product feeds, customer demographics and more to automatically generate email variations from a single HTML tag, transforming how marketers create 1-to-1, individualized subscriber experiences. In short, this tool enables marketers to truly get the most out of their email programs.

What is dynamic content automation?

Dynamic content automation — sometimes called “adaptive,” “smart” or “real-time content” — allows marketing teams to use a combination of data and customer segmentation to dictate what specific, personalized content to display for individual subscribers.

Using HTML tags, email marketers can apply the most up-to-date data to personalize content for each subscriber based on:

Past purchase behaviors

Popular items

Similar content

Products viewed by similar shoppers

The most-viewed products or content by all visitors

Top category, top in category, or top purchased products and services

Products frequently purchased together

With dynamic content automation, marketers can automatically highlight content, products and services that resonate with similar audiences in real-time, supercharging the subscriber experience, increasing conversions and impacting revenue.

This strategy uses two different types of dynamic content: Variable and content insertion. Variables often include more basic personalization, showing different versions of the same variable for each subscriber. It might use a “first name” or “company name” field in an email, for example.

Content insertion, on the other hand, is more powerful. It allows marketers to insert sections of content, either text or images, based on subscriber data. They can create multilingual versions of emails — and swap content or images according to a subscriber’s preferred location or language. Any known data about a certain segment of subscribers, for example, age, gender, location, other demographics or interests, can also inform the content in a message. If a customer fills a cart but doesn’t check out, these emails work for abandoned cart reminders.

Another possibility? Offering proactive product suggestions based on previous purchases.

Regardless of what type of dynamic content you choose, the content and images you send via email can be informed by a wealth of data, like subscribers’ loyalty program status, preference center data, previous interactions or other account information. Other options include using geolocation targeting based on CRM data — like fast food or convenience stores closest to the zip code in an account profile — or if/then rules based on CRM or CDP data — like currency indicators based on profile location or language data.

Content automation challenges

Using dynamic content automation is not without its challenges, however. It isn’t always easy to create or update content without paying for a professional service if a company lacks the right technical expertise.

Another challenge? The risk of brand damage, loss of subscribers, or missed ROI when emails contain personalization or content errors, which may leave subscribers concerned the brand doesn’t know or value them. Broken links in content variations can result in frustrated subscribers and lost business.

While customizing content based on demographic identifiers can create great experiences that truly resonate, when brands get it wrong — like suggesting a Boston-based activity to someone who lives in Philadelphia — the email won’t produce the desired results.

The same goes for recommending products based on past purchases. It’s a great way for brands to boost revenue by solving subscriber needs — or making recommendations subscribers didn’t initially consider, but broken content holds zero value and can result in low conversion rates or, worse, unsubscribes.

Dynamic content is an incredible tool for creating unique, personalized email experiences, but it is not easy, and effectively adopting it can pose a whole other set of challenges. It is time-consuming to manually create and test many personalized versions of an email without automation. Without data integration like a CRM, it is hard to keep product, inventory, content feeds updated.

Because automated content often requires a lot of technical skill, companies may need to outsource or have dedicated internal development resources. Outsourcing dynamic content, however, can reduce control or visibility into how the process works, may require significant hand-holding, and creates potential testing roadblocks before launching a campaign.

Best practices for dynamic content

When done well, dynamic content automation enables marketers to execute strong, personalized email campaigns driving engagement and conversions at scale. Keep the following best practices in mind as you develop your content strategy.

Define and prioritize your marketing goals and metrics.

Ask questions to determine whether your email messaging resonates with your target audience. For example, does your content build upon itself? Have you engaged recipients with an authentic interest in that content? Are you tracking open, click and unsubscribe rates?

Leverage cross-channel user data, geotargeting, demographics, psychographics, and other behavioral cues like life cycle and buying stages to hone the personalization.

Dynamic content can drive personalized and data-driven recommendations — think Netflix and Amazon’s “collaborative filtering” approach. Your emails can include call-to-action (CTA) buttons that streamline the buyer journeys from initial contact to conversion. Different CTAs can represent each stage in a sales funnel. Previous interactions — and data from CRM — can inform other dynamic CTAs, like customer surveys, customer feedback, a contact database, or market research and segmentation.

Since content works best with accurate data, audit and cleanse your customer data regularly. Ask subscribers to update email preferences, too. Furthermore, do not make the mistake of overwhelming your subscribers with multiple dynamic content features all at once. Instead, opt for a more restrained approach, focusing on the content that would benefit the most from personalization based on the customer segment.

For example, if you use dynamic content automation in your welcome emails, you could customize the content based on where a customer subscribed. If someone subscribed via a specific page on your website, the email could include content about that product. If they subscribed after attending your webinar — or meeting you at a trade show — the welcome email could include a snippet from the presentation or show.

Putting your best foot forward — through email

The future of email must include personalization. Dynamic content automation solutions empower email marketers to efficiently build, test, collaborate on, and analyze high volumes of emails. In today’s increasingly connected — and digital — world, customers expect to engage with brands anytime, anywhere.

The wealth of data available to help marketers predict how their customers may respond across multiple scenarios has become even more complex. So is the challenge of giving subscribers what they want even before they realize they want it.

For example, mobiles.co.uk was losing revenue from abandoned carts. The company embedded AI-powered recommendations into Salescycle cart abandoned emails. Customers received two emails in the basket abandonment series to encourage them to check out or continue their shopping experience. Emails also included product recommendations displaying products similar to the abandoned product.

Results showed a 68% increase in average order value, 30% increase in conversion rate and a 124% increase in conversion value. Adding live, in-stock, and relevant product recommendations significantly increased value for mobiles.co.uk’s cart recovery program.

Generate more business from emails

To increase campaign engagement and improve customer experiences, companies must move beyond basic segmentation to achieve true personalization at scale. Delivering relevant content to each subscriber, however, breaks through the noise to shine in the inbox. Connecting directly with first-party data not only respects your customers’ privacy preferences but also delivers the individualized email experiences they crave and improves campaign results.

Ultimately, dynamic content automation empowers teams to improve their email marketing performance and strategy without spending valuable time on manual tasks or committing costly errors. Creating individualized experiences fosters customer loyalty and drives sustainable revenue outcomes.

OTTAWA, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol on Friday agreed to deepen cooperation on critical minerals used in electric vehicles (EVs) batteries as both countries seek to cut emissions to fight climate change.

Yoon visited London for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, and then New York in his first U.S. trip to attend the U.N. General Assembly, before arriving in Canada on Thursday. On Friday, Yoon met Trudeau in Ottawa, and then they both spoke to reporters.

""Yoon and I discussed ways to collaborate in a variety of areas, including essential minerals, batteries for electric vehicles, and emerging technologies, including AI (artificial intelligence),"" Trudeau told reporters.

Canada has many of the critical minerals - like lithium, cobalt and nickel - that are now used to make batteries for EVs, and the government is in the process of seeking to help producers and processors scale up production.

""Canada, as a global leader in the production of minerals, and Korea, a major semiconductor and battery maker - each play crucial roles in global supply chains,"" Yoon said through an interpreter.

""The governments and businesses of our two nations will work together for the mineral resources sector to build a cooperative architecture... to respond to the shocks resulting from the changing world order,"" Yoon added.

China is currently by far the dominant global supplier of critical minerals used in EVs. Yoon said it was strategically important for both countries to find an alternative supplier.

Canada and South Korea are already cooperating in the sector, Trudeau pointed out.

In March, Stellantis (STLA.MI), the parent of Jeep and Chrysler, said it would build an EV battery plant in a joint venture with South Korea's LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) in Windsor, across the border from Detroit. read more

In a joint statement, the two countries said they agreed to deepen their ""strategic partnership on supply chain resiliency"" and would seek to position themselves as ""competitive players in the critical minerals supply chain and battery and EV value chains"".

To that end, both countries agreed to develop a memorandum of understanding in the coming months to ""support clean energy transition and energy security, including with respect to critical minerals"".

Why it matters Meta's research into AI technology that can create new content could make it easier for creators and artists to make videos. Still, there are also concerns that these tools could be abused.

In one video, a dog wearing a red cape and sunglasses flies through the sky. In another video, unicorns gallop along a beach.

Facebook parent company Meta created these quirky videos with a new artificial intelligence system called Make-A-Video. It's part of Meta's research into technology that can create new content from text prompts. Meta said that Make-A-Video can also generate videos from images or similar videos.

Meta says its research into what's known as ""generative AI"" has the ""potential to open new opportunities for creators and artists."" Other companies are also studying this technology, making it easy for people to create art that would typically take a lot of time for humans to make. OpenAI, the company behind a service called Dall-E that uses AI to turn text prompts into visual art, said this week it opened the tool to everyone and roughly 1.5 million people make more than 2 million images a day. In May, Google unveiled an AI program that can turn text prompts into images.

Meta said that it plans to release a demo of Make-A-Video, but the tool isn't currently available to everyone. Meta's AI research team will be taking image requests through its Twitter account.

""Generative AI research is pushing creative expression forward by giving people tools to quickly and easily create new content,"" Meta said in a blog post on Thursday. ""With just a few words or lines of text, Make-A-Video can bring imagination to life and create one-of-a-kind videos full of vivid colors and landscapes.""

Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat, expressed some of those concerns, noting in a September letter that Stable Diffusion was used ""to create photos of violently beaten Asian women and pornography depicting real people.""

Meta said in its blog post it wants to be ""thoughtful"" when building generative AI systems and is open to getting feedback as the company shares their research publicly.",artificial intelligence,cnet

At the university, Cook was awarded an Honorary Degree in Innovation and International Management and also sat down for a Q&A session with students. Responding to a question from a student on what future technologies excite him the most, Cook pointed to artificial intelligence, calling it a ""fundamental, horizontal technology that will touch everything in our lives,"" ranging from innovations in the Apple Watch to ""many other things"" Apple is working on.

Cook, more importantly, stressed his excitement for augmented reality. Cook suggested that augmented reality's impact on the world will be as profound as the internet itself, saying people will wonder how they led a life without it. As he was speaking on augmented reality, the live stream of the Q&A session abruptly cut, so Cook's full comment on the subject is not publicly known.



I'm super excited about augmented reality. Because I think that we've had a great conversation here today, but if we could augment that with something from the virtual world, it would have arguably been even better. So I think that if you, and this will happen clearly not too long from now, if you look back at a point in time, you know, zoom out to the future and look back, you'll wonder how you led your life without augmented reality. Just like today, we wonder, how did people like me grow up without the internet. And so I think it could be that profound, and it's not going to be profound overnight...

Cook has in the past expressed his personal excitement for augmented reality and has hinted that Apple is working on AR/VR products. The company's first AR/VR product, a high-end headset rumored to be called ""Reality Pro,"" is expected to be announced as soon as January. The headset has been in development for several years and will be Apple's first major new product since the ""One more thing"" introduction of the Apple Watch in 2014.

""Reality Pro"" is rumored to feature a lightweight design, two 4K micro-OLED displays, 15 optical modules, two main processors, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, eye tracking, and more. The headset will run the realityOS operating system, which was seemingly confirmed by App Store logs. The device is expected to cost somewhere around $3,000, with a more affordable option reportedly in the works.",artificial intelligence,macrumors

Head over to the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions here.

Deepfakes, or high-fidelity, synthetic, fictional depictions of people and events leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), have become a common tool of misinformation over the past five years. But according to Eric Horvitz, Microsoft’s chief science officer, new deepfake threats are lurking on the horizon.

A new research paper from Horvitz says that interactive and compositional deepfakes are two growing classes of threats. In a Twitter thread, MosaicML research scientist Davis Blaloch described interactive deepfakes as “the illusion of talking to a real person. Imagine a scammer calling your grandmom who looks and sounds exactly like you.” Compositional deepfakes, he continued, go further with a bad actor creating many deepfakes to compile a “synthetic history.”

“Think making up a terrorist attack that never happened, inventing a fictional scandal, or putting together “proof” of a self-serving conspiracy theory. Such a synthetic history could be supplemented with real-world action (e.g., setting a building on fire),” Blaloch tweeted.

Generative AI is at an inflection point

In the paper, Horvitz said that the rising capabilities of discriminative and generative AI methods are reaching an inflection point. “The advances are providing unprecedented tools that can be used by state and non-state actors to create and distribute persuasive disinformation,” he wrote, adding that deepfakes will become more difficult to differentiate from reality.

The challenge, he explained, arises from the generative adversarial networks (GAN) methodology, an “iterative technique where the machine learning and inference employed to generate synthetic content is pitted against systems that attempt to discriminate generated fictions from fact.” Over time, he continued, the generator learns to fool the detector. “With this process at the foundation of deepfakes, neither pattern recognition techniques nor humans will be able to reliably recognize deepfakes,” he wrote.

Back in May, Horvitz testified before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, where he emphasized that organizations are certain to face new challenges as cybersecurity attacks increase in sophistication — including through the use of AI-powered synthetic media and deepfakes.

To date, he wrote in the new paper, deepfakes have been created and shared as one-off, stand-alone creations. Now, however, “we can expect to see the rise of new forms of persuasive deepfakes that move beyond fixed, singleton productions,” he said.

Defending against deepfakes

Horvitz cites a variety of ways governments, organizations, researchers and enterprises can prepare for and defend against the expected rise of interactive and compositional deepfakes.

The rise of ever-more sophisticated deepfakes will “raise the bar on expectations and requirements” of journalism and reporting, as well as the need to foster media literacy and raise awareness of these new trends.

In addition, new authenticity protocols to confirm identity might be necessary, he added – even new multifactor identification practices for admittance into online meetings. There may also need to be new standards to prove content provenance, including new watermark and fingerprint methods; new regulations and self-regulation; red-team efforts and continuous monitoring.

Deepfake vigilance is essential

“It’s important to be vigilant” against interactive and compositional deepfakes, said Horvitz in a tweet over the weekend.

Other experts also shared the paper on Twitter and weighed in. “Public awareness of AI risk is critical to staying ahead of the foreseeable harms,” wrote Margaret Mitchell, researcher and chief ethics scientist at Hugging Face. “I think about scamming and misinformation a LOT.”

Horvitz expanded in his conclusion: “As we progress at the frontier of technological possibilities, we must continue to envision potential abuses of the technologies that we create and work to develop threat models, controls, and safeguards — and to engage across multiple sectors on rising concerns, acceptable uses, best practices, mitigations, and regulations.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Without exaggeration, digital transformation is moving at breakneck speed, and the verdict is that it will only move faster. More organizations will migrate to the cloud, adopt edge computing and leverage artificial intelligence (AI) for business processes, according to Gartner.

Fueling this fast, wild ride is data, and this is why for many enterprises, data — in its various forms — is one of its most valuable assets. As businesses now have more data than ever before, managing and leveraging it for efficiency has become a top concern. Primary among those concerns is the inadequacy of traditional data management frameworks to handle the increasing complexities of a digital-forward business climate.

The priorities have changed: Customers are no longer satisfied with immobile traditional data centers and are now migrating to high-powered, on-demand and multicloud ones. According to Forrester’s survey of 1,039 international application development and delivery professionals, 60% of technology practitioners and decision-makers are using multicloud — a number expected to rise to 81% in the next 12 months. But perhaps most important from the survey is that “90% of responding multicloud users say that it’s helping them achieve their business goals.”

Managing the complexities of multicloud data centers

Gartner also reports that enterprise multicloud deployment has become so pervasive that until at least 2023, “the 10 biggest public cloud providers will command more than half of the total public cloud market.”

But that’s not where it ends — customers are also on the hunt for edge, private or hybrid multicloud data centers that offer full visibility of enterprise-wide technology stack and cross-domain correlation of IT infrastructure components. While justified, these functionalities come with great complexities.

Typically, layers upon layers of cross-domain configurations characterize the multicloud environment. However, as newer cloud computing functionalities enter into the mainstream, new layers are required — thus complicating an already-complex system.

This is made even more intricate with the rollout of the 5G network and edge data centers to support the increasing cloud-based demands of a global post-pandemic climate. Ushering in what many have called “a new wave of data centers,” this reconstruction creates even greater complexities that place enormous pressure on traditional operational models.

Change is necessary, but considering that the slightest change in one of the infrastructure, security, networking or application layers could result in large-scale butterfly effects, enterprise IT teams must come to terms with the fact that they cannot do it alone.

AIops as a solution to multicloud complexity

Andy Thurai, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research Inc., also confirmed this. For him, the siloed nature of multicloud operations management has resulted in the increasing complexity of IT operations. His solution? AI for IT operations (AIops), an AI industry category coined by tech research firm Gartner in 2016.

Officially defined by Gartner as “the combination of big data and ML [machine learning] in the automation and improvement of IT operation processes,” the detection, monitoring and analytic capabilities of AIops allow it to intelligently comb through countless disparate components of data centers to provide a holistic transformation of its operations.

By 2030, the rise in data volumes and its resulting increase in cloud adoption will have contributed to a projected $644.96 billion global AIops market size. What this means is that enterprises that expect to meet the speed and scale requirements of growing customer expectations must resort to AIops. Else, they run the risk of poor data management and a consequent fall in business performance.

This need creates a demand for comprehensive and holistic operating models for the deployment of AIops — and that is where Cloudfabrix comes in.

AIops as a composable analytics solution

Inspired to help enterprises ease their adoption of a data-first, AI-first and automate-everywhere strategy, Cloudfabrix today announced the availability of its new AIops operating model. It is equipped with persona-based composable analytics, data and AI/ML observability pipelines and incident-remediation workflow capabilities. The announcement comes on the heels of its recent release of what it describes as “the world-first robotic data automation fabric (RDAF) technology that unifies AIops, automation and observability.”

Identified as key to scaling AI, composable analytics give enterprises the opportunity to organize their IT infrastructure by creating subcomponents that can be accessed and delivered to remote machines at will. Featured in Cloudfabrix’s new AIops operating model is a composable analytics integration with composable dashboards and pipelines.

Offering a 360-degree visualization of disparate data sources and types, Cloudfabrix’s composable dashboards feature field-configurable persona-based dashboards, centralized visibility for platform teams and KPI dashboards for business-development operations.

Shailesh Manjrekar, VP of AI and marketing at Cloudfabrix, noted in an article published on Forbes that the only way AIops could process all data types to improve their quality and glean unique insights is through real-time observability pipelines. This stance is reiterated in Cloudfabrix’s adoption of not just composable pipelines, but also observability pipeline synthetics in its incident-remediation workflows.

In this synthesis, likely malfunctions are simulated to monitor the behavior of the pipeline and understand the probable causes and their solutions. Also included in the incident-remediation workflow of the model is the recommendation engine, which leverages learned behavior from the operational metastore and NLP analysis to recommend clear remediation actions for prioritized alerts.

To give a sense of the scope, Cloudfabrix’s CEO, Raju Datla, said the launch of its composable analytics is “solely focused on the BizDevOps personas in mind and transforming their user experience and trust in AI operations.”

He added that the launch also “focuses on automation, by seamlessly integrating AIops workflows in your operating model and building trust in data automation and observability pipelines through simulating synthetic errors before launching in production.” Some of those operational personas for whom this model has been designed include cloudops, bizops, GitOps, finops, devops, DevSecOps, Exec, ITops and serviceops.

Founded in 2015, Cloudfabrix specializes in enabling businesses to build autonomous enterprises with AI-powered IT solutions. Although the California-based software company markets itself as a foremost data-centric AIops platform vendor, it’s not without competition — especially with contenders like IBM’s Watson AIops, Moogsoft, Splunk and others.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Watch for their articles in the Data Pipeline.

Dallas-based Colossal Biosciences, the self-described de-extinction company behind the woolly mammoth and thylacine, today announced that it is spinning off Form Bio, as an independent software company offering a computational life sciences platform that bridges the gap between data and discovery.

Driven by deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, Form Bio empowers life scientists with a software platform for managing large datasets, executing verified workflows, visualizing results and collaborating with their peers. The platform brings these capabilities together in one cohesive unit with a user experience designed to simplify computational work and bolster life science breakthroughs across companies, labs and universities.

It is designed to be applied across an array of use cases including drug discovery, gene and cell therapy, manufacturing efficiency, academic research and more. Form Bio enters the market with a $30 million series A funding round led by JAZZ Venture Partners with participation from Thomas Tull, Colossal lead investor.

“When you have a big scientific endeavor like de-extincting a species, you not only need the smartest scientists in the world, you need powerful software, much of which simply hasn’t existed until now,” said Ben Lamm, Colossal cofounder and CEO. “After reviewing everything available on the market, we chose to create our own software solution. Now, we want to share this platform with the broader community to impact other areas of scientific innovation, including human health.”

Form Bio: The in-house tool turned software company

Form Bio was created almost in parallel with Colossal, the company that rose to fame for applying CRISPR technology for the purposes of species restoration, critically endangered species protection and the repopulation of critical ecosystems that support the continuation of life on Earth. At the time, the Colossal team recognized the lack of necessary software capabilities in the market and inadequacies of traditional bioinformatics processes to rapidly analyze enormous volumes of data. More importantly, they noticed that the market lacked the tools required by the team at Colossal themselves for comparative genomics and computational biology.

Developed initially to advance de-extinction, Form Bio was a solution that had the potential to address the data deluge while responding to the industry’s acute need for a simple, user-friendly platform to replace mountains of code, cumbersome data wrangling processes and underdeveloped tools.

Colossal’s team of computation biologists, along with the team of scientists at the Church Lab, and more than 35 geneticists at Colossal’s labs in Boston and Dallas, worked to develop and refine Form Bio’s core platform capabilities for the broader market.

The future of bioengineering: AI and machine learning

“Computer-aided design, fabrication, testing analyses and machine learning are key to the future of bioengineering in general and specifically restoration of endangered and extinct genetic diversity for keystone species in vital ecosystems,” said Colossal cofounder George Church, Professor at Harvard Medical School and MIT, and director of Synthetic Biology at the Wyss Institute in Boston. “Form Bio is the software critical to pave the way. As scientist-engineers, we need these pipelines and look forward to faster breakthroughs in scientific discoveries and applications, now that software has caught up with science.”

The Form platform sits at the intersection of biology and discovery. It brings together core components of data management, workflows, results visualization and collaboration in one cohesive solution. Included as part of Form is an extensive catalog of verified workflows, covering a wide range of scientific use cases from ancient DNA analysis and transcriptomics to AAV gene therapy.

The platform also serves as a foundation for advanced, AI-based applications tailored to the needs of specific industries and academic fields. “Scientists do like to tinker and do things very bespoke. The platform allows them to upload their own workflows or use the workflows that we’ve already developed and validated. So it gives them the confidence that it is something that they can trust the output of and that if they bring a different set of data in six months to get comparable results,” said Claire Aldridge, Ph.D., chief strategy officer, Form Bio.

With the launch of Form Bio, Kent Wakeford will transition from his day-to-day role as Colossal’s COO to Form Bio’s co-CEO, where he will work alongside co-CEO Andrew Busey and support Colossal’s CEO and Board of Directors in an executive special advisor role. Former Biolabs COO, Adam Milne, has also joined Colossal as its new Chief Operating Officer.

“We’ve created one integrated platform that’s been in development for the last 18 months. It allows users to take an idea and move it all the way into production in a way that is more efficient and cost effective. By taking a more open and transparent approach, the platform can use different toolsets, export data in any way they choose, perform computational analysis with our machine learning and AI models, and share the information with peers or other journals. In a nutshell, we aspire to be like the GitHub for science,” Wakeford told VentureBeat.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Head over to the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions here.

Even as data-driven apps, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) or advanced analytics, continue to see a surge in demand, companies are facing challenges in making the most of them. In a recent survey conducted by Alteryx and IDC, 73% of 1500 business leaders said they see spending on analytics growing. However, at the same time, many of the respondents also claimed that only about half of their business decisions are currently based on analytics.

While there can be multiple reasons for this gap, reliability challenges often come out as a major roadblock. Essentially, most data apps, even though effective, fail to deliver the performance that decision-makers expect consistently. They run on a complex data stack, which makes it difficult for data teams to track performance or understand the interactions and dependencies critical to optimizing it. In fact, modern data teams spend more than half of their day just on debugging and troubleshooting issues on the thousands of data pipelines in their environment and still end up struggling with performance issues.

This also results in higher costs and impacts the productivity of teams.

Unravel Data to the rescue

To address the challenges, Palo Alto, California-headquartered Unravel Data offers a full-stack data operations (dataops) platform that uses AI and ML to not only monitor the entire data stack for issues leading to application performance gaps, but also provide insights and automation capabilities to address those issues. The company today announced it has raised $50 million in a series D round of funding, led by Third Point Ventures.

Event Low-Code/No-Code Summit Join today’s leading executives at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit virtually on November 9. Register for your free pass today. Register Here

Founded by Sun Microsystems veteran Kunal Agarwal and Shivnath Babu, Unravel works in three stages to manage complex data pipelines.

The platform gathers metadata from across your entire stack to paint a picture of performance across data apps and their platforms, regardless of whether they are on-premise or on the cloud. Then, using this data, it builds and analyzes a fully correlated model of the entire environment. Finally, this model, combined with the platform’s knowledge base and intelligence engines, results in specific answers and insights about the data stack and what might be affecting app performance.

But, that’s not the end of the story.

Beyond insights, the solution also provides AI-powered recommendations to help teams take quick action on the issues detected, as well as the ability to automate actions for automatically improving performance over time.

“Just as the devops market united the practice of software development and operations a decade ago to transform the application lifecycle — data teams require the same kind of full-stack visibility, automation, and actionable intelligence that meet their needs around data pipeline performance, cost, and quality,” Agarwal said.

The company claims that its offering can ensure 100% reliability, making data apps available all the time, while reducing costs by up to 60% and time spent on troubleshooting by 98%. It has already seen adoption from leading giants, including Adobe, 84.51 (a Kroger company) and Deutsche Bank.

“Unravel enables us to see across our entire data environment, enabling our team to quickly understand which workloads are running well and which ones are having issues, and make recommendations on how we can fix the problems,” Jeff Lambert, VP of data solutions at 84.51, said.

Funding

With this round of funding, which takes Unravel’s total capital to $107.5 million, the company will focus on extending its platform to help connect the dots from every system in the modern data stack, including within and across the most popular data ecosystems such as Databricks, Snowflake, Amazon EMR, BigQuery, and Dataproc.

“The dataops observability market is poised to explode as enterprises invest in building data products that increase customers, revenue, and efficiencies,” Curtis McKee, partner at Third Point Ventures, said. “We’re excited to partner with Unravel Data, as the company has paved the way and established a proven track record of success helping some of the world’s most recognized brands simplify their data operations so they can bring new data-driven innovations to market.”

Other players in the dataops observability space are Dynatrace, New Relic, AppDynamics and Datadog.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

The latest generation of artificial intelligence (AI) models, also known as transformers, have already changed our daily lives, taking the wheel for us, completing our thoughts when we compose an email or answering our questions in search engines.

However, right now, only the largest tech companies have the means and manpower to wield these massive models at consumer scale. To get their model into production, data scientists typically take one to two weeks, dealing with GPUs, containers, API gateways and the like, or have to request a different team to do so, which can cause delay. The time-consuming tasks associated with honing the powers of this technology are a main reason why 87% of machine learning (ML) projects never make it to production.

To address this challenge, New York-based Hugging Face, which aims to democratize AI and ML via open-source and open science, has launched the Inference Endpoints. The AI-as-a-service offering is designed to be a solution to take on large workloads of enterprises — including in regulated industries that are heavy users of transformer models, like financial services (e.g., air gapped environments), healthcare services (e.g., HIPAA compliance) and consumer tech (e.g., GDPR compliance). The company claims that Inference Endpoints will enable more than 100,000 Hugging Face Hub users to go from experimentation to production in just a couple of minutes.

“Hugging Face Inference Endpoints is a few clicks to turn any model into your own API, so users can build AI-powered applications, on top of scalable, secure and fully managed infrastructure, instead of weeks of tedious work reinventing the wheel building and maintaining ad-hoc infrastructure (containers, kubernetes, the works.),” said Jeff Boudier, product director at Hugging Face.

Saving time and making room for new possibilities

The new feature can be useful for data scientists — saving time that they can instead spend working on improving their models and building new AI features. With their custom models integrated into apps, they can see the impact of their work more quickly.

For a software developer, Inference Endpoints will allow them to build AI-powered features without needing to use machine learning.

“We have over 70k off-the-shelf models available to do anything from article summarization to translation to speech transcription in any language, image generation with diffusers, like the cliché says the limit is your imagination,” Boudier told VentureBeat.

So, how does it work? Users first need to select any of the more than 70,000 open-source models on the hub, or a private model hosted on their Hugging Face account. From there, users need to choose the cloud provider and select their region. They can also specify security settings, compute type and autoscaling. After that, a user can deploy any machine learning model, ranging from transformers to diffusers. Additionally, users can build completely custom AI applications to even match lyrics or music creating original videos with just text, for example. The compute use is billed by the hour and invoiced monthly.

“We were able to choose an off the shelf model that’s common for our customers to get started with and set it so that it can be configured to handle over 100 requests per second just with a few button clicks,” said Gareth Jones, senior product manager at Pinecone, a company using Hugging Face’s new offering. “With the release of the Hugging Face Inference Endpoints, we believe there’s a new standard for how easy it can be to go build your first vector embedding-based solution, whether it be semantic search or question answering system.”

Hugging Face started its life as a chatbot and aims to become the GitHub of machine learning. Today, the platform offers 100,000 pre-trained models and 10,000 datasets for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, speech, time-series, biology, reinforcement learning, chemistry and more.

With the launch of the Inference Endpoints, the company hopes to bolster the adoption of the latest AI models in production for companies of all sizes.

“What is really novel and aligned with our mission as a company is that with Inference Endpoints even the smallest startup with no prior machine learning experience can bring the latest advancements in AI into their app or service,” said Boudier.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

The piece focused on a study published in Science that “analyzed data from multiple large-scale randomized experiments on LinkedIn’s People You May Know algorithm, which recommends new connections to LinkedIn members, to test the extent to which weak ties increased job mobility in the world’s largest professional social network.” The Times’ said that LinkedIn ran “experiments” on more than 20 million users over five years that, “while intended to improve how the platform worked for members, could have affected some people’s livelihoods.”

According to Xu, who leads LinkedIn’s centralized data team that includes all AI, data science and privacy engineering teams, the study involved “no experimenting.” Instead, she told VentureBeat the research “was entirely based on observational causal study – this means we used cutting-edge social science methods (the same ones that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Economics) to analyze historical data and discover causal patterns.”

A bridge between research and product

Xu said she thinks a great deal about the ethical implications of LinkedIn research, especially when it comes to using new algorithms and machine learning architecture like GPT and Transformers. At the same time, AI is core to LinkedIn products, as it is for so many of today’s businesses — so she explained that her philosophy is that research and product groups have to work hand-in-hand to meet the needs of the company’s three different customer ecosystems — job seekers and hiring companies; B2B buyers and sellers; and knowledge seekers/producers.

“True magic really comes when we can create a very tight connection and bridge between the research and the practical applications,” she said.

That starts with the organizational structure, with researchers and engineers working together.

“The problem itself should inform the research agenda, but at the same time the production constraints should actually inspire the research itself,” she explained. “For example, if you don’t have any scalability constraints, you can come up with the most complicated algorithm, but if have to fit everything within this memory, you have to use this kind of computational constraint, you have these latency constraints, all of a sudden you actually inspire and motivate the research to be done in a different way.”

3 top traits of LinkedIn data science talent

That collaborative culture requires the right data science talent — Xu said there are three important things that she looks for in candidates. First, is the individual mission-driven and impact-driven?

“They want to achieve something in the end,” she explained. “They may have a different approaches to achieving it…but ultimately they want to do right by members and customers.”

Next, Xu wants to hire people who are — not surprisingly — collaborative. They should be those “who really care for each other, who really respect people who are coming with different skill sets,” she said. “You don’t want to hire individuals who are like, ‘hey, I’m the smartest and the best and the brightest and no one else is right.'”

Finally, Xu said she wants people who are willing to learn, adapt and stay curious. “Nobody can come into this field and be like, ‘I know everything,'” she said. “I mean, I had my Ph.D. in machine learning statistics 10 years ago, and if I compare what I did to what is [going on] today, oh my gosh, it’s night and day,” she said.

LinkedIn’s AI and data challenges

LinkedIn’s three ecosystems create AI and data challenges, said Xu, because their heterogeneity makes it hard to define a “true north” value. “AI works the best if you can say ‘This is the objective function’ and optimize towards that,” she said.

That means there needs to be a multi-objective optimization framework for AI, complicated further by the fact that there are so many different personas involved. “It’s another challenging thing to understand what their needs are and how to balance those different needs,” she said.

Finally, from a technical standpoint, each of those personas comes with various problems at different scales: “We have a lot more posts on LinkedIn than we have on learning courses, for example,” she said. “And they come with different latency requirements — you have to return ads within milliseconds, but you have a lot more flexibility when it comes to, maybe, a search returned from our Sales Navigator, or recommendations by email.”

AI opportunities and responsible AI

The latest AI advancements, such as large language models including GPT-3, offer opportunities for LinkedIn to tie its marketplaces together with common technology that can be used across the board, said Xu.

“Whether it’s a feed post, a job description, or a member’s profile, we can understand that text a lot better, and we can then map to topics that a post is about or maybe job skills and then connect that back to what this member is looking for,” she said, adding that advances in algorithms, hardware and software will be a key focus overall in advancing LinkedIn’s AI and data ambitions.

She added that better technology methods also now exist to better measure AI fairness in LinkedIn’s feed recommendations or connection recommendations.

However, fairness is just one area LinkedIn is investing in when it comes to responsible AI using Microsoft’s Responsible AI framework.

“In the fairness area, we are continuously pushing for both measurement and mitigation — how can we understand how our algorithm is doing relative to what it’s intended to do?” she said. “And then mitigation is, if we identify areas that there are gaps, what are the approaches that we can do in order to mitigate it?”

Transparency is another focus area. about explaining what algorithms are doing, she said: “Can the modelers who are building these algorithms explain them to the developers? Can we explain it then to the users who are interacting with algorithms?”

It’s a “very challenging” space, she admits: “But it’s really, really exciting from a technology standpoint.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Moira Buffini’s damning satire imagining the Queen’s weekly meetings with Margaret Thatcher acquires poignancy; James Macdonald directs Chekhov in outer space; and a driving lesson for us all Kate Kellaway Sun 25 Sep 2022 10.30 BST Share on Facebook

It seemed likely that the revival of Handbagged, Moira Buffini’s 2010 satirical hit about the reputedly dicey relationship between the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, would be cancelled – and, on the day of the funeral, it was. The following day, I pitched up to the Kiln feeling hesitantly heretical: what would it be like to see the Queen impersonated after all those sober hours of contemplating her coffin on television?

As Marion Bailey stepped on stage, I could swear I spotted tears in her eyes. An exceptionally sympathetic actor, she made it possible, within seconds, to relax. Buffini’s play is, not unexpectedly, far more merciful to the Queen than to Mrs Thatcher, and in Bailey’s hands, satire came close to tribute. She brings sweetness, kindness and intelligence to the role. The Queen’s niceness becomes almost a moral quality. As she totters around in frumpy, apricot-coloured twinset, she looks about to purr, although also, at times, privately eye-rolling and tempted to growl at her prime minister’s intransigence. The Queen’s younger self, impressively played in parallel by Abigail Cruttenden, is politely concentrated yet frequently nonplussed by Thatcher. There are gentle jokes at the monarch’s expense – digs about her love of horses – but only one serious potshot. When the Queen is holding forth about poverty, Thatcher retorts in an exasperated aside that the Queen does not pay taxes.

This is an entertaining, pacy and damning scamper through Thatcher’s 11 years in power. She is also played by two actors to represent her older and younger selves. Naomi Frederick plays the younger with vim, but it is Kate Fahy, the elder, who steals the show. She has mastered Maggie to comic perfection, catching precisely the faux-hushed, breathy quality of the later voice – at its most mannish when in pursuit of femininity. It’s an excruciating pleasure to hear her. Fahy has also mastered the strange up-and-down movements of the head when speaking, like a nodding dog mascot but more swayingly unpredictable.

The two men in the cast, Romayne Andrews and Richard Cant, each play several roles and do the piece proud. As the Queen’s butler and a saucy Nancy Reagan, Andrews is a hoot. Cant has an unfailing grip on the absurd, too, as a ganglingly offputting Denis Thatcher and a mindless cowboy of a Ronald Reagan. There are several satisfying meta-theatrical moments when the actors appear to shake off their script: Andrews flatly refuses to play Enoch Powell; Cant is determined to enlighten younger members of the audience about what the Thatcher years were really like. Indhu Rubasingham, who directed the original, pulls off this revival with confidence. And seeing Bailey, at the opening of the second half, walking through the stalls, waving a white-gloved hand, has a revenant poignancy.

The samovar has given way to the spaceship in Vinay Patel’s admirable and eccentric reworking of Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard, with a cast of mainly South Asian heritage. James Macdonald’s production is an experimental feat. Within the Yard’s small space, a revolving stage has been installed (great work from designer Rosie Elnile) with hi-tech, talkative, all-lights-flashing artificial intelligence as its centrepiece (name of Divya, she is pert and tactless, her voice amusingly conveyed by Chandrika Chevli).

One misses the romance of the Russian estate, but this brave new play relates to a moment in which we are on the verge of losing so much. Here are future citizens of a translated universe, mourning a pastoral scene. But do we have lift-off, theatrically speaking? Only intermittently. This is a claustrophobic piece for the crew aboard the spaceship, and too often a particularly stultifying form of Chekhovian ennui sets in and spreads into the audience.

‘An experimental feat’: The Cherry Orchard at the Yard. Photograph: Johan Persson

Anjali Jay plays Captain Prema Ramesh (the Madame Ranevskaya equivalent) fluently; Neil D’Souza plays her brother, Lohit, an amusingly tiresome compulsive talker. There are good supporting performances from Tripti Tripuraneni as an embattled Varsha; Maanuv Thiara as Abinash, chief engineer; Gavi Singh Chera as Pawan, stellar cartographer; and Aaron Gill as Sailesh, a gauche and lovestruck quartermaster who serenades the computer in a particularly diverting scene. But the most enjoyable theatrical ingredient is Hari Mackinnon’s old retainer, Feroze (Firs in the original), in Russian butler garb of shabby black, whose unfocused vision, strange high-stepping gait and jerky arm movements reveal him to be a robot. Feroze is saturated by images of the past, and the implication is that the past is no longer bearable for anything other than a machine to store. He is comic and tragic – a perfectly Chekhovian combination.

It takes less time than your average driving lesson (under an hour) to watch Clutch, Will Jackson’s funny, involving and heartwarming new play, empathically directed by Philip J Morris. On stage are two black leather car seats, side by side. The driving instructor and the learner driver, his pupil, have been brilliantly cast for contrast. Max (Geoffrey Aymer) is larger-than-life and black, and instructs Tyler (Charlie Kafflyn), who is small, white and transgender, and the play is about the sympathy that develops between them as they discover by accident (and because of an accident) the vulnerabilities in each other’s lives. There is no stalling in this playlet, although Tyler gets off to a bumpy start in the car. Fasten your seatbelt – and go.

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/09/29/acdsee-photo-studio-ultimate-now-lets-you-edit-faces-and-skies-with-ai/,"ACDSee’s Photo Studio Ultimate 2023 update is focused on artificial intelligence (AI) features, like a new Face Edit and subject removal, which brings it more in line with competitor products from Adobe and Skylum.

Photo Studio Ultimate adds several new features, headlined by the addition of two new AI-powered tools: AI Face Edit and Ai Actions.

AI Face edit allows photographers from various skill levels to edit human facial features in photos such as their general shape, the eyes, nose, mouth, and more.

The edits that can be made to a face are rather extreme and quite similar to Adobe Photoshop’s Neural Filters which were criticized as being too powerful and ripe for abuse.

That was two years ago, and it could be debated if that fear ever came to fruition. With ACDSee’s integration of the feature now, which allows editors to change a frown into a smile, it is at least something that will become more widely available.

The new AI Actions are described as a simple way to perform more complicated procedures such as selecting the sky, subject, or removing backgrounds, all with a single click. Sky replacement has become a rather ubiquitous, expected feature in modern photo editing platforms, so its inclusion here should not come as a surprise.

The platform also adds advanced search with logic, improved and faster Quick Search, and a new photo merge feature that includes panoramic stitching, HDR, and focus stacking. IT also has a new shape selection tool and tighter integration with Microsoft OneDrive.

“The new features and enhancements help photographers edit photos and manage them in a variety of ways, all in an instant. By taking advantage of the new AI Features and Advanced Search, photographers will find their process flowing smoother than ever before. Photo Studio Ultimate 2023 is the ticket to a future where Artificial Intelligence will help transcend a photographer beyond their limits,” Frank Lin, COO and CTO of ACDSee, says.

Photo Studio Ultimate 2023 carries forward features from previous iterations of course, including layered editing, face detection and facial recognition, batch processing tools, RAW editing with support for over 700 cameras, color and tone wheels, a liquify tool, and more.

ACDSee Photo Studio Ultimate 2023 is available now for $150. That is a one-time cost, which perhaps positions it as an affordable alternative to the subscription-only Adobe Creative Cloud.",artificial intelligence,petapixel
42,A.I. Cannot Choose for Us (Yet): Aristotle on Choice and Thinking,"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1008,h_528,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fdeepsub.substack.com%2Ftwitter%2Fsubscribe-card.svg%3Fv%3D039646889e7306822789549b01fdd0cd%26version%3D7",25/09/2022,Aristotle on Choice and Thinking,https://deepsub.substack.com/p/coming-soon,"This is Autonomy, a newsletter about A.I. and Philosophy.

A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) systems, or more generally algorithms run by machines, make calculations that help solve problems for us. In this way, they exhibit a certain ability to think. But we do not believe they yet have a general-purpose reasoning ability commensurate with a human's. Our efforts have not arrived at A.G.I. (Artificial General Intelligence) yet. Can Aristotle's breakdown of thinking help us understand what might be missing?

“Thinking itself moves nothing"", Aristotle writes. Action—of the informed kind, praxis—needs choice, and choice comes from deliberate desire. The deliberation part of the equation here relates to thinking and calculating, whereas the desire part is more ineffable. Right desire needs an understanding of what is good, which relates to wisdom. More about the latter in a later blog post. But the upshot to Aristotle's framework is, as he goes on to write:

“… choice is … desire fused with thinking, and such a source is a human being.""

There are no serious claims yet of an A.I. system having desires. Therefore current A.I. is not such a source of choice-making. At least, not in Aristotle's framework of describing the work of a human-being in terms of virtue.

Now, you might cite examples of A.I. making choices for us. For example, a sophisticated GPS navigation algorithm chooses the best route to work for us each morning, taking into account traffic conditions. But, does the algorithm want us to have the shortest ride? No. The human engineers who implemented the algorithm do.

And when the GPS navigation goes wrong at times, we blame the human engineers, not the algorithm. The algorithm may be the cause of a bad commute, but we don't hold it accountable as we do the engineers, the engineers who made the tradeoffs when coming up with and implementing the algorithm. It was they who chose for us.

Current A.I. does not choose for us. When it gains the ability to do so, it becomes something more.

And Qualcomm's VP believes that artificial intelligence (AI) technology will help smartphones to surpass DSLR cameras completely within the next three to five years.
[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/09/28/smartphones-will-soon-outperform-dslr-quality-qualcomm-vp-says/,"Today’s smartphones have become the biggest competitor for DSLR cameras. And Qualcomm’s VP believes that artificial intelligence (AI) technology will help smartphones to surpass DSLR cameras completely within the next three to five years.

In an interview with Android Authority on Monday, Qualcomm’s VP of product management for cameras, Judd Heape said that thanks to innovations in AI technology, smartphone will overtake DSLR cameras and effectively render them obsolete in the coming years.

“We’re three to five years away from reaching the holy grail of AI photography,” explains the Qualcomm engineer.

In the interview, Heape explains that AI in photography can be divided into four stages. The first stage is a “basic” one in which AI is used to understand a specific thing in an image or scene.

The second stage sees AI control the so-called 3A features, namely auto-focus, auto-white balance, and auto-exposure adjustments.

According to Android Authority, Heape estimates that the industry is currently at the third stage of the AI photography game, where AI is used to understand the different segments or elements of the scene. For example, smartphones today can recognize a person’s face and make sure it is properly exposed.

Heape says that the industry is roughly three to five years away from the fourth stage, which will see AI processing the entire image.

“Going forward in the future, we see a lot more AI capability to understand the scene, to understand the difference between skin and hair, and fabric and background and that sort of thing,” he explains. “And all those pixels being handled differently in real-time, not just post-processing a couple of seconds after the snapshot is taken but in real-time during like a camcorder video shoot.”

Heape adds “Imagine a world from the future where you’d say ‘I want the picture to look like this National Geographic scene,’ and the AI engine would say ‘okay, I’m going to adjust the colors and the texture and the white balance and everything to look like and feel like this image you just showed me’.”

He claims that the processing power available inside smartphones is a significant advantage over DSLR cameras. Heape argues that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors in smartphones are what makes its cameras so capable, despite the devices having smaller sensors and that this will play a huge part towards smartphones overtaking DSLRs.

“In terms of getting towards the image quality of a DSLR, yes. I think the image sensor is there. I think the amount of innovation that’s going into mobile image sensors is probably faster and more advanced than what’s happening in the rest of the industry.”

“The processing in Snapdragon [in a smartphone] is 10 times better than what you can find on the biggest and baddest Nikon and Canon cameras. And that’s why we’re able to really push the barrier on image quality,” explains Heape. “Because even though we have a small lens and small image sensor, we’re doing many, many times more processing than what’s even capable in a DSLR.”

In May, the CEO of Sony’s Semiconductor division also claimed that smartphone cameras would exceed the quality of single-lens reflex cameras within the next few years, specifically by 2024.

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/09/26/photographer-uses-ai-to-resurrect-stars-from-the-dead/,"A photographer has used artificial intelligence (AI) to show what celebrities like Princess Diana, Kurt Cobain, and John Lennon would look like if they were still alive today.

Photographer Alper Yesiltas, who is based in Istanbul, Turkey, created the hyper-realistic portraits for a project titled “As If Nothing Happened.”

For the project, Yesiltas used AI photo enhancer software and photo editing programs to visually resurrect stars who died young and bring them back to life.

“With the development of AI technology, I’ve been excited for a while, thinking that anything imaginable can be shown in reality,” Yesiltas writes about the project.

“When I started tinkering with technology, I saw what I could do and thought about what would make me the happiest. I wanted to see some of the people I missed again in front of me and that’s how this project emerged,” he says.

Yesiltas adds “Behind this project lies the question of how would people look photo-realistically if some great events had not happened to them.”

In “As If Nothing Happened,” Yesiltas reimagines celebrities who died at a young age, often in tragic circumstances, and depicts them as if they were still living now. With the help of AI technology, he has created eerily lifelike portraits of cultural icons like Tupac Shakur, Heath Ledger, Janis Joplin, and Michael Jackson.

Yesiltas says that one of the most challenging parts of the creative process was making his images of these stars appear photo-realistic.

“The hardest part of the creative process for me is making the image feel “real” to me. The moment I like the most is when I think the image in front of me looks very realistic as if it was taken by a photographer,” he explains.

To make the images as real looking as possible, Upworthy reports that Yesiltas incorporated various photo editing programs such as Adobe Lightroom and VSCO, as well as the AI photo-enhancing software Remini.

However, the photographer says it can take a long time before he feels the portrait looks authentic.

“I am using various software programs. The time it takes for me to create one fully finished image varies,” he says. “But I would say it takes a while for an image to feel ‘real’ to me.”

Imgmi, other than being impossible to pronounce, promises to be easy to navigate yet is able to produce higher-quality photos thanks to relying on artificial intelligence (AI) tools.

“We know that the photography industry is changing, and many photographers nowadays are using their smartphones as the main camera. That’s why we decided that it would be amazing to give mobile photographers the power of our technologies,” Ivan Kutanin, CEO of Skylum, says.

“With the help of imgmi we provide creators all over the world with the most innovative solutions wrapped in a beautiful user experience, and we’ll be glad if you try it out too. Thanks to imgmi, now anyone can have outstanding results with our smart editor on the go.”

Skylum says that imgmi helps eliminate “undesireable” elements in photos and make them more attractive to a wider audience in a few taps. The company says it is especially useful for photographers who feel the need to produce attractive content quickly while simultaneously don’t want to carry equipment — such as a camera or laptop — with them.

The app takes several of the features that make Skylum’s flagship desktop software Luminar Neo desirable and supposedly makes them fast and easy to access on the go. While it does include a set of simple filters, it also has an auto “Enhance AI” feature, sky replacement, powerline removal, and a content-aware removal feature called Erase.

Below are two before and after examples of what can be expected form the Enhance AI too:

In addition to these AI-powered tools that are borrowed from Luminar Neo, imgmi also has the typical photo editing tools like Saturation, Exposure, Shadows, and Highlights that the company says allow for simple and effective editing.

Imgmi launches today and is available both on Google Play and the Apple App Store. The editing app is available to try for free for seven days after which it can be purchased outright or subscribed to either weekly or annually. As has become typical for Skylum products lately, the company did not provide any pricing information for imgmi ahead of the announcement.

Update 9/29: After publication, Skylum explained that its subscription options are weekly or annually, not monthly or annually as its original press release stated. It also clarified pricing: that the app will cost $2.99 per week, $19.99 per year, or can be purchased outright for $40.",artificial intelligence,petapixel

Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Facebook parent Meta says it has disrupted a large Russian network of fake accounts impersonating European news outlets to push a pro-Kremlin view of the war in Ukraine.

Separately, the social media giant says it also took down a network originating in China targeting the U.S. midterm elections and criticizing the Czech government.

While the campaigns were not connected, the dual takedowns underscore how social media platforms continue to be ripe targets for efforts to shape the narratives around high-profile events, said Ben Nimmo, Meta's global threat intelligence lead.

""There's a shooting war going on in Ukraine, there are elections coming up in the U.S.,"" he said. ""And we're seeing influence operations that are talking about those things.""

Russia campaign targeted European support for Ukraine

Meta said the Russian operation was the largest and most complex it has disrupted since President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February.

""You can actually sum up everything it was saying in ten words: 'Ukraine's bad. Russia's good. Stop the sanctions. Stop supplying weapons,'"" Nimmo said.

It involved more than 60 websites pretending to be legitimate, high-profile European news organizations, including the U.K.'s The Guardian and Daily Mail, Germany's Der Spiegel and Bild, and Italian news agency ANSA.

The spoofed websites were built with care, Nimmo said, under the apparent theory that imitating a big brand would draw a big audience. They copied the layouts of outlets' real sites and imitated their web addresses. In some cases they used bylines and photos of real journalists and included working links to other news articles.

But Nimmo said that level of detail is what doomed the operation. Meta began investigating the fake sites after journalists, researchers and members of the public flagged them this summer.

""They overreached themselves,"" he said. ""If you pretend to be Spiegel in Germany in front of an audience where Spiegel is one of the best-known brands in the country, then what you're doing is increasing the risk that somebody is actually going to look at you and say, 'Wait a minute, this is not the real thing.'""

The various fake sites ran articles in multiple languages with pro-Kremlin narratives, including accusing the Ukrainian government and military of corruption and warning of dire consequences from European sanctions on Russia.

The bulk of the spoofed news sites were German, but others imitated outlets in the U.K., Italy, France, Ukraine, and Latvia. In earlier phases, the operation created its own brands posing as news outlets, some of which were shared by official Facebook pages of Russian embassies.

The network promoted links to its websites using fake accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Telegram and Russia's LiveJournal as well as petition websites including Change.org. Many of the fake accounts used profile pictures generated by artificial intelligence, and a large number claimed to work for Netflix.

""They were trying to do a kind of smash-and-grab raid on the information environment,"" Nimmo said. ""They were trying to create these fakes and push them out so fast and so loudly that they reached real people before they got caught.""

Using fake social media accounts to drive traffic to external websites has become a common tactic in influence operations, also used by a separate Russian influence campaign that Meta removed in the early days of the invasion.

Facebook removed more than 2,300 accounts, pages and groups on Facebook and Instagram, which collectively accumulated around 5,500 followers. The network spent about $105,000 on ads promoting links to the fake websites.

These amplification tactics were crude, Meta said, with many of the posts, accounts and ads detected by its automated systems.

Chinese network took aim at divisive political issues

The Chinese network was much smaller and less sophisticated, and gained little, if any, traction. It consisted of 92 accounts, pages and groups on Facebook and Instagram that collectively gained around 280 followers.

It's the first time Meta has taken down a China-based effort focusing on the U.S. midterm elections. In the spring and summer of this year, fake accounts posed first as conservative Americans and then as liberals posting about U.S. politics, figures including President Joe Biden, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, and contentious topics such as abortion access and gun rights.

Meta said there were similarities to another network of China-based fake accounts it removed in 2020, which posted, in part, about the U.S. presidential election.

What is different this time, Nimmo said, is the direct focus on American politics rather than critiquing the U.S. government.

""All the operations from China that we've seen before talk about America rather than talking to America,"" he said. ""It looks like they were using these divisive issues, these hot political issues, as a window into American conversations.""

The network also posted in Chinese about geopolitics, accusing the U.S. of conducting surveillance and cyberattacks against China. In a separate cluster of activity, the fake accounts impersonated Czechs, criticizing the Czech government's support for Ukraine and warning against antagonizing China.

The network posted sporadically and typically during Chinese working hours. Its posts got little engagement on Facebook and Instagram, with some other users calling them out as fake, and hashtags it used when posting about American politics were rarely used by accounts outside the network, Meta said.

In addition to Facebook and Instagram, the network also operated on Twitter and two Czech petition websites – a similarity it shared with the Russian campaign.

""That they're moving off social media and trying to find other platforms where they can reach people, whether they're a big operation or a small one – that's an interesting development,"" Nimmo said. ""They're looking for a safe place on the internet where they're not going to get taken down.""

The road to learning new things and making discoveries is paved with hard labor, tough thinking, and plenty of dead ends. It’s a time-consuming, expensive endeavor, and for every success, there are thousands upon thousands of failures.

It’s a process so inefficient, you would think someone would have automated it already. The concept of the self-driving laboratory aims to do exactly that, and could revolutionize materials research in particular.

Leave It To The Auto-Lab

Materials research is a complex field and a challenging one to work in. Much of the work involves finding improvements on existing materials to make them harder, better, faster, or stronger. There’s also the scope to discover entirely new materials with unique properties and capabilities beyond those already known to us.

In the modern world, it’s not enough to just go outside and dig up a new kind of rock or find a new kind of tree. All the low-hanging fruit are already gone. Materials research now requires a sound understanding of physics and chemistry. It’s all about figuring out how to exploit those principles to make something better than what we’ve seen before.

This is where artificial intelligence and computers come in. Rules we’ve discovered in chemistry and physics can be programmed into an intelligent system. It’s then a straightforward leap to have that system apply those rules in varying ways to optimize desired outcomes. For example, an AI system can be asked to synthesize a given chemical in the most efficient way possible given a certain set of precursor chemicals. It’s then possible for the AI to run through all the possibilities and determine the best course of action.

Where the concept gets most compelling, though, is where an AI system is given the capacity to run its own experiments in the real world. Laboratory automation is advanced to the point where robots can readily run experiments far quicker and more efficiently than human scientists can do by hand. Give the AI the hardware to do experiments and to measure the results of its work, and it can then use the results to guide further experiments towards its given research goals. Congratulations – you’ve built a self-driving laboratory!

In Practice

Far from a mere theory, researchers around the world are already building self-driving laboratory systems. One of the most well-known is the so-called Artificial Chemist, developed by researchers at the University of Buffalo and North Carolina State University. The project’s goal was to develop an automated system to perform chemistry research for the research and development of commercially-desirable materials.

It’s designed to perform chemical research into materials that can be made using liquid solutions. The system is tasked with finding a way to synthesize a material that meets a set of desired parameters, and performs experiments on its own to determine how to achieve that. In testing the system was tasked with synthesizing quantum dots with various desired parameters. Through experimentation, Artificial Chemist was able to figure out ideal techniques on how to make the dots, including the identification of the correct chemical precursors.

Far from a simple computer simulation, Artificial Chemist does real chemistry on its own, and measures the results. The system was outfitted with chemical reactors that are entirely autonomous. They’re also designed to remain clean without picking up chemical residues that would throw off the experiments. The system can mix chemicals and run an entire chemical synthesis all on its own.

The system was developed with an eye to both research and manufacturing. It can be tasked to produce quantum dots for a given wavelength of light, and will first spend time doing research experiments to determine the best way to make them. Once that process is complete, usually after 1-10 hours, the system can then begin producing the dots en masse.

Research+

Overall, though, the basic principle can be applied to all kinds of research processes. One need only give a suitable AI system the means to experiment and the means to examine the results of its work. It can then take the logical steps to further its work in the direction of its given research goals.

The benefits of such systems are manifold. Where parts of experiments may have been automated by robots before, self-driving laboratories go further. They enable scientists to set a goal and the automated lab works its way to a solution entirely indepdently. This enables research to be carried out with less labor and human effort, with progress made far faster and far cheaper than before. Plus, the ability for quick calculation and experimentation may allow an AI to quickly run tests on combining regular ingredients in unexpected ways, netting surprise unconventional results. Some researchers expect these systems to provide a tenfold benefit to costs and time, where goals that once took ten years and $10 million dollars completed in one year and for just $1 million.

Of course, such systems won’t make human researchers obsolete. Creativity is of huge importance in science and engineering disciplines, and has led to some of our biggest advances. For example, an AI could be tasked to make stronger and more lightweight metal alloys. However, given those human-spawned preconceptions, it would never come up with the brilliance of composite materials like carbon fiber.

A great corollary is the image synthesis AIs which have skyrocketed in popularity this year. Initially, hyperbole stated that artists and photographers would be out of a job and human endeavour in this field was over. Then, weeks later, it turned out that these were just a new kind of tool that could be guided and put to work by humans best experienced in exploiting them.

These “self-driving laboratories” will likely become major tools in industrial R&D labs, doing everything from developing new materials to uncovering new molecules of potential medical interest. Talented research scientists will work to best employ the robotic resources they have, ensuring they’re put to work in the most effective manner for their broader research goals in general. With much of the research drudgery handed off to the robots, that will leave human scientists more time to think about the bigger picture.

48,We’re Witnessing the Birth of a New Artistic Medium,,27/09/2022,Expect AI art to go the way of Warhol.,https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/ai-art-generators-future/671568/?utm_source=feed,"Creative artificial intelligence is the latest and, in some ways, most surprising and exhilarating art form in the world. It also isn’t fully formed yet. That tension is causing some confusion.

If you’re familiar at all with the use of creative artificial intelligence, you probably know it through one of the popular text-to-image AI applications, which use sprawling databases of existing imagery to convert a written prompt into a new picture. DALL-E 2 from OpenAI is the best known, but more recent and arguably cooler applications include Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Their products can be astonishing: realistic street scenes, strawberry-covered ice-cream mountains in space, abstract concepts such as “hurt feelings” and “reminiscence” rendered in a way that feels visually accurate, if not entirely coherent. The best way to get a sense of their power is to test them yourself, and many are. Stable Diffusion reportedly has a million users just a month after its release, and at least that many people are using DALL-E 2.

These images are fascinating but oddly unsatisfying. Perhaps it’s just that I know they’re inhuman. But the inhumanity does not feel—at least to me, at least not yet—transcendent. It’s amazing that computers made the AI art, but the AI art is not yet amazing in itself.

The confusion of AI art in its nascent state leads, sadly but inevitably, to fear, as the unknown so often does. When Jason Allen’s Théâtre D’opéra Spatial won first prize for digital art at the Colorado State Fair, the reaction was entirely predictable. Théâtre D’opéra Spatial wasn’t art at all, the critics said—but also, somehow, it was going to replace art. “Art is dead,” Allen himself told The New York Times. “It’s over. AI won. Humans lost.” The writer Walter Kirn recently wrote an essay titled “There Is No Such Thing as A.I. Art.” For him, human struggle is essential to the validity of artistic expression: “As a writer, I face the demon of despair with every blank page, and many full ones, too, when I read what I’ve written and feel it could be better, if only I were able to make it so. A.I. knows nothing of these dramas. It compiles, sifts, and analyzes, then finally executes. But it doesn’t dare. It takes no risks. Only humans, our vulnerable species, can.” I mean, it’s not art if you’re just pushing some buttons, right?

What is so tiresome about the fear of AI art is that all of this has been said before—about photography. It took decades for photography to be recognized as an art form. Charles Baudelaire famously called photography the “mortal enemy” of art. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which was among the first American institutions to collect photographs, didn’t start doing so until 1924. The anxiety around the camera was nearly identical to our current fear of creative AI: Photography wasn’t art, but it was also going to replace art. It was “mere mechanism,” as one critic put it in 1865. I mean, it’s not art if you’re just pushing some buttons, right?

The idea that art is only art when it shows evidence of the artist’s handicraft is, at this point, so ludicrous that it barely needs addressing. People who say that anyone can make AI art are the latest in a long line of people who said the same thing about some of the most important art of the 20th century. Anyone could make a Jackson Pollock drip painting. Anyone could make Andy Warhol’s Brillo Boxes. Anyone could make Barnett Newman’s Voice of Fire.

Read: Of God and machines

With hindsight, it’s clear that machines didn’t replace art; they just expanded it. Photography and postwar art movements did not end anything. Instead, through them, new and wonderful things came into existence. Artificial intelligence isn’t going to replace creativity. It’s simply going to reconfigure the nature of creativity, as machines have been doing since the advent of modernity.

So let’s turn away from ludicrous fear toward the wonderful newness. Creative AI is the art of big data, perhaps the most direct form of artistic reproduction. What could be more suitable to our moment? As Jean-François Lyotard wrote in The Postmodern Condition, “Data banks are the Encyclopedia of tomorrow. They transcend the capacity of each of their users. They are ‘nature’ for postmodern man.” Creative artificial intelligence is the art of the archives; it is the art derived from the massive cultural archives we already inhabit.

Within this realm, eerie surprise or a kind of weird half-recognition are common effects. Strange figures can emerge from the archival primordium—figures such as Loab.

Loab is a kind of accidental horror story generated by creative AI. The Swedish musician Supercomposite was fooling around with negative prompt weights one day—commands that generate images that are the opposite of a given text. From one of these prompts materialized an image of a terrifying woman. When fused with other prompts, ever more horrific images resulted, some of which Supercomposite didn’t post—“the most disturbing ones, borderline snuff images of dismembered, screaming children.” The “creator” of Loab describes the monster she conjured as “some kind of emergent statistical accident.”

The great irony of creative AI is that its derivativeness is what makes it so original. Loab is a form of expression that has never existed before, but it’s unclear who the creator and audience are. Loab is much scarier when you know where she comes from, though. She is terrifying as an emanation of the collective imagistic heritage, the unconscious visual mind, if you will. Data, it turns out, have their own monsters.

Read: Is AI art a “toy” or a “weapon”?

We already have useful context for thinking about this moment. Virgil Abloh—skateboarder, DJ, Kanye West collaborator, Off-White founder, Louis Vuitton artistic director, and all-purpose genius—offered several relevant “cheat codes” before his untimely death in 2021. Perhaps his most powerful hack was “the three per cent rule.” “A creative only has to add a three per cent tweak to a pre-existing concept in order to generate a cultural contribution deemed innovative,” he said. “For instance, a DJ only needs to make small edits to innovate a song. Likewise, a designer would only need to add holes to an iconic handbag to leave his mark.” In the 21st century, reconfiguration, not originality, is the essence of art. As for criticism that his work amounted to ripping off other artists? Abloh’s rejoinder was simple: “Duchamp is my lawyer.” (Marcel Duchamp being the artist best known for a signed urinal.) These are fine principles to guide the art form that creative AI will be.

Already, there are glimpses of where this medium might be going. It has produced a deluge of images on stock-photography sites. A marketplace for prompts has developed, where you can buy and sell phrases to input into AI: $1.99 will get you a text description to feed into DALL-E 2 for emoji that look like they were molded from clay. There are also serious artists experimenting with the technology. The filmmaker Glenn Marshall recently won a jury award at the Cannes Short Film Festival for an AI-generated animation called The Crow. There are a great number of AI artists worth checking out, including Karen X. Cheng, CoffeeVectors, Faezeh Razavi, and Alan Resnick.

What has been true since at least the advent of photography is still true now: The art that is half-born is the most exciting. Nobody knows what a new art form can be until somebody figures out what it is. Figuring out what AI art is will be tremendously difficult, tremendously joyful. Let’s start now.",artificial intelligence,the atlantic

But artificial intelligence can do more, and actually make us tear up when seeing its creations – it can generate people who once were. It can create portraits of people who are no longer with us and show us what they would look like if they were still alive.

This is exactly what Alper Yesiltas used it for. With help of AI, he reimagined some of the biggest music icons such as Jimi Hendrix, Freddie Mercury, Janis Joplin and others. All of them abandoned us way too young, and Alper’s emotional project shows what they might look like if they were still here.

Alper is a lawyer and an award-winning photographer living in Istanbul, Turkey. He’s been imagining scenes and capturing memories for nearly two decades, with his photos published worldwide in books, magazines, exhibitions, and websites. His latest project is titled As if nothing happened and although he’s a photographer, this one is AI-based. “With the development of AI technology, I’ve been excited for a while, thinking that ‘anything imaginable can be shown in reality,'” the artist writes. “When I started tinkering with technology, I saw what I could do and thought about what would make me the happiest. I wanted to see some of the people I missed again in front of me and that’s how this project emerged.”

The question behind this project is “how would people look photo-realistically if some tragic events had not happened to them?” Alper asked himself the question and tried imagining people what those people who died young would look like today. He explains that the hardest part of the creative process was making the image feel “real.” “The moment I like the most is when I think the image in front of me looks very realistic as if it was taken by a photographer,” he explains.

To create his AI-portraits, Alper uses various software programs. The time it takes him to create an image varies, but it always takes “a while” before it feels realistic enough to be called finished. He has imagined rock and pop stars, but in his project you’ll also see images of an old Princess Diana, Bruce Lee, or Heath Ledger. They may not be musicians, but they are icons in their own regard.

South Australian artificial intelligence (AI) company GoMicro is rolling out its new grain assessment technology in Australia, paving the way towards more consistent quality controls and stable grain and pulse prices.

Based at Flinders University's high-tech New Venture Institute (NVI) at Tonsley Innovation District in Clovelly Park, Adelaide, GoMicro CEO Dr. Sivam Krish says the multi-grain assessor gives growers and domestic and export markets a quick and better way to grade crops, accurately testing more than 1,200 grains in one sample—compared to the existing scanner-based method which assesses about 200 well-separated grains at a time.

""GoMicro relies on the excellent quality of phone cameras and Amazon web services to deliver low-cost, high-precision quality grain and other produce assessments to farmers worldwide,"" says Dr. Krish.

GoMicro's grain assessment technology is also being trialed in wheat grown in India, corn in Ghana and negotiations are well advanced to expand the assessor rollout with a large Indian ag-tech company to use on grain, corn and soy procurement.

""Accurate verifiable assessment will greatly reduce quality-related assessment risks for all parties in the supply chain,"" says Dr. Krish.

The new system reduces the risk of wasted production and trade disputes which often involves more subjective human quality assessment.

""This direct digital manufacturing facility, at Flinders University, is working with Queensland grain, seed and pulse trader PB Agrifood to assess the quality of soybeans sold by local farmers,"" Dr. Krish says.

In the first Australian trial, PB Agrifood field officer Kate McIntyre says the Toowoomba-based company hopes the GoMicro Assessor will be ""very useful in day-to-day operations,"" making digitization solutions accessible to the company as well as growers to produce fair pricing based on objective assessment.

""When PB Agrifood heard about Go Micro and the use of AI technology to classify grain and pulses, we thought about how this technology could improve efficiency and accuracy in our intake of soybeans,"" says Ms. McIntyre.

""We believe that the implementation of the technology developed by Go Micro will allow us to establish the quality of the soybeans at intake more quickly and accurately.""

PB Agrifood has several uses for soybeans including whole beans, flour, kibble and meal. Each of these require different standards of soybeans. Currently, PB Agrifood staff manually categorize these soybeans based on the relevant standards.

The Go Micro technology assesses the soybeans into five categories and creates a table of results for each defect, including the percentage of defective beans in each category. ""It will enable us to match these percentages to our intake standards and categorize the beans,"" says Ms. McIntyre.

""We are still implementing the technology into our intake process with a few changes to be made, for example, our current standards work off a weight sample whereas with the Go Micro app the sample will be based on the number of individual beans.

""We hope that the technology will result in growers getting a fairer and faster categorization of their soybeans.""

Dr. Krish says the Go Micro technology has shown the potential for farmers to capitalize on low-cost, high-quality grain assessments to ""transform entire harvests into digital assets that can be traded online.""

""We are looking at yet more design and AI features to achieve optimal imaging conditions rapidly, even in the field,"" says Dr. Krish.

""We look forward to making our phone-based AI assessment technology affordable and available to the entire grain industry.""

GoMicro has developed a range of phone camera techniques and flexible web-based and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to promote primary production and profitability via pest and food product surveillance and now the new grain, pulses, coffee and tea assessment method for farmers and consumers around the world.

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/09/27/palette-is-a-free-web-based-ai-powered-photo-colorizer/,"A new artificial intelligence-powered web-based tool called Palette is able to take any black and white photo and colorize it. The creator is so confident in the results that he is billing it “the Dall-E of color.”

Developed by French artist-in-residence at Google Emil Wallner, Palette is based on “unreleased research” and uses a similar text-to-image artificial intelligence (AI) process as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and Dall-E but for post-production instead of image creation. Wallner is perhaps best known for his work colorizing Gustav Klimt’s faculty paintings with AI.

Wallner shared Pallete on Reddit earlier this month and received a huge amount of support, with that post garnering about a million views and resulted in more than 100,000 people trying out the platform.

“I’ve been creating AI colorization models for five years, both as a hobby and in a professional capacity. I find it fascinating for many reasons. I’m curious what black and white photos look like in color. You can often see new details and the general mood of the image changes,” Wallner says.

While some historical scholars have pushed back against the practice of colorization as harmful to historical accuracy, Wallner argues the opposite is true.

“It’s a fun way to learn about history. It’s also interesting from a technical point of view. The model both has to learn everything about the world, but also human language to enable people to edit photos with words. It’s fascinating to see the model start from scratch and learn advanced concepts about the world.”

Wallner says the idea for the system came about after he personally tried several different AI-based colorization approaches.

“Most AI colorizations average the colorization resulting in mostly brown colors, and purple and red tones for say clothes and cars. With the advancement of text-to-image AI technology, I saw an opportunity to both make more vibrant and dynamic colorizations, but also enable people to edit the colorization,” he explains.

“Editing photos is especially important when you know the colors of certain objects and for historical accuracy.”

Palette is smart enough to not only add color to an image, but also adapt to changing light conditions. Wallner says that he did not envision it being this intelligent and was even surprised when he saw that it worked.

“The first time I adjusted the light conditions, I was really surprised. I didn’t explicitly train it to adapt to different lighting conditions, but I learned it as a byproduct of translating grayscale images into colors. Not only did it learn about morning light and sunset, but also adapted to the time of the day. You simply describe the light with a text prompt.”

While it works better than he expected, Wallner says that Palette isn’t going to replace professional colorization.

“A common misconception about colorization is that a black and white image can only correspond to one colored image. In fact, that information is lost and we have to guess it,” he says.

“While you can make educated guesses based on statistics, much of colorization is doing research and artistic choices. The research required to make historically accurate colorizations still requires context and manual research. However, with a text prompt and filters, it makes it both easier to apply the research and also test different artistic directions.”

Palette is available to anyone worldwide and is compatible with most browsers, Wallner says. He also says that the images that are created using Palette are deleted from his servers after colorization is complete and the copyright to the colorizations belongs to the platform’s users.",artificial intelligence,petapixel
53,Ships are turning whales into ‘ocean roadkill’.

Last month…",https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/26/whale-deaths-ship-prevention-ai,"Fran was a celebrity whale – the most photographed humpback in the San Francisco Bay, with 277 recorded sightings since 2005. Last month, she was hit by a ship and killed.

Her death marked a grim milestone: Fran was the fifth whale to be killed by a ship strike in the area this year, according to the Marine Mammal Center. Collisions with ships are one of the leading causes of death for endangered whales, who breed, eat and travel in deep channels in the same busy waters that cargo ships frequent.

Whales that spend their lives near the surface – such as humpbacks and right whales – are especially at risk. One 2019 study likened their plight to those of land animals forced to criss-cross the highways that cut through their habitats. Whales, they say, are becoming ocean roadkill.

The Whale Safe project, which started in 2020 and is funded by the tech billionaire and Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, hopes to overcome that challenge using artificial intelligence. It provides close to real-time data on how many whales are present in the area, and sends out alerts to shipping companies to slow their boats in the presence of the whales.

“This is where tech meets Mother Nature for the benefit of marine life,” said Jeff Boehm, chief external relations officer of the Marine Mammal Center, in a news release last week. “Whales and ships must coexist in an increasingly busy ocean.”

The Whale Safe system works by using buoys fitted with microphones to hear whales, then layers artificial intelligence and models to deliver a “whale presence rating” ranging from low to high. It will also create report cards for shipping companies, based on their voluntary speed reductions in areas of whale activity. Slowing down is the number one thing ships can do to avoid lethal collisions, the group says.

The system has been in use around Santa Barbara, which is home to one of the shipping channels that services the biggest ports on the west coast, and is now expanding northward, into the San Francisco Bay area, also a busy port area for international cargo ships. In the first full year of the system operating near Santa Barbara, there were no recorded whale-ship interactions in the area, the project says.

Marine biologists say the project is a good step, but not a silver bullet in addressing the core issue of whales and ships. John Calambokidis, a senior research biologist and a founder of the Cascadia Research Collective, says he welcomes the Whale Safe program because “it provides additional attention to this important threat to whales”. The system is exciting in that it adds a real-time component to advance detection capabilities, he says.

But he doesn’t think it will represent any kind of solution to the problem until other measures – such as mandatory speed restrictions for ships and moving shipping lanes out of whale routes – are taken.

Calambokidis says that while the system can sense the presence of whales, it can’t give details on how far away they are, which direction they’re traveling, or how many of them are present. Calls from blue whales travel tens of miles, and males make calls more often when they are traveling. Some whales don’t make much noise at all, which would make sensing them difficult. The lack of sound doesn’t necessarily mean that whales aren’t present, he says. “It requires interpretation of the acoustics.”

In addition, the models that the artificial intelligence is trained on, models that Calambokidis has helped to create over decades of research, aren’t very effective at predicting whale occurrence at the scale of shipping lanes.

Between 1988 and 2012, there were at least 100 documented large whale ship strikes along the California coast. But that probably represents only a small proportion of deaths, because most bodies sink to the bottom, and the true number of deaths from ship strikes may be 10 times higher. Blue whales, in particular, have not experienced a population bump after the end of whaling – and ship collisions could be a significant reason stopping their recovery.

Cotton Rockwood, a senior marine ecologist at Point Blue Conservation Science, agrees that it’s a good piece of the puzzle for addressing the issue, but it won’t solve the problem alone. “We’ve often heard from captains that yes, they get these notifications that there are higher than average whale densities present, but they don’t necessarily see those whales at the surface, so they don’t necessarily feel like they have to slow down.”

Although more listening stations would make it easier to triangulate the location of whales, that doesn’t account for the quiet moments. “You’re only listening when they call, which isn’t all the time.”

Some projects to avoid whale-ship collisions in the Pacific north-west have tested infrared cameras, which work in some cases, but are very expensive, making them a tricky solution. Another technological fix could be sonic alarms that would shriek out warnings to help keep whales from getting hit. But again it comes with costs, says Rockwood. “Unfortunately, it means you’re putting more sound in the ocean, which is a pollutant for the whales,” he says, adding that whales didn’t respond to it in tests.

Rockwood says that while ship collisions are a visible problem along coastlines – because whale carcasses wash up on beaches – it’s a problem everywhere that ships travel, not just near the shore. “The more people are aware, and the more that the issue gets out there, the more likely it is that things are going to change,” he says. “There are known solutions that do help.”",artificial intelligence,the guardian

For too many companies, critical data is locked on a printed page, stored in a box or sitting on someone's desk who is out of the office. It's difficult to get that information flowing without scores of people to rekey it into an electronic format so that it can be more easily shared, analyzed, processed and acted upon.

These outdated practices are driving the adoption of intelligent document management.

Why traditional document management falls short

Document management has been around for a while. It generally refers to scanning all the pieces of paper in an office to understand what a company has so it can decide what to keep and develop a system of indexing that enables other employees to retrieve information.

Previously, companies manually indexed documents, meaning a human would look at a piece of paper, hone in on the vendor name and the account number, and key it into a database. Advancements then used optical character recognition (OCR) to aid in indexing. That is when software tries to figure out what each character is, for example, a machine reading six digits in an invoice and coming up with the number 123456. The trouble is that a ""6"" also looks like a ""b,"" so OCR is not highly accurate.

Traditional document management falls short in an important way: Information is only useful when inserted into workflows. This is where intelligent document management comes into play, and it's critical to digital transformation.

A shift to information management

Intelligent document management is more than a better way to scan documents because it enables information management. Thanks to its ""intelligence,"" intelligent document management offers automated classification, routing, measurement, monitoring and multi-channel information management fueled by artificial intelligence (AI).

Auto-classification means that scanners deploy AI to make intelligent decisions about what a page contains (e.g., recognize a bill of lading vs. an invoice) and categorize it.

Next, following the company's internal workflows, it routes the electronic version of the document to the correct person based on a combination of roles and rules (e.g., Mary, the Comptroller, must approve all invoices over $10,000, while invoices less than $5,000 go to Fred). Approvals can co-occur or follow a strict, sequential order.

Monitoring is essential. What if Mary is away on vacation for two weeks, and that invoice must be paid? An intelligent document management tool has timers, recognizing when a deadline is approaching and notifying and rerouting the document to a designated person so it can be handled. It also monitors the overall process and reports it to management.

Finally, intelligent document management supports multi-channel information — whether a piece of paper from a vendor or a bill of lading generated from an order management system. AI ensures data is gleaned correctly and routed through the proper workflows.

With intelligent document management, roughly 90% of a document's processing is handled by computer — decreasing administrative time, eliminating human error and saving money.

Getting started with intelligent document management

We believe the first step for intelligent document management is to fully document the current workflow by someone with information-management experience, not just IT experience. This is called a Business Process Analysis (BPA), and a solid grasp of how business is conducted is essential. Additionally, having experience rolling out future enterprise content management (ECM) initiatives within a Finance Department, HR Department, etc., is crucial if you want the final result to be a tenable solution that does what you need.

Then you need to decide what to digitize. Most organizations store more documents than they need. This scenario can lead to unnecessary risk, given emerging privacy laws and requirements protecting specific information types.

A document audit is required before digitization even starts. For instance, is a document, such as an employee contract, within its retention requirements, or are you no longer needed to keep it? If the latter, it's probably better to destroy that document. Another consideration: Every page scanned costs money, so an audit will drive cost efficiency.

Next, you'll need to develop a content roadmap for filing documents so that current and future employees can easily retrieve information. You have a photo of the Statue of Liberty. How should it be classified as a statue, national icon, New York City tourist attraction or gift from France?

You want to choose a vendor that works with you to guarantee successful outcomes and eliminates the risk of you making the wrong technology investments. Too often, companies underestimate the level of effort and complexity of a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach.

Many capture systems offer similar capabilities, but your experience with them may be highly influenced by the vendor. Is the vendor willing to do the critical document audit for you? Is the vendor willing to do the painstaking work of documenting your workflows so that the system lives up to its true potential? Does the vendor offer Service Level Agreements (SLAs), enabling you to hold the company accountable?

Getting the right solution at the right cost is key in any consideration. Intelligent document management providers charge money for an up-front analysis that highly trained, certified experts perform. A monthly subscription fee follows this to use the platform and a customization fee to implement your specific requirements. If you want to add more files to the system, there are fees to scan, extract and index those.

If the analysis is performed properly, you will know what it costs you now, where your bottlenecks are, where your risks and efficiencies are and what it will cost to improve. The BPA provides a quantitative pay-back period that allows you to make a heads-up decision based on facts.

Converting to an intelligent document management system will deliver immediate returns on investment and pay dividends well into the future. Mapping all incoming information to your unique workflows so that it can be processed with the minimal manual intervention will do more than save you time and money, however. It will ensure your company has the agility it needs to thrive in a fast-paced economy.",artificial intelligence,entrepreneur

The big tech news in a slow week was that the software giant Adobe is planning to pay the unconscionable sum of $20bn (£18bn) to acquire a small company called Figma. Why is this news? Well, first of all, there’s the price – way above any rational valuation of Figma. Second, there’s the question that we have finally learned to ask about tech mergers and acquisitions: is there a competition or antitrust issue here somewhere?

We’ll come to the price later, but at first sight, the answer to the second question would seem to be no: the two companies are not direct competitors. Adobe dominates the market in software for creating and publishing digital and printed material – graphics, photography, illustration, animation, multimedia/video, motion pictures and print. If you’ve ever used Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat Reader or opened a pdf (portable document format), then you’ve used an Adobe product.

Figma, in contrast, is a smallish company that produces nifty web-based tools to enable teams working on user interface and user experience design projects to collaborate online. None of these tools is a serious competitor for the heavy-duty ones that Adobe markets and indeed the Figma designers have always been ecumenical about what people choose to use in their design work. If a customer uses Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, well, that’s fine by Figma. Its focus is on enabling teams of designers to create workflows – using brainstorms, whiteboards, sticky notes, etc – that suit them and their collective projects.

So why would Adobe want to lay out such a mountain of cash to acquire this minnow? The answer is that its leaders are thinking ahead and they see a strategic threat in the making. In the networked world, more and more work is being done by geographically dispersed teams who have to collaborate online. And in that context, project management and the creation of workflows that are efficient, user-friendly and agile is moving centre stage. As James Carville, Bill Clinton’s strategist, might have said: “It’s the workflow, stupid!”

And Figma, to all intents and purposes, already owns that workflow space, whereas Adobe only makes tools that people use. As the veteran analyst Ben Thompson puts it in his newsletter, the reason why Adobe is both willing and has no choice but to spend so much is: “Figma is set to be the ‘operating system for design’, which means that in the long run Adobe has to operate on Figma’s terms, not the other way around; to put it another way, Adobe is not only paying for long-run control of design but also its own independence. That alone is worth a whole bunch of money!”

But even that need doesn’t quite explain the overpayment. The other reason is that Figma was doing quite nicely and had no need to sell itself. So the offer had to be one that nobody could refuse.

At this point, those with long memories will hear a bell ringing. Way back in 2009, an interesting messaging app appeared on the net. It was called WhatsApp. From the outset, it was clean and efficient and had a simple and honest business model – one year’s free use and then a modest annual subscription. And it grew like crazy.

By 2012, Facebook saw WhatsApp as a serious strategic threat. Internal documents extracted by a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) inquiry in 2020 tell the story. One senior executive writes: “This is the biggest threat to our product that I’ve seen in my five years here at Facebook; it’s bigger than G+ [Google Plus] and we’re all terrified. These guys actually have a credible strategy: start with the most credible social graph (ie the ones you message on mobile) and build from there.” In February 2013, the Facebook board saw a presentation warning that services such as WhatsApp were “a threat to our core businesses, both with respect to social graph and content sharing. They are building gaming platforms, profiles and news feeds [and] have all the ingredients for building a mobile-first social network.”

With the hard-won wisdom of hindsight, we now realise that Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp should never have been allowed

Guess what happened? In 2014, Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, made WhatsApp’s founders an offer they couldn’t refuse – $19bn – and that was way more than any rational valuation of the company. In an internal document, the move was described as a “land grab” that “prevents probably the only company that could have grown into the next Facebook purely on mobile”.

With the hard-won wisdom of hindsight, we now realise that Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp – just like its earlier purchase of Instagram in 2012 – should never have been allowed. So whether the FTC allows Adobe’s land grab of Figma will be a good test of whether the US government has acquired that wisdom. The deal should be challenged, investigated and banned. And if it isn’t, then we will know that tech companies still have little to fear from regulators – other than the odd, affordable, multibillion-dollar fine.

56,3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/702195/robot-star-background.jpg,24/09/2022,"IBM, Workday, and SentinelOne are all promising AI investments.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/24/3-artificial-intelligence-stocks-you-can-buy-and-h/,"The artificial intelligence (AI) market has become one of the tech sector's hottest pockets of growth in recent years. Many organizations now realize that crunching massive amounts of data with AI algorithms can help them make smarter decisions, spot overarching trends, and optimize their businesses. Others have realized that AI-powered services can replace human employees while automating and accelerating repetitive tasks.

However, the AI market is so broadly diversified that it can be tough for investors to separate the winners from the losers. So today I'll discuss a trio of promising AI stocks that are geared toward three very different types of investors: value-oriented ones, growth-oriented ones, and deeply speculative ones.

1. The value stock: IBM

Investors looking for a value stock that has plenty of exposure to the growing AI market should take a closer look at IBM (IBM -1.44%). Under Arvind Krishna, who took over as Big Blue's CEO in April 2020, the aging tech giant streamlined its sprawling business by spinning off its sluggish managed IT services segment as Kyndryl (KD -4.86%).

That separation, which closed last November, enabled the slimmed-down IBM to focus on expanding its higher-growth hybrid cloud and AI services. That strategy will mainly be driven by Red Hat, the open source software company it acquired for $34 billion three years ago.

Instead of going head-to-head against public cloud giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, IBM plans to wedge its AI-powered services between public and private clouds. These ""hybrid"" cloud services are compatible with a wide range of computing platforms, which makes them ideal for large companies that don't want to store all of their data on public cloud platforms.

Analysts expect the ""new"" IBM's revenue and earnings to grow 5% and 18%, respectively, as it expands those newer services. Those are solid growth rates for a stock that trades at just 13 times forward earnings while paying a forward dividend yield of 5.3%.

2. The growth stock: Workday

Investors who crave a higher-growth stock should check out Workday (WDAY -2.19%), which helps large companies hire, organize, and pay their employees with its AI-powered, cloud-based HCM (human capital management) platform. Companies can also use its analytics tools to make data-driven decisions, or use its financial tools to plan their budgets.

Workday already serves more than half of the Fortune 500, but it's still growing. Its revenue rose 19% to $5.14 billion in fiscal 2022 (which ended this January), and analysts expect 21% growth in fiscal 2023. Its business is well insulated from inflation, higher interest rates, and other macro headwinds because its tools help companies streamline their businesses and make tough decisions during economic downturns. Its subscription-based model keeps those customers locked in.

Workday isn't consistently profitable on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, but it's firmly profitable by non-GAAP measures. Analysts expect its non-GAAP earnings to decline 15% this year, but that's mainly due to its higher investments, which should be expected for a growing cloud-based software company.

Workday isn't a screaming bargain at 43 times forward earnings and six times this year's sales, but it could command higher valuations if it continues to grow its revenue by around 20% each year.

3. The speculative stock: SentinelOne

Last but not least, investors who want even more growth should dig deeper into SentinelOne (S -4.87%). This cybersecurity company claims its AI-powered Singularity platform, which operates across a hybrid mix of on-site appliances and cloud-based services, is more efficient than other traditional cybersecurity platforms that rely on human analysts.

A lot of companies agree: SentinelOne's revenue skyrocketed 120% to $205 million in fiscal 2022 (which ended this January), and it expects 102% to 103% growth in fiscal 2023. Those growth rates are stunning, but SentinelOne is still deeply unprofitable by GAAP and non-GAAP measures.

On a GAAP basis, SentinelOne's net loss more than doubled from $118 million in fiscal 2021 to $271 million in fiscal 2022, and analysts anticipate an even wider loss of $402 million this year. That's worrisome, because SentinelOne already operates at lower gross margins than many other larger cybersecurity companies -- and it could lack the pricing power to simultaneously expand while narrowing its losses.

Nevertheless, SentinelOne expects its gross margins to expand from about 70% today to ""75%-80%"" over the long term as it scales up its business. SentinelOne's stock isn't cheap at 17 times this year's sales, but it might be a worthwhile play for investors who want a speculative bet on the AI market that could either crash or generate multibagger gains.",artificial intelligence,motley fool

As the United Arab Emirates (UAE) continues to transition from an oil-based economy to a more knowledge-based economy, artificial intelligence is expected to become one of the country’s key sectors. The World Economic Forum estimates that artificial intelligence will add nearly $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030.

Abu Dhabi is spearheading the UAE’s transition. The country’s capital city boasts a burgeoning startup community, advanced machine-learning research facilities, and world-class educational institutions like the Khalifa University of Science and Technology (KU) and the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI).

“These institutions help anchor Abu Dhabi’s world-class AI ecosystem,” said Dr. Ernesto Damiani, professor and senior director of Khalifa University’s Robotics and Intelligent Systems Institute. “The ecosystem is also composed of several large companies that are invested in developing AI applications across a variety of verticals, from healthcare to energy.”

International professionals and researchers are relocating to Abu Dhabi thanks to the UAE’s Golden Visa program, which provides a wide range of visa options to top global talent for up to 10 years.

A Unique Government Partnership

In 2017, the UAE became the first country to appoint a minister of artificial intelligence, Omar Sultan Al Olama, who views artificial intelligence as a horizontal enabler that cuts across many industries, including information technology, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, finance, and marketing.

“Having a federal minister is what makes the UAE so special,” Damiani said. “The minister oversees the UAE’s Council for Artificial Intelligence, which helps the community coordinate research and assemble resources. This is something I rarely see in Europe or other regions of the world. The Council encourages collaboration while also fostering an important degree of competition.”

In addition to leading the strategic vision, setting priorities, and serving as an advocate for the sector at the federal level, the minister helps foster collaboration and information exchange among the region’s various educational institutions and research facilities.

“I’m very happy to know we have a friend and advocate in the government,” said Dr. Jorge Manuel Miranda Dias, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at KUCARS. “It gives Abu Dhabi a stronger position on the international stage.”

Abu Dhabi’s Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure

One of the Council’s biggest priorities is to enable the practical application of artificial intelligence, an effort supported by Khalifa University, MBZUAI, and the region’s growing cluster of educational and research institutions devoted to the sector.

For example, Khalifa University has been ramping up its artificial intelligence and robotics capabilities for more than 10 years, with the establishment of KUCARS in 2018 marking a major milestone for its growth in the sector.

“We have about 80 researchers working on advanced robotics projects, including about 12 faculty members, 30 post-doc researchers, and 50 graduate students,” said Dr. Lakmal Seneviratne, a professor who helped set up Khalifa University’s robotics division in 2010. “Our lab facilities are second to none, including a new marine robotics pool, an autonomous driving test lab, and a number of smaller laboratories focused on industrial robotics, space robotics, computer vision, and drones, to name a few. We even launched a program to strengthen food security, applying robotics to greenhouse and indoor farming.”

MBZUAI is teaming up with IBM to open a new research facility, the AI Centre for Excellence, which will bring students, faculty members, and IBM researchers together to develop artificial intelligence applications that address an array of real world challenges, from health care to climate change. In addition, the university plans to open a new supercomputing resource that can help students and researchers process the complex algorithms and large data sets needed to produce accurate results and models.

Other institutions include the NYU Abu Dhabi Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR), which is exploring how to use artificial intelligence to combat climate change, and the Technology Innovation Institute (TII), a global research center dedicated to pushing the frontiers of knowledge in a variety of advanced scientific fields, including natural language processing, a key component of the artificial intelligence sector. TII recently unveiled the world’s largest Arabic language processing model, Noor, which is designed to boost the development of tools like chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis across social media.

An Ideal Destination for Meetings and Events

Skift’s 2022 Megatrends reported that Abu Dhabi’s meetings and events strategy prioritizes the health and safety of residents and travelers while innovating around infrastructure, technology, culture, and experiential offerings. The city’s recently announced Advantage Abu Dhabi’s Meeting and Incentive 2.0 provides comprehensive value-adds and enhanced experiences to incentivize corporate clients to select Abu Dhabi for their events, and several conferences in the artificial intelligence sector are on the horizon.

In November, MBZUAI and NYU Abu Dhabi are co-hosting the 2022 conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, a leading conference on natural language processing and artificial intelligence. And in October 2024, Khalifa University is hosting the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, one of the largest robotics research conferences in the world.

Together, these high-caliber events make a strong case for Abu Dhabi as a truly global artificial intelligence hub. The city has been awarded the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS) in 2024, a highly acclaimed annual event established “to facilitate state-of-the-art research, innovation, and development activities at the frontiers of artificial intelligence.”

Looking Ahead: A Vision for the Future

Abu Dhabi has laid a great foundation for future growth in artificial intelligence. Sector leaders are confident that the city’s investment in developing people, supporting educational and research-led institutions, and fostering a robust tech business environment will pay major dividends over the next decade.

Seneviratne is excited for the road ahead: “Looking back over the past 10 years, we would never have imagined how quickly robotics and artificial intelligence would develop in Abu Dhabi. I think the next 10 years are going to be even more explosive.”

61,2 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch For Reversals,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/providers/marketbeat/hero-image-marketbeat-435935.jpeg,23/09/2022,"If you’re a fan of the industry over the long term, you might want to start thinking about backing up the truck. Both these stocks are looking very oversold.",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/2-semiconductor-stocks-to-watch-for-reversals/,"Key Points Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has a promising new business deal on the horizon.

Nvidia is about to be very-oversold.

After recent boom years, investors in the semiconductor industry have experienced a rough year so far in 2022. You only need to look at the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) to see how punishing this year has been to chip investors. A leading chip stocks fund with more than $6 billion in net assets, the ETF has been down 35% in the past ten months.

It wasn’t always like this, though. In recent years, semiconductor companies moved to actually expand their production capacity to address global chip shortages. Amid these shortages, chip prices soared, generating premium margins for semiconductor companies. But investors have lately soured on chip stocks amid concerns that the expanded capacity could lead to a supply glut that would, in turn, damage prices. Hence the multi-month sell-off.

Recession concerns have also scared off some investors from the semiconductor industry because of worries over the potential weak demand for chips. Moreover, the U.S. government’s recent decision to restrict the sale of certain chips to China has only increased uncertainty for semiconductor industry investors. As a result, chip stocks across the board have dropped sharply from their recent peaks. But when there’s chaos, there’s also opportunity, and now may be the best time to go bargain hunting for oversold semiconductor stocks. Let’s take a look at two such stocks that are worth considering for a rebound play.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM)

The chip supply chain has many participants. TSM participates in the production side. As its name suggests, the company is based in Taiwan, a global chip production capital, where they handle contract chip production and are the world’s leading provider in that space.

In fact, Nvidia recently tapped TSM to manufacture its latest generation of gaming graphic chips, which is a big win for them as Nvidia produced the previous generation of those chips at Samsung factories. The company has, over the years, invested in improving its manufacturing technology, making them the easy choice manufacturer for advanced semiconductor components.

It’s worth noting that the passing of the Chips Act caused some jitters among TSM investors. Many worried that the U.S. domestic semiconductor subsidy program could undercut Taiwan’s competitiveness in the chip manufacturing market and deal a blow to its companies like TSM. But Taiwan has gone out of its way to reiterate its position in the global semiconductor supply chain and argue that the Chips Act doesn’t threaten its chip industry.

If anything, TSM actually stands to benefit from the Chips Act. The company is setting up a $12 billion semiconductor plant in Arizona, putting them in a position to benefit from the U.S. chip industry subsidy and tax credit program.

In the midst of all this, though, TSM shares recently fell to a new 52-week low, but looking at the charts, a bullish setup has started to emerge. There’s a strong argument that a low could soon be put in as the RSI reading of 35 now indicates the stock is extremely oversold.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Nvidia is one of the better-known semiconductor names out there, and they design graphics processing chips that power a variety of gaming devices. The company also makes artificial intelligence chips used in data centers and other applications. Nvidia recently unveiled a new and advanced generation of its flagship GeForce graphics chips for the gaming industry, and in a show of its market might, they maintained high price tags on these. There’s a risk that the U.S. ban on the sale of advanced semiconductor components to China might hurt sales, but in all likelihood, the company’s latest graphics chips won’t be affected.

Still, its shares have been selling off since March. In addition to the broader concerns around the industry’s outlook and recession fears, Nvidia’s mixed earnings report for the most recent quarter also caused investors heartburn.

This week they hit a new 52-week low of $125, but with the stocks RSI approaching the 20s, you have to be thinking they’ll soon be very oversold. Indeed, it’s around this level that they consolidated back in 2020 and 2021, so there’s a fair chance the bulls will be stepping in again this time.

If you’re a fan of the industry over the long term, you might want to start thinking about backing up the truck.

62,Here's Why You Should Embrace Simplicity as a Strategy (and 3 Ways to Do It),https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1663703478-GettyImages-1286931542.jpg,26/09/2022,Here are three recommendations for placing simplicity at the center of your organizational strategy.,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/heres-why-you-should-embrace-simplicity-as-a-strategy-and/434377,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

""Simple is harder than complex,"" said Steve Jobs, the acknowledged master of simplicity in product design. ""Once you get there, you can move mountains."" Jobs spent his career trying to get his thinking ""clean"" and cultivating a ""beginner's mind"" so that he could make things simple. And he largely succeeded: Today, Apple is the second-largest company in the world by market capitalization, and its products are renowned for their sleek design and simplicity.

As Jobs notes, however, getting to ""simple"" isn't easy. Every business, regardless of industry, operates in an environment of complexity — and that's never been truer than it is today. Complexity saps an organization's strength, reduces its speed to market and serves as a drag on operational efficiency, and perhaps most importantly, its focus on customer needs.

And simplicity ranks high on the list of consumer desires. According to a global study of more than 15,000 consumers across the U.S., Europe and Asia, including the Middle East, 76% of respondents said they were more likely to recommend a brand that delivers simple experiences — up from 64% in 2018.

There are multiple causes of business complexity. In a classic 2007 Harvard Business Review article, ""Simplicity-Minded Management,"" Ron Ashkenas cites four main sources:

Structural mitosis: the steady accretion of structural changes or new organizational layers that makes businesses unwieldy and difficult to manage Product proliferation: the ongoing expansion of a company's product portfolio through the addition of new products, product lines or product variations Process evolution: the ongoing multiplication of organizational processes that contributes to inefficiency and even internal conflicts Managerial habits: the behavior — in some cases unintentional — of senior leaders and managers that makes for unnecessary work, which persists over time

In addition to organizational and product complexity, people today confront an increasingly complex technology landscape, both in their personal and professional lives. Indeed, as advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and AI applications like machine learning take hold, more and more people will be working alongside machines. Workers will need to have a working knowledge of complex technology and the necessary skills to manage human-machine interactions.

So, how can we, as leaders, defend against this tidal wave of complexity? Here are three recommendations for placing simplicity at the center of your organizational strategy:

Related: 5 Ways to Promote Simplicity and Boost Efficiency

1. Set clear, quantitative goals

Most entrepreneurs are driven by the desire to make the world a better place by improving upon the way things have always been done and inspired by lofty visions for the way things can be done. While being motivated by a deeply personal mission is important, it is just as important for entrepreneurs to set a few specific, measurable goals that guide their day-to-day work. Quantifying what success looks like — a month, quarter or year down the line — gives you benchmarks to work towards and allows you to make decisions based on hard facts and data.

Clearly defined goals are also necessary to align your team around a shared purpose. Just as a rowing team can't move forward unless everyone agrees upon the direction in which they are going, an organization will only thrive if every individual understands what they are working together to achieve.

2. Examine your people, processes and technology

Established in the early 1960s, the people, process, technology framework — sometimes called the Golden Triangle — encapsulates the three elements of a successful organizational transformation. This framework is just as useful for entrepreneurs looking to simplify their ways of working. Has your organizational structure become too hierarchical, and would a flatter structure eliminate barriers to getting work done? Can you expedite the process in which products are brought to market? Technology can automate time-intensive but low-value work, but too much technology can create unnecessary complexity. If you want to simplify your business but are unsure of where to begin, taking a closer look at your people, processes and technology is an excellent starting point.

3. Slow down, and listen to your customer

Simplicity often means slowing down to speed up — taking a step back to assess your progress so you can make sure you remain on the right path. There is a temptation, for example, to just keep building and deploying new products at maximum speed without fully understanding how the solutions are being received by customers. You've got to give those products a chance to breathe before refining them and building new enhancements.

The same is true when developing those enhancements. There's a tendency to overengineer things and develop features that may or may not be relevant to customers. Sometimes the answer is right in front of us — if we just allow the customer's voice to break through and tell us what they're really looking for.

This is why design thinking — the ability to diagnose problems, visualize and identify solutions and bring value to their customers quickly and consistently — is an essential skill for entrepreneurs. Design thinking is a powerful technique for customer-first problem-solving because it requires understanding your most important customers and their pain points first, before determining how to develop solutions that directly address them.

In business, very few things are simple. But we don't need to be ruled by complexity. It's our job as leaders to cut through the noise/distractions and simplify. It's our job to be deliberate, intentional and clear about what's essential to the organization and what's not. As the American philosopher William James noted, ""The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook.""",artificial intelligence,entrepreneur

Moreover, the company's bleak fundamentals look concerning. Hence, it might be wise to avoid NVDA now....",https://stocknews.com/news/nvda-stm-ateyy-umc-mxl-1-stock-to-dump-this-week-if-you-havent-already/,"Popular chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) received restrictions on exports of two of its top chips to China. However, Chief Executive Jensen Huang still expects a large market for its data center chips in China. But the export regulation of its A100 and H100 chips could affect up to $400 million in sales in its current fiscal quarter.

Moreover, famed investor Jim Cramer, who had been a strong proponent of NVDA for a long time, has recently turned bearish on the company’s stock following its Ethereum venture.

He stated, “They haven’t been able to make the transition yet to artificial intelligence, virtual reality, machine learning. We’re just not there yet. So, we have the high-tech stuff not there yet producing earnings and the lower stuff being hurt by this Ethereum transfer.”

The stock has declined 44.6% over the past year and 58.4% year-to-date to close its last trading session at $122.28. It is down 21.5% over the past month.

Here are the factors that could affect NVDA’s performance in the near term:

Bleak Bottom Line

For the fiscal second quarter that ended July 31, NVDA’s revenue increased 3% year-over-year to $6.70 billion. However, non-GAAP net income decreased 50.7% from the prior-year quarter to $1.29 billion. Non-GAAP net income per share declined 51% from the same period the prior year to $0.51.

Stretched Valuations

In terms of its forward EV/Sales, NVDA is trading at 11.30x, 375.5% higher than the industry average of 2.38x. The stock’s forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 49.12 is 322.1% higher than the industry average of 11.64. In terms of its forward Price/Sales, NVDA is trading at 11.49x, 368.1% higher than the industry average of 2.46x.

Unfavorable Analyst Expectations

The consensus EPS estimates of $0.71 and $0.79 for the quarters ending October 2022 and January 2023 indicate 39.3% and 40.2% year-over-year decreases. Street EPS estimate for the current fiscal year (ending in 2023) of $3.37 reflects a decline of 24.1% from the prior year.

The consensus revenue of $6.21 billion for the quarter ending January 2023 indicates an 18.7% year-over-year decline.

POWR Ratings Reflect Bleak Prospects

NVDA’s POWR Ratings reflect this bleak outlook. The stock has an overall rating of D, equating to Sell in our proprietary rating system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by considering 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.

NVDA has a Growth and Value grade of D in sync with its bleak bottom line growth and high valuations. The stock has a Stability grade of D, consistent with its five-year monthly beta of 1.69.

In the 92-stock Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry, it is ranked #77.

Bottom Line

The export regulations on NVDA’s fastest chips could hurt the company’s top line. Moreover, its bottom-line decline in the last reported quarter is concerning. With analysts bearish on the company’s prospects, its stock might be best avoided.

How Does NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Stack Up Against its Peers?

While NVDA has an overall POWR Rating of D, one might consider looking at its industry peers, STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM) and Advantest Corporation (ATEYY), which have an overall A (Strong Buy) rating, and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and MaxLinear, Inc. (MXL), which have an overall B (Buy) rating.

NVDA shares were trading at $123.42 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $1.14 (+0.93%). Year-to-date, NVDA has declined -58.01%, versus a -22.93% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Astro combines autonomous navigation, intelligent motion, Alexa, and a cheery personality all into one device. Thus far, you could use it to help patrol and secure your home or have it always near a loved one for communication. Today at its fall hardware event, Amazon announced new features that Astro will have to improve its intelligence.

First, Astro is no longer just for the home, but also for small and medium-sized businesses. Having Astro patrol your business after hours or while you’re away is an excellent alternative to hiring a security guard. Speaking of which, Astro can now utilize Ring’s Virtual Security Guard feature to keep businesses protected. For example, suppose the company is already using Ring Alarm systems, and an alarm goes off. In that case, Astro can investigate what is happening while a rapid response agent can visually observe what’s happening in real time. Then, if needed, agents can take action by calling authorities or talking to intruders using Astro’s cameras and two-way talk microphones.

Next up, Astro will now be able to interact with more members of your family. This comes in the form of the new pet detection feature. Astro can now discern cats and dogs from humans and other objects with pet detection. When Astro does see your pet, it will send you a short video clip so you know what your pet is doing at all times. You can then take action and start a Live View or take a photo if you want. So now you can have peace of mind that Fido isn’t tearing up the couch while you’re away.

Astro’s AI will also get more robust by learning about more objects in your home and becoming more proactive in notifying you about the state of these items. Amazon is doing this by introducing a new multimodal artificial intelligence capability within Astro. Starting with doors and windows, Astro will learn their locations (ex., front door, kitchen window, etc.) and whether they are open or not. Astro can then alert you by returning to you or sending you an alert through its app and telling you the state of the door or window. In the future, Amazon hopes to have Astro learn more about objects, such as appliances and pet food bowls.

Lastly, Amazon introduced a new software development kit (SDK) for developers hoping to create new features for Astro. For example, the aforementioned pet detection feature was built using this new SDK. Amazon will work with robotics schools, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Maryland, and the University of Michigan to put an early form of the SDK into students’ hands.

Astro has been available for one year and by invitation only. However, with time, Amazon is making sure that Astro will be a more intelligent, functional, and helpful robot in all of our homes and businesses.

It assembles the most recent achievements in artificial intelligence and data science. It is arranged in chronological order with a link to an article that goes into greater detail.

Breaking the Convergence Barrier: Optimization via Fixed-Time Convergent Flows

Accelerated gradient methods are the backbone of large-scale optimization problems driven by data and come up naturally in machine learning and other fields that deal with data analysis.

Here, the researchers introduce a gradient-based optimization framework for achieving acceleration. It is based on the recently introduced idea of fixed-time stability of dynamical systems. The method seems to be a generalization of simple gradient-based methods that are scaled to converge to the optimizer in a fixed amount of time, no matter how the problem is set up at the beginning. The researchers do this by first using a continuous-time framework to design fixed-time stable dynamical systems. They then provide a consistent discretization strategy so that the equivalent discrete-time algorithm can track the optimizer in a fixed number of iterations. They also give a theoretical analysis of how the proposed gradient flows converge. In addition, how well they can handle disturbances that are added together.

The researchers also show that the regret bound on the convergence rate is always the same because of fixed-time convergence. The meanings of the hyperparameters are easy to understand, and we can change them to meet the needs of the desired convergence rates. They compare the accelerated convergence of the proposed schemes to the best optimization algorithms on several numerical examples. Furthermore, their work gives us ideas about how to make new optimization algorithms by breaking up flows in continuous time.

Conditional Generative Model based Predicate-Aware Query Approximation

Approximate Query Processing (AQP) aims to give fast but ""good enough"" answers to expensive aggregate queries, making it easier for users to explore large datasets interactively. Compared to traditional query processing on database clusters, recently proposed Machine-Learning-based AQP techniques can provide very low latency because query execution only involves model inference.

But the approximation error for these methods gets much worse as the number of filtering predicates (WHERE clauses) increases. To find insights, analysts often use queries with a lot of predicates. So, keeping approximation error low is important if analysts don't want to come to wrong conclusions.

In this paper, the researchers propose ELECTRA, a predicate-aware AQP system that can answer analytics-style queries with many predicates and much more minor approximation errors. ELECTRA uses a conditional generative model that learns the conditional distribution of the data and, at runtime, creates a small (1000 rows) but representative sample on which the query is run to get an approximation of the result. Their tests with three real-world datasets and four different baselines show that ELECTRA has lower AQP error for many predicates than baselines.

Deep Clustering of Text Representations for Supervision-free Probing of Syntax

The researchers are looking into how deep clustering text representations can help unsupervised models understand and learn syntax. Since these are high-dimensional representations, methods like KMeans don't work very well. So, their approach changes the representations into a lower-dimensional space that is good for clustering and then groups them.

In this work, the researchers look at two ideas about syntax: Part of Speech Induction (POSI) and Constituency Labeling (CoLab). They find it interesting that Multilingual BERT (mBERT) knows a surprising amount of English grammar, maybe even as much as English BERT (EBERT). Their model can be used as an unsupervised probe to look into something that might be less biased. They find that, compared to supervised probes, unsupervised probes benefit from higher layers. In addition, the researchers also say that their unsupervised probe uses EBERT and mBERT representations in POSI in different ways. Finally, they prove their probe works by showing that it can be used as an unsupervised syntax induction method. Their probe works well for both syntactic forms because it changes how the inputs are represented.

Furthermore, the researchers say that their probe did well on 45-tag English POSI, was state-of-the-art on 12-tag POSI across ten languages, and did well on CoLab. They also do zero-shot syntax induction on languages with few resources and say the results are promising.",artificial intelligence,indiaai.gov.in

Our fast, free, self-hosted Artificial Intelligence Server for any platform, any language",https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5322557/CodeProject-AI-Server-AI-the-easy-way,"If you are a Blue Iris user and you are using custom models, then you would notice that the option, in Blue Iris, to set the custom model location is greyed out. This is because Blue Iris does not currently make changes to CodeProject.AI Server's settings. It can be done by manually starting CodeProject.AI with command line parameters (not a great solution), or editing the module settings files (a little messy), or setting system-wide environment variables (way easier). For version 1.6 we added an API to allow any app to change our settings programmatically, and we take care of stopping/restarting things and persisting the changes.



So: Blue Iris doesn't currently change CodeProject.AI Server's settings, so it doesn't provide you a way to change the custom model folder location from within Blue Iris.



Blue Iris will still use the contents of this folder to determine the calls it makes. If you don't specify a model to use in the Custom Models textbox, then Blue Iris will use all models in the custom models folder that it knows about.







Here we've specified a specific model to use. The Blue Iris help file explains more about how this works, including inclusive and exclusive filters on the models it finds.



CodeProject.AI Server doesn't know about Blue Iris' folder, so it can't tell what models it may be expected to use, nor can it tell Blue Iris about what models CodeProject.AI server has available. Our API allows Blue Iris to get a list of the AI models installed with CodeProject.AI Server, and also to set the folder where these models reside. But Blue Iris doesn't, yet, use that API.



So we do a hack.



At install time we sniff the registry to find where Blue Iris thinks the custom models should be. We then make empty copies of the models that we have, and copy them into that folder. If the folder doesn't exist (eg you were using C:\Program Files\CodeProject\AI\AnalysisLayer\CustomObjectDetection\assets , which no longer exists) then we create that folder, and then copy over the empty files.



When Blue Iris looks in that folder to decide what custom calls it can make, it sees the models, notes their names, and uses those names in the calls. CodeProject.AI Server has those models, so when the calls come through we can process them.



Blue Iris doesn't use the models. It uses the list of model names.



If you have your own models in the Blue Iris folder



You will need to copy them to the CodeProject.AI server's custom model folder (by default this is C:\Program Files\CodeProject\AI\AnalysisLayer\ObjectDetectionYolo\custom-models )



If you've modified the registry and have your own custom models



If you were using a folder in C:\Program Files\CodeProject\AI\AnalysisLayer\CustomObjectDetection\ (which no longer existed after the upgrade, but was recreated by our hack) you'll need to re-copy your custom model into that folder.



The simplest solutions are:

Modify the registry (Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Perspective Software\Blue Iris\Options\AI, key 'deepstack_custompath') so Blue Iris looks in C:\Program Files\CodeProject\AI\AnalysisLayer\ObjectDetectionYolo\custom-models for custom models, and copy your models into there.



or



Modify C:\Program Files\CodeProject\AI\AnalysisLayer\ObjectDetectionYolo\modulesettings.json file and set CUSTOM_MODELS_DIR to be whatever Blue Iris thinks the custom model folder is. cheers

If you've come across an issue in building, installing, running or configuring CodeProject.AI Server we're here to help.



We just ask that you provide enough info for us to dig in quickly:

What version of CodeProject.AI Server are you using? Windows installation, Docker, or within a development environment? What Operating System? Specifically, what version of that OS? Are you running in a VM, in parallels, or are you using Bootcamp on a mac? If you have a GPU, what card and what version of the drivers do you have installed? Some tips:

In the root directory of CodeProject.AI Server is a logs/ directory. Take a look in there to see if you spot any logs that might be worth including in your post (remove personal info though!)

Have you changed any settings? If so, let us know.

We can usually only help with questions around CodeProject.AI Server. Questions about third party apps are usually outside our scope, so please keep the focus on CodeProject.AI Server. cheers

I have an Nvidia Quadro K620. I've been using the Deepstack 09/2021 version as their most recent version is broken for GPU. This project appears better supported so I wanted to switch to this for my object and facial detection. On the Deepstack version with the same setting I see two process running Python3 and get object detection speeds around 60-80ms. With this project I am getting 250ms and I only see one process...if this matters.



This is what I see in the log when it starts. Which appears to say that it's running at only half process? Any ideas as I really would like to work with a project that is being actively developed.

There must be a bug in Codeproject.AI.Server-1.6.6.0 causing the gpu memory (NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 2GB) to fill up as it starts out working great from a fresh reboot, but then over the course of a day the gpu start erroring with messages like:

Object Detection (YOLO): (General Exception) : CUDA error: unknown error in Object Detection (YOLO)

and then:

Object Detection (YOLO): (General Exception) : cuDNN error: CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED in Object Detection (YOLO)

I reduced the model_size from medium to tiny and small and that seemed to help, but then object detection was terrible.

Changing the NVIDIA drivers from 517.48 and 471.96 did not help.

This same card works great with Deepstack-GPU.







Do you get the same result on 522.25?



In this article it hosts the service on localhost, but I want to host it on my Server . I want to access the results on external devices. I get the results on my Server on my Webpage, but it is hosted in the localhost directory, therefor i cannot acces it outside of my server environment.



Here you can see it is hosted on the localhost directory:





I want to access it on my external browser like this:



But it wont work because its not hosted correctly right now.



Does anybody already host their project externally? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Adding the ability to put a custom model file in the mounted directory would be awesome and prevent the need for building a complete server just to have a custom model.







If so, you can use the --mount or --volume flags to effectively map the /src/AnalysisLayer/ObjectDetectionYolo/custom-models folder to whatever local folder on your system you wish, and then place your custom models in that folder.



Here's what I did on my local system:

Terminal docker run -p 32168:32168 --name CodeProject.AI-Server -d -v c:\ProgramData\CodeProject\AI:/usr/share/CodeProject/AI --mount type=bind,source=C:\my-custom-models,target=/app/AnalysisLayer/ObjectDetectionYolo/custom-models,readonly codeproject/ai-server

This mounts the C:\my-custom-models directory on my local system and maps it to the /app/AnalysisLayer/ObjectDetectionYolo/custom-models folder in the Docker container. Now, when CodeProject.AI Server is looking for the list of custom models, it will look in C:\my-custom-models rather than /app/AnalysisLayer/ObjectDetectionYolo/custom-models



As you can see it now picks up the extra model I had placed in that directory:

Michael Morell was deputy director of the CIA from 2010 to 2013 and twice its acting director during that period. He is co-chair of the American Edge Project’s National Security Advisory Board. The United States is engaged in a high stakes battle with Russia and China for global technological dominance. The winner will determine whether the future of the internet will be free and open or characterized by censorship and government control.

A little-known election will be held Thursday for the top post at the International Telecommunication Union — the U.N. agency that facilitates international connectivity in communications networks and is responsible for setting standards for emerging technology.

The candidates represent two very different visions for the future of our global internet. The election pits Doreen Bogdan-Martin, a veteran U.S. diplomat with a track record of expanding internet access, against Rashid Ismailov, a Putin-backed former Russian deputy minister of telecommunications and mass communications and former Huawei Technologies executive. Should Ismailov win, he would serve as a conduit for the government of Russia’s internet policy goals, which historically have included censoring dissent.

Advertisement

The internet has remained largely open and free because of deliberate policy choices by the United States, our allies and multilateral standard-setting bodies that value free speech.

Our adversaries are eager to dismantle this model. Just last year, Russia and China signed a joint statement committing to preserve “the sovereign right of States to regulate the national segment of the internet”— in other words, the right of states to censor political dissidents. Last year, at least 48 countries pursued new restrictions on content, data and technology, in many cases attempting to subdue free expression and gain greater access to private data.

This is the vision Russia and China are trying to bring to the internet. One of China’s Huawei-supported proposals for the International Telecommunication Union would fundamentally redesign internet protocol (IP) addresses into a less secure, state-controlled model. Since its invasion of Ukraine last year, Russia has significantly tightened its digital information space by blocking more than 2,384 websites and passing a law punishing citizens who spread “false information.”

As we look to the future, the United States must partner with our allies to set standards for emerging tech such as 5G, artificial intelligence, data surveillance and patent reform. And our leaders must ensure that Russia and China play by the same rules.

Today, the U.S. tech sector leads the way in exporting technology abroad that embodies a commitment to a free and open internet. If we cede this leadership and hand the keys to the internet to Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, we risk jeopardizing our economic and national security as well as freedom across the globe.

And it isn’t pretty.

Like, I suspect, many people reading this article, I enjoy the late night comedy shows. When I was a kid, late night comedy was rather dry, filled with stale jokes designed to appeal to the broadest possible demographic. But as we’ve reached the age of peak T.V., so too have we reached the age of peak late night T.V. In our stratified media landscape, where we no longer turn in unison to the same broadcast and news outlets and the idea of a common knowledge base is quickly fading, late night comedians have also taken on the somewhat unfair mantle of often being a source for breaking news. I shouldn’t have to watch John Oliver’s monologue to get a deep dive into real issues affecting the world today. But, with the major networks taking a USA Today approach to most stories these days (only the minimum amount of ink required), late night comedy is often the only place devoting any amount of time to the pressing issues of the day.

This is not meant as an advertisement for late night comedy or a rant against modern news. Rather, it is meant to explain why I found myself watching a story on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver last week about a new service called Midjourney, which allows people to use artificial intelligence to create digital artwork by typing in a series of keywords. While the user themselves isn’t doing any of the drawing or painting, the words they choose to enter result in the computer generating their best approximation of the user’s intent. Predictably, the results range from sublime to awful. And the segment is played mostly for laughs. But the fact that something like this not only could exist, but already does exist, should raise an artist's hackles regardless of discipline.

Only a day or two after watching that segment, I saw a news story about an A.I. rapper that lost its record deal. Yes, you read that right. And I have so many questions. One, how did a rapper that literally doesn’t exist get an actual record deal? Two, how did they teach the A.I. to rap? Three, who is behind the A.I. rapper? As it turns out, it’s that last part that led the rapper’s contract to be rescinded and leads to more pressing questions of why it was offered a contract in the first place. As it turns out, the digital gangster rapper, decked out in every stereotype of what certain people seem to think of African-Americans in general, was the brainchild of two non-African Americans. I’m not going to go into the entire history of blackface and minstrel shows in this essay. That is a topic for its own essay, book, and/or documentary series. But, let’s just agree that a digital minstrel show is no better than a live one.

Of course, the echos of history didn’t stop there. The voice of the A.I. avatar who secured the record deal was actually that of a real rapper. But, much like many a shady music producer throughout the history of the industry, the producers had manipulated the situation to take the talent from the human artist, convert it into more easily manipulated ones and zeros, capitalize financially on the artist’s work, then cut them out of the financial profits all together.

As more facts about this A.I. rapper came to light and more outrage began to build, the record company canceled the contract and scrapped their plans. But why could they not have seen the problem with the plan upfront?

And, stepping away from any cultural appropriation issues for a moment, what implications does that have for the music industry going forward? We already live in a world of autotune which can make almost any average shower singer into a songbird. As someone who is “musically challenged,” I appreciate the idea that a computer can make me sound like Marvin Gaye. But does that mean that I can actually sing? I’d say no. But what the story of the canceled rapper tells us is that we’ve rapidly reached a point where the human being might not be needed at all. Just plug in a handful of appropriate hashtags and voice samples and voila! You’ve got the next Whitney Houston. And, better yet, you don’t have to pay her a cent.

The same thing is coming to the visual arts as well. I was watching Trevor Noah’s show last night (yes, another late night comedian), and he had a story about an A.I. artist who won an art contest. The winning image was 90 percent created by artificial intelligence, according to the artist. He submitted the original keywords and did some finishing work in Photoshop. But the bulk of the heavy lifting was done by an algorithm. Without commenting at all on the quality of the result, what larger questions does that pose? Is the submitter really the artist behind the image at all if he only contributed 10% of the work? He did come up with the original set of keywords to generate the image. So, it’s fair to say the image wouldn’t exist without him. But all the intricate brushwork, lighting, and composition that can take a human being decades to perfect were all done by the computer. I don’t know if his winning image would technically be termed a painting or a photograph. It’s very photorealistic. But, even if it’s technically a painting, the implications for photographers are obvious.

Why would a client pay you thousands of dollars in creative fees and licensing to take a picture of their products when they can have a computer generate an image for them? True, it probably won’t be totally free. No doubt, a cottage industry will sprout up around A.I. images similar to creating VFX for film and television, and there will be new leaders in the emerging field demanding higher rates. That’s how capitalism works. But does that mean that we are on a precipice of seeing our entire professions replaced by machines?

Let’s take the example of a product photographer, for instance. Let’s say Coca Cola needs to make a new ad to promote the introduction of their new flavor of Coke. The ad is going to be a spinning soda can, with music and text. It is entirely possible that it would be far more cost effective for Coca Cola to type the dimensions and hex values of its can into a computer and have it generate the photorealistic imagery of the spinning can than it would be to hire a full video crew. As mentioned earlier, they can even turn to an A.I. musical artist to generate a jingle for the spot that won’t require them to pay royalties.

As someone whose work generally centers around human beings rather than products, I could easily delude myself into thinking the computer couldn’t possibly do what I do. But that would clearly be presumptuous on my part. Assuming that others share my same aversion for ones and zeros. I mean, honestly, even if you’re a fan of Marvel movies, what are they really if not just 2.5-hour tributes to special effects. And, based on ticket sales, people don’t seem to mind.

We’ve been debating ethical issues surrounding digitally manipulating human performances since back when Ridley Scott was forced to use a CGI version of actor Oliver Reed for parts of the film Gladiator following the actor’s sudden death three weeks before the end of principal photography. In the ensuing 22 years, the technology has only gotten better to the point where the majority of blockbuster movies these days contain large amounts of avatar stuntmen and women doing feats of strength that defy human ability. I won’t even get started on the absolute mediocrity of the modern superhero film that seems to not only utilize A.I. avatars on screen, but apparently uses A.I. algorithms to write the scripts as well. Okay, I’m being a little snarky there. But, honestly, are you truly sure that Netflix doesn’t have some kind of reverse algorithm that knows exactly what movies you are watching and directly feeds this information into another A.I. machine that is writing scripts designed to hit the broadest common denominator?

So, it’s not even remotely out of the question that in a society which increasingly views art as mere content, that sheer practicality will dictate that the majority of content we consume within 10 to 15 years, if not sooner, will be created almost entirely in a computer. The question is, as artists, what do we do about it?

The enterprising capitalist may look at that scenario and decide the only way to make money as an artist in the future is to become the puppet master behind the creation of A.I. art. If I were Benjamin Braddock’s plastic loving neighbor in 2022, it would probably be A.I. that I would be urging the hapless hero to get into. But as an artist who straddles both the analog and digital generations, the idea of giving up even an inkling of my artistic output to a machine just somehow seems wrong. That’s not to say that it is wrong. We all have our own levels of comfort with how much of our art should be computer generated and how much should be done “in camera” so to speak. I personally tend to reject computer generated art instinctively, like a body rejecting a blood transfusion. But that’s entirely subjective, no doubt affected by my age and personal preferences. And, as CGI gets better and better, the line between computer generated art and the real world continues to blur. So my own red line will undoubtedly shift.

The other day, I was rewatching one of my favorite movies, Braveheart. The film is famous for its massive battle scenes with hoards of opposing armies going toe to toe across sweeping vistas. I didn’t know it when I first saw it in the theater, but in order to have that many soldiers in the battle scenes, a large number of the soldiers were created digitally. This is commonplace now, but at the time was revolutionary. They did have a significant number of extras to play soldiers. But they essentially doubled and tripled those extras to fill out the scene. To me, this feels like a good use of digital technology. The filmmakers still accomplished the bulk of the work practically. They simply rounded out the hard work they had already done with these digital soldiers so that they wouldn’t break the budget. I never noticed it in the film, and it didn’t bother me.

Compare that with the modern superhero movie where not only the actors, but the environment, and half of the props are created whole cloth from digital assets. The actors give performances against green screens (or the new, more immersive virtual LED walls), and everything around them is literally created by a computer. There are still, at this moment, real human beings serving as VFX artists to create those digital worlds. So, it’s not the same as an A.I. generated environment. The human VFX artists are truly digital gods. But I do find myself emotionally disengaging from the majority of these modern action films simply because it’s impossible for my mind to divorce from the fact that I’m watching one and zeros turned into avatars rather than actual people.

People, as imperfect as we are, have value. In fact, it’s our flaws that give us that little extra something that allows an audience to relate to a character and see a little something of themselves. Human beings have oddities that make them special. Audrey Hepburn complained about having an extra long neck, but I defy anyone to see her as anything less than beautiful. Humphrey Bogart had a lisp. Jimmy Stewart’s awkward and stilting way of talking not only didn’t hurt his career, but became one of his trademarks.

A few months ago, I was revisiting John Woo’s 1997 action film Face/Off. There’s a scene in the film where the two characters, played by Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, are in a speedboat race. At some point, there’s a boat crash and the two characters are thrown from the boat, flying high through the air. As many times as I’ve seen the film this particular time, it became painfully clear to me that the people flying out of the boat in the wide shot were quite decidedly not Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. This makes sense. This is why the profession of stuntman exists. And it’s not like, deep in my brain, I didn’t already realize that there’s no way the two stars would do that stunt themselves. But, in the context of the film, I had suspended disbelief long enough to just go with it. And, you know what? It totally worked.

Nowadays, those stuntmen would have been replaced by digital avatars. They would have been able to superimpose Cage and Travolta’s faces onto those avatars and likely created the boats and the flailing bodies with VFX. But, somehow, I seriously doubt it would have felt as exciting. There’s something about seeing a real person, even an imperfect one, in peril. One of the main reasons the new Top Gun: Maverick sequel works so well is because of Tom Cruise’s dedication to practical stunts. Surely, the movie has its fair share of digital effects. But by keeping those to a minimum, you allow your audience a greater ability to connect to the story. Because what you are seeing is real. It’s human. It’s relatable.

So, as we continue to hurtle our way towards a world where A.I. is going to start taking away a larger and larger chunk of the creative jobs in which many of us make our living, I suspect that the most powerful tool we will have in our defense is our very imperfection. This sounds counterintuitive, but what’s the one thing about us that a computer will never be able to replicate? Our humanity.

If your entire artistic voice is based on your ability to expose perfectly to your light meter, you may find yourself in trouble. Computers can already perform that trick. Just think about all the tasks your camera is already capable of doing for you. But your camera, no matter how many megapixels, can’t replicate your artistic voice. Your artistic voice is the culmination of all the experiences that you’ve had in life, art-related or otherwise. Your artistic voice is the grand sum of your life's emotions. It is when you put yourself, all of yourself, into your work and art that you can create greatness.

There will no doubt be more and more pressure to turn over more and more of your artistic creation to technology as time goes on. And, no doubt, new technologies will come along that will genuinely afford you a chance to be a more effective storyteller and artist. But ask yourself why you wanted to be an artist in the first place. Was it just to get a result as quickly and as cheaply as possible? Was it just as a shortcut to fame and fortune? Or, did you become an artist because you had something to say? Did you look at the great ballad of life and feel that you had a right to contribute a verse?

There’s no question that the machines are coming for us as artists. But trends and technologies can never replace the value of human intuition. Our creativity will sustain us. Our humanity will sustain us. And we, as artists, will survive. No matter what SkyNET says.",artificial intelligence,fstoppers

One of these bugs seems to affect videos recorded in Cinematic Mode, which are no longer recognized by iMovie and Final Cut Pro.

Cinematic videos in iOS 16

As reported by users on the Apple Support forums and also on Reddit, Apple’s video editors iMovie and Final Cut Pro can no longer open Cinematic videos recorded with an iPhone running iOS 16. The reason behind the bug is unclear, but reports are consistent in pointing out that these apps show an error when users try to edit a Cinematic video.

“It seems that iOS 16 broke this feature in FCP, which will show a ‘The cinematic effect cannot be activated’ error,” said a Final Cut Pro user. According to another user, the errors are also experienced when using iMovie – Apple’s free video editor.

Unfortunately, Apple is yet to acknowledge this bug, and there’s no software update available to fix it. A workaround suggested by some users is to edit Cinematic videos on the iPhone and only then share these videos to the Mac over AirDrop. Since macOS Ventura will be released to the public in October, Apple will probably wait until then to update its Mac apps.

iPhone’s Cinematic Mode

Cinematic Mode is a feature introduced with iPhone 13 that lets users record videos with a Portrait effect. This mode combines artificial intelligence and depth data obtained by the iPhone cameras to blur the background of the video while keeping the person or object in focus.

After the video has been recorded, users can change the intensity of the background blur and even the focus point.

While iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro can only record Cinematic videos in 1080p resolution, the new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro record Cinematic videos in 4K resolution with 24 frames per second.

Last year Apple released updates to iMovie, Clips, and Final Cut Pro so that users can edit Cinematic videos using these apps.

There's no dearth of quirky filters out there that make a person look like an older version of themselves or turn an adult's face into a fun child-like version. But AI-based image generators like Dall E-2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion have truly changed the game from wobbly AR filters to photorealistic stills. Istanbul-based photographer Alper Yesiltas recently set social media on fire with a fictional AI-assisted photography project in which he imagined how famous personalities would have looked today if their lives hadn't come to a tragic end at a young age.

Titled ""​​As If Nothing Happened,"" the project was created using AI generator Remini (via Upworthy), while the results were further polished using editing tools like VSCO and Adobe Lightroom. ""I wanted to see some of the people I missed again in front of me and that's how this project emerged,"" Yesiltas wrote regarding the endeavor. The list includes a total of 10 names, from music stars like Michael Jackson, John Lennon, and Tupac Shakur to actors like Heath Ledger and Bruce Lee.

The stunning realism in the photos, especially in the still of Nirvana lead Kurt Cobain, generated a lot of buzz as the project soon went viral. Ever since, Yesiltas has experimented with more celebrities like Paul Walker and Amy Winehouse, but one image in particular that has drawn some hot criticism is that of Princess Diana, the deceased wife of King Charles, who tragically died in a car accident in 1997.",artificial intelligence,slashgear

73,How Technology Can Help Overburdened Doctors and Combat the Great Resignation in Health Care,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1663872945-GettyImages-1365331874.jpg,28/09/2022,Physicians experienced burnout long before the global pandemic hurled healthcare further into a maelstrom — technology offers an antidote.,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/5-ways-technology-can-help-overburdened-doctors/434820,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Even before the pandemic, the United States was already facing a physician shortage, beginning in the early 2000s, that many described as ""devastating."" Doctors faced long hours, regulatory compliance, high malpractice insurance premiums, mountains of paperwork that kept them in the office well after closing hours and increasing medical school debt (which mostly won't be covered by the new student loan forgiveness program).

Indeed, the Covid-19 crisis exacerbated an already worrisome problem. During the pandemic, the lives of physicians became even more strained as they dealt with sick and dying patients, the lack of PPE and hospital beds, mixed communications about Covid and its spread, patient fear and their own anxieties about becoming infected.

Nearly three years into the pandemic, we have vaccines proven to prevent and mitigate Covid in its various iterations, schools are returning to maskless classrooms, people are setting sail on cruise ships, and living with the virus has become the new normal. However, in the wake of Covid's destruction, doctors are exhausted, depressed and stressed. Some are considering a career change. According to a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic and funded by the American Medical Association (AMA), one in five doctors plans to leave their medical practice by the end of 2023, and one in three will be reducing their hours by the end of 2022.

The Great Medical Resignation is upon us. The AMA recommends solutions that include providing better support to doctors as parents and caretakers and making them feel more valued in their roles. But , which eliminates some of the minutiae of the doctor's day-to-day tasks, can also play an important role in reducing the heavy burden doctors carry. Here's how:

Virtual meetings with pharma reps

Anyone who has been to a doctor's office is familiar with the ubiquitous sight of the pharma rep outfitted with their rolling sample cart and waiting patiently for a minute of the doctor's time. They would wait for hours and barely get a minute. Then the pandemic struck. All of the major pharmaceutical companies sent their reps home to work remotely. Although reps can once again trolley their sample carts to doctors' offices, both physicians and reps have discovered that virtual visits lead to more meaningful and fruitful conversations. And by meeting with reps virtually, doctors can schedule times that work best for them and spend more time in virtual meetings than in-person meetings.

There are now communication platforms that allow doctors to communicate directly with pharma companies in a compliant way. Communication can be as simple as a text message, which is convenient for a doctor who has a quick question about a drug and is in between patients. They don't need to spend time sitting down and logging in, and they can be assured that their messaging is privileged and encrypted.

Global Date Healthcare reports that physicians overwhelmingly prefer video conferencing to in-person meetings. A 2021 poll showed that 75% of healthcare professionals prefer virtual or a mix of virtual and in-person meetings. The pandemic wave of digital transformation has permanently changed the way the pharmaceutical industry is doing business.

Telehealth and quantum computing

According to the 2021 McKinsey Physician Survey, 88% said they have used telehealth at one point during the pandemic. The survey also says that while there was an upsurge in telehealth during the pandemic, it has abated with consumers using digital platforms at 38% higher than pre-pandemic numbers. But as with the changes for pharma reps, the public's comfort level with utilizing telemedicine has grown. This is particularly true for patients seeking mental health care. A 2022 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 36% of those seeking care for mental health and substance abuse disorders rely on telehealth today.

Without even realizing it, patients are fast becoming adept consumers of digital medicine, which will continue to evolve as quantum computing takes center stage in the medical world. With lighting-speed capabilities, quantum computing will be able to conduct ""in silico"" diagnoses, completing a full genetic scan and simulacrum of a patient virtually. Within a decade, it's possible that quantum computing can create personalized drugs for patients — without ever needing to see the patient in person.

Hub services

Back from the future, doctors must still contend with prescribing specialty drugs in a byzantine system that is complex, sluggish, and costly. Specialty drugs derive from living cells and treat chronic complex diseases like cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (e.g., Keytruda for lung cancer).

Specialty drugs have been on the market since the 1990s, when there were just 30 drugs available. Today, there are more than 500. The IQVIA Institute predicts that by 2023, 65% of new pharma products will be specialty drugs.

Hub services are a boon for the specialty drug boom. As the name implies, hub services centralize the required data — including patient history, drug specifications, compliance requirements and insurance information — in one place, making the administration of a complex process more manageable.

QR codes, chatbots and AI

Digital technology leads to better outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers. Doctors are not trained to be tech-savvy, but fortunately, tech has become more savvy and user-friendly. QR codes (""quick response""), invented in 1994, were initially used in marketing. Now, 30 years later, they are widely used in medical brochures, magazines and even patient charts. A 2020 Deloitte survey shows that patients are now more comfortable sharing their medical data, creating a pathway for digital trust in using QR codes.

Patients are also becoming more acclimated to conversing with AI-driven chatbots that use machine learning and have the ability to become more intelligent. Chatbots reduce the doctor's load by quickly and correctly answering questions that could interrupt a doctor's busy schedule. They also add a layer of privacy for delicate questions about things like genital warts or colonoscopy prep that might embarrass a patient.

AI-based technologies continue to make healthcare better every day — from their utilization in administrative tasks to drug development to predictive analytics. These technologies will not replace doctors but will make doctors more efficient as well as lighten the heavy loads they are carrying. And with the shocking and sharp decline in life expectancy in the U.S., we need our doctors to be at their best now more than ever.

Its segments are FedEx Express; FedEx Ground; FedEx Freight; FedEx Services; and Corporate- Other and Eliminations.

On the other hand, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) provides letter and package delivery, transportation, logistics, and related services. Its two segments are U.S. Domestic Package and International Package.

As aggregate demand continues to decline amid widespread macro headwinds, freight rates are witnessing a palpable downtrend with reduced global trade volumes. However, supply chain bottlenecks have improved. Moreover, lucrative federal investments in transport infrastructure are expected to foster growth in the freight and shipping industry.

On September 19, 2022, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced approximately $160 million annually for the next five years to boost and revamp the country’s transportation infrastructure with advanced technology. In addition, according to ReportLinker, the global freight and logistics market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.4% until 2026.

FDX and UPS are expected to benefit from the industry’s promising prospects.

FDX has lost 31.3% over the past month, while UPS has lost 16%. FDX has lost 32.6% over the past year and 42% year-to-date, while UPS has lost 10.5% and 22% over the same periods. But which of these stocks is the better pick now? Let’s find out.

Latest Developments

On September 13, 2022, FDX expanded its partnership with Berkshire Grey Inc. (BGRY), a best-in-class company with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled robotic solutions that automate supply chain processes. This collaboration primarily aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of global supply chains through advanced AI automation technology.

On August 8, 2022, UPS announced that it would acquire Bomi Group, a multinational healthcare logistics provider. Under the agreement, several temperature-controlled facilities across 14 countries are expected to be built, and around 3,000 highly-qualified employees from Bomi Group would join the UPS Healthcare network in Europe and Latin America.

This partnership is expected to fortify UPS’ healthcare logistic services in the near term.

Recent Financial Results

FDX’s total revenue came in at $23.24 billion for the fiscal 2023 first quarter ended August 31, 2022, up 5.6% year-over-year. However, its non-GAAP operating income came in at $1.23 billion, down 17.7% year-over-year. Also, its non-GAAP net income came in at $905 million, down 23.8% year-over-year, while its non-GAAP EPS decreased 21.3% year-over-year to $3.44.

UPS’ revenue came in at $24.77 billion for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022, up 5.7% year-over-year. Its operating profit came in at $3.54 billion, up 8.5% year-over-year, while its net income increased 6.5% year-over-year to $2.85 billion. Moreover, its adjusted EPS came in at $3.29, up 7.5% year-over-year.

Past and Expected Financial Performance

FDX’s revenue and EPS have increased at 10.8% and 99.7% CAGRs over the past three years. FDX’s revenue is expected to increase marginally year-over-year in the fiscal years 2023 and 2024. Its EPS is estimated to increase 25.7% year-over-year to $18.23 in 2024. However, its EPS is expected to decline 29.6% year-over-year to $14.50 in 2023.

On the other hand, UPS’ revenue and EPS have increased by 11.4% and 31.5% CAGRs over the past three years, respectively. UPS’ revenue is expected to increase 4.7% and marginally year-over-year in 2022 and 2023, respectively. In addition, its EPS is expected to increase 6% and marginally year-over-year in 2022 and 2023, respectively.

Profitability

FDX’s EBITDA and net income margins of 10.22% and 3.79% are lower than UPS’ 16.62% and 10.92%. Moreover, FDX’s ROE and ROTC were 14.51% and 5.73%, compared with UPS’ 80.59% and 21.98%, respectively.

Thus, UPS is more profitable.

Valuation

In terms of forward EV/Sales, FDX’s 0.72x is lower than UPS’ 1.52x. Its forward EV/EBITDA of 7.39x is 18.8% lower than UPS’ 9.10x. Furthermore, FDX’s forward P/E of 10.91x is lower than UPS’ 13.06x.

Thus, FDX has more attractive valuations.

Innovator of this unique formula, John Barban, deems these components will stimulate a state of metabolism called nutritional synergy. This fat-burning supplement dissolves with any beverage without altering its taste and flavor. This morning beverage peps you up all through the day.

Enhance memory power

A healthy diet is crucial for overall well-being, and nutritional synergy fortifies the nutritional value of the foods you eat. The University of Illinois, in a study, found an association between specific nutrients and brain functioning in older individuals. Java Burn supports a weight loss regime without vigorous exercise and a restricted diet and enhances your memory power, intelligence, and brain function associated with global-oriented behavior. This nutritional supplement is organic; the flavorless powder stimulates healthy synergy, a form of metabolism when consumed with a balanced proportion of minerals and vitamins.

Instantly soluble

Java Burn is a weight loss supplement that comes in a tasteless powder form. The product is only available on the official website. A pouch of Java Burn costs $49; its organic ingredients instantly dissipate in coffee or other beverages stimulating metabolism. The product’s creator suggests you put one bag of the supplement in coffee, stir it well and sip. The powder is flavorless, so it does not alter the aroma or taste of brimming coffee. When your body’s metabolism rate increases, it burns the stubborn fat cells rapidly, and you shed that extra body weight.

The components of Java Burn are vegetarian and non-GMO, with no side effects, and a third party examines its effectiveness and safety. A pouch contains thirty sachets; drink one daily with an aromatic brimming cup of coffee.

Non-GMO

The critical elements of Java Burn contain green tea and coffee extracts, L-theanine, and chromium. The powder, when intakes in the morning, enhances metabolism speed and efficiency by 500%, and the fat-burning process continues throughout the day. The product reduces the feeling of hunger and optimizes nutrition synergy. All product ingredients are non-GMO, citing they are not genetically modified. Many scientists and environmentalists advocate that GMO products pose serious health threats. Furthermore, the formula does not use fillers, antibiotics, artificial sweeteners/colors, stimulants, or preservatives. Healthy men and women from the age group of twenty-five to sixty-five can enjoy this supplement for weight loss.

Stimulates metabolism

Genetic, junk food habits, and poor lifestyle are significant reasons for obesity; this fat-burning supplement is the easiest way to eliminate the extra pounds. The product naturally stimulates your metabolism process and kicks up fat burning procedures. The product goes well with any type of coffee, regular, espresso, American, and light, medium, or dark roast. The product is manufactured in the US, complying with GMP guidelines. Java Burn effectively burns the stored fat cells, thus supporting the weight loss program. When you consume the supplement mixed with coffee, its effectiveness increases as it is assimilated into the bloodstream. For an optimal result, the product needs to be consumed within two years from the date of manufacture.

2-3 months

When consumed with coffee, Java Burn suppresses hunger, and you need not count your calorie intake. To get the best result out of the product, you need to consume it for two to three months consecutively. It is the last time your body gets acclimatized to the product and starts burning stored fat by increasing metabolism and efficiency. Till now, no side effects have been reported by consumers, and the possibility is almost nil as all ingredients are non –GMO and natural.

Every manufactured sachet undergoes rigorous testing by a third party ensuring quality, effectiveness, and purity. The reviews submitted by thousands of consumers on the official website testify to the efficacy and safety of the supplement. If any health issue arises after consuming the fat-burning supplement, immediately contact a health care professional and stop taking the supplement.

Basal metabolism

The metabolism rate affects the calorie of fat you burn during exercise, sleep or rest. Metabolism, aka metabolic rate, is a biochemical process in living organisms that breaks up nutrients and fat to generate the energy necessary for survival. In simpler terms, the rate at which your body produces energy or burns calories. The human body burns calories in three ways; when the body is at rest (Basal Metabolism) to keep the body running. BMR (basal metabolic rate) is, to a degree, dependent on genetics. Metabolism occurs when you perform daily activities and exercise.

Factors

As metabolism is partly genetic, to change it, you need outside influence; people with higher metabolism feel more vigorous. On the other hand, people with poor metabolism feel lethargic; the body resists the fat burning process and the stored fat cells in the belly and thigh do not shed. As the body burns fewer calories, less energy is produced, and the person feels sluggish. Java Burn, coupled with coffee, claims it increases the user’s metabolic rate. Consequently, the mulish stored fat starts to disintegrate. If you achieve a higher metabolic rate, the body will burn more calories at rest and daily errands. Lean people are more active than obese ones as their metabolic rate is higher in the no exercise period than the latter.

Money Back Guarantee

The product is only available at the official portal. It is applicable for any number of orders. One pouch containing thirty sachets costs $49. If you order three pouches, the cost is $34 for each unit, and you get a supply for three months. Six pouches cost $29 per pouch plus the shipping charge. A sixty-day money-back guarantee comes with the supplement, so you can return it if not satisfied within the stipulated time. Due to its ongoing popularity, many counterfeit products torment the market, so purchase them online from the official website.",artificial intelligence,maple ridge news

Intel has announced these new/future FPGA families:

Intel® Agilex™ D-Series

For midrange FPGA applications like studio cameras, 8K video transport, and wireless infrastructure.

This new family incorporates an upgraded hard processor system (HPS), Enhanced DSP with AI Tensor Block, MIPI I/O support, and a hardened time-sensitive network controller (TSN). Intel Agilex D-Series devices also keep features from previous families like the 2nd-generation Intel® Hyperflex™ FPGA Architecture and high-speed SerDes transceivers.

Future Intel® Agilex™ FPGAs (codenamed Sundance Mesa)

Under design, for a variety of applications, including workloads in industrial, broadcast, automotive, communications, consumer, test and measurement, and medical markets.

The new Intel Agilex device family inherits many of the most important architectural features of earlier Intel Agilex devices including the second-generation Intel® Hyperflex™ FPGA Architecture, which places Hyper-Registers throughout the FPGA.

These devices combine the Intel Agilex FPGA fabric with a broad set of intellectual property (IP) and connectivity options including high-speed transceivers that support data rates to 28.1 Gbps and the PCIe 4.0 interface protocol.

The new Intel Agilex device family also supports DDR4, LPDDR4, DDR5, and LPDDR5 SDRAM; general purpose I/O with output voltages ranging from 1.05 V to 3.3 V; in addition a hard processor system (HPS) based on a multi-core Arm Cortex CPU with two Arm Cortex-A76 processor cores that can run as fast as 1.8 GHz and two Arm Cortex-A55 processor cores that can run as fast as 1.5 GHz.

Intel® Agilex™ FPGAs with R-Tile

These devices include the Compute Express Link (CXL) intellectual property (IP) to the Intel Quartus Prime Software IP library. This CXL hard + soft IP builds upon the existing PCI Express (PCIe) 5.0 capabilities of the Intel® Agilex™ I-Series and M-Series FPGAs and SoCs that incorporate “R” transceiver tiles. The initial release of this IP supports CXL v1.1. A planned future IP release will provide a software-only upgrade path for these Intel Agilex FPGAs and SoCs by adding support for CXL v2.0.

CXL devices will be used in diverse areas such as high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data analytics, and other specialized tasks.

Direct RF FPGAs Intel® Direct RF FPGAs can perform direct analog RF signal conversion for multiple analog input and output channels in a variety of topologies supporting up to 16 channels and various configurations with channel rates as fast as 64 Gsps.

The new devices in this portfolio of Intel Direct RF FPGA devices now extend the I/O capabilities of Intel Agilex and Intel Stratix 10 FPGAs to the analog domain using ADC and DAC chiplets that have been co-developed with partners and then composed into packaged devices using Intel’s EMIB and AIB technologies.",artificial intelligence,fpgaer.tech

Although much of the SCO’s focus is on regional development, such as railways and trade agreements, it has been a key player in the proliferation of technologies designed for social control, which foreign policy experts call “digital authoritarianism.”

Following China’s lead, research shows that the majority of SCO member countries, as well as other authoritarian states, are quickly trending toward more digital rights abuses by increasing the mass digital surveillance of citizens, censorship, and controls on individual expression.

Democracies use massive amounts of surveillance technology as well, of course. The United States is one of the most surveilled countries in the world, and it buys much of that tech from China. Yet it’s the technology trade relationships between authoritarian countries everywhere—SCO members, as well as its allies—that are rapidly growing deeper, and such states have begun to adopt similar playbooks for digitally enabled social control.

What do we mean when we say “digital authoritarianism”?

Four years ago, Freedom House, a non-profit research and advocacy group for global democracy, focused on “the rise of digital authoritarianism” when it published its annual report on the state of freedom and the internet in 2018. As the report explains, “Digital authoritarianism is being promoted as a way for governments to control their citizens through technology, inverting the concept of the internet as an engine of human liberation.” Since then, this has been a common way for Washington to frame the US-China power competition in the tech realm.

There is a strong correlation between governance systems and the state of digital rights, with authoritarian regimes more likely than democratic regimes to use tech as another domain for social control.",artificial intelligence,mit technology review

It came up with a confusing mix of ideas. 
The post AI Imagines a Future with Funky Fluorescent iPhones appeared first on Nerdist.",https://nerdist.com/article/ai-midjourney-creates-future-iphones-fluorescent-lights-holographs/,"Artwork and pictures made using artificial programs seem to be popping up everywhere these days. From the free version Craiyon to the professional DALL-E and Midjourney, AI generation of images based on text prompts is making a splash in nearly every field. With the new iPhone 14 coming out, tech resale website Decluttr decided to use AI to jump into the future and see what the smartphone will look like in years to come. The results are undeniably futuristic, with fluorescent screens that look more gel than glass. But they also show charging stands and the return of the home button. We’ll have to wait and see if AI got this prediction right.

Decluttr

Decluttr is a website marketplace for buying refurbished technology and selling your old devices. The team used Midjourney AI to envision future iPhones. Most of the images retain the rectangular shape we’re used to. However, various ports, camera lenses, and buttons are also still present. There’s even a watch version, or at least we think that’s the implication of an arm in the background of the middle image above.

There’s a multi-dimensional feeling to these future phones that definitely give them that science fiction vibe. Think more like the holographic elements from The Expanse rather than the data pads of Star Trek. But are colorful lights and different shaped buttons the main upgrades we can expect from the iPhones of the future? Only time will tell.

Decluttr

Midjourney has been especially busy recently. It helped fan-cast Tom Holland as Link in a Legend of Zelda movie that doesn’t exist. It was also used to create some seriously creepy versions of what Simpsons characters would look like in real life. People just can’t seem to help asking artificial intelligence for insights into alternate realities.

Even though he never wore the imposing costume, his iconic voice acting makes the character what it is. It’s not surprising the actor is saying goodbye to Darth Vader, he is 91 years old after all. But thankfully, this doesn’t mean we won’t hear James Earl Jones’ iconic Darth Vader voice anymore. Jones signed over the rights so Lucasfilm can use artificial intelligence to add his voice to Darth Vader for any future projects.

The studio already used the AI program Respeecher to create Jones’ Darth Vader voice for his return in Obi-Wan Kenobi. And Lucasfilm used the same technology to recreate Mark Hamill’s voice from decades ago for Luke Skywalker’s appearances in The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett. Both actors received credit for those roles.

Lucasfilm

We saw this news on Deadline. Jones performed as Darth Vader most recently for one line in The Rise of Skywalker. But his contributions to Revenge of the Sith, Star Wars: Rebels, and Rogue One were invaluable. And, of course, his other iconic work in the original trilogy (and the Holiday Special!) cannot go unpraised. But voice actors other than Jones have picked up the Darth Vader’s mantle in video games and shows like Robot Chicken.

Artificial intelligence also gave Val Kilmer his voice back after a tracheotomy. These examples all have the benefit of the person in question being alive to consent to AI uses of their voice. But there are others uses that raised eyebrows, like Andy Warhol’s estate green-lighting an AI voice for a docuseries. AI recreating Anthony Bourdain’s voice for another series also created some controversy. There’s also the recent news that Amazon is training Alexa to talk in other people’s voices. The company presented the heart-warming option of a beloved grandparent being able to read bedtime stories even after they’ve passed away. But we all know that people will immediately use such technology unethically.

Lucasfilm

All that being said, we’d love to hear Majel Barrett’s voice again as the voice of the ship’s computer on Star Trek. It was something she wanted before she passed away, but the technology just wasn’t ready at the time. So, in the case of James Earl Jones, Darth Vader, and AI, at least, we’ll count ourselves lucky.

In a bid to tackle manpower challenges due to the declining birth rate in Singapore, the SRU has leveraged artificial intelligence and automation technology to enhance its decontamination and casualty conveyance operations, SCDF said.

Among the SRU’s main stars is the mass decontamination vehicle designed by the SCDF and first used in 2016. Although it looks like a typical bus from the outside, it is far from one. The vehicle can transport up to 24 walking casualties at one go and also comes into play during emergencies such as a chemical attack.

It has a decontamination rate of 80 to 120 walking casualties on average per hour.

There are eight shower cubicles within the vehicle which are equipped with clean clothes, towels and slippers.

Another mode in the vehicle allows it to self-decontaminate and sanitise the air for its subsequent usage. The process takes less than an hour to complete.",artificial intelligence,cna

But today’s dynamics are more complicated. Companies need to accept their customers as ever-changing, complex people deeply impacted by unpredictable external forces — an approach the authors call life centricity. Life-centric businesses are deeply attuned to the forces that most profoundly affect their customers’ lives, such as technology, health, and culture. They achieve relevance by bridging the interplay between these life forces and their customers’ everyday decisions. And they maintain that relevance by perpetually evolving their products, marketing, sales, and service experiences as life continues to shift.

A mere 20 years ago, a song typically stayed on the Billboard Top 100 charts for 20 weeks. Right now, it’s closer to two weeks. Similarly, the skillset that would once last your whole career now requires a complete refresh every three to five years. Corporate longevity is also rapidly changing: in 2020, the average company lifespan on Standard and Poor’s 500 was just over 21 years, compared with 32 years in 1965. It’s expected to fall even further throughout the 2020s.

The half-life of relevance has never been shorter, and it’s no wonder: Technology advancements, cultural shifts, pandemics, and global conflicts are reshaping the world at record pace. And the resulting change isn’t just happening faster — it’s happening in a more profound way.

Facing this barrage of uncertain and chaotic external forces, people are rethinking who they are and what matters to them. In an Accenture survey of 25,000 global consumers, released in July 2022, 60% of them told us their priorities are changing based on global events. Nearly the same number say they’ve completely reassessed their life purpose and values in 2022, up from 50% in 2021.

As they reconcile these changes with the practicalities of everyday life, consumers are making paradoxical decisions. They want to shop based on values like sustainability — but they also want good value for their money. They want to act in their own best interest — but also effect change for others. In the absence of perfect solutions, they’re making choices the best they can in the moment.

Paradoxical decisions are not new, but the way people are accepting them is. In fact, nearly 70% of consumers told us that behaving inconsistently is very human and totally acceptable.

But consumers are also saying that businesses need to keep up. Around two thirds of customers feel that companies are not responding fast enough to their changing needs.

Meeting these needs — and unlocking the next great wave of growth for businesses globally — requires a new approach.

From Customer Centricity to Life Centricity

Over time, businesses have moved from a product-centric approach focused on performance to a customer-centric strategy meant to prioritize experience. But now, the dynamics are more complicated. Companies need to accept their customers as ever-changing, complex people deeply impacted by unpredictable external forces.

It’s time for life centricity.

Life-centric businesses are deeply attuned to the forces that most profoundly affect their customers’ lives, such as technology, health, and culture. They achieve relevance by bridging the interplay between these life forces and their customers’ everyday decisions. And they maintain that relevance by perpetually evolving their products, marketing, sales, and service experiences as life continues to shift.

Consider the case of Best Buy. The consumer electronics giant recognized that technology was a part of customers’ day-to-day activities — and could also be a source of stress, cost, and confusion as people tried to manage multiple products across incompatible ecosystems. So Best Buy created Totaltech, a new membership option that makes it easier to buy, set up, understand and enjoy tech products, plus fix them when something goes wrong. In making this life-centric shift, the company went from a place you go to buy technology to a “total life technology partner” for its members. They were able to see a growing need — not just around products or experiences, but around their customers’ full lives — and respond with a new offering that could adapt to changing circumstances and make people’s experience with technology easier.

Seeing customers’ full lives means finding ways to respond to changing cultural and social norms around technology. Japan’s Bank of Fukuoka saw use of traditional branches drop 40% over 10 years and needed a way to better serve digital natives who eschew the brick-and-mortar experience and who see money differently than previous generations. The result was Minna Bank, a cloud-driven banking system that leads with a frictionless mobile app and incorporates both financial and non-financial services. The end service is fun, simple, and turns the focus from money itself to what that money enables in people’s lives.

Likewise, Microsoft saw a growing gulf between the number of organizations in need of digital upgrades and the number of skilled developers available to do the work. The company launched Power Pages, a tool to empower users to rapidly build high-end, data-centric websites for complex business scenarios to reach their customers and community at scale, without needing to know how to code. Instead of just delivering a new product, Microsoft created something responding to larger life circumstances — with flexibility built in, so organizations can continue to adapt to changing needs. Organizations get a modern, secure, and reliable platform that allows them to adapt to massive changes and accelerate digital innovation, no matter their level of technical fluency, and customers get the seamless digital experience they need.

Moving Your Company Towards Life Centricity

To move toward life centricity, companies need to widen their strategic aperture. Digital transformation is part of the process, but it’s not enough on its own: Over and over, we have found this can help businesses keep pace today, but not necessarily get ahead or gain relevance tomorrow. Instead, the journey to life-centricity requires a three-pronged approach: See, solve, and simplify.

See customers in their full lives.

Instead of treating customers merely as “buyers,” businesses need to recognize them as ever-changing multi-dimensional people who play many roles, each providing new opportunities for value creation.

Businesses also need to expand their understanding of the forces that most profoundly affect customer’s lives. Customer analytics alone are no longer enough — monitoring changes in technology, culture, politics, health, the environment, and the economy in a much deeper way has to be part of the process.

Solve for shifting scenarios.

Life-centric businesses are prepared to deliver novel solutions in a constantly changing, resource-constrained environment, all while benefiting not just customers but all stakeholders. Rigid, one-size-fits-all products are unsustainable when people are allowing themselves to be inconsistent based on external pressures. By meeting unmet needs and offering adaptability, companies can stay relevant even as circumstances evolve.

Simplify for relevance.

Companies need to seek simplicity — not just in what they offer but in how they operate. Internally, organizations should prioritize interoperability across all customer-facing functions (such as product innovation, marketing, sales, service, and commerce), with an integrated technology stack across platforms and ecosystems.

Externally, customers are eager for anything that makes their decision-making easier. Companies can look to data, artificial intelligence, and human expertise to draw connections between people’s needs and the external life forces that are influencing them. Creating a bridge between the two helps customers get what they want — and helps businesses stay relevant.

Putting Life Front and Center

Truly life-centric businesses are only now beginning to emerge. And so, too, are the rewards. In July and August, we surveyed 850 worldwide executives and their businesses and found that companies that embrace life-centricity are far more likely to excel beyond their peers. Our analysis, which will be released this fall, suggests that life-centric businesses will on average achieve annual growth rates that are nine percentage points higher — that’s an increase of 900 basis points in their growth rates. In fact, we find that these companies lagging in life centricity are likely to see their revenues shrink year over year. For a $10 billion company, that’s the difference between growing $4B of new annual revenues after five years versus shrinking by $1B in the same period. Our analysis also shows that the life-centric companies are more resilient, materially outperforming on speed to market and customer lifetime value.

Customers are changing fast, but so are some of today’s leading companies. The risks are there, but so is the prize. Ultimately, companies can’t optimize their way to relevance in the future. Instead, they need to discover it by taking on a life-centric approach that allows the creativity, agility, and adaptability needed to thrive in tumultuous times.

Meta’s announcement of Make-A-Video, which is not yet being made available to the public, will likely prompt other AI labs to release their own versions. It also raises some big ethical questions.

In the last month alone, AI lab OpenAI has made its latest text-to-image AI system DALL-E available to everyone, and AI startup Stability.AI launched Stable Diffusion, an open-source text-to-image system.

But text-to-video AI comes with some even greater challenges. For one, these models need a vast amount of computing power. They are an even bigger computational lift than large text-to-image AI models, which use millions of images to train, because putting together just one short video requires hundreds of images. That means it’s really only large tech companies that can afford to build these systems for the foreseeable future. They’re also trickier to train, because there aren’t large-scale data sets of high-quality videos paired with text.

To work around this, Meta combined data from three open-source image and video data sets to train its model. Standard text-image data sets of labeled still images helped the AI learn what objects are called and what they look like. And a database of videos helped it learn how those objects are supposed to move in the world. The combination of the two approaches helped Make-A-Video, which is described in a non-peer-reviewed paper published today, generate videos from text at scale.

Tanmay Gupta, a computer vision research scientist at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, says Meta’s results are promising. The videos it’s shared show that the model can capture 3D shapes as the camera rotates. The model also has some notion of depth and understanding of lighting. Gupta says some details and movements are decently done and convincing.

“A young couple walking in heavy rain”

However, “there’s plenty of room for the research community to improve on, especially if these systems are to be used for video editing and professional content creation,” he adds. In particular, it’s still tough to model complex interactions between objects.

In the video generated by the prompt “An artist’s brush painting on a canvas,” the brush moves over the canvas, but strokes on the canvas aren’t realistic. “I would love to see these models succeed at generating a sequence of interactions, such as ‘The man picks up a book from the shelf, puts on his glasses, and sits down to read it while drinking a cup of coffee,’” Gupta says.",artificial intelligence,mit technology review

According to a Friday report by Vanity Fair, the 91-year-old screen legend has permitted Disney and Lucasfilm to use artificial intelligence and archival recordings to re-create his menacing tone in future “Star Wars” projects. Jones was most recently billed as Darth Vader on the Disney+ series “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” which premiered earlier this year.

While working on “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” Skywalker Sound editor Matthew Wood and the Ukrainian company Respeecher consulted with Jones to create a sound for Vader that captured his chilling vocal performance from the flagship “Star Wars” trilogy.

“[Jones] had mentioned he was looking into winding down this particular character,” Wood — who has worked with Jones at least a dozen times for various “Star Wars” projects — told Vanity Fair. “So how do we move forward?”

In the early “Star Wars” films, Jones made an indelible mark on the sci-fi franchise and cinema as a whole with seminal soundbites such as, “No. I am your father.” He is also credited as Vader on later “Star Wars” movies, including 2016’s “Rogue One” and 2019’s “The Rise of Skywalker.”",artificial intelligence,los angeles times
92,Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: Benefits and Challenges of Machine Learning Technologies for Medical Diagnostics - Government Accountability Office,https://www.gao.gov/assets/extracts/8a1729ae552d618a4352ba5514f78b5d/STAA-22-104629.png,29/09/2022,Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: Benefits and Challenges of Machine Learning Technologies for Medical Diagnostics  Government Accountability Office,https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104629,"What GAO Found

Several machine learning (ML) technologies are available in the U.S. to assist with the diagnostic process. The resulting benefits include earlier detection of diseases; more consistent analysis of medical data; and increased access to care, particularly for underserved populations. GAO identified a variety of ML-based technologies for five selected diseases — certain cancers, diabetic retinopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and COVID-19 —with most technologies relying on data from imaging such as x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these ML technologies have generally not been widely adopted.

Academic, government, and private sector researchers are working to expand the capabilities of ML-based medical diagnostic technologies. In addition, GAO identified three broader emerging approaches—autonomous, adaptive, and consumer-oriented ML-diagnostics—that can be applied to diagnose a variety of diseases. These advances could enhance medical professionals’ capabilities and improve patient treatments but also have certain limitations. For example, adaptive technologies may improve accuracy by incorporating additional data to update themselves, but automatic incorporation of low-quality data may lead to inconsistent or poorer algorithmic performance.

Spectrum of adaptive algorithms

We identified several challenges affecting the development and adoption of ML in medical diagnostics:

Demonstrating real-world performance across diverse clinical settings and in rigorous studies.

Meeting clinical needs, such as developing technologies that integrate into clinical workflows.

Addressing regulatory gaps, such as providing clear guidance for the development of adaptive algorithms.

These challenges affect various stakeholders including technology developers, medical providers, and patients, and may slow the development and adoption of these technologies.

GAO developed three policy options that could help address these challenges or enhance the benefits of ML diagnostic technologies. These policy options identify possible actions by policymakers, which include Congress, federal agencies, state and local governments, academic and research institutions, and industry. See below for a summary of the policy options and relevant opportunities and considerations.

Policy Options to Help Address Challenges or Enhance Benefits of ML Diagnostic Technologies

Opportunities Considerations Evaluation (report

page 28) Policymakers could create incentives, guidance, or policies to encourage or require the evaluation of ML diagnostic technologies across a range of deployment conditions and demographics representative of the intended use. This policy option could help address the challenge of demonstrating real world performance. Stakeholders could better understand the performance of these technologies across diverse conditions and help to identify biases, limitations, and opportunities for improvement.

Could inform providers' adoption decisions, potentially leading to increased adoption by enhancing trust.

Information from evaluations can help inform the decisions of policymakers, such as decisions about regulatory requirements. May be time-intensive, which could delay the movement of these technologies into the marketplace, potentially affecting patients and professionals who could benefit from these technologies.

More rigorous evaluation will likely lead to extra costs, such as direct costs for funding the studies. Developers may not be incentivized to conduct these evaluations if it could show their products in a negative light, so policymakers could consider whether evaluations should be conducted or reviewed by independent parties, according to industry officials. Data Access (report

page 29) Policymakers could develop or expand access to high-quality medical data to develop and test ML medical diagnostic technologies. Examples include standards for collecting and sharing data, creating data commons, or using incentives to encourage data sharing. This policy option could help address the challenge of demonstrating real world performance. Developing or expanding access to high-quality datasets could help facilitate training and testing ML technologies across diverse and representative conditions. This could improve the technologies' performance and generalizability, help developers understand their performance and areas for improvement, and help to build trust and adoption in these technologies.

Expanding access could enable developers to save time in the development process, which could shorten the time it takes for these technologies to be available for adoption. Entities that own data may be reluctant to share them for a number of reasons. For example, these entities may consider their data valuable or proprietary. Some entities may also be concerned about the privacy of their patients and the intended use and security of their data.

Data sharing mechanisms may be of limited use to researchers and developers depending on the quality and interoperability of these data, and curating and storing data could be expensive and may require public and private resources. Collaboration (report

page 30) Policymakers could promote collaboration among developers, providers, and regulators in the development and adoption of ML diagnostic technologies. For example, policymakers could convene multidisciplinary experts together in the design and development of these technologies through workshops and conferences. This policy option could help address the challenges of meeting medical needs and addressing regulatory gaps. Collaboration between ML developers and providers could help ensure that the technologies address clinical needs. For example, collaboration between developers and medical professionals could help developers create ML technologies that integrate into medical professionals' workflows, and minimize time, effort, and disruption.

Collaboration among developers and medical providers could help in the creation and access of ML ready data, according to NIH officials. As previously reported, providers may not have time to both collaborate with developers and treat patients; however, organizations can provide protected time for employees to engage in innovation activities such as collaboration.

If developers only collaborate with providers in specific settings, their technologies may not be usable across a range of conditions and settings, such as across different patient types or technology systems.

Why GAO Did This Study

Diagnostic errors affect more than 12 million Americans each year, with aggregate costs likely in excess of $100 billion, according to a report by the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine. ML, a subfield of artificial intelligence, has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex problems in diverse domains, including medical diagnostics. However, challenges to the development and use of machine learning technologies in medical diagnostics raise technological, economic, and regulatory questions.

GAO was asked to conduct a technology assessment on the current and emerging uses of machine learning in medical diagnostics, as well as the challenges and policy implications of these technologies. This report discusses (1) currently available ML medical diagnostic technologies for five selected diseases, (2) emerging ML medical diagnostic technologies, (3) challenges affecting the development and adoption of ML technologies for medical diagnosis, and (4) policy options to help address these challenges.

GAO assessed available and emerging ML technologies; interviewed stakeholders from government, industry, and academia; convened a meeting of experts in collaboration with the National Academy of Medicine; and reviewed reports and scientific literature. GAO is identifying policy options in this report.

I should never have christened Theresa May “the Maybot”. With hindsight, she appears positively emotionally present. Touchy-feely. Almost functional. If not entirely competent. Certainly not the 1980s piece of Amstrad junk she always seemed when she was running the country. If you can call it that.

But the Tories are just playing with us. It’s as if the members said: “So you think David Cameron is useless? Just wait until we give you Theresa.” And once we’d all had about enough of May, they gave us a narcissistic, sociopathic liar instead.

Now, to top it all – at least we hope so; surely there can’t be another one who is even worse? – we’ve been landed with Liz Truss. Someone who is not just half-witted and robotic, but reckless enough to bankrupt the country. The ideologue with only a tenuous grasp on reality. There’s always a job waiting for Truss in an automated call centre: a deathless loop that sucks the life out of you.

I’m not sure who was stupid enough to suggest starting the reclusive prime minister’s media rehabilitation with a tour of the BBC regional radio studios, but they won’t be doing it again in a hurry. If they thought they were going to ease Librium Liz out of her week-long hibernation with a series of short, “lifestyle” interviews – think author flogging new book on PR junket – that would reach a smallish, local audience and fly beneath the national media, then they badly miscalculated. Local radio presenters are no mugs and they weren’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth.

Inevitably, they all mainly asked the same questions. After all, there really is only one game in town. What the fuck did you think you were doing? Didn’t it occur to you that your mindless mini-budget could wipe £500bn off the markets, putting pensions at risk and increasing the cost of borrowing? Thanks very much for the £100 or so tax cut that the least well-off will be getting, but did you know that you’ve just made most people even more broke?

But there was a virtue in hearing the same question asked on eight separate occasions. Because it reinforced the key message that Librium Liz doesn’t have any coherent answers. She really didn’t seem to have any idea of the scale of the damage she had done. She was in total denial. Like an arsonist caught with a can of petrol.

It also said much about Truss’s limited capacity for rational thinking. Most artificial intelligence is programmed to learn from its mistakes. So you’d have thought she would have got better and better as the hour went on – that she might even have sounded half human and half intelligent by the time she came off air.

Only she didn’t. She got worse and worse. Out came the same absurd answers, and the pauses as she tried to think of something credible got longer and longer. She is the embodiment of the circle of doom on a laptop that’s crashing. She is not AI. She is Artificial Stupidity, programmed to carry on repeating more and more errors until she collapses in on herself. A dead cert to win this year’s Darwin awards for those who have contributed to human evolution by selecting themselves out of the gene pool. Wire Truss up to an ECG and you’d find no activity. Just a flat line.

One of Liz Truss’s radio interviews

The circus began at Radio Leeds, where presenter Rima Ahmed cut to the chase. Why had Truss crashed the economy and what was she going to do about it? “Um … er,” muttered Librium Liz, apparently astonished to be asked about why the country was in crisis.

“We took decisive action.” Thousands of people shouted at their radio. You took decisive action to wreck the economy. To make everyone significantly less well off. The one thing you weren’t supposed to do. What we really want to know is what “decisive action” you are going to take to reverse your child death squad mindless destruction. Doing nothing isn’t an option. “Nothing,” said Truss.

It was like this, she said. It all went wrong because we were trying to help people out with their energy bills. “Are you stupid?” everyone screamed. Of course it didn’t. You had announced the energy bailout early in September and no one had batted an eyelid. The markets had taken it in their stride. It was only when you and Kamikwasi Kwarteng announced your unfunded tax cuts that benefited the most well-off that the pound nosedived. It was an entirely self-inflicted crisis that only the ever delusional John Redwood and the batshit-crazy Institute of Economic Affairs welcomed.

On and on Librium Liz went. Through Norfolk, Kent, Lancashire, Nottingham, Tees, Bristol and Stoke. Each time sounding less and less convincing. Detached, emotionally dead, intellectually wanting. Careless with other people’s lives. Not even curious to find out how people were experiencing her calamity economics. The dead-air silences became so long I presumed she was trying to communicate by telepathy.

It was Putin who had crashed the economy, Truss insisted. Which was weird, because no one could remember the Russian president having delivered the budget in the Commons. Then it was the fault of the Marxist International Monetary Fund for sticking their oar in. Go back to North Korea! Finally, it was all down to the Bank of England. Mortgages getting more expensive was all their fault. They were the ones who had put up interest rates. Out of pique. Not in response to the budget.

Come the end, Truss was little more than a puddle on the floor. A pool to be mopped up and taxied back to Downing Street. She couldn’t even answer any of the local questions she was asked. Who would have guessed local journalists might ask local questions? She was clueless on fracking. Clueless on everything. When she was talking to her own local radio station in Norfolk, she didn’t just seem unaware that the roof was falling in on the hospital in King’s Lynn. She also seemed to have forgotten she was prime minister and in a position to do something about it.

It could have been worse. She could have spoken to 10 radio stations rather than eight. If there was a way out of this mess, Librium Liz wasn’t letting on. At present, her only plan seems to be to hang on and hope for the best. Much the same goes for Kamikwasi. He spent the day in Darlington doing not very much. At this rate, our two star-crossed lovers could be the only Tories to show their faces at the party conference in Birmingham next week. Let’s hope they’ve thought of something better to say by then.",artificial intelligence,the guardian

Scientists have reduced a vastly complex quantum physics problem requiring 100,000 equations to just four equations using artificial intelligence.

The team hope that the “dimensionality reduction” method could “revolutionise” scientific investigation into quantum problems, leading to breakthroughs in ultra-efficient materal design.

Potential outcomes could include new materials that have useful properties, like superconductivity, or have applications in fields ranging from neuroscience to renewable energy.

“We start with this huge object of all these coupled-together differential equations; then we’re using machine learning to turn it into something so small you can count it on your fingers,” said Domenico Di Sante, an assistant professor at the University of Bologna in Italy, and a visiting research fellow at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics in New York.

“It is essentiall a machine that has the power to discover hidden patterns.”

Recommended AI to take over the voice of Darth Vader

The quantum problem involved the movement of electrons on a lattice, in a setup known as a Hubbard model.

Physicists have grappled how to deal with the way the electrons can become quantum mechanically entangled, meaning they cannot be treated individually within the formula and therefore require vast computational power to figure out.

Using a neural network, the team were able to train it over many weeks to find a small set of equations that generated the same solution as the method that involved thousands of equations.

“When we saw the result, we said, ‘wow, this is more than what we expected’,” Dr Di Sante said. “We were really able to capture the relevant physics.”

The scientists now hope to test the approach on more complex quantum systems that involve electrons interacting at long distances.

The breakthrough was detailed in an article, titled ‘Deep learning the functional renormalisation group’, published in the scientific journal Physical Review Letters on 23 September.",artificial intelligence,independent

Klondike Gold evaluated Minerva's DRIVER software with data from the Lone Star Gold Deposit and was extremely impressed with the results. The study compared gold models autonomously created by DRIVER to existing block models of gold in the Lone Star Zone generated using conventional orebody modelling techniques. The results showed that Minerva's DRIVER software was able to successfully recreate the enriched gold model along with the 35 other elements within the datasets in a single day rather than approximately three weeks.

""The close agreement between DRIVER's model extents and anisotropy with that of the manually created block model strengthens the confidence of the gold distribution at the Lone Star Zone. This program was successful in helping us target higher grades within the known resource areas and to guide us for new discoveries."" stated Peter Tallman, President, CEO & Director of Klondike Gold Corp.

""This study further validates DRIVER as an indispensable tool that can help confirm and expedite the modelling of 3D geochemistry and enable our clients to spend more time evaluating models rather than generating them. Our clients are able to use DRIVER to create 3D block models of all the elements in their assay suite, allowing them to gain a better understanding of their deposit for the purposes of mine planning and exploration vectoring."" said Scott Tillman, CEO & Director of Minerva.

97,[Articles] Artificial intelligence-guided screening for atrial fibrillation using electrocardiogram during sinus rhythm: a prospective non-randomised interventional trial,https://www.thelancet.com//els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/cms/asset/eb876fd1-f71a-4cdd-8980-07dcd88e17c5/gr1.jpg,27/09/2022,An AI-guided targeted screening approach that leverages existing clinical data increased the yield for atrial fibrillation detection and could improve the effectiveness of atrial fibrillation screening.,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01637-3/fulltext?rss=yes,"Background

Previous atrial fibrillation screening trials have highlighted the need for more targeted approaches. We did a pragmatic study to evaluate the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm-guided targeted screening approach for identifying previously unrecognised atrial fibrillation.

Methods

NCT04208971. For this non-randomised interventional trial, we prospectively recruited patients with stroke risk factors but with no known atrial fibrillation who had an electrocardiogram (ECG) done in routine practice. Participants wore a continuous ambulatory heart rhythm monitor for up to 30 days, with the data transmitted in near real time through a cellular connection. The AI algorithm was applied to the ECGs to divide patients into high-risk or low-risk groups. The primary outcome was newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. In a secondary analysis, trial participants were propensity-score matched (1:1) to individuals from the eligible but unenrolled population who served as real-world controls. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov

Findings

1003 patients with a mean age of 74 years (SD 8·8) from 40 US states completed the study. Over a mean 22·3 days of continuous monitoring, atrial fibrillation was detected in six (1·6%) of 370 patients with low risk and 48 (7·6%) of 633 with high risk (odds ratio 4·98, 95% CI 2·11–11·75, p=0·0002). Compared with usual care, AI-guided screening was associated with increased detection of atrial fibrillation (high-risk group: 3·6% [95% CI 2·3–5·4] with usual care vs 10·6% [8·3–13·2] with AI-guided screening, p<0·0001; low-risk group: 0·9% vs 2·4%, p=0·12) over a median follow-up of 9·9 months (IQR 7·1–11·0).

Interpretation

An AI-guided targeted screening approach that leverages existing clinical data increased the yield for atrial fibrillation detection and could improve the effectiveness of atrial fibrillation screening.

98,Upcoming Missions Could Search for Ancient Alien Technology Within the Solar System,https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/F0632582-2728-47A2-A36EC472DCCEB256_source.jpg,28/09/2022,"In a recent report, researchers with the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center recommend that we search for extraterrestrial intelligence here in the Solar System.
The post Upcoming Missions Could Search for Ancient Alien Technology Within the Solar…",https://www.universetoday.com/157788/upcoming-missions-could-search-for-ancient-alien-technology-within-the-solar-system/,"Over sixty years ago, the first search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), known as Project Ozma, was conducted. This campaign was led by legendary astronomer Frank Drake, which relied on the 85-1 Tatel Telescope at the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia to listen to Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani for any signs of radio transmissions. Since then, the field of SETI has become more sophisticated thanks to more advanced radio telescopes, improved data analysis, and international collaboration. In the coming years, SETI will also benefit from advances in exoplanet studies and next-generation instruments and surveys.

In addition to examining exoplanets for signs of technological activity (aka. “technosignatures”), there are also those who recommend that we look for them here at home. Examples include the Galileo Project, which is dedicated to studying interstellar objects (ISOs) and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). There’s also the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center, a research group dedicated to advancing SETI through the search for technosignatures. In a recent paper, they explain how future SETI efforts should consider looking for extraterrestrial technology in our Solar System.

The PSETI Center consists of researchers from Penn State University, the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science (BMSIS), the SETI Institute, the Planetary Science Institute (PSI), NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and multiple universities. The paper they recently authored was the subject of a report titled “Opportunities for Technosignature Science in the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey,” presented at the First Penn State SETI Symposium – which took place from June 27th-30th.

For the entirety of its history, the field SETI has been predominantly focused on observing distant star systems and galaxies for signs of technological activity. These surveys have all searched for signs of radio transmissions since it is the most effective communication method grounded in well-known physics (by our standards). But in the coming years, SETI researchers hope to cast a wider net and search for other means of communication – such as directed energy, neutrinos, and even gravitational waves. These and other possibilities were outlined in NASA’s Technosignature Report, released in 2019.

In addition, there is a growing movement among SETI researchers that want to expand the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) here at home. Dr. Jacob Haqq-Misra, the Senior Research Investigator at the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science and the report’s lead author, is one such person. Haqq-Misra’s research is focused on the conditions that allow life to emerge and thrive in the Universe and the possibility of detecting life on other planets through signs of biological (“biosignatures”) or technological activity. As he told Universe Today via email:

“Most SETI searches have focused on looking for technosignatures in other star systems, [while] only a handful have looked for technosignatures in our own Solar System. We cannot yet rule out the possibility of technosignatures in the Solar System, so it would be worthwhile to look.”

For years, Haqq-Misra’s work has also focused on the types of technosignatures we should be looking for. This included a NASA-funded study he conducted in 2020 alongside Prof. Adam Frank of the University of Rochester, Avi Loeb and Manasvi Lingam from the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and Jason Wright from Pennsylvania State University. This study was aimed at looking for traces of chlorofluorocarbons (CFS) – specifically tetrafluoromethane (CF 4 ) and trichlorofluoromethane (CCl3F) – in exoplanet atmospheres and large arrays of solar panels.

Earlier this year, Haqq-Misra teamed up again with Frank, Wright, Lingam, and other colleagues to author a study about how the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could search for extraterrestrial civilizations by looking for signs of atmospheric pollution. But as Haqq-Misra expressed, SETI research also needs to expand to consider technological activity and objects that could be here in our Solar System. Such efforts have received a boost in recent years, thanks to the interstellar objects (ISOs) like ‘Oumuamua (which flew by Earth in 2017) and 2I/Borisov, detected two years later.

The detection of these objects confirmed what astronomers had suspected for some time, which is that ISOs enter the Solar System on a regular basis. Other research showed that some of these visitors are periodically captured by the Solar System and even suggested where some of them could be found today. Last, but not least, multiple proposals have been made since 2017 for missions that could rendezvous with ‘Oumuamua or intercept future ISOs and retrieve samples from them. If even one of these ISOs were artificial in origin, the scientific returns would be immeasurable.

If there are any Von Neumann probes in the Solar System – especially in the Main Asteroid Belt, the Kuiper Belt, and the Oort Cloud, where they would be hardest to detect – then relatively low-cost missions to search for them could provide similar returns. Haqq-Misra described what form these missions could take and how they might look for possible technosignatures:

“Orbiters, rovers, and probes that explore planetary bodies would be well-suited to constrain the presence of technosignatures on surfaces. Missions that observe small bodies such as asteroids and Kuiper Belt Objects would be ideal for looking for free-floating or orbiting artifacts in space. Ground- and space-based observatories might also be able to help with the search.”

These goals are consistent with the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey (2023-2032) drafted by the National Research Council (NRC) and released on April 19th, 2022. The Survey recommends several missions for the coming decade, like a Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP), an Enceladus orbiter and lander, and the crewed exploration of the Moon and Mars. An ISO intercept mission is also recommended, like the Comet Interceptor mission the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) are developing. As is indicated in the Survey:

“It is expected that in the coming decade, the discovery rate of ISOs will increase dramatically. By discovering and characterizing additional ISOs, we will be able to compare them to the small body populations in the Solar System, and potentially constrain their birthplace.” Haqq-Misra and his colleagues note in their report that such a mission would also provide opportunities to constrain the presence of technosignatures on ISOs. As he explained, this would require no changes in the mission architecture or instrumentation:

“We are encouraging scientists and mission planners to consider the kind of technosignature science they can already do with their existing Solar System exploration program. Our report highlights a number of ways in which the recommendations of the Decadal Survey could advance technosignature science without needing to add any new instrumentation. For example, the ongoing Mars Exploration Program can place constraints on technosignatures on the surface of Mars by analyzing the high-resolution images that arise from other science on Mars.”

The goals of the PSETI report are also consistent with those of the Galileo Project, which will rely on astronomical, atmospheric, and space-based observations (combined with machine learning algorithms) to characterize ISOs and UAFs. The Project will rely on instruments like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (VRO), which will detect ISOs as they enter our Solar System (at a rate of a couple per month) once it begins its Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Alongside the many next-generation observatories that will be operational soon, the number of known ISOs is expected to increase exponentially.

In the meantime, Haqq-Misra and his team hope that their paper will inspire aspiring SETI researchers and veterans in the field to look beyond traditional boundaries. With some simple modifications, missions destined for locations throughout the Solar System in the coming years could also become frontline SETI missions. As Haqq-Misra summarized:

“We hope that our report will encourage scientists, mission planners, and administrators to consider the relevance of technosignature science to their existing and planned missions. We have many capabilities for constraining the prevalence of technosignatures in the solar system, and so it is worth considering the possibility as we continue to explore the Solar System.”

Throughout our Solar System, there are countless places where defunct extraterrestrial spacecraft might be lingering. According to recent research, ISOs captured by the Solar System are most likely to be found between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune. As for functioning probes and Von Neumann machines, the smart money says they would be beyond the orbit of Neptune, residing in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. For all we know, there could be dozens of probes in our Solar System that are looking for biosignatures and technosignatures themselves!

Prediction of the main histological subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) into clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC), chromophobe carcinoma (chRCC), and papillary carcinoma (papRCC) is a widely studied task in computational pathology23,33. We trained ResNet, a convolutional neural network (CNN, Fig. 1A) and a ViT (Fig. 1B) on this task on TCGA-RCC (N = 897 patients, Suppl. Fig. 1A). The resulting classifiers performed well on the external test set AACHEN-RCC (N = 249, Suppl. Fig. 1B), reaching a mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.960 [±0.009]. ViT reached a comparable AUROC of 0.958 [±0.010] (Fig. 1C and Suppl. Table 2), which was on par with and not significantly different from the ResNet (p = 0.98). The image tiles which were assigned the highest scores showed typical patterns for each histological subtype, demonstrating that ResNet and ViT can learn relevant patterns and generalize to an external validation cohort (Fig. 1D). In addition, we evaluated the baseline performance of CNN and ViT on subtyping of gastric cancer37,38. When trained on the TCGA-GASTRIC cohort (N = 191 patients, Suppl. Fig. 1C) and tested on the BERN cohort (N = 249 patients, Suppl. Fig. 1D), CNN and ViT achieved mean AUROCs of 0.782 [±0.014] and 0.768 [±0.015] respectively (Fig. 1E and Suppl. Table 2). Again, the highest-scoring tiles showed morphological patterns which are representative of the diffuse and intestinal subtype (Fig. 1F)39,40. Together, these data are in line with the previous evidence23 and show that CNNs and ViTs perform equally well for weakly-supervised classification tasks in our experimental pipeline.

CNNs are susceptible to multiple adversarial attacks

We attacked CNNs with adversarial attacks (Fig. 2A), evaluating white-box and black-box attacks (Fig. 2B). By default, we used the most commonly used gradient-based attack, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and additionally tested five other types of adversarial attacks (Fast Gradient Sign Method [FGSM], Fast Adaptive boundary [FAB], Square attacks, AutoAttack [AA], and AdvDrop, Fig. 2C). We found that with an increasing attack strength ɛ, the amount of visible noise on the images increased (Fig. 2D). We quantified this in a blinded observer study and found that the detection threshold for adversarial attacks was ɛ = 0.19 for ResNet models and ɛ = 0.13 for ViT (Suppl. Table 3 and Suppl. Fig. 2A, B). With increasing attack strength, the classifier performance of a ResNet CNN on the test set decreased. Specifically, we attacked with PGD with a low (ɛ = 0.25e-3), medium (ɛ = 0.75e-3), and high (ɛ = 1.50e-3) attack strength. The AUROC for RCC subtyping by ResNet dropped from a baseline of 0.960 to 0.919, 0.749, and 0.429 (Fig. 3A and Suppl. Table 4). For the secondary classification task, subtyping gastric cancer, the CNN models were even more susceptible to adversarial attacks. Here, the PGD completely degraded classification performance. The AUROC reached by the CNN dropped from a baseline of 0.782 to 0.380, 0.029, and 0.000 for the images attacked with low, medium, and high ɛ (Fig. 3B and Suppl. Table 5). Together, these data show that CNNs are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks in computational pathology.

Adversarially robust training partially hardens CNNs

We subsequently investigated two possible mitigation strategies to rescue CNN performance. First, we evaluated adversarially robust training, in which PGD is applied to the training dataset so that CNN can learn to ignore the noise patterns. Although training a CNN with PGD-attacked images (ɛ = 1.50e-3) slightly reduced the RCC classification performance from baseline from 0.960 to 0.954 (Suppl. Table 2), it improved the model’s robustness to attacks. For the PGD attack at inference, this adversarially robustly trained CNN yielded an average AUROC of 0.951, 0.944, and 0.932 for low, medium, and high ɛ, respectively (Fig. 3A and Suppl. Table 6). Second, we investigated if the effect of adversarially robust training of CNNs could be enhanced by using a dedicated technique, dual-batch-normalized (DBN). The baseline performance of this model was an AUROC of 0.946 [±0.028] (p = 0.58) for RCC classification, which was not significantly inferior to the original model (Suppl. Table 2). When we attacked the test dataset with the PGD attack, DBN-CNN conveyed good protection at inference, but did not beat the normal adversarially robust training (Fig. 3A and Suppl. Table 6). In the secondary prediction task, adversarially robust training slightly lowered the classification accuracy at baseline (on non-attacked images) from 0.782 [±0.014] to 0.754 [±0.012], but mitigated the vulnerability to attack, resulting in AUROCs of 0.731, 0.679, and 0.595 for low, medium and high ɛ (Suppl. Table 7). Together, these data show that the attackability of CNNs can be partly mitigated by adversarially robust training. Dual batch normalization (DBN) did not convey any additional robustness to CNNs.

ViTs are inherently robust to adversarial attacks

Next, we attacked ViTs with adversarial attacks. We found that they were relatively robust against adversarial attacks without any adversarial pretraining and without any modifications to the architecture. For low, medium, and high PGD attack strengths in RCC classification, ViT AUROCs were slightly reduced from a baseline of 0.958 to 0.944, 0.908, and 0.827 (Suppl. Table 4), but ViT was significantly more robust than Resnet (p = 0.06, 0.04, and 0.01). For the secondary prediction task of gastric cancer subtyping, the baseline performance was lower for all classifiers when compared to RCC (Fig. 3B). Also in this task, ViTs were significantly more robust to attacks than ResNet (p < = 0.01 for low, medium and high attack strength, Suppl. Table 5). Training a ViT in an adversarially robust way slightly reduced the baseline performance for RCC classification from 0.958 [±0.01] to 0.938 [±0.007] (Fig. 3A), and reduced the performance of ViT under a low-intensity PGD attack from 0.944 [±0.011] to 0.932 [±0.007]. However, for medium and high-intensity attacks, adversarially robust training was beneficial for ViTs, slightly increasing the AUROC from 0.908 [±0.015] to 0.922 [±0.01] and from 0.827 [±0.032] to 0.906 [±0.016], respectively (Suppl. Tables 4, 6). Similarly, in the gastric cancer classification task, adversarially robust training hardened ViTs: they only slightly reduced their baseline AUROC of 0.737 to 0.724, 0.699, and 0.657 under low, medium, and high-intensity attacks, respectively (Suppl. Table 7). Next, we investigated whether the improved higher robustness of ViTs compared to CNNs extended to other types of white and black-box attacks. To this end, we selected 450 tiles from the RCC subtyping task and calculated the attack success rate (ASR) for an overall 6 attacks under low, medium, and high attack strength (ɛ = 0.25e-3, 0.75e-3, and 1.50e-3) (Table 1). For all six types of attacks, in baseline models and adversarially trained models, ViTs had a lower (better) ASR in the majority of experiments. For baseline models, ViT outperformed ResNet for all the attack types and for all predefined attack strengths ɛ (Suppl. Fig. 3). For adversarially trained models, the margin was smaller, but ViT still outperformed ResNet in 9 out of 24 experiments (Table 1). In addition, we investigated whether the higher robustness of ViT compared to ResNet was due to its pretraining on a larger image set or its higher number of parameters. To this end, we repeated our experiments with another CNN model, the BiT, which is similar to the original ResNet, but has more parameters and is trained on more data during pretraining. We found that BiT was even more susceptible to adversarial attacks than the baseline ResNet (Table 1) and was similarly inferior to ViT for sub-visual attack strengths ɛ. Finally, we evaluated attacks with a very high ɛ value of 0.1 (Table 1), which resulted in a severe performance reduction for all models. However, because 0.1 is at the threshold for human perception, these attacks are potentially of low practical relevance. In contrast, attacks in the low sub-visual range (e.g., ɛ 1.5e-3, as used by us and by the previous studies41) are very hard to detect and still detrimental to the performance of convolutional neural networks, placing these attacks in the focus of adversarially robust model development.

Mechanism of ViT robustness against adversarial attacks

To identify potential reasons for this higher robustness of ViTs towards adversarial attacks, we analyzed the adversarial noise obtained with white-box attacks on ViTs and ResNets. Quantitatively, we found that the magnitude of the gradients was consistently lower for ViT than for ResNet (Suppl. Fig. 4A). Qualitatively, in ViT, we observed a clear patch partition boundary alignment while ResNet patterns were more spatially incoherent (Suppl. Fig. 4B). We conclude that this observation reflects the patch-based nature of ViTs, which causes learned features to contain less low-level information such as lines and edges from an input image and therefore making them less sensitive to high-frequency perturbations. In addition, we analyzed the structure of the latent space of the deep layer activations in ResNet and ViT, after dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA). We found that for the original images in the RCC classification tasks, the instances in the classes were visually more clearly separated for ViT than for the CNN (Fig. 3C). This was confirmed in the more difficult task of gastric cancer subtyping, in which also a clearer separation was seen (Fig. 3D). Quantitatively, the instances within a given class were aggregated more tightly in the ViT latent space, and the distance between the centers of the classes were larger (Suppl. Table 8). When we attacked the images and used the baseline model to extract the features, the differences were even more pronounced: the ResNet latent space was more de-clustered than the ViT latent space (Fig. 3C, D). Finally, we investigated which regions in input images were assigned high importance by the ResNet and the ViT, respectively, visualizing important regions with Grad-CAM. At baseline, the ResNet tended to focus on a single region of the input image, while ViT assigned higher importance to multiple image regions. After adversarial attacks, the ResNet region's importance was defocused and included much larger, potentially irrelevant image regions. This effect increased with increasing attack strength ɛ. In contrast, the important image regions as highlighted by Grad-CAM in a ViT did not visibly change during an attack (Suppl. Fig. 5). Based on these observations, we conclude that the high robustness of ViT towards white-box adversarial attacks, when compared with CNN, is associated with a better separation of distinct classes in the latent space, and a more stable focus on relevant image regions within image tiles.",artificial intelligence,nature.com

SYDNEY, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Australian telecoms giant Optus must pay the cost of replacing the passports and drivers licences of millions of customers whose personal information was stolen in one of the country's biggest data breaches, the government said on Thursday.

The theft of data attached to 10 million customer accounts, equivalent to 40% of Australia's population, was the result of an error by Optus so it was up to the Singapore Telecommunications-owned (STEL.SI) company to pay for the consequences, Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said.

""Optus is absolutely responsible for paying for the costs and the implications of this for customers, whether it's the replacement of a licence, whether it's the replacement of a passport, or other necessary pieces of ID,"" Jones told reporters in Sydney. He did not give a dollar figure for the costs.

An Optus representative was not immediately available to respond to Jones's comments. Optus has apologised for the breach and said it would pay for the most affected customers to receive credit monitoring for a year.

The comments underscore the growing tension between Australia's government and its second-largest telco as internet companies, banks and government authorities scramble to minimise the risk of being similarly hacked.

The operator of an anonymous account had in an online chatroom demanded $1 million to refrain from selling the Optus customer data, only to later withdraw the demand and apologise, citing heightened publicity. Optus and law enforcement authorities have not verified the demand, although cybersecurity experts say it was most likely authentic.

The stolen data included passport numbers, drivers licence numbers, government health insurance numbers, phone numbers and home addresses, prompting commentators and lawmakers to demand replacement documents.

Other large internet firms meanwhile said they were running extra cybersecurity checks to reduce the risk of a similar breach.

""In light of the recent Optus breach, we have been working closely with our cybersecurity partners and the relevant government agencies to increase our checks,"" said a spokesperson for No. 3 internet provider TPG Telecom Ltd (TPG.AX), which has about 6 million customers.

A spokesperson for Telstra Corp , Australia's largest internet provider, said in an email: ""We will continue to consider what other steps we may need to put in place as we learn more about the Optus incident"".

“In our Cybersecurity business, we delivered double-digit sequential billings growth, including securing significant business in both government and financial services, as well as in the middle market. We’re executing on our plan and we’re seeing the decisions made in recent quarters starting to pay off, with Cybersecurity ARR expected to resume growth early next fiscal year.”

Blackberry (NYSE: BB), continues to struggle with its SaaS and cybersecurity business, meanwhile, on the other hand, the IoT division continues to grow relatively rapidly making up for declines in revenue elsewhere. The company’s management has reiterated that it will increasingly focus on the IoT segment moving forward, which is surprising because not long ago Blackberry always featured among the most preferred cyber security companies, but is now increasingly being overlooked for companies such as Crowdstrike (Nasdaq: CRWD). Issues from the previous quarter remain but the overall results were better and some green shoots have begun to show for the security and IoT company.

Blackberry IoT Flourishes but Cyber Security Continues to Struggle

Management has guided that IoT revenue for the fiscal year 2023 will come in at around $200-$210 million and that the future looks bright with an increasing number of car makers adopting the main IoT software program QNX, including the likes of Volkswagen. QNX is now also embedded in 7 out of the 10 largest OEMs in China, and the company remains hopeful that IoT can be the backbone of Blackberry’s revenue in the future. The good news is that as the IoT division becomes a larger percentage of revenue the company’s gross margins are likely to head much higher to around 70%, which would push the company towards profitability, something that investors will look for before they start to dip their toes in the stock again. Cybersecurity meanwhile continues to struggle even though the company’s systems are increasingly preferred by governments to protect their network. But the private sector continues to prefer competitors leaving Blackberry in a tight bind.

Financial Outlook Remains Lukewarm

The company continued to produce losses for the quarter with GAAP earnings-per-share coming in a 9 cents, and investors will be disappointed that Blackberry has not been able to turn a profit despite relatively healthy margins. Many would take a look at the lack of return on investment in research and development that has gone into the various business divisions, and wonder whether the management competency is at stake. Despite the losses, the company remains well capitalized and currently has $432 million in cash and cash equivalents on its books. But investors will be worried about the negative free cash flow, with operating cash flow coming in at -$23 million.

Blackberry’s revenue is expected to increase by around 15-20% in 2023, but it remains to be seen whether IoT and QNX will bring in enough customers to get the company back on track to sustainable growth and away from the limbo it is currently in. Management has guided that revenue from cyber security products will witness growth once again next year, as a lot of the issues that had affected growth previously have now been resolved. It remains to be seen whether Blackberry will finally turn that corner in 2022.

Analysts have continued to cut Blackberry’s price target, and now the average analyst target currently stands at around $8 per share, with most analysts recommending a ‘hold’ rating. But the market is unlikely to bring the stock back to those levels unless management shows prospects for a turnaround.

102,15 top-paying IT certifications for 2022,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-Training-Hiring-Certifications-1.gif?w=1200&strip=all,29/09/2022,Employers need the expertise to keep IT operating and secure — and IT certifications are benefitting enterprises across sectors.,https://venturebeat.com/security/15-top-paying-it-certifications-for-2022/,"Did you miss a session from MetaBeat 2022? Head over to the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions here.

The highest-paying certification in the U.S. this year is the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional certification — with an average salary of $168,080. That’s 13% higher than the average salary of the top 15, most well-paying certifications — the average of which is $148,278.

Today Skillsoft released its 15 Top-Paying IT Certifications for 2022 based on its 2022 IT Skills & Salary Report. A certification must have at least 50 survey responses to ensure the data was statistically valid, and the certification exam must be currently available. Additionally, 65% of technical professionals who have earned one of the top 15 certifications also have a certification in cybersecurity. Skillsoft says 62% of all respondents earned certifications in the last year.

Security, the most lucrative of certifications

Getting into specifics, of the many certification types and focuses, security certifications are the most lucrative, with an average annual salary of $153,154. For cloud certifications, the average salary is $150,961. AWS certifications — despite having the top paying certification as mentioned above — are just a tad lower on average overall with the annual salary sitting around $149,371. It’s all good news for many technical professionals looking to grow their careers and capitalize on their certifications and experience to increase their incomes.

Tech professionals with one or more certifications continue to see strong demand in the job market. For instance, LinkedIn’s job listings shows a combined 117,000 open cybersecurity jobs today seeking candidates who hold at least one of the four security certifications on the top 15 list below. There are also 88,200 open jobs on listed on the platform for candidates who hold at least one of the six cloud architect certifications below.

From that list, here are some key insights for 2022:

The avg. salary across all 15 certs is $148,278 in 2022, up from 2021

The highest-paying cybersecurity certification in 2022 is paying an average salary of $168,080 for AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional expertise — which is far above the average salary of all five AWS certifications combined. The top five AWS certifications pay an average salary of $149,371. More than 14,000 open positions listed on LinkedIn today list one or more of the five AWS certifications as a requirement.

Google certs are the best-paying

The average salary of technical professionals with Google certifications averages $152,039 this year, leading all cloud platforms in pay. It leads with a $3,000 margin over AWS and $10,000 above Microsoft. In contrast, Amazon AWS certifications pay an average of $149,371, and Microsoft’s certifications pay $142,975. The GCP – Professional Cloud Architect is one of the most lucrative from a platform perspective, paying around $161,371, or 8.8% higher than the average salary of all certifications.

“The increase in the importance of Google Cloud and multicloud certifications – not just AWS and Azure – speaks to the growing fraction of enterprises that now rely on more than one cloud computing platform,” said Michael Yoo, customer market leader at Skillsoft. “Sometimes, that’s driven by a desire for technical and commercial flexibility. Other times, it is a result of M&A activity.”

85% of IT leaders in the U.S. say certified professionals add $10,000+ in economic value to their orgs

What’s more? Skillsoft’s findings found that 21% actually say the value may be more than $30,000 with a certification. IT leaders cite higher productivity as the leading benefit of certified staff, but also note competitive advantage and turnover reduction.

Some high-paying certifications just missed the cut

The four that did not make the top 15 list include the Certified Ethical Hacker (EC-Council), Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Fundamentals, Google Cloud – Professional Data Engineer and Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) by ISACA.

Google’s Cloud – The Professional Data Engineer certification was the highest paying certification in last year, but did not make the list this year, with a reported average salary of $171,749.

A changing economy and industry

“This year’s list is notable first by what topics continue to be hot – cloud foremost, supplemented by key certifications in cybersecurity and data,” Yoo said. “This is not surprising given how nearly every company in every industry of every size in every geography is relying on cloud computing to power their technology strategy.”.

Cloud, cybersecurity and platform certifications are also an excellent hedge against inflation and turbulent economic conditions, as employers need the expertise to keep IT operating and secure.",cybersecurity,venturebeat

ATHENS, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google will set up its first cloud region in Greece, the company said on Thursday, giving a boost to the country's efforts to become a world cloud computing hub.

The deal is estimated to contribute some 2.2 billion euros ($2.13 billion) to Greece's economic output and create some 20,000 jobs by 2030, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.

Since taking office in 2019, Mitsotakis's conservative government has stepped up moves to diversify the economy and attract foreign investment and high tech companies to the country which emerged from a decade-long financial crisis in 2018.

""Today, we are very pleased to be announcing our first cloud region in Greece which will provide storage and cloud services for Google customers,"" said Adaire Fox-Martin, president of Google Cloud International, announcing the investment at an event in Athens.

The investment would enable organisations to better use their data, help improve low latency and ensure users' security in the face of cybersecurity threats, she said.

A cloud region usually is based around a cluster of data centres.

Google's investment comes two years after Microsoft Corp. decided to build a data centre hub in the country.

Amazon Inc's cloud computing division also opened its first office in Greece last year to support what it said was a growing number of companies and public sector agencies using its cloud services.

LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Around $22 trillion of global debt rated by Moody's has a ""high"" or ""very high"" exposure to the risk of cyber attack, the ratings agency said in a report on Thursday, with hospitals and utilities seen at the greatest risk.

Out of $80 trillion worth of debt across 71 sectors that the rating agency monitors, more than a quarter - or 28% - featured in these two highest-risk brackets. This was $1 trillion more than in 2019, Moody's said.

Hospitals and infrastructure including electricity, gas and water utilities, are the most at risk, Moody's said.

The scores took into account the risk of exposure to hacks and mitigation measures taken.

""We view not-for-profit hospitals as being highly attractive, data-rich targets with average mitigation measures in place to reduce the impact of a potential cyber event,"" the report said.

The agency said that its findings were unrelated to any credit rating actions and that most cyber attacks were not material enough to affect issuers' ratings.

Moody's said that cyber-related risk was rising, but that there had also been an increase in investment in security measures to counter that risk.

Ride-hailing app Uber (UBER.N) and Australian telecoms company Optus Network are among the companies to have been hit by cybersecurity breaches so far in September.

PARIS, Sept 29 (Reuters) - French technology consultancy company Atos (ATOS.PA), whose shares have slumped on scepticism over its restructuring plan, said on Thursday it had rejected expressions of interest in its Evidian unit from rival onepoint and UK private equity fund ICG.

Atos said onepoint and ICG had sent an unsolicited letter of intent related to the potential acquisition of the Evidian business for an indicative enterprise value of 4.2 billion euros ($4.1 billion).

""Following the thorough examination of this preliminary and non-binding mark of interest, and upon the recommendation of its ad hoc committee, the board of directors has convened and unanimously concluded that it is not in the interest of the company and its stakeholders,"" Atos said. ""The board of directors has therefore decided not to proceed.""

The City watchdog has issued a warning to insurers to treat customers fairly after concerns that the cost of living squeeze may prompt households and businesses to cut back on insurance, leaving them without protection.

The Financial Conduct Authority has written to chief executives in the insurance industry urging them to ensure consumers are not sold unnecessary products or add-ons and do not face unfair penalties.

The watchdog is concerned the rising cost of everything from food to energy may force customers not to opt for insurance they would normally take out.

It said consumers may opt for cheaper insurance policies or forgo insurance entirely. Consumers going abroad may decide to travel uninsured and then face huge medical costs if they were injured or taken ill.

Businesses could also take a similar route as they try to cut overheads due to rising commodity and energy costs. The FCA said some small to medium-sized businesses may choose to cancel cybersecurity insurance policies “during a time when we believe the risks of hacking and cyber-attacks are higher” due to the pandemic and the “economic instability following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine”.

The FCA has asked insurers to reassess customers’ needs, provide clear information and waive fees associated with adjusting a customer’s policy.

Sheldon Mills, the executive director for consumers and competition at the FCA, said: “Customers who are struggling with their finances should contact their providers as soon as possible. We encourage customers to continue to shop around to find the best deal.

“Firms should not unfairly penalise them for any payment difficulties but instead work with them to find solutions.”

The move comes as the pressure on household incomes continues to rise. The communications regulator, Ofcom, said on Thursday a record 8m UK households were struggling to pay their mobile, broadband, pay-TV and streaming bills and the Next boss, Simon Wolfson, has warned of a second cost of living crisis in 2023.

Earlier this year, the FCA told banks to improve their treatment of small businesses owners when recovering debts owing to concerns over the impact of the cost of living crisis.

It warned firms about unsuitable credit promotions and almost 4,000 adverts have been amended or withdrawn as a result.",cybersecurity,the guardian

Australian telecom giant Optus must pay the cost of replacing the passports and driver’s licences of millions of customers whose personal information was stolen in one of the country’s biggest data breaches, the government has said.

The theft of data attached to 10 million customer accounts — equivalent to 40 percent of Australia’s population — was the result of an error by Optus so it was up to the Singapore Telecommunications-owned company to pay for the consequences, Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.

“Optus is absolutely responsible for paying for the costs and the implications of this for customers, whether it’s the replacement of a licence, whether it’s the replacement of a passport, or other necessary pieces of ID,” Jones told reporters in Sydney, Australia. He did not give a dollar figure for the costs.

An Optus representative was not immediately available to respond to Jones’s comments. Optus has apologised for the breach and said it would pay for the most-affected customers to receive credit monitoring for a year.

The comments underscore the growing tension between Australia’s government and its second-largest telco as internet companies, banks and government authorities scramble to minimise the risk of being similarly hacked.

The operator of an anonymous account had, in an online chatroom, demanded $1m to refrain from selling the Optus customer data, only to later withdraw the demand and apologise, citing heightened publicity. Optus and law enforcement authorities have not verified the demand, although cybersecurity experts say it was most likely authentic.

The stolen data included passport numbers, driver’s licence numbers, government health insurance numbers, phone numbers and home addresses, prompting commentators and legislators to demand replacement documents.

Other large internet firms meanwhile said they were running extra cybersecurity checks to reduce the risk of a similar breach.

“In light of the recent Optus breach, we have been working closely with our cybersecurity partners and the relevant government agencies to increase our checks,” said a spokesperson for the third-biggest internet provider TPG Telecom, which has about 6 million customers.

A spokesperson for Telstra Corp, Australia’s largest internet provider, said in an email: “We will continue to consider what other steps we may need to put in place as we learn more about the Optus incident.”",cybersecurity,al jazeera english
112,How the CIA failed Iranian spies in its secret war with Tehran - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/usa-spies-iran/mastheads/usa-spies-iran-share.jpg?v=074800290922,29/09/2022,Gholamreza Hosseini got caught spying for the CIA in Iran. The story of how he was burned casts light on an epic U.S. intelligence failure.,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran/,"The spy was minutes from leaving Iran when he was nabbed.

Gholamreza Hosseini was at Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran in late 2010, preparing for a flight to Bangkok. There, the Iranian industrial engineer would meet his Central Intelligence Agency handlers. But before he could pay his exit tax to leave the country, the airport ATM machine rejected his card as invalid. Moments later, a security officer asked to see Hosseini’s passport before escorting him away.

Hosseini said he was brought to an empty VIP lounge and told to sit on a couch that had been turned to face a wall. Left alone for a dizzying few moments and not seeing any security cameras, Hosseini thrust his hand into his trouser pocket, fishing out a memory card full of state secrets that could now get him hanged. He shoved the card into his mouth, chewed it to pieces and swallowed.

Not long after, Ministry of Intelligence agents entered the room and the interrogation began, punctuated by beatings, Hosseini recounted. His denials and the destruction of the data were worthless; they seemed to know everything already. But how?

“These are things I never told anyone in the world,” Hosseini told Reuters. As his mind raced, Hosseini even wondered whether the CIA itself had sold him out.

Rather than betrayal, Hosseini was the victim of CIA negligence, a year-long Reuters investigation into the agency’s handling of its informants found. A faulty CIA covert communications system made it easy for Iranian intelligence to identify and capture him. Jailed for nearly a decade and speaking out for the first time, Hosseini said he never heard from the agency again, even after he was released in 2019.

The CIA declined to comment on Hosseini’s account.

Hosseini’s experience of sloppy handling and abandonment was not unique. In interviews with six Iranian former CIA informants, Reuters found that the agency was careless in other ways amid its intense drive to gather intelligence in Iran, putting in peril those risking their lives to help the United States.

One informant said the CIA instructed him to make his information drops in Turkey at a location the agency knew was under surveillance by Iran. Another man, a former government worker who traveled to Abu Dhabi to seek a U.S. visa, claims a CIA officer there tried unsuccessfully to push him into spying for the United States, leading to his arrest when he returned to Iran.

Such aggressive steps by the CIA sometimes put average Iranians in danger with little prospect of gaining critical intelligence. When these men were caught, the agency provided no assistance to the informants or their families, even years later, the six Iranians said.

James Olson, former chief of CIA counterintelligence, said he was unaware of these specific cases. But he said any unnecessary compromise of sources by the agency would represent both a professional and ethical failure.

“If we’re careless, if we’re reckless and we’ve been penetrated, then shame on us,” Olson said. “If people paid the price of trusting us enough to share information and they paid a penalty, then we have failed morally.”

The men were jailed as part of an aggressive counterintelligence purge by Iran that began in 2009, a campaign partly enabled by a series of CIA blunders, according to news reports and three former U.S. national security officials. Tehran has claimed in state media reports that its mole hunt ultimately netted dozens of CIA informants.

To tell this story, Reuters conducted dozens of hours of interviews with the six Iranians who were convicted of espionage by their government between 2009 and 2015.

To vet their accounts, Reuters interviewed 10 former U.S. intelligence officials with knowledge of Iran operations; reviewed Iranian government records and news reports; and interviewed people who knew the spies.

None of the former or current U.S. officials who spoke with Reuters confirmed or disclosed the identities of any CIA sources.

The CIA declined to comment specifically on Reuters’ findings or on the intelligence agency’s operations in Iran. A spokeswoman said the CIA does its utmost to safeguard people who work with the agency.

Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Mission to the United Nations in New York did not respond to requests for comment.

Hosseini was the only one of the six men Reuters interviewed who said he was assigned the vulnerable messaging tool. But an analysis by two independent cybersecurity specialists found that the now-defunct covert online communication system that Hosseini used – located by Reuters in an internet archive – may have exposed at least 20 other Iranian spies and potentially hundreds of other informants operating in other countries around the world.

This messaging platform, which operated until 2013, was hidden within rudimentary news and hobby websites where spies could go to connect with the CIA. Reuters confirmed its existence with four former U.S. officials.

These failures continue to haunt the agency years later. In a series of internal cables last year, CIA leadership warned that it had lost most of its network of spies in Iran and that sloppy tradecraft continues to endanger the agency’s mission worldwide, the New York Times reported.

“This is a very serious, very serious intelligence goal to penetrate Iran’s nuclear weapons program. You don’t get a much higher priority than that.”

The CIA considers Iran one of its most difficult targets. Ever since Iranian students seized the American embassy in Tehran in 1979, the United States has had no diplomatic presence in the country. CIA officers are instead forced to recruit potential agents outside Iran or through online connections. The thin local presence leaves U.S. intelligence at a disadvantage amid events such as the protests now sweeping Iran over the death of a woman arrested for violating the country’s religious dress code.

Four former intelligence officers interviewed by Reuters said the agency is willing to take bigger risks with sources when it comes to spying on Iran. Curbing the Islamic Republic’s nuclear ambitions has long been a priority in Washington. Tehran insists its nuclear efforts are solely for energy needs.

“This is a very serious, very serious intelligence goal to penetrate Iran’s nuclear weapons program. You don’t get a much higher priority than that,” said James Lawler, a former CIA officer whose focus included weapons of mass destruction and Iran. “So when they do the risk-versus-gain analysis, you’ve got to consider the incredible amount of gain.”

Much has been written about the decades-long shadow war between Iran and Washington, in which both sides have avoided a full military confrontation but have carried out sabotage, assassinations and cyberattacks. But the six informants, interviewed by Reuters for the first time, gave an unprecedented firsthand account of the deadly spy game from the perspective of Iranians who served as CIA foot soldiers.

The six Iranians served prison terms ranging from five to 10 years. Four of them, including Hosseini, stayed in Iran after their release and remain vulnerable to rearrest. Two fled the country and have become stateless refugees.

The six men acknowledged that their CIA handlers never made firm promises to help if they were caught. Still, all had believed that U.S. assistance would one day come.

The espionage busts could pose a challenge to the CIA’s credibility as it seeks to rebuild its spy network in Iran. The country’s state media publicized some of these cases, portraying the agency as feckless and inept.

“It’s a stain on the U.S. government,” Hosseini told Reuters.

CIA spokeswoman Tammy Kupperman Thorp declined to comment on Hosseini, the cases of other captured Iranians or any aspect of how the agency conducts operations. But she said the CIA would never be careless with the lives of those who help the agency.

“CIA takes its obligations to protect the people that work with us very seriously and we know that many do so bravely at great personal risk,” Thorpe said. “The notion that CIA would not work as hard as possible to safeguard them is false.”

An angry volunteer

Hosseini’s leap to espionage came after he had climbed a steep path to a lucrative career. The son of a tailor, he grew up in Tehran and learned lathing and auto mechanics, he said, showing Reuters his trade-school diploma.

Along the way, teachers spotted Hosseini’s intelligence and pushed him to study industrial engineering at the prestigious Amirkabir University of Technology, he said. Hosseini said a professor there put him in touch with a former student with ties to the Iranian government who eventually became his business partner.

Founded in 2001, their engineering company provided services to help businesses optimize energy consumption. The firm at first worked mainly with food and steel factories, Hosseini said, over time scoring contracts with Iran’s energy and defense industries. Hosseini’s account of his professional background is confirmed in corporate records, Iranian media accounts and interviews with six associates.

Hosseini said the company’s success made his family affluent, allowing him to buy a large house, drive imported cars and go on foreign vacations. But in the years after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who served from 2005 to 2013, his business teetered.

Under Ahmadinejad, a hardliner aligned with the country’s theocratic ruler, Iran’s security forces were encouraged to enter the industrial sector, increasing the military’s control over lucrative commercial projects. Established companies often found themselves relegated to the role of subcontractors for these newcomers, Iranian democracy activists said, shrinking their slice of the pie.

Before long, Hosseini said, all of his new contracts had to be routed through some of these firms, forcing him to lay off workers as earnings tumbled.

“They didn’t know how to do the work, but they took the lion’s share of the profits,” said Hosseini, his voice rising as he recounted the events a decade later. “It was as if you were the head of the company, doing everything from 0 to 100, and seeing your salary being given to the most junior employees. I felt raped.”

At the same time, U.S. rhetoric was ramping up against Ahmadinejad. Washington viewed Iran’s president as a dangerous provocateur set on building nuclear weapons. Hosseini began to feel that his life was being destroyed by a corrupt system, and that the government was too erratic to be allowed to obtain nukes. His anger grew.

One day in 2007, he said he opened the CIA public website and clicked the link to contact the agency: “I’m an engineer who has worked at the nuclear site Natanz and I have information,” he wrote in Persian.

Located 200 miles south of Tehran, Natanz is a major facility for uranium enrichment. Archived web records from Hosseini’s engineering firm from 2007 say the company worked on civilian electrical power projects. Reuters could not independently confirm Hosseini’s work at Natanz.

A month later, to his surprise, Hosseini said he received an email back from the CIA.

Part of the team?

Three months after that contact, Hosseini said he flew to Dubai. At the fashionable shopping market Souk Madinat Jumeirah, he looked for a blonde woman holding a black book. He was standing outside the restaurant where they had agreed to meet, when she arrived accompanied by a man.

The restaurant manager guided them to a table secluded in a corner. The woman introduced herself only as Chris, speaking in English while her colleague translated in Persian. As she sipped a glass of champagne, Chris told him they were the people Hosseini had been exchanging messages with over the past few months in Google’s chat platform. She asked Hosseini about his work.

Hosseini said he explained that his company had several years earlier worked on contracts to optimize the flow of electricity at the Natanz site, a complex balancing act to keep centrifuges spinning at precisely the speed needed to enrich uranium. Located in central Iran, Natanz was the heart of Tehran’s nuclear program, which the government said was to produce civilian electricity. But Washington saw Natanz as the core of Iran’s push to acquire nuclear weapons.

Hosseini told Chris his firm was a subcontractor of Kalaye Electric, a company sanctioned in 2007 by the U.S. government over its alleged role in Iran’s nuclear development program. He added that he was seeking additional contracts at other sensitive nuclear and military sites.

Kalaye Electric did not respond to requests for comment.

The next day the three met again, this time at Hosseini’s hotel room overlooking the Gulf. Hosseini unfurled a maze-like map across the desk showing the electricity connected to the Natanz nuclear facility. As he did, Chris’s mouth dropped open wide, Hosseini recalled.

While several years old, Hosseini explained, the map’s notations of the amount of power flowing into the facility provided Washington a baseline to estimate the number of centrifuges currently active. That evidence, he believed, could be used to assess progress toward processing the highly enriched uranium needed for a nuclear weapon.

Hosseini said he didn’t know it at the time, but Natanz was already in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities. That same year, Washington and Israel launched a cyberweapon that would sabotage those very centrifuges, infecting them with a virus that would cripple uranium enrichment at Natanz for years to come, security analysts concluded. Reuters could not determine whether the information provided by Hosseini assisted in that cyber sabotage or other operations.

In subsequent meetings, Hosseini said, the CIA asked him to turn his attention to a broader U.S. goal: identifying possible critical points in Iran’s national electric grid that would cause long and paralyzing blackouts if struck by a missile or saboteurs.

Hosseini said he continued to meet with the CIA in Thailand and Malaysia, in a total of seven meetings over three years. To show evidence of his travels, Hosseini provided photographs of entry stamps in his passport for all but his first two trips, for which he said he had used an older, now discarded, passport.

As the relationship progressed, Hosseini said, Chris was replaced with a male handler who was accompanied by officials described as more senior in the CIA’s Iran operations, as well as technical experts able to keep up with his engineering jargon.

The new role motivated Hosseini, injecting his work with a sense of urgency and purpose. He scrambled to win business that would give him greater access to the intelligence the CIA sought. He said his company secured a contract with a unit of Setad, the sprawling business conglomerate controlled by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to assess the electrical needs of a giant shopping and commercial building project in the north of Tehran.

Representing the supreme leader’s commercial organization, Hosseini pushed the state power company Tavanir for the electricity the sprawling development required, Hosseini said. When Tavanir said it didn’t have enough electricity to meet the project’s giant demands, Hosseini asked the company to provide in-depth analyses of the national grid. This allowed him access to maps showing how electricity flowed to nuclear and military sites and how critical points of the network could be sabotaged.

Setad and Tavanir did not respond to requests for comment.

In August 2008, a year after becoming a spy, Hosseini said he met with an older, broad-shouldered CIA officer and others at a hotel in Dubai.

“We need to expand the commitment,” Hosseini recounted the officer saying. The officer handed Hosseini a piece of paper and asked him to write a promise that he would not provide the information he was sharing to another government, a CIA practice intended to deepen a feeling of commitment from an informant, two former CIA officials said.

Another CIA officer in the meeting then showed Hosseini a covert communications system he could use to reach his handlers: a rudimentary Persian-language soccer news website called Iraniangoals.com. Entering a password into the search bar caused a secret messaging window to pop up, allowing Hosseini to send information and receive instructions from the CIA.

When Hosseini lamented missing his daughter’s third birthday during one of the trips, he said a CIA officer bought him a teddy bear to give to the child. “I felt that I had joined the team,” Hosseini told Reuters.

Secret system breakdown

What Hosseini didn’t know was that the world’s most powerful intelligence agency had given him a tool that likely led to his capture. In 2018, Yahoo News reported that a flawed web-based covert communications system had led to the arrest and execution of dozens of CIA informants in Iran and China.

Reuters located the secret CIA communications site identified by Hosseini, Iraniangoals.com, in an internet archive where it remains publicly available. Reuters then asked two independent cyber analysts – Bill Marczak of University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, and Zach Edwards of Victory Medium – to probe how Iran may have used weaknesses in the CIA’s own technology to unmask Hosseini and other CIA informants. The two are experts on privacy and cybersecurity, with experience analyzing electronic intelligence operations. The effort represents the first independent technical analysis of the intelligence failure.

Marczak and Edwards quickly discovered that the secret messaging window hidden inside Iraniangoals.com could be spotted by simply right-clicking on the page to bring up the website’s coding. This code contained descriptions of secret functions, including the words “message” and “compose” – easily found clues that a messaging capability had been built into the site. The coding for the search bar that triggered the secret messaging software was labeled “password.”

Far from being customized, high-end spycraft, Iraniangoals.com was one of hundreds of websites mass-produced by the CIA to give to its sources, the independent analysts concluded. These rudimentary sites were devoted to topics such as beauty, fitness and entertainment, among them a Star Wars fan page and another for the late American talk show host Johnny Carson.

Each fake website was assigned to only one spy in order to limit exposure of the entire network in case any single agent was captured, two former CIA officials told Reuters.

But the CIA made identifying those sites easy, the independent analysts said. Marczak located more than 350 websites containing the same secret messaging system, all of which have been offline for at least nine years and archived. Edwards confirmed his findings and methodology. Online records they analyzed reveal the hosting space for these front websites was often purchased in bulk by the dozen, often from the same internet providers, on the same server space. The result was that numerical identifiers, or IP addresses, for many of these websites were sequential, much like houses on the same street.

“The CIA really failed with this,” said Marczak, the Citizen Lab researcher. The covert messaging system, he said, “stuck out like a sore thumb.”

In addition, some sites bore strikingly similar names. For example, while Hosseini was communicating with the CIA through Iraniangoals.com, a site named Iraniangoalkicks.com was built for another informant. At least two dozen of the 350-plus sites produced by the CIA appeared to be messaging platforms for Iranian operatives, the analysts found.

All told, these features meant the discovery of a single spy using one of these websites would have allowed Iranian intelligence to uncover additional pages used by other CIA informants. Once those sites were identified, nabbing the operatives using them would have been simple: The Iranians just had to wait and see who showed up. In essence, the CIA used the same row of bushes for its informants worldwide. Any attentive espionage rival would have been able to spot them all, the analysts said.

This vulnerability went far beyond Iran. Written in various languages, the websites appeared to be a conduit for CIA communications with operatives in at least 20 countries, among them China, Brazil, Russia, Thailand and Ghana, the analysts found.

CIA spokeswoman Thorp declined to comment on the system.

Reuters confirmed the nature of the intelligence failure of the CIA’s cookie-cutter websites with three former national security officials.

The agency wasn’t fully aware that this system had been compromised until 2013, after many of its agents began to go missing, according to the former U.S. officials.

Still, the CIA had never considered the network safe enough for its most prized sources. Top-tier informants receive custom-made covert communications tools, built from scratch at agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to seamlessly blend into the life of a spy without drawing attention, three former CIA officers said.

The mass-produced sites, they said, were for sources who were either not considered fully vetted or had limited, albeit potentially valuable, access to state secrets.

“This is for a person viewed as not worth the investment of advanced tradecraft,” one of the former CIA officials said.

And, of course, public-private partnerships are vital for that very reason. Sometimes forgotten in the conversation, however, are the positive business impacts such partnerships can have for individual enterprise organizations themselves.

The desire to forge and strengthen public-private partnerships is clearly present: 93% of cyber decision-makers feel public-private partnerships are vital to national cyber defense, according to a report from RSA Conference and MeriTalk titled “Reimagining Public-Private Partnerships: Minimizing Systematic Risk and Transforming National Cybersecurity Resilience.” Additionally, 91% feel systemic risk is one of the biggest threats to national and economic security.

In mitigating cyber risk, security professionals can help create a safer country for U.S. citizens, allies and countless other stakeholders. But, simply, uniting the public and private sectors in this pursuit also presents unique business opportunities for enterprise organizations.

By strengthening the public-private partnership in cybersecurity, business leaders open the door for not only greater security within their individual organizations, but also a stronger cybersecurity workforce and enablement of greater technological innovation.

Supporting national security reciprocates business value

Cyberthreats pose a hefty price for private enterprises. Globally, cybercrime is expected to cost up to $10.5 trillion annually by 2025; a ransomware attack, on average, costs businesses $84,116 and over 16 days of network downtime.

However, while individual enterprise organizations can and should tend their own vulnerabilities to try and prevent such attacks, the public sector has much more power to dissuade cyberattacks systemically and reduce the overall activity of malicious actors at large.

The combined resources of federal intelligence agencies, as well as organizations such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), offer a global reach for detecting digital risks, tracking active malicious hacking groups and, ultimately, punishing those malicious actors. In doing so, they help prevent further proliferation of cyberattacks such as ransomware from inflating above today’s levels. That translates to money and time saved for businesses.

Of course, ransomware attacks do still remain on the rise, and cybersecurity teams must work to slow that rise beyond what they already have. To do so requires private organizations to play their part in identifying and reporting breaches to assist the public sector in its role as global investigator and legal enforcer.

Building a stronger cybersecurity workforce

Of the responsibilities both the public and private sectors are assigned, public and private cybersecurity decisionmakers agree that it is more the role of government agencies to maintain an educated workforce, according to the “Reimagining Public-Private Partnerships” report.

CISA, for example, publishes educational materials and virtual training modules for federal and non-federal security employees as well as the general public through certification courses, incident response training, a workforce training guide, the Federal Virtual Training Environment and more. The National Security Agency funds CyberSkills2Work, a program offering professional development training to those with military or first-responder experience pursuing a job in the cybersecurity field.

But the dialogue must flow both ways. Private organizations must clearly communicate to federal agencies the educational needs of their security and non-security workforce. In return, federal agencies are better able to collate those needs into far-reaching educational and training materials easily accessible to the private workforce.

This symbiosis serves to lift all boats — a stronger cybersecurity workforce in the private sector ultimately fosters greater security at the national level and provides individual enterprise organizations the benefits listed above — money and time.

Innovation depends on public-private cooperation

Beyond the premise that cybersecurity saves enterprise organizations both time and money, business leaders must also consider the technological innovation that public-private partnerships enable.

Take, for example, the problem of digital identity management. To improve cybersecurity strategies tackling identity management, security teams need access to a large number of data points. Currently, many identity proofing strategies rely on a few major data points, such as government IDs, identity history or biometrics such as facial recognition. Public-private partnerships, however, could enable the sharing of several others, including information from national criminal databases, verification data from public institutions like the IRS, private healthcare records, user device authentication and many more.

The sharing of personal data poses important concerns about individual liberty, and important conversations about the standards and regulations surrounding that sharing must be had. However, government agencies are largely unwilling to tackle the identity proofing problem themselves; so, if such a system is to be built, strong public-private partnerships must be forged. The private sector will ultimately be responsible for the sensitive data that the government is capable of sharing.

The business benefits of public-private partnerships in cybersecurity are straightforward: saving time and money, improving innovation and building a smarter workforce. Partnering with federal agencies to communicate breaches, highlight vulnerabilities and discuss enterprise cybersecurity needs are not sacrifices enterprise organizations must make in the name of national security; rather, they are investments any enterprise organization can make in national security and individual business value.",cybersecurity,securitymagazine.com

Atos Rejects $4.12B Onepoint Bid for Cybersecurity Business

Onepoint Bid Follows Atos Proposal to Extract More Value From Beleaguered Business

Atos has turned down an unsolicited $4.12 billion offer from rival Onepoint to acquire the French conglomerate's $4.8 billion cybersecurity, big data and digital business.

The Paris-based IT services giant says it received a letter of intent Tuesday related to a potential acquisition of Atos' Evidian business by French competitor Onepoint and British private equity fund ICG.

""Following the thorough examination of this preliminary and non-binding mark of interest, and upon the recommendation of its ad hoc committee, the board of directors has convened and unanimously concluded that it is not in the interest of the company and its stakeholders,"" Atos says in a statement Thursday. ""The board of directors has therefore decided not to proceed.""

Onepoint Founder Disappointed by Atos Rejection

Onepoint founder David Layani told Reuters that combining Atos and Onepoint would create a new French technology champion as well as 20,000 jobs in Europe. Layani characterized Onepoint's overtures as ""friendly"" and urged Atos to reconsider.

""We ask the board to take the time to reconsider its position so that we can work together to find the best solution for this merger,"" Layani told Reuters. Atos' announcement of Onepoint's interest sent the company's stock skyrocketing, with Atos closing Thursday up $0.81, or 10.64%, to $8.48 per share. That's the highest Atos' stock has traded since Sept. 20.

Atos has been at the center of internal studies and media reports for months regarding potential deals aimed at extracting more value out of the beleaguered firm. Reuters and Bloomberg said in February that Thales was looking to buy Atos' big data and cybersecurity arm while private equity firms swallowed the company's infrastructure and data management teams and business and platform solutions teams (see: Thales Buys OneWelcome for $101.6M to Enter CIAM Market).

Then in March, Airbus joined Thales in attempting to buy Atos' big data and security business driven by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer's interest in the field of cybersecurity. In June, Atos announced it was exploring spinning off its digital, big data and cybersecurity business - also known as Evidian - into a separate publicly listed company by the end of 2023. The breakup plan seems to have reignited outside interest in Atos' assets.

Security Leads Low-Growth Evidian Business

Revenue for Atos' Evidian business in the first half of 2022 inched up to $2.49 billion, 2% higher than the $2.44 billion the year prior on a constant currency basis, thanks to above-market growth from the company's cybersecurity practice. Evidian has 50,000 employees focused on its $3.43 billion digital transformation business and 9,000 employees serving its $1.38 billion big data and security practice.

Atos says Evidian's cybersecurity practice enjoys high single-digit operating margins and was recognized by Gartner as the top managed security services vendor in the world. Atos' big data and security practice benefited from an aggressive acquisition strategy; the company bought German cryptography specialist Cryptovision in September 2021 and Canadian cybersecurity consulting firm In Fidem in January 2021.

In late 2020, Atos purchased Austrian consulting provider SEC Consult Group and Netherlands-based company Motiv ICT Security, as well as Reston, Virginia-based managed detection and response provider Paladion and Paris-headquartered company digital.security.",cybersecurity,bankinfosecurity.com

The post Twitter Ads Suspended By Top Brands Because Of Child Exploitation appeared first on Search Engine Journal.",https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-ads-suspended-by-top-brands-because-of-child-exploitation/466456/,"At least 30 major advertisers have dropped advertising on Twitter after it was revealed that their ads were displayed alongside tweets soliciting illegal child abuse content.

For example, a promoted tweet by a Scottish Rite Children’s Hospital in Texas was shown alongside toxic tweets related to child sexual abuse.

Advertisers Revolt Against Twitter

Reuters reported that at least 30 large brands have stopped their accounts when it was revealed that their promoted tweets were shown alongside toxic tweets.

A Twitter spokesman was quoted as saying that the research and conclusions by the cyber security firm (which studied tweets and accounts during the first twenty days of September 2022) was not representative of Twitter’s efforts to combat illicit activities.

But the article by Reuters quoted multiple big brand advertisers who were notified that their ads appeared next to the toxic tweets.

Reuters quoted an executive from Cole Haan:

“”We’re horrified,” David Maddocks, brand president at Cole Haan, told Reuters after being notified that the company’s ads appeared alongside such tweets. “Either Twitter is going to fix this, or we’ll fix it by any means we can, which includes not buying Twitter ads.”

Twitter Inability to Accurately Detect Toxic Content

The background to Twitter’s toxic content problem first came to light within an article published by The Verge.

The article recounts a Twitter project to create a platform similar to OnlyFans where users can pay to share sexually explicit content.

Before launching the new service, Twitter tasked a group of employees to test if Twitter could be successful in weeding out harmful content so that the platform didn’t devolve into the sharing of illegal content.

This group of employees were called the Red Team.

Twitter’s project was halted when the Red Team determined that Twitter was incapable of detecting abusive and toxic content.

According to The Verge article:

“What the Red Team discovered derailed the project: Twitter could not safely allow adult creators to sell subscriptions because the company was not — and still is not — effectively policing harmful sexual content on the platform.

“Twitter cannot accurately detect child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity at scale,” the Red Team concluded in April 2022. The company also lacked tools to verify that creators and consumers of adult content were of legal age, the team found.”

So, in the Spring of 2022 Twitter concluded that it was ill-equipped to launch the service and it was shelved.

However, according to the cybersecurity firm Ghost Data, Twitter continued to have difficulties catching rogue users and accounts that were sharing illicit content.

Ghost Data conducted an investigation in September 2022 to discover how widespread the child exploitation problem is on Twitter.

Starting with a group of known child exploitation accounts they mapped out toxic accounts through the linked follower social connections between accounts, eventually identifying over 500 accounts responsible for nearly 5,000 tweets related to illicit child abuse activities.

The researchers noted that these accounts were all in English and that they hadn’t investigated the child abuse Twitter networks in other languages.

They concluded that further research into accounts in non-English accounts may reveal even more users sharing child abuse content.

Researchers Claim Twitter Ineffectual

A startling finding from the report is that Twitter only took action against just over 25% of the accounts that they identified as sharing explicit child abuse content, during the period of research covering the first twenty days of September 2022,

The researchers wrote (PDF):

“We noted that Twiter (sic) suspended less than 30% (27.5%) of the users that publicly shared child pornography links, material, and references in the first 20 days of September. To date, still, more than 400 users are active after « the purge». Many of these users have been active for months.”

The researchers concluded that though they identified many illicit activities and accounts on Twitter, they estimate that this is just a fraction of the true scope of the problem.

They observed that Twitter could do a better job at stopping the toxic activities:

“These results validate the alarming problem already discovered by internal employees and exposed by online media: Twiter (sic) cannot accurately detect child sexual exploitation and its executives are doing almost nothing to address this disaster. We also uncovered evidence that such permissive policies on pornographic content are also inducing users to post non-consensual and rape videos, not to mention minors trying to sell their own nudity or sexual content. …Probably a modest investment and a dedicated team, even applying our own basic techniques, would be suficient (sic) to easily locate and drastically reduce the illicit activities…”

That conclusion reached by the cybersecurity firm Ghost Data seemingly contradicts a statement issued by Twitter and reported by Reuters that Twitter has “zero-tolerance” for these kinds of activities because it’s been months since Twitter’s Red Team identified issues in detecting toxic content.

Reuters also reported that Twitter stated that it is hiring more employees to “implement solutions.”

The Travelers Companies released its 2022 Risk Index results Sept. 26, outlining leading concerns for businesses.

According to the survey of more than 1,000 U.S. business decision makers, nearly 60% of respondents said they worry some or a great deal about cyber threats.

Concerns of broad economic uncertainty, fluctuations in oil and energy costs, the ability to attract and retain talent, and medical cost inflation are among the other top concerns.

“It’s imperative that companies have a plan in place to mitigate any associated operational and financial disruptions.” Travelers’ Tim Francis

“Cyberattacks can shut down a company for a long period of time or even put it out of business, and it’s imperative that companies have a plan in place to mitigate any associated operational and financial disruptions,” Travelers enterprise cyber lead Tim Francis said.

The number of respondents who said their company has suffered a data breach or cyber event increased for the seventh consecutive year.

According to the survey, 26% of respondents said their company had been a cyber victim, and nearly half of those incidents happened within the last 12 months.

“Effective measures that have proven to reduce the risk of becoming a cyber victim are available, but based on these survey results, not enough companies are taking action,” Francis said.

Cybersecurity Measures

Researchers are expressing concern about the overconfidence companies have in navigating the cyber landscape.

More than 90% of respondents said they were confident their company has implemented best practices to mitigate a cyber event, however future responses to questions did not support the statement.

Researchers said 64% of companies said they do not use endpoint detection, 59% said they have not conducted a cyber assessment for vendors, and 53% do not have an incident response plan.

“It’s never too late, and these steps can help businesses avoid a devastating cyber event,” Francis said.

Multifactor authentication, which adds a layer of protection to the sign-in process, is a system few companies have adapted to in recent years.

Microsoft said 99.9% of account compromised attacks are blocked by adding MFA to verify a computer’s identity.

Still, only 52% of respondents said they implemented MFA for remote access, despite 90% of leaders acknowledging that they were familiar with the security measure.",cybersecurity,cbia.com

119,A third of people fall victim to cyberattacks despite training,https://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Shock-horror-50x50.jpg,29/09/2022,"A new study of 3,000 individuals across the US, UK and Canada finds that although 58 percent of tech users that had access to cybersecurity training or education say they are better at recognizing phishing messages and related attacks, 34 percent still fell v…",https://betanews.com/2022/09/29/a-third-of-people-fall-victim-to-cyberattacks-despite-training/,"A new study of 3,000 individuals across the US, UK and Canada finds that although 58 percent of tech users that had access to cybersecurity training or education say they are better at recognizing phishing messages and related attacks, 34 percent still fell victim to at least one type of cybercrime.

The research from The National Cybersecurity Alliance and CybSafe shows that of more than 1,700 incidents of cybercrime that were disclosed by participants, 36 percent were phishing attacks that led to a loss of money or data, while 24 percent report falling victim to identity theft.

""Cybersecurity is no longer a field that can simply be delegated,"" says Lisa Plaggemier, executive director of the National Cybersecurity Alliance. ""In a world where individuals, businesses and organizations of all types are increasingly relying on digital devices to conduct everyday activities, everyone has a role to play in safeguarding data and information. That is why it is so important to consistently evaluate where individuals stand on all issues involved in the cybersecurity landscape so that we can work together and build a stronger cybersecurity community that can stand up to bad actors.""

While 45 percent of respondents state they are 'always connected to the internet', 62 percent of users lack access to cybersecurity knowledge altogether and one-third say they rely on the help of friends and family.

Participants in the US are consistently more likely to have been victims of cybercrime. There are generational differences too, 20 percent of millennials and 18 percent of generation Z had their identity stolen at least once. In comparison, 27 percent of millennials and 34 percent of gen Z had lost money/data due to harmful cyber activity such as phishing. This differs significantly from baby boomers, where 92 percent report never having their identity stolen, and 88 percent had never lost money/data due to cyberattacks.

It seems cybercrimes aren't being reported either, 26 percent of identity theft victims and 31 percent of phishing victims didn’t report their incidents directly to service providers or law enforcement. The reporting numbers around romance scams and cyberbullying are even worse, with 45 percent of romance scam victims and 48 percent of cyberbullying victims saying they didn’t report incidents when they occurred.

Although 78 percent consider staying secure online to be a priority and 66 percent think it is achievable, 46 percent of those polled say they feel frustrated while staying secure online, and 39 percent of users trying to keep safe felt information on how to stay secure online is confusing.

Bad habits persist too, 36 percent of individuals don't always create unique passwords, while only 18 percent have downloaded a password manager. 43 percent of respondents say they had never heard of MFA, and 37 percent don't have automatic software updates enabled. Also only 43 percent of individuals say they back up their data either 'always' or 'very often'.

""We are nearing a point where everyone will be connected to the internet all the time, and unfortunately, that means everyone has the potential to be vulnerable to basic cyberattacks,"" adds Plaggemier. ""Businesses, organizations, schools and even friends and family need to make the adoption of security behaviors a priority. Increasing adoption and eliminating setbacks during the overall process of remaining safe and secure needs to be an all hands on deck approach.""

In the past, this month generally has focused on how end users need to be better, and should avoid clicking on every link. However, this year the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a unit of U.S. Department of Homeland Security, is focusing on four major concepts.

I would like to point out that only one of these concepts truly is in the hands of the end user. I love that IT and senior leadership fully control the last three of these.

Advertisement

CISA’s focus is as follows:

Recognize and report phishing

Enable multi-factor authentication

Use strong passwords

Update your software.

I would take these four a step further. Be sure your employees have a phish button to easily report phishing, so they don’t feel the need to forward suspected malware.

Go ahead and run phishing campaigns for your employees monthly, so they understand how to spot a scam.

Business email compromise has been getting worse the past few years, so be sure that anyone who can wire money or pay bills isn’t using email as the only confirmation method.

Enabling multi-factor authentication, or MFA, is a given at this point. The one-time passcode that involves actively entering the digits as prompted is the standard.

The push authentication is falling out of favor because your end-users will simply hit “accept” even if they are not logging in.

The text message based on SMS is the least favored method as SIM cards can be spoofed. MFA genuinely is one of the best controls you can implement to increase security, and something is better than nothing.

Strong passwords -- pass phrases -- long have been important, but the most central concept to reiterate is that entropy comes from length. Yes, upwards of 12 to 16 characters.

Stop with the complexity song and dance as that makes your end-users reuse or iterate their passwords. I’ve talked about it before, but using a password vault is the best way to discourage your end-users from reusing passwords.

Another fantastic control to implement is to run a “dictionary check” on passwords at the moment of creation. When your users create a password that contains a known bad password from a compromised list -- such as rockyou -- the system asks them to use something better.

You even can add your own list of prohibited stings, such as your company name.

Consider the predictability of the password of AcmeFall22! The user picks the company name to separate it from their private accounts, then they use the season because you make them change it every 90 days, then they use the year because you force them to use a number, and to fulfill the character requirement they slap on an exclamation point.

This pattern is widely known by hackers, and by most in the security community. It looks like a strong password because it fulfills the security requirements.

It is not.

Updating your software also is important, and that includes your operating systems, and third-party software outside of Windows. Hardening includes ports and protocols, but it all stems from not doing updates in a timely manner.

This bullet point is difficult to get right if you have technical debt or are beholden to legacy software, but risk remains the same. Patches, updates and known vulnerabilities must be addressed in a timely manner.

It seems like not a day goes by where we don’t hear about a local government cyberattack. Indeed, from 911 call centers to public schools, cyberattacks on local governments are as common as they are devastating.

Just how often do threat actors attack local governments? A survey of 14 mainly larger US local governments found that just over half of respondents said they suffer attacks constantly, more than a quarter said hourly, and 14.3% said daily.

Local governments continue to be a common cyberattack target for two big reasons. The first is that they handle troves of sensitive data, especially personally identifiable information (PII), and the second is that they operate on shoestring budgets with little to no cybersecurity staff or leadership buy-in.

Now, factor in these two reasons with the sheer number of local governments out there in the United States—90,075 units—and you have a huge, vulnerable, and valuable target. Sounds like easy pickings for attackers, but it doesn’t have to be.

With a few best practices, local governments can improve their cybersecurity posture and make it less likely that threat actors attack their systems. We’ll break down five best practices for local government cybersecurity in this post.

Table of Contents

1. Take cybersecurity assessments to find and address weaknesses

Cybersecurity consultants and the professional literature agree: You should adopt cybersecurity policies such as the NIST Framework to help prevent and respond to attacks. And a key part of building out any cybersecurity policy for your local government is to develop an organizational understanding of risk to systems, people, data, and so on.

There are tons of free cybersecurity assessments for Federal, State, Local, Tribal and Territorial (SLTT) governments that you can take to get started. After performing the assessments, you can compare your results to the criteria of NIST to identify gaps, as well as deficiencies to be improved.

Cyber Infrastructure Survey (CIS): A free assessment of essential cybersecurity practices in-place for critical services. Also conducted by the DHS. Cyber Resilience Review (CRR): The CRR assessment evaluates your organization’s operational resilience and cybersecurity practices. Conducted free of charge by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Phishing Campaign Assessment (PCA): Evaluates an organization’s susceptibility and reaction to phishing emails. Conducted free of charge by the National Cybersecurity Assessments and Technical Services (NCATS) team. Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET®): A stand-alone desktop application that guides asset owners evaluate their cybersecurity posture against recognized standards. Also delivered free of charge by the NCATS team. Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (RVA) One-on-one engagement to give organizations an actionable risk analysis report containing remediation recommendations prioritized by severity and risk.

2. Adopt the fundamentals

The unfortunate reality is that an inability to pay competitive salaries, insufficient number of staff, and lack of funds are big barriers to local government cybersecurity. However, there’s still plenty of important cybersecurity fundamentals that local governments should try to adopt to the fullest extent possible.

Take cyber insurance, for example. Cyber insurance can prevent local governments from having to pay huge out of pocket costs in the event that they’re hit with a cyberattack. Baltimore learned this the hard way.

(An important caveat here is that cyber insurance is becoming increasingly expensive: check out our article on 4 ways to save money on cyber insurance).

Cybersecurity best practices don’t just help you stay safe—they can also make you eligible for grant funding. In particular, local governments looking to be eligible for the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program must include these best practices in their cybersecurity plan:

In addition, only 23% of local governments have adopted the .gov domain, meaning a majority of local governments are missing out on one of the simplest ways to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. Sponsored by CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the .gov domain comes with several key security benefits:

MFA is enforced on all accounts in the .gov registrar, and user accounts cannot use passwords that have been found in known data breaches.

It ‘preloads’ all new domains, which lets web browsers know to always use HTTPS to connect with any website on that domain.

CISA, GSA, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) help monitor for issues in the namespace

To obtain a .gov domain or to learn more, check out some of the resources below.

3. Partner up!

Local governments may be resource-constrained, but the good news is that they don’t have to face cybersecurity alone. State governments, together with Federal, university, and even nonprofit partners, can be strong allies to local government cybersecurity.

Federal partners: Local governments are encouraged to report cyber incidents to a federal entity so they can receive relevant asset response, threat response, and threat intelligence services. Partnering with your local fusion center is a good idea as well.

State partners : The level of state-local cybersecurity support will vary by state, but can include assessments, exercises, and consulting services. In Michigan’s Cyber Partners Program, for example, local communities receive services from a CISO-level consultant.

University partners : Partnering with universities can help local governments get access to talent, technological insights, even real-time network security monitoring.

Nonprofit partners: Local governments involved with the Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) get free resources for cyber threat prevention, protection, response, and recovery.

4. Build a playbook for ransomware response and recovery

For local governments especially, a ransomware attack is a matter of ‘when’ and not ‘if’. However, they might not have the budget or staff to implement and use anti-ransomware solutions such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR).

Fortunately, you don’t need any fancy technology to start building a solid ransomware response and recovery plan. NIST recommends that organizations follow these steps to accelerate their recovery, among others:

Develop an incident recovery plan: Establish a plan that has a Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) with clearly identified roles, responsibilities, and contacts ahead of time, then regularly exercise that plan.

Data backup and restoration strategy: Backups are a prime target for attackers, so keep multiple copies of your data, and make sure at least one of them is online.

Know who you’re going to contact: Maintain an up-to-date list of internal and external stakeholders to contact in the event of an attack, which may include senior management, PR, your legal team, insurance providers, vendors, and law enforcement.

In our Ransomware Emergency Kit, you'll find more resources your local government needs to understand threats, prevent attacks, and defend against cybercriminals.

5. Consider outsourcing

Though CISOs might be wary about having their data handled by an outside organization, many local governments rely on vendors and managed service providers (MSPs) to provide some or all of their cybersecurity operations.

A 2020 survey of 165 municipalities found 50.9% outsourced some of their cybersecurity functions, with almost 60% citing “Lack of local skilled professionals” as a reason for outsourcing. Some of functions commonly outsourced are:

“By working with a trusted partner or service provider, local governments can fast track to get their security stack up to par,” said David Pier, Team Lead, Corporate Solutions Engineering at Malwarebytes. “Many frameworks and security plans can take upwards of multiple years to successfully implement and audit for certification. If they can pass this work along to their partners, it circumvents the need for them to commit to a lengthy process in addition to the complexity of implementation.”

Read “Risk Considerations for Managed Service Provider Customers” from CISA for more information for local governments choosing an MSP.

Enhancing local government cybersecurity

A lack of funding and staff makes local government cybersecurity tough, period.

However, if every local government implemented these five best cybersecurity practices today, they could dramatically lessen the likelihood and fallout of an attack—and increase eligibility for the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program while they're at it.

It’s not clear who’s behind this network of fake CISOs or what their intentions may be. But the fabricated LinkedIn identities are confusing search engine results for CISO roles at major companies, and they are being indexed as gospel by various downstream data-scraping sources.

If one searches LinkedIn for the CISO of the energy giant Chevron, one might find the profile for a Victor Sites, who says he’s from Westerville, Ohio and is a graduate of Texas A&M University.

Of course, Sites is not the real CISO of Chevron. That role is currently occupied by Christopher Lukas of Danville, Calif. If you were confused at this point, you might ask Google who it thinks is the current Chief Information Security Officer of Chevron. When KrebsOnSecurity did that earlier this morning, the fake CISO profile was the very first search result returned (followed by the LinkedIn profile for the real Chevron CISO).

Helpfully, LinkedIn seems to be able to detect something in common about all these fake CISO profiles, because it suggested I view a number of them in the “People Also Viewed” column seen in the image above. There are two fake CISO profiles suggested there, including one for a Maryann Robles, who claims to be the CISO of another energy giant — ExxonMobil.

Maryann’s profile says she’s from Tupelo, Miss., and includes this detail about how she became a self-described “old-school geek.”

“Since playing Tradewars on my Tandy 1000 with a 300 baud modem in the early ’90s, I’ve had a lifelong passion for technology, which I’ve carried with me as Deputy CISO of the world’s largest health plan,” her profile reads.

However, this description appears to have been lifted from the profile for the real CISO at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in Baltimore, Md.

Interestingly, Maryann’s LinkedIn profile was accepted as truth by Cybercrime Magazine’s CISO 500 listing, which claims to maintain a list of the current CISOs at America’s largest companies:

Rich Mason, the former CISO at Fortune 500 firm Honeywell, began warning his colleagues on LinkedIn about the phony profiles earlier this week.

“It’s interesting the downstream sources that repeat LinkedIn bogus content as truth,” Mason said. “This is dangerous, Apollo.io, Signalhire, and Cybersecurity Ventures.”

Google wasn’t fooled by the phony LinkedIn profile for Jennie Biller, who claims to be CISO at biotechnology giant Biogen (the real Biogen CISO is Russell Koste). But Biller’s profile is worth mentioning because it shows how some of these phony profiles appear to be quite hastily assembled. Case in point: Biller’s name and profile photo suggest she is female, however the “About” description of her accomplishments uses male pronouns. Also, it might help that Jennie only has 18 connections on LinkedIn.

Again, we don’t know much about who or what is behind these profiles, but in August the security firm Mandiant (recently acquired by Google) told Bloomberg that hackers working for the North Korean government have been copying resumes and profiles from leading job listing platforms LinkedIn and Indeed, as part of an elaborate scheme to land jobs at cryptocurrency firms.

None of the profiles listed here responded to requests for comment (or to become a connection).

In a statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity, LinkedIn said its teams were actively working to take these fake accounts down.

“We do have strong human and automated systems in place, and we’re continually improving, as fake account activity becomes more sophisticated,” the statement reads. “In our transparency report we share how our teams plus automated systems are stopping the vast majority of fraudulent activity we detect in our community – around 96% of fake accounts and around 99.1% of spam and scam.”

LinkedIn could take one simple step that would make it far easier for people to make informed decisions about whether to trust a given profile: Add a “created on” date for every profile. Twitter does this, and it’s enormously helpful for filtering out a great deal of noise and unwanted communications.

The former CISO Mason said LinkedIn also could experiment with offering something akin to Twitter’s verified mark to users who chose to validate that they can respond to email at the domain associated with their stated current employer.

“If I saw that a LinkedIn profile had been domain-validated, then my confidence in that profile would go way up,” Mason said, noting that many of the fake profiles had hundreds of followers, including dozens of real CISOs. Maryann’s profile grew by a hundred connections in just the past few days, he said.

“If we have CISOs that are falling for this, what hopes do the masses have?” Mason said.

Mason said LinkedIn also needs a more streamlined process for allowing employers to remove phony employee accounts. He recently tried to get a phony profile removed from LinkedIn for someone who falsely claimed to have worked for his company.

“I shot a note to LinkedIn and said please remove this, and they said, well, we have to contact that person and arbitrate this,” he said. “They gave the guy two weeks and he didn’t respond, so they took it down. But that doesn’t scale, and there needs to be a mechanism where an employer can contact LinkedIn and have these fake profiles taken down in less than two weeks.”",cybersecurity,krebs on security

""The messages are vile and are not in line with the content and ethos of Fast Company."" Apple also tweeted about the incident, informing users that it immediately acted to disable the outlet on its platform.

An incredibly offensive alert was sent by Fast Company, which has been hacked. Apple News has disabled their channel. — Apple News (@AppleNews) September 28, 2022

Reports suggest the original messages were signed off by a party named ""Thrax."" According to screenshots of a later on-site post that was shared over Twitter, the hacker detailed some of the alleged vulnerabilities that allowed them to breach the website. We're not sure when the website will be back, but Fast Company seems to be hard at work on an investigation to figure out what happened. The company was quick to acquire the services of a cybersecurity firm to help, according to its statement, which will hopefully result in new measures to prevent future abuse.

This, of course, isn't the first time we've seen hackers manage to take control over a well-known internet destination. In July 2020, Twitter fell victim to a cybersecurity breach that resulted in several accounts tweeting a bitcoin wallet address used by the hackers. The accounts all belonged to high-profile companies and individuals, including Apple and Elon Musk.

CHELTENHAM, England, Sept. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ten Eleven Ventures , the original venture capital firm dedicated to global, stage-agnostic cybersecurity investing, today formally announced their newest General Partner, longtime respected security industry leader and entrepreneur Dave Palmer, has officially opened the European office of Ten Eleven Ventures, located in Cheltenham, United Kingdom. As General Partner at Ten Eleven Ventures, Palmer's new role will include meeting, mentoring, and supporting innovators of new cyber technologies throughout the UK and Europe.

Ten Eleven Ventures’ newest General Partner, Dave Palmer, near Ten Eleven’s new office in Cheltenham

While Ten Eleven has invested globally since its founding, the new office is the firm's first outside of the United States. The cybersecurity industry continues to grow across Europe, especially in the UK where the sector's revenue has grown to more than £10 billion annually. 2021 was also a record year for cyber security investment, with £1.4 billion raised by firms across the UK. The firm believes the whole of Europe is ripe for an explosion in cybersecurity innovation and the development of new cybersecurity companies. It is opening a UK office to increase its access and insight into a region where it plans to continue to invest at the seed through growth stages.

Other UK and European cybersecurity start-ups that have already received funding from Ten Eleven include Noetic Cyber ( 2022 SINET 16 winner ), Cado Security ( 2022 RSA Innovation Sandbox finalist ), Vaultree , Revelock (acquired by Feedzai , also a Ten Eleven company), Digital Shadows (recently acquired by Reliaquest , also a Ten Eleven company), and Darktrace (which went public on the London Stock Exchange in 2021). Several other Ten Eleven-backed, US-based companies that have expanded into Europe include KnowBe4 (which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021), NetSPI , Sonrai Security , and Immuta . Ten Eleven's Advisory Board includes UK-based members Grace Cassy, co-founder of CyLon, a London-based investor and supporter of early-stage security start-ups, and Richard Horne, a partner with PwC's London cyber practice. Through its increased presence, growing network and new office, Ten Eleven continues to actively source and nurture new venture investments at all stages in the UK and Europe.

Story continues

Before joining Ten Eleven as General Partner, Palmer was a founder and Chief Product Officer at Darktrace, a global leader in cyber security artificial intelligence. He has also acted as an advisor to cyber security start-ups and growth-stage companies from the UK Government's Cyber Security Accelerator and CyLon. In addition, he has over a decade of experience in government intelligence operations, including at UK intelligence agencies GCHQ and MI5. Palmer's prior experience as a technical leader, founder, and operator means he has seen the UK cybersecurity ecosystem evolve from a predominantly service industry to one that now also includes a burgeoning scene of founders building the next generation of cybersecurity platforms. Dave has joined Darktrace's Advisory Council, where he will continue to advise the organization on key industry trends.

""Ten Eleven and Darktrace are both industry disruptors dedicated to shaping the future of cybersecurity,"" said founder and managing partner of Ten Eleven, Alex Doll. ""We have known Dave since 2016, when Ten Eleven first invested in Darktrace, and have always deeply appreciated the technical expertise and product wisdom he brought to the company. We know that after the nine years he spent helping to build Darktrace, in addition to the significant work he has done for the UK government, Dave will be a highly valued resource to future cybersecurity entrepreneurs. Dave will work with early and growth stage entrepreneurs across Europe to help them develop products and markets, grow internationally, and build companies that can excel internationally, as Darktrace has done. His support will come not only with funding but with guidance and expertise gained through his hands-on experience of helping to build Darktrace from the ground up. Dave's character, founder experience, and cybersecurity skills make him a perfect addition to our close-knit team.""

""Through Darktrace, I've been deeply fortunate to have had the experience of helping to found a start-up, developing an innovative new cyber technology, scaling our operations internationally, and expanding our offerings to multiple new product lines. Along with my co-founders, I helped build Darktrace from the ground up, to IPO and then continued to lead as the Chief Product Officer of a public company. These were all deeply valuable experiences and ones that I am looking forward to sharing with other innovators,"" said Palmer. ""It was a pleasure to work with Ten Eleven as an investor in Darktrace, and I am thrilled to now be joining them to open a UK office. I see this move as a natural progression in my mission to advance the cybersecurity space in the UK, Europe, and worldwide.""

""Dave played a pivotal role in growing Darktrace into the innovative, world-class cyber security company that it is today. I am thrilled that Dave will remain in the Darktrace family through his role on our Advisory Council,"" said CEO of Darktrace, Poppy Gustafsson. ""Dave's experience of helping to scale Darktrace from start-up to IPO will prove invaluable to Ten Eleven and the entrepreneurial businesses it is investing in. We wish him every success in this new endeavour.""

In the latest post of our Community Voices blog series, Microsoft Security Senior Product Marketing Manager Brooke Lynn Weenig talks with Alissa “Dr. Jay” Abdullah, Ph.D., Deputy Chief Security Officer of Mastercard and former Deputy Chief Information Officer in the Executive Office of the President for the Obama Administration. The thoughts below reflect Alissa’s views, not the views of Microsoft, and are not legal advice. In this blog post, Alissa talks about the role data and identity play in the future of cybersecurity.

Brooke: How did you get into cybersecurity?

Alissa: I started out as a radio DJ while I was an undergraduate at Savannah State University. Originally, I was a mass communications major, but my university English professor urged me to move away from that. At the same time, my mathematics professor was urging me to change my major to math. Ultimately, I decided to major in math.

After graduation, I used my mathematics degree to work my way into information technology and began a career within the Department of Defense. As a certified Cryptologic Engineer, I toggled between information technology and information assurance—both cyber-adjacent areas. Over the course of my career, I have sought out roles that let me grow in both areas. This approach took me across the private sector before I was eventually appointed by President Barack Obama to help lead White House technology (which included cybersecurity) in 2012. It was while I served in the White House that my passion for—and appreciation of—cybersecurity really took off.

Brooke: Why is comprehensive identity and access management (IAM) necessary within an organization’s cybersecurity approach?

Alissa: If you think about the future of cybersecurity, it is an amalgamation of many different aspects. One of those is the future of data.

The relevance of data is built on many different aspects—specifically calling out the importance of identity tied to the data, whether that is a human identity, machine identity, or something else. So, as we talk about where we are now with cybersecurity and where we will be in the future, it greatly hinges on IAM. It hinges on the identity tied to data and tied to systems. It hinges on getting access to what you need, when you need it, and how you need it without going further than that.

The strategy of the future contains boundaries that give you what you need while limiting yourself to include only those things. That way, you shrink the threat landscape in anticipation of a bad day. A strong IAM strategy provides just that. It protects aspects of the various identities while allowing for the appropriate amount of access. The future of cybersecurity will hinge on how well we handle identities and access.

Brooke: What are the most common access security gaps within organizations?

Alissa: I sum up the gap with one word—culture. That is the most common gap. What I mean by that is we are used to the idea of having carte blanche access. The change to a Zero Trust mindset is a paradigm shift that can often cause angst in many environments. Some developers or data owners are anxious that the limitations provided in a Zero Trust environment will impact innovation. When done right, it enhances innovation and pushes security to the edge.

Brooke: Compromised passwords are the number one way in for attackers. What should organizations do to address this?

Alissa: The easiest solution for me to recommend is a passwordless environment, but to be honest, no solution is attack-proof on its own. We have heard attacks that include multifactor authentication fatigue and those where the adversary is paying employees to provide multifactor authentication approvals to compromised accounts. The best step for most environments is to move to passwordless, but the work does not stop there. A security-aware culture will be an additional line of defense.

Brooke: President Biden’s 2021 Executive Order on Cybersecurity mandated a Zero Trust approach for all government agencies. What can private organizations learn from the Executive Order?

Alissa: The Executive Order really formalized the work that organizations in both the public and private sectors were doing together through strong partnerships and a collaborative working relationship. We have had many conversations around Zero Trust and its implementation together and separately. We can continue with the good foundation started and expand the learnings between the different environments.

Brooke: Microsoft recently released multicloud Microsoft Entra Permissions Management, based on the Cloud Knox acquisition, within the Microsoft Entra product family, which also includes Microsoft Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Entra Verified ID. Why is permissions management important as part of a strong identity strategy?

Alissa: Let us start with two assumptions:

First, a lot of the future will be based on identities. If you start to decouple identity information from the data, the data becomes less relevant. Second, the future relies heavily on cloud-based architectures. These are not absolutes but are statements that describe the future as we know it today.

If we take both of those as great starting points, then you easily move into the need to manage entitlements and permissions in the cloud environments. We cannot be myopic in our view of identities. Just as we seamlessly want to manage user identities, those entitlements in the cloud are equally important and we should not have to chase down entitlements in every cloud platform. An integrated model helps with visibility, automation, and policy management.

Brooke: What basic elements of security should organizations expect to be built into any cloud platform for a strong security foundation?

Alissa: Cloud platforms have many security elements ready to customize that will provide the level of security that you need for your data. Some examples that I can think of are data encryption, intrusion detection with event logging, and application security protections, just to name a few.

It is important to think of security protections in layers—data, application, and infrastructure. Cloud platforms have options that allow you to protect each layer and negotiate the level of security for your situation with the cloud service provider.

Brooke: What are three things an organization should absolutely make sure they have implemented for a strong digital identity framework?

Alissa: First, a strong digital identity framework should include many layers, but those layers cannot be seen as complexities. The layers should help provide clarity on the security state of digital identities within an environment.

Second, solutions have to be adopted and executed in a timely way so that the biggest benefit is reached. Solutions like multifactor authentication and passwordless not only enhance your digital identity framework but also enhance your user experience.

Third, the identity framework needs to be comprehensive. There are so many different types of identities, and the framework needs to include the management and security of all identities—including employee, machine, service, and cloud. If you miss including one area, you could potentially open that area up to the adversary.

Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard's podcast and reporting on the dark underbelly of the internet. See More →

The hacker who breached news website Fast Company and used that access to push an offensive Apple News push alert to a massive number of users says they performed the hack to “embarrass” Fast Company.

The hacker, who goes by the handle thrax, also said that the hack itself was opportunistic and they didn’t specifically target Fast Company, at least initially, highlighting something that is sometimes missed in cybersecurity discussions: often, it does not entirely matter who you are, but if you are vulnerable, a hacker may exploit those weaknesses simply because they can.

“It's not every day that you get to click a button and send tens of thousands of people a notification straight to their phone. I don't know the statistic for this, but it was lots given what we've seen,” thrax told Motherboard in a direct message on a data trading website where they have an account.

Do you know about any other hacks? We'd love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.

On Tuesday, Fast Company sent an Apple News push notification that said “[racial slur] tongue my anus. Thrax was here.” Many articles on the Fast Company website were also changed to display a similar message, according to archives of the defacement on the Wayback Machine. For days after the hijacking, the Fast Company website has remained offline, with visitors unable to view its articles, a highly unusual scene even compared to earlier examples of defacements of news websites. At the time of writing, Fast Company has replaced its landing page with a statement which directs visitors to the company’s social media channels.

“The messages are vile and are not in line with the content and ethos of Fast Company. Tuesday's breach follows an apparently related event that occurred Sunday afternoon on FastCompany.com, when an unknown actor (or actors) posted similar language on the site's home page and other pages. Fast Company regrets that such abhorrent language appeared on our platforms and in Apple News, and we apologize to anyone who saw it before it was taken down,” that statement reads.

Thrax told Motherboard that they were “not surprised Fast Company’s website is still offline.” They said the hack started when they were browsing a website that displayed sites that had exposed credentials in public facing web pages. Those results included Fast Company and a range of other sites, thrax said. On the data trading platform, thrax has released an alleged set of more than 6,700 records that they say in an accompanying post is taken from Fast Company’s WordPress database, including password hashes for some users.

“I want to add that this was completely preventable; anyone could have done it and that anyone just ended up being me. It wasn't a sophisticated cyber attack from a foreign state and it didn't require ‘specialist skills’,” thrax added.

On the push notification specifically, thrax said “It could have been a hoax threat-to-life event, a hoax nuclear fallout, the hoax death of President Biden, a crypto scam or anything else which could have had the potential to shift markets. Instead, I chose to embarrass Fast Company.”",cybersecurity,vice news
131,Leveraging the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program,https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/09/Funding.jpg,29/09/2022,Your state or local government may be eligible for a share of over $1 Billion in Federal funding to defend against growing cyber threats. Learn how.,https://blogs.cisco.com/government/leveraging-the-state-and-local-cybersecurity-grant-program,"While state and local governments are prime candidates for cyberattacks, the new State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP), through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, aims to help mitigate such threats.

Historically, funding can prove to be a key hinderance in governments taking proactive steps to protect themselves. In turn, the new SLCGP grant is an innovative and first-of-its-kind grant program to help reduce cyber risk and build resilience to the dynamic and evolving cybersecurity threat environment.

How the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program works

In the critical first year of the program rolling out, around $200M of the overall $1B in funding will be available to states. All states and territories are eligible, but 80% of the funds must be “passed on” to local entities from the state level. State and territory applications are due by mid-November 2022 for the first year, with the funding supporting the completion of the state’s Cybersecurity Plan, their state/local capabilities assessment, and, eventually, individual state and local project plans.

Each state will have an integral Cybersecurity Planning Committee, which will prove to be the gatekeeper of funding throughout the multi-year funding process. While the committees will vary state by state, it’s likely that the state CIO, CISO, public health and education leaders, and those with security/IT expertise will be integrated into the group.

States should be working through their lists of requirements for what they believe each local entity requesting funding should have at a minimum. An example of this could be something like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and working to support local entities who can’t check that box. Alternatively, some states could use the first-year funds to plan, with technology installations to follow in subsequent years.

How Cisco can help

Cisco Secure is a seamless way to help check the box on required elements of the Cybersecurity Plan, such as implementing multi-factor authentication and enhanced logging, data encryption, end use of unsupported or EOL internet accessible software and hardware, prohibiting use of known/fixed/default passwords and credentials, ensuring backup ability, and migration to the .gov internet domain.

With many details still outstanding, this funding comes at a critical time to support the security posture of state and local government’s vast networks. The Cisco Public Funding Office is here to help government agencies understand, digest, and approach funding such as the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, in addition to the many intricate funding programs that evolved both in and out of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. Remember, we’re here to help! Please reach out to your Cisco Account Manager or Public Funding Advisor to discuss further.

If you entered the workforce in the last 5-6 years, there’s a good chance you were given a Mac on your first day and you likely don’t remember a world where the only Macs that an organization generally had was in the graphic design department.

These users were on an island by themselves – often having to become their own IT department to troubleshoot issues. The IT department didn’t manage software updates or system settings. They’d buy the Mac, give it to the employee and probably would never see the device again.

The world has changed, and not just because Macs have become more common in the enterprise (which they have), but cybersecurity is now front and center. Security is no longer a technical problem. It’s now a board-level problem, and that’s led every endpoint to a situation where IT teams no longer can rely on trust to make sure their devices are secure – they must verify.

The Mac’s built-in protection

The Mac has historically been the type of platform that didn’t get traditional anti-virus tools as Windows did. Apple has done an excellent job of hardening the core of macOS while also putting in place tools to deal with threats when they occur.

Through tools like the App Store, Notarization and Gatekeeper, Apple makes it harder for malicious agents to create and distribute Mac malware without the Mac user being clearly informed of the risks associated with installing applications that would bypass those protections.

The next layer of defense is to help ensure that if a known malware can find its way through the first prevention layer, it will be identified and blocked, stopping the spread before further damage can occur. This includes both XProtect and MRT.

These protections can offer a good level of security for the traditional consumer user. But what about for business?

Macs used at work normally have access to very critical and sensitive information, from large volumes of personal identifiable information of customers, to confidential business data, and even source code of hundreds of thousands of applications that will be installed in millions of devices around the world.

For these reasons, the security for Macs used at work needs reach a new level of defense.

Companies don’t only need stronger and more specialized security tools, but also to be able to remotely validate, in real time, that all devices are protected with a centralized solution that would make this information readily available internally for internal reviews, security certifications and external audits.

How can enterprise IT managers and CISOs secure their Macs?

Building upon the secure foundation that Apple has built, there are a handful of additional technologies that can – and should – be deployed to add achieve the appropriate level of security expected from companies while ensuring compliance (with reporting). The first is a next-generation antivirus.

Apple-specific Next-Generation Antivirus

Plain and simple: All Macs used for business purposes should be running a next-generation antivirus software.

While the built-in tools such XProtect will offer protection against some well-known malware, the majority of attacks targeting companies today leverage new or updated malware. With a good portion of them being totally unknown before identified as part of a security incident.

Next-generation antivirus solutions go beyond known file-based malware signatures, and are prepared to efficiently identify unknown malware and threats by leveraging sophisticated engines based on artificial intelligence and machine learning to execute predictive analysis.

But not just any next-generation antivirus will be effective on Macs. macOS is materially different than Windows and so are the threats and methods used by malicious agents. Solutions that “also work on Macs” are normally adapting their original Windows solution to Macs by looking for common elements between both. This allows providers to also generate some extra revenue from Macs by exploring their market recognition as efficient in protecting Windows.

However, in several cases, these solutions do not add much on top of what macOS is already doing around malware prevention.

So, when selecting a next-generation antivirus solution for Macs, the IT or security teams should ask one simple question: is that provider specialized on Macs and is the solution provided specially crafted to protect Macs? If the answer is no, they should look for another solution provided by an Apple-specific security provider.

macOS Hardening and Compliance

A macOS Hardening & Compliance solution can provide a complete repository of security controls to help you better protect your macOS fleet, including remote and hybrid work environments where there is no corporate firewall at the incoming network connection.

A macOS hardening & compliance solution allows you to integrate your existing security controls into the deployment process, so that you can deploy a secure and compliant macOS environment in minutes—and then easily repeat it across your entire fleet as new machines are introduced.

Hardening should be accompanied by means to report and maintain compliance with regulations. When considering the tools your business will use, look for these features:

Preconfigured security configurations library

24/7 monitoring

Mapping for CIS, NIST, SOC2, and PCI

Specialized options for each supported macOS version

Compliance status reporting

Automatic remediation for devices out of compliance

Easy to create any custom compliance rules

Privilege management

In today’s complex IT environment, companies must take a new approach to their macOS privileged access management. Attackers look for ways to spread malware after exploiting a vulnerability and persistence is one of the first things they try.

So it’s important that your company has measures in place for disabling the option for all users to run as an admin 24/7.

There needs to be a solution that only gives admin-level privileges when needed. An admin on-demand tool is an automated solution that eliminates the time-consuming process of managing and securing privileged accounts.

Employees can be given administrator privileges for a particular task and period of time. Once the employee completes the task and no longer needs privileged access, they are immediately removed from admin level permissions, and a detailed log is generated for IT to use in analysis.

Taking this approach allows IT teams to focus on what really matters, saving money and strengthening the business’s security profile.

Online Security

Online protection in a remote environment can be challenging.

While the number of malware distribution websites, phishing attacks, spam and user online tracking grows exponentially, the new hybrid work environment has eliminated the traditional corporate network layer used in the past to create some protection against these threats.

For this reason, a Mac-specialized solution for online security and privacy has become a must have for all companies using Macs at work. A Mac-specialized solution for online security and privacy will enforce controls and protection against online threats directly on each Mac.

Because of this, employees will be protected wherever they work, whether it be from home, in airports, hotels and coffee shops.

Finally, methods to ensure privacy should be another requirement for advanced online security, because no company wants to give hotels, coffee shops of even Internet Service Providers access to all the online activity of their employees. Methods like encrypted DNS offer strong protection and are readily available through the top Mac-specialized solutions for online security and privacy.

One solution to solve all your macOS security needs

Based on the different solutions described above, companies might expect needing several different vendors to achieve the desired level of security for their Macs. While this may seem like a viable option, in reality it is not ideal.

The good news is that there are better options for protecting Macs used at work.

Software providers that focus on solutions for managing and protecting Apple devices used at work can use their deep knowledge of Apple’s operating systems and specialization to integrate all the features needed to manage and protect Apple devices used at work via a single Apple platform.

This approach is known as Apple Unified Platform.

Mosyle, a leader on modern Apple endpoint solutions is the reference on Apple Unified Platform through its product called Mosyle Fuse.

Mosyle Fuse integrates a complete and automated apple device management, a Mac-specific next-generation antivirus, Mac-specific hardening and compliance, Mac-specific privilege management, Mac identity management, Apple-specific application and patch management with a complete library of fully automated apps not available on the App Store, and an encrypted online privacy & security solution.

By unifying all solutions on a single platform Mosyle not only simplifies the management and protection of Apple devices used at work, but Mosyle Fuse also reaches a level of efficiency and integration that is impossible to be achieved by independent solutions.

Finally, the cost benefits of an Apple Unified Platform such as Mosyle Fuse is also material. Considering the average cost of each individual solution that should be part of the IT software stack for Macs, we estimate that by adopting an Apple Unified Platform enterprises can generate savings of more than 70%. Even for small fleets, it’s a relevant amount.

So, if you have Macs used by employees at work you should try a unified Apple solution, such as Mosyle Fuse, since they can bring amazing benefits for you and your company.

 Related stories:Lula Back From Prison and Could Be Brazil's Next President, Again...",https://dnyuz.com/2022/09/29/on-eve-of-election-bolsonaros-party-attacks-brazils-voting-systems/,"RIO DE JANEIRO — For months, officials in Brazil and across the international community have watched President Jair Bolsonaro cast doubt on Brazil’s voting systems, growing increasingly worried that the far-right leader was setting the stage to dispute an election loss.

Late Wednesday, the president gave them more reason to worry. In a surprise move less than four days before the vote, Mr. Bolsonaro’s political party released a document that claimed, without evidence, that a group of government employees and contractors had the “absolute power to manipulate election results without leaving a trace.”

It was among the most significant attacks yet against Brazil’s election system. The party said that it reached its conclusion based on an audit of the election system it commissioned in July, and that it was releasing the information now because election officials had not sufficiently responded.

Brazil’s electoral authority immediately responded on Wednesday. The document’s conclusions “are false and dishonest, with no backing in reality” and are “a clear attempt to hinder and disrupt the natural course of the electoral process,” the agency said in a statement. The Supreme Court said it was now investigating the president’s party for releasing the document.

The document delivered a jolt to the presidential race that already had the nation on edge. The attempt to discredit the voting systems just days before the election heightened fears that, in the face of worsening poll numbers, Mr. Bolsonaro was preparing to challenge the results of Sunday’s vote.

“They released the report right now because they’re afraid they’re going to lose,” said Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. “They’re trying to create some kind of excuse for Bolsonaro supporters on why.”

Mr. Bolsonaro has trailed former leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in polls since last year. If no candidate receives 50 percent of the vote on Sunday, the top two finishers will compete in a runoff on Oct. 30. Mr. da Silva’s support has ticked up in recent weeks, and it looks increasingly likely that he could win outright on Sunday. Mr. Bolsonaro has claimed, without evidence, that the polls are systematically wrong.

Mr. Bolsonaro has also claimed that Brazil’s electronic voting systems are vulnerable and that Mr. da Silva’s supporters are planning to rig them to steal the election. In July, he called foreign diplomats to the presidential palace to lay out his evidence, which turned out to be years-old news about a hack that did not threaten the voting machines. He has also enlisted Brazil’s military in his fight with election officials, raising fears that the armed forces could support any effort to hold onto power.

Observers across the world have been alarmed that Mr. Bolsonaro appears to be following in the footsteps of former President Donald J. Trump. On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution that urged the White House to condemn Mr. Bolsonaro’s efforts to undermine the elections and reconsider its relationship with any Brazilian government that is not democratically elected.

Leaders in Brazil’s Congress, courts and armed forces have said that they would not abide by any efforts to reject voters’ will, but many say privately that they are concerned that Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters will react violently to a loss. In July, three out of every four supporters of Mr. Bolsonaro told Brazil’s most prominent polling company that they trusted the voting machines only a “little” or not at all.

There is no evidence of past widespread fraud in the system.

On Wednesday night, news of the document quickly spread among Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters on social media, with people sharing right-wing articles about the allegations and conspiracy theories that said it proved what Mr. Bolsonaro had been alleging. One YouTube video about it quickly attracted more than 100,000 views in just a few hours. A conservative congresswoman, Carla Zambelli, was one of the first to post the document on social media, sharing it with her 1.9 million followers on Twitter.

However, many other politicians, including Mr. Bolsonaro, did not mention it online. In its statement on Wednesday night, the electoral authority reminded elected officials and candidates that they could be impeached or prohibited from running if they shared false allegations about the voting system. That swift reaction likely prevented wider dissemination of the document among politicians.

Election officials could also revoke the registration of Mr. Bolsonaro’s conservative political party, called the Liberal Party, if it was found guilty of spreading misinformation about the voting systems, though that would only happen after the election.

The document said that the July audit found 24 flaws in the election system’s security. A rough summary of the audit, it specified just a few of those alleged flaws, including that election officials used poor cybersecurity policies, that they did not properly vet relationships with suppliers and that they did not fully protect the employees who control the machines’ computer code from “irresistible coercion.”

Election officials’ delay in fixing those alleged security gaps “could result in internal or external breaches of the electoral systems, with a serious impact on the October election results,” the document said.

Cybersecurity experts also dismissed the claims.

“Some points are old complaints,” said Diego Aranha, a Brazilian computer scientist who has studied the election system. “Others are completely fabricated.”

Marcos Simplicio, a researcher at the University of São Paulo who tests Brazil’s voting machines, said the document made gross exaggerations about the risks to the system.

He said that like most computer systems, there is a group of engineers that controls the code that underpin the voting machines, but there are multiple security checks to prevent that code from being surreptitiously altered. There are also tests to ensure that the machines are counting votes properly on Election Day.

Even if there was a conspiracy to change the code before the election, Mr. Simplicio said, it would likely require a sophisticated, coordinated effort by a group of engineers to pull off.

“It’s really hard to keep a secret this big between two people,” he said. “Imagine 20.”

(NYSE: IRNT), an innovative leader Transforming Cybersecurity Through Collective DefenseSM, has launched IronRadarSM, a new solution designed to proactively and automatically update customers’ cybersecurity tools with malicious indicators for adversary infrastructure.

Developed by IronNet’s team of elite threat hunters, IronRadar uses an innovative process that fingerprints a server and determines whether it is a command and control (C2) server while those servers are being stood up, even before a cyber attack is initiated. IronRadar enriches the data creating purpose-built intelligence updates for proactively blocking adversarial infrastructure, and was observed to have 98% accuracy over six months of testing.

“We know that Cobalt Strike and other open-source tools provide the framework for legitimate ‘red team’ activities,” said Don Closser, Chief Product Officer of IronNet. “Unfortunately, open-source tools are being used by advanced persistent threat groups to gain access to systems, establish C2, and launch attacks. Thanks to our innovative and dedicated CyOC team, IronRadar can identify threats as new adversarial infrastructure servers appear and before they can be used in sophisticated cyber attacks.”

IronRadar is now available for all networks beyond the IronNet Collective DefenseSM platform community as an annual subscription – sold directly from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace makes it cost effective and easy to buy and scale. Once installed, customers can easily upgrade to join the Collective Defense community at any time.

“Detecting weaponized C2 servers before they connect to a network and inflict damage like ransomware and eCrimes is a daunting challenge for all organizations,” said Christopher Kissel, Research Vice President of Security and Trust Products, at IDC. “The launch of the purpose-built threat intelligence feed from IronNet is a game changer because it proactively blocks known, new, and unreported C2 infrastructures.”

IronRadar is the only existing automated threat intelligence feed developed specifically to combat C2 behavior. This easy-to-use tool enables a customer’s SOC to:

Actively block known C2 and emerging threat C2 IoCs.

Integrate real-time threat intelligence into any security solution – SIEM, SOAR, Incident Response, and more.

Accelerate threat response by exposing the adversaries and evolving tradecraft targeting infrastructure.

IronRadar integrates seamlessly with the IronNet Collective Defense platform, powered by AWS, which is the only solution that can identify anomalous behaviors and deliver actionable attack intelligence to all the other participants in the IronNet community. The Collective Defense platform serves as an early warning system for all participating companies and organizations, strengthening network security through correlated alerts, automated triage, and extended hunt support.

About IronNet, Inc.

Founded in 2014 by GEN (Ret.) Keith Alexander, IronNet, Inc.

Microsoft is set to phase out the use of Client Access Rules (CARs) in Exchange Online.

CARs help users control access to their Exchange Online organization based on client properties or client access requests, using details such as their IP address (IPv4 and IPv6), authentication type, user property values, and the protocol, application, service, or the resource that they're using to connect

CARs are set to be fully deprecated by September 2023, and will be disabled for tenants who don't use them in October 2022.

What’s replacing CARs?

As per the announcement (opens in new tab)by Microsoft, CARs are set to be replaced by Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE).

CAE was first announced in January 2021, and according to Microsoft (opens in new tab) will allow Azure Active Directory applications to subscribe to critical events.

These events, which include account revocation, account disablement/deletion, password change, user location change, and user risk increase can then be evaluated and enforced in ""near real-time"".

On receiving such events, app sessions are immediately interrupted and users are redirected back to Azure AD to reauthenticate or reevaluate policy.

Microsoft says this enables users to have better control while also adding resiliency to their organizations because the real-time enforcement of policies can safely extend the session duration.

In the case of any Azure AD outages, users with CAE sessions will reportedly be able to ride out these outages without ever noticing them.

Tenants still using client access rules are set to receive notifications via Message Center to start the planning process to migrate their rules.

It's no surprise that Microsoft is consistently rolling out updates to Microsoft Exchange's authentification protocols, it's a platform that's remaining a consistent target for cybercriminals.

A group of cybersecurity authorities, including the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) highlighted how Iranian state-sponsored hackers have beenusing the ProxyShell vulnerability (opens in new tab) since at least October 2021.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian telecoms giant Optus must pay the cost of replacing the passports and drivers licences of millions of customers whose personal information was stolen in one of the country's biggest data breaches, the government said on Thursday.

The theft of data attached to 10 million customer accounts, equivalent to 40% of Australia's population, was the result of an error by Optus so it was up to the Singapore Telecommunications-owned company to pay for the consequences, Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said.

""Optus is absolutely responsible for paying for the costs and the implications of this for customers, whether it's the replacement of a licence, whether it's the replacement of a passport, or other necessary pieces of ID,"" Jones told reporters in Sydney. He did not give a dollar figure for the costs.

An Optus representative was not immediately available to respond to Jones's comments. Optus has apologised for the breach and said it would pay for the most affected customers to receive credit monitoring for a year.

The comments underscore the growing tension between Australia's government and its second-largest telco as internet companies, banks and government authorities scramble to minimise the risk of being similarly hacked.

The operator of an anonymous account had in an online chatroom demanded $1 million to refrain from selling the Optus customer data, only to later withdraw the demand and apologise, citing heightened publicity. Optus and law enforcement authorities have not verified the demand, although cybersecurity experts say it was most likely authentic.

The stolen data included passport numbers, drivers licence numbers, government health insurance numbers, phone numbers and home addresses, prompting commentators and lawmakers to demand replacement documents.

Other large internet firms meanwhile said they were running extra cybersecurity checks to reduce the risk of a similar breach.

Story continues

""In light of the recent Optus breach, we have been working closely with our cybersecurity partners and the relevant government agencies to increase our checks,"" said a spokesperson for No. 3 internet provider TPG Telecom Ltd, which has about 6 million customers.

A spokesperson for Telstra Corp, Australia's largest internet provider, said in an email: ""We will continue to consider what other steps we may need to put in place as we learn more about the Optus incident"".

read more",https://www.securityweek.com/investors-bet-ox-security-guard-software-supply-chains,"The funding frenzy in the software supply chain space now includes Ox Security, an early-stage Israeli startup that just raised a whopping $34 million in seed-stage financing.

Ox Security, based in Tel Aviv, announced Wednesday that the $34 million funding round was led by Evolution Equity Partners, Team8, and M12, Microsoft’s venture fund. Investors at Rain Capital also participated.

The brainchild of former Check Point executives, Ox Security is promising to extend the SBOM (software bill of materials) concept down through the pipelines that connect and distribute code for critical software products.

Ox Security is pushing the idea of PBOMs (pipeline bill of materials) that includes the traditional SBOM components but also covers the procedures and processes that impacted the software throughout its development.

[ READ: Cybersecurity Leaders Scramble to Decipher SBOM Mandate ]

The company claims its product is already used by more than 30 companies to secure their software supply chains, including Kaltura, Marqeta and Bloomreach.

The plan is for the product to integrate with existing tools and infrastructure to monitor and record every action affecting software throughout the entire development lifecycle, giving security and DevOps teams visibility and control over the attack surface, including source code, pipeline, artifacts, container images, runtime assets, and applications.

Ox Security isn’t the only early-stage software supply chain company making a big funding splash.

Earlier this year, Chainguard bagged a massive $50 million Series A just a few months after raising $5 million in seed funding. Chainguard was created by Dan Lorenc and Kim Lewandowski and the team that worked on Google’s major supply chain security initiatives -- Sigstore and SLSA.

Aqua Security ($265 million raised), Legit Security ($34 million raised), ReversingLabs ($81 million raised, Tidelift ($27 million funding) are also among the well-funded software supply chain startups.

146,Why is Pakistan investigating several audio leaks from PM office?,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AA-20220401-27439299-27439293-PAKISTANI_OPPOSITION_LEADER_SHEHBAZ_SHARIF.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,29/09/2022,PM Shehbaz Sharif orders formation of committee to investigate leaking of several audio files released over past week.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/29/why-is-pakistan-investigating-several-audio-leaks-from-pm-office,"PM Shehbaz Sharif orders the formation of a committee to investigate the leaking of several audio files released over the past week.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered the formation of a committee to investigate the leaking of several audio files released over the past week and a review of cybersecurity at the prime minister’s office (PMO).

The National Security Committee, comprising Sharif himself, top military and government officials met on Wednesday to discuss the audio leaks and ways to ensure fool-proof security at the PMO and other important government offices.

Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah will lead the committee, according to a statement released after the meeting.

What is the government investigating?

The leaks started on September 24 when multiple files of purported conversations, allegedly recorded in the PMO, emerged online. They apparently showed Sharif and other ministers talking about official matters. In at least one instance, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party’s vice president Maryam Nawaz Sharif could also be heard.

As soon as the files came began circulating on Pakistani social media, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb played down the matter, saying the files have nothing incriminating or illegal in them.

At a news conference on Tuesday, however, Sharif called the leaks a “very serious lapse” and announced the formation of a high-powered committee to probe the incident.

“This is a big question mark. Who will now come to Pakistan to meet the PM in the PM House? Be it a friend or a sympathiser, they will think twice about if they should mention anything sensitive or not. They will think 100 times, wondering if these conversations will be recorded,” the prime minister said.

What do the PMO audio files contain?

At least four different audio files purportedly recorded in the PMO have been leaked so far.

The first file included a conversation between Sharif and an unnamed government official, discussing the importation of industrial machinery from India.

Another file contains a purported conversation between Maryam and Sharif, discussing the performance of former Finance Minister, Miftah Ismail, who resigned earlier this week.

In that audio file, Maryam could be apparently heard complaining about Ismail’s performance and expressing her wish for the return from exile of Ishaq Dar, who has now replaced Ismail as the finance minister.

Dar, a 72-year-old veteran politician, returned last week from London where he lived since 2017 in a self-imposed exile following corruption allegations against him. He is close to the ruling Sharif family.

How were the audio files leaked?

There has been no official statement on how the audio files were leaked or who recorded them in the first place.

In a tweet on September 24, Fawad Chaudhry of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party hinted at a Twitter thread by an unidentified user.

The user, OSINT Insider, claimed the files were leaked online in August by a hacker who allegedly asked for $340,000 to release the complete material.

Shocking! PM of Pak office conversations are available on hackers website for 345,000 USD, really shows the security levels of PMO …. https://t.co/5P6M4TlgCu — Ch Fawad Hussain (@fawadchaudhry) September 24, 2022

In another tweet the next day, Chaudhry attacked the intelligence agencies for their failure to find the source of the files. He also asked why the government was not responding to the leak.

“More than 100 hours of conversation from PMO is available for sale since August/September. But our agencies will only look at sensitive issues once they get free from their political tasks,” he tweeted.

Are there more audio leaks?

On Wednesday, a new audio file purportedly featuring opposition leader Imran Khan surfaced on social media when he was the prime minister.

In the audio file lasting just over 100 seconds, Khan is talking to a top bureaucrat about a “cypher” or secret cable sent to Islamabad by the then Pakistani envoy to the US.

“We only have to play it up. We don’t have to name America. We only have to play with this,” he could be heard saying.

Days before he lost a no-confidence vote in parliament in April this year, Khan had alleged a “foreign conspiracy” being hatched by the US to overthrow his government. Islamabad and Washington have denied the allegations.

It is unclear if the file about Khan is part of the same tranche of the PMO leaks aimed at incriminating the incumbent government.

Khan’s PTI party has not denied the authenticity of the audio tape so far, but the politician alleged the government itself had leaked it.

“This was leaked by Shehbaz Sharif at al. They did a good thing by leaking this,” Khan told reporters in Islamabad on Wednesday. “I say the whole cypher should be leaked. It should be apparent to everybody that what a huge foreign conspiracy this was.”

Khan’s PTI was also the target of two other leaks last month when purported telephone conversations between former Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin and two of his provincial counterparts were released.

Tarin, who confirmed the authenticity of the conversation, could be heard discussing the International Monetary Fund bailout package with the two ministers.",cybersecurity,al jazeera english

At the same time, cybercriminals continue to take advantage of long-standing security vulnerabilities and increased attacks on VPNs, according to Zscaler’s VPN Risk Report.

“As evident in several high profile breaches and ransomware attacks, VPNs continue to be one of the weakest links in cybersecurity. Their architecture deficiencies provide an entry point to threat actors and offer them an opportunity to move laterally and steal data,” said Deepen Desai, Global CISO of Zscaler.

“To safeguard against the evolving threat landscape, organizations must use a zero trust architecture that, unlike VPN, does not bring the users on the same network as business-critical information, prevents lateral movement with user-app segmentation, minimizes the attack surface, and delivers full TLS inspection to prevent compromise and data loss.”

Zero trust secures remote access

While more and more companies have employees returning to the office, 95 percent of surveyed workplaces still rely on VPNs to support a combination of hybrid and distributed work environments that often span multiple geographies. In addition to remote employees, large organizations often extend network access to other external stakeholders, including customers, partners, and contractors. In many cases these users are connecting from untrusted devices on insecure networks, are granted far more freedom than necessary, and result in additional security risks.

Unlike cumbersome, insecure VPNs, zero trust architecture improves organizational security posture without sacrificing the user experience. In addition, zero trust allows IT teams to keep the location of their network and applications secret, reducing the attack surface and threat of internet-based attacks.

VPN risks continue to grow

The increase in the number of remote workers across industries has resulted in a sharp spike in cyberattacks that are tailor-made to target VPN users. As VPNs grant a greater degree of trust to users when compared to zero trust architecture, cybercriminals are more active in seeking to gain unauthorized access to network resources through exposed attack surfaces.

According to the report, 44 percent of cybersecurity professionals have witnessed an increase in exploits targeting their business VPNs in the last year, demonstrating the risks associated with this technology when deployed to support remote users.

Legacy network security architectures are pervasive and deeply entrenched in corporate data centers, making it difficult to challenge the status quo and adopt new architectures. So it should come as no great surprise that nearly all of the organizations surveyed continue to use VPNs despite knowing they are being targeted by ransomware and malware. Meanwhile, incumbent network security vendors have a vested interest in maintaining the remote access status quo.

Organizations should be wary of legacy network access approaches that rely on cloud-based VPN, and examine vendors’ architectures to understand whether they will bring significant benefits in risk reduction and user experience. VPN technology carries the same fundamental shortcomings and risks in cloud virtual machines as it does on appliances, and should be avoided in favor of more modern approaches.

VPN alternatives

Ongoing risks from legacy VPNs have created a gradual shift towards zero trust security, which provides greater control and flexibility for effective remote access management. 78 percent of organizations surveyed for the VPN Risk Report indicated that their future workforce will be hybrid, creating an ongoing need for this type of security infrastructure in the enterprise.

Since the shift to remote and hybrid work environments, 68 percent of surveyed companies have indicated that they are accelerating their zero trust projects. Unlike VPNs, zero trust architecture treats all network communications as potentially hostile and requires tightening access using identity-based validation policies. This ensures IT and security teams can restrict users from off-limits applications and prevent malicious intruders from taking advantage of granted access to move laterally within the network.

Zero trust security architecture also reduces network risk by eliminating the attack surface, masking activity from internet-based threats and connecting them directly to the applications and resources they need.",cybersecurity,help net security

The company has been developing a series about the biggest cybersecurity breaches of the past two decades, in hopes of educating consumers on cybersecurity standards—and why its little hardware dongles are necessary.

Two leading video-streaming services have expressed interest in the TV series, said CEO Stina Ehrensvard via email, declining to name them. But winning over consumers won’t necessarily help Yubico. They can buy the little keys, which plug into computers, but unless their bank, insurance firm or money manager incorporates Yubico’s keys into its security standards, consumers can’t use them. And while Google and other big tech firms are heavy promoters of Yubico’s keys—although Google also sells its own keys—Ehrensvard acknowledged in an interview this week that adoption from sectors such as banking had not been “as fast as I expected.” Many companies still prefer to stick to password-based security methods.

Possibly reacting to that slow progress, Ehrensvard appears to have become more open to selling the company, saying Yubico could achieve its mission as part of a bigger company. Early last year, she had said she wanted to remain independent. “I am open to both possibilities,” she said this week.",cybersecurity,the information

Russia has engaged in a sustained, malicious cyber campaign against Ukraine and its allies since the February 24 invasion – but its lack of success shows that it's possible to defend against cyberattacks, even against some of the most sophisticated and persistent attackers, says the UK's cybersecurity chief.

""Try as they might, Russian cyberattacks simply have not had the intended impact,"" said Lindy Cameron, CEO of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) – the cyber arm of GCHQ – speaking at Chatham House in London.

""But if the Ukrainian cyber defence teaches us a wider lesson – for military theory and beyond – it is that, in cybersecurity, the defender has significant agency. In many ways you can choose how vulnerable you can be to attacks.""

Also: The scary future of the internet: How the tech of tomorrow will pose even bigger cybersecurity threats

In the run-up to and since the invasion of Ukraine, the country has been hit by a series of cyberattacks that have been attributed to Russia. These include distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the Ukranian government and financial sector, as well as wiper malware campaigns designed to destroy systems by rendering them unusable.

These weren't the first offensive cyberattacks linked to the Russian state that have targeted Ukraine; attacks previously caused power outages in the winters of 2015 and 2016. Then, in 2017, Russia launched the NotPetya wiper malware attack against Ukraine, but the impact spread further, causing billions of dollars of damage around the world.

Since the invasion, Cameron said, ""what we have seen is a very significant conflict in cyberspace – probably the most sustained and intensive cyber campaign on record."" But she also pointed to the lack of success of these campaigns, thanks to the efforts of Ukrainian cyber defenders and their allies.

""This activity has provided us with the clearest demonstration that a strong and effective cyber defence can be mounted, even against an adversary as well prepared and resourced as the Russian Federation.""

Cameron argued that not only does this provide lessons for what countries and their governments can do to protect against cyberattacks, but there are also lessons for organisations on how to protect against incidents, be they nation-state backed campaigns, ransomware attacks or other malicious cyber operations.

""Central to this is a commitment to long-term resilience,"" said Cameron. ""Building resilience means we don't necessarily need to know where or how the threat will manifest itself next. Instead, we know that most threats will be unable to breach our defences. And when they do, we can recover quickly and fully.""

The NCSC has previously suggested that organisations should be operating at a heightened threat level, and has made recommendations that should be followed to help protect against cyberattacks, or collateral damage as a result of wide-scale cyber events.

Also: White House warns: Do these 8 things now to boost your security ahead of potential Russian cyberattacks

These recommendations, which Cameron reiterated at Chatham House, include verifying that all software is up to date with the latest security patches, checking that backups are working properly, and having an incident response plan in place – because cyberattacks continue to represent a major threat.

""There may be organisations that are beginning to think 'is this still necessary?' as in the UK we haven't experienced a major incident related to the war in Ukraine. My answer is an emphatic 'yes',"" Cameron said.

""UK organisations – and their network defenders – should be prepared for this period of elevated alert to be with us for the long haul. Across the UK, we need to focus on building long-term resilience. Just as the Ukrainian defenders have done,"" she added.

154,Two US Senators Want to Update a 2015 Cybersec Bill to Include Crypto,https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/imageForEntry39-WFt.jpg,29/09/2022,Two Republican Senators brought a proposal before the US Senate to amend the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 to include crypto.,https://tokenist.com/two-us-senators-want-to-update-a-2015-cybersec-bill-to-include-crypto/?utm_sour,"Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.

Two Republican Senators brought a proposal before the US Senate to amend the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 to include crypto. Allegedly, the altered bill would bear the name Cryptocurrency Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act and could help companies crack down on bad practices within the industry.

US Senators Propose Amendments to a 2015 Cybersec Bill

Senators Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee and Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming filed a proposal to alter a cybersecurity bill from 2015. According to the Senators, the changes would help crypto companies report crime and other violations within their sector, and work more closely with law enforcement.

Blackburn stated that “some bad actors have used cryptocurrency as a way to hide their illegal practices and avoid accountability,” and added that the update to the bill could provide companies a way to voluntarily disclose such abuse to authorities. This could help prevent the misuse of crypto in the future.

This proposal is the newest step in the ongoing struggle to expand and upgrade crypto regulation. An initiative partly stemming from incidents like the Terra LUNA collapse and reinforced by the danger posed by crypto-related crime. According to a recent FBI report, around $1.3 billion was stolen in Q1 2022 in crypto hacks alone.

Global Efforts to Regulate Crypto in 2022

The increase in regulator and law enforcement activity with regard to digital assets is visible throughout the world. For example, South Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant for Do Kwon, the man behind LUNA, earlier this month. They made the manhunt global when it got Interpol to join the search.

On Wednesday, the same day the proposed amendments for the 2015 bill were made public, India froze $1.5 million in Bitcoin due to an ongoing case involving a gaming app, E-Nuggets. The US has also seen a major increase in crypto-related enforcement both at the Federal, and State levels.

Additionally, there is some rivalry between agencies in the US. Both the SEC and the CFTC have been attempting to become the main digital assets regulator with the Securities and Exchange Commission so far being in the spotlight. Earlier in September, CFTC requested its authority be expanded and appeared to double down on the effort as a recent speech by its commissioner made crypto-related legislation its main focus.

Crypto companies made themselves active in the matter as well. Coinbase is a firm that is actively trying to bring about more crypto-friendly policies. Two weeks ago, the company announced it would score politicians based on their stance on digital assets.

Perhaps it isn’t surprising that Cynthia Lummis, one of the Senators responsible for the proposal to the 2015 bill, is currently graded with an A by Coinbase seeing that she has so far been fairly crypto-friendly and expressed particular admiration for Bitcoin in a recent interview.

The consulting giant polled 3522 business, tech and security execs to compile its 2023 Global Digital Trust Insights report. Over half hailed from companies with over $1bn in revenue, and 16% from firms with $10bn or more.

The majority (70%) of tech and business executives have seen improvements in their cybersecurity this year, but fewer than 40% have fully mitigated emerging risks.

Most respondents claimed progress on several fronts, notably in operational technology (OT) security (79%), ransomware defenses (77%), security by design, and increasing the efficiency of cyber resources (both 75%).

However, less than 3% believe they have fully mitigated cyber risk related to all initiatives outlined in the report – which range from hybrid work and cloud adoption to IT–OT convergence and supply chain digitization.

Larger organizations are significantly more likely to be affected by risks related to the software supply chain, cloud-based pathways and operational technology, the report claimed.

The report also highlighted several serious concerns among those global organizations polled, namely:

Just a fifth (19%) of respondents are fully confident they have taken steps to secure against the top four causes of cloud breaches

56% of chief operating (COO) and chief risk officers (CROs) are extremely or very concerned about their company’s ability to withstand supply chain attacks

Less than half (46%) of COO/CROs have controls in place to mitigate serious cyber-related disruption

Over half (54%) of CIOs/CISOs say security staff attrition is a problem

Given the average size of most of the organizations polled and the wealth of resources at their disposal, such concerns may be amplified even further among their smaller counterparts.",cybersecurity,infosecurity magazine
156,3 Reasons IBM Is a Surprisingly Strong Buy,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/702648/investor-looks-at-a-financial-chart-on-a-laptop.jpg,29/09/2022,Big Blue is a technology stock but without most of the usual risks of tech stocks.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/29/3-reasons-ibm-is-a-surprisingly-strong-buy/,"There's no denying it: This year's been a pretty lousy one for the market. The S&P 500 (^GSPC -2.37%) is down 23% year to date, and is sitting within easy reach of a new 52-week low. Blame the rout suffered by several key technology stocks, mostly, paving the way for most other equities.

There's a curious exception to this market-wide and tech sector weakness that's worth noting. IBM (IBM -1.44%) is holding up surprisingly well in the otherwise miserable environment. And it's arguably doing so for all the right reasons despite the specter of a recession. Here are the top three reasons.

1. Diversified business lines that are perpetually in demand

If the economy sours enough, it will take a toll on all businesses, with corporations being forced into extreme austerity. That's a worst-case scenario that doesn't seem a likely threat to IBM, though.

The company might not be positioned for significant growth, but it is positioned to generate revenue in almost any economic environment. Around one-third of its revenue stems from consulting work, while more than one-third comes from software sales.

These aren't your typical consulting and software businesses, however. Much of it is contractual, meaning its client companies have pre-arranged access to employees or software for a specified period of time. Its annualized recurring software revenue, for example, now stands at $12.9 billion, making up roughly half of its current yearly software sales. Moreover, its software includes cybersecurity, data analysis, artificial intelligence, hybrid cloud computing, and transaction processing. These are service-based software suites that most of its customers rely on in a big way.

The kicker: CFO James Kavanaugh said a couple of years ago, ""[For every $1 worth of business on a hybrid cloud platform], another $3 to $5 is

spent on software and another $6 to $8 on the cloud services."" In other words, sales of hardware drive long-term software and consulting revenue, yet IBM's unique software and consulting offerings also drive hardware sales. It's a self-powering virtuous cycle.

IBM's solutions aren't something major enterprises can easily replace or simply stop using. In fact, the company argues that technology becomes an even more important growth driver when stagflation stifles traditional growth efforts.

2. IBM is making smart business-building acquisitions

Many companies make acquisitions to increase their revenue without much thought about where or how they fit in. But IBM's deals are made with purpose rather than rooted in status and stature. For instance, in July, the company announced its purchase of Databand.ai, adding the ability to spot errant digital data to the company's data-management arm. Earlier this year, it bought Neudesic, which operates a hybrid cloud consulting business specializing in Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.

None of the six deals the company has made this year have been particularly high-profile acquisitions. Neither have any of the other 20-plus acquisitions CEO Arvind Krishna has directed since taking the helm from Ginni Rometty in early 2020. IBM hasn't made any large-scale deals since buying Red Hat in 2019, in fact. But the smaller companies it's scooping up make its products more marketable.

While the recent acquisitions have been relatively small, analysts at Evercore ISI (EVR -1.98%) suggest IBM could be mulling an acquisition worth as much as $30 billion, potentially pushing the company into an all-new line of business that creates synergy with its existing ones.

3. A little something is better than a lot of nothing

Lastly, IBM might never dish out enormous organic growth again, but it offers something even more valuable to investors amid economic weakness: a healthy dividend. It currently yields 5.2%, and given the consistent recurring revenue of much of its business as well as how well its payouts are covered, there's no reason to fear this dividend is in jeopardy.

Investors in tune with the company's fiscals might not completely agree. Last fiscal year, IBM dished out $6.55 per share in dividends, but the company only earned $6.41 per share. That's clearly not sustainable.

But it was a year complicated by COVID-19 and more corporate restructuring. In November, IBM completed the spinoff of its managed infrastructure business now called Kyndryl (KD -4.86%). While spinoffs don't technically incur direct operational costs, they can often take an indirect toll on a company's focus and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. IBM hasn't exactly escaped inflationary pressures and the fallout from broken supply chains, either.

Regardless, the company's bottom line is growing again. Analysts collectively expect per-share earnings of $9.34 this year, followed by an improvement to $10.05 next year. That's far more than enough to continue funding the dividend and extend its 27-year streak of annual dividend growth.

Dividends may not be your thing. Amid economic uncertainty, though, collecting good income becomes a pretty big deal.",cybersecurity,motley fool

ShiftRight’s workflow automation technology is currently being integrated into the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange cloud security platform to automate security management for the growing influx of risks and incidents organizations are experiencing. This integration will provide a simple, sophisticated solution to reduce incident resolution time dramatically.

“I am excited to welcome the ShiftRight team into the Zscaler family,” said Jay Chaudhry, CEO, chairman and founder of Zscaler. “The decision to acquire ShiftRight was the logical next step because we saw the immense benefits of their technology during our pre-existing technology partnership. We will now extend the value of Zscaler’s platform with ShiftRight by simplifying IT and security operations through security workflow automation. The integration of ShiftRight’s technology into Zscaler’s cloud platform will help customers establish clear lines of responsibility and provide real-time visibility for their security posture.”

Security teams are held accountable, but are not directly responsible, for many security-related actions. This misalignment has become a source of contention for organizations as the security landscape becomes crowded, fragmented and complex. In practice, the responsibility for cybersecurity is distributed throughout multiple teams in an organization.

Security teams are forced to work with multiple distinct groups to keep users and data properly secured. The current working model is an ineffective patchwork of error-prone spreadsheets interlaced with disparate systems where critical security issues fall through the cracks.

“ShiftRight is a natural fit for the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange by automating accountability and responsibility management for security teams,” said Sanjay Kalra, CEO of ShiftRight (now a part of Zscaler). “As an integrated capability into Zscaler’s platform, ShiftRight’s technology will strengthen Zscaler’s offerings and transform security into a collaborative solution for internal teams to tackle numerous security challenges, like remediation, deployment, compliance and upgrades.”

Last week, Australian telecommunications giant Optus revealed about 10 million customers - about 40% of the population - had personal data stolen in what it calls a cyber-attack.

Some experts say it may be the worst data breach in Australia's history.

But this week has seen more dramatic and messy developments - including ransom threats, tense public exchanges and scrutiny over whether this constituted a ""hack"" at all.

It's also ignited critical questions about how Australia handles data and privacy.

The alarm was sounded last Thursday

Optus - a subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd - went public with the breach about 24 hours after it noticed suspicious activity on its network.

Australia's second-largest telecoms provider said current and former customers' data was stolen - including names, birthdates, home addresses, phone and email contacts, and passport and driving licence numbers. It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised.

Those whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a ""quite significant"" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said.

Optus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported.

In an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a ""sophisticated attack"", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity.

Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said she was ""devastated"" by the breach

""Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it,"" she said on Friday.

Then a ransom threat was made

Early on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; £938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus.

The company had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said.

Investigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate.

Story continues

Sydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data.

The user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was ""sophisticated"", saying they pulled the data from a freely accessible software interface.

""No authenticate needed… All open to internet for any one to use,"" they said in a message, according to Kirk.

As data circulates, revelations of more stolen details

In another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline.

But just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a ""mistake"" - and deleted the previously posted data sets.

""Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone,"" they posted. ""Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this.""

That sparked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation.

Adding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them.

It also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose.

Late on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.

'Potentially Australia's most serious breach'

Optus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week.

People have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion.

A class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. ""This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed,"" said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers.

The government has called the breach ""unprecedented"" and blamed Optus, saying it ""effectively left the window open"" for sensitive data to be stolen.

In an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: ""You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?""

""Well, it wasn't. So no,"" Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online.

What happened at Optus wasn't a sophisticated attack.



We should not have a telecommunications provider in this country that has effectively left the window open for data of this nature to be stolen.#abc730 pic.twitter.com/KamkiapcZl — Clare O'Neil MP (@ClareONeilMP) September 26, 2022

Ms Bayer Rosmarin told News Corp Australia on Tuesday: ""We have multiple layers of protection. So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there.

""I think most customers understand that we are not the villains,"" she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing.

The company has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves.

'A decade behind on cyber-security'

The breach highlights how much Australia lags behind other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says.

""We are probably a decade behind… where we ought to be,"" she told the ABC.

Both sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is ""asleep at the wheel"", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule.

Ms O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform.

She argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said.

She also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies.

""At the time, the telecommunications sector said: ""Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question.""

Security experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say.

Optus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules.

Other industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator.",cybersecurity,yahoo entertainment

Subscribers to business magazine Fast Company were flooded with obscene and racist notifications after its Apple News feed was seized by hackers.

The online and monthly print business magazine owned by billionaire Jow Mansueto’s Mansueto Ventures, experienced a breach of security on Tuesday. Hackers sent two racist notifications just minutes apart through the company’s Apple News channel.

“Fast Company regrets that such abhorrent language appeared on our platforms and in Apple News, and we apologize to anyone who saw it before it was taken down,” the company said in a statement.

“The messages are vile and not in line with the content and ethos of Fast Company.”

The magazine’s website has been temporarily shut down out of an abundance of caution, Fast Company said in a statement, and a cybersecurity firm is investigating the hack.

Fast Company’s statement (Fastcompany.com )

According to Fast Company, Tuesday’s breach follows a similar event on Sunday on FastCompany.com, when hackers also posted similar language on the site’s home page.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google will set up its first cloud region in Greece, the company said on Thursday, giving a boost to the country's efforts to become a world cloud computing hub.

The deal is estimated to contribute some 2.2 billion euros ($2.13 billion) to Greece's economic output and create some 20,000 jobs by 2030, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.

Since taking office in 2019, Mitsotakis's conservative government has stepped up moves to diversify the economy and attract foreign investment and high tech companies to the country which emerged from a decade-long financial crisis in 2018.

""Today, we are very pleased to be announcing our first cloud region in Greece which will provide storage and cloud services for Google customers,"" said Adaire Fox-Martin, president of Google Cloud International, announcing the investment at an event in Athens.

The investment would enable organisations to better use their data, help improve low latency and ensure users' security in the face of cybersecurity threats, she said.

A cloud region usually is based around a cluster of data centres.

Google's investment comes two years after Microsoft Corp. decided to build a data centre hub in the country.

Amazon Inc's cloud computing division also opened its first office in Greece last year to support what it said was a growing number of companies and public sector agencies using its cloud services.

The state recorded its objection in bankruptcy court on Thursday, arguing that Celsius is asking for “troublingly broad permission to sell assets insufficiently defined for purposes that are also insufficiently defined.”

Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July, and the case is now moving through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The latest filing from the Texas State Securities Board and the Texas Department of Banking also points out that Celsius’ past activities are currently being investigated by more than 40 states’ regulators and the company is under orders to cease all investing activity.

The potential sale of stablecoins is scheduled for a hearing on Oct. 6 in New York.

The company – whose CEO, Alex Mashinksy, resigned this week – “currently owns [11] different forms of stablecoin totaling approximately $23 million,” according to its Sept. 15 request.

[...]",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-microsoft-exchange-zero-days-reportedly-exploited-in-attacks/,"Threat actors are exploiting yet-to-be-disclosed Microsoft Exchange zero-day bugs allowing for remote code execution, according to claims made by security researchers at Vietnamese cybersecurity outfit GTSC, who first spotted and reported the attacks.

The attackers are chaining the pair of zero-days to deploy Chinese Chopper web shells on compromised servers for persistence and data theft, as well as move laterally to other systems on the victims' networks.

""The vulnerability turns out to be so critical that it allows the attacker to do RCE on the compromised system,"" the researchers said.

GTSC suspects that a Chinese threat group is responsible for the attacks based on the web shells' code page, a Microsoft character encoding for simplified Chinese.

The user agent used to install the web shells also belongs to Antsword, a Chinese-based open-source website admin tool with web shell management support.

Microsoft hasn't disclosed any information regarding the two security flaws so far and is yet to assign a CVE ID to track them.

The researchers reported the security vulnerabilities to Microsoft privately three weeks ago through the Zero Day Initiative, which tracks them as ZDI-CAN-18333 and ZDI-CAN-18802 after its analysts validated the issues.

""GTSC submitted the vulnerability to the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) right away to work with Microsoft so that a patch could be prepared as soon as possible,"" they added. ""ZDI verified and acknowledged 2 bugs, whose CVSS scores are 8.8 and 6.3.""

Trend Micro released a security advisory Thursday evening confirming that they submitted the two new Microsoft Exchange zero-day vulnerabilities discovered by GTSC to Microsoft.

The company has already added detections for these zero-days to its IPS N-Platform, NX-Platform, or TPS products.

There’s reports emerging that a new zero day exists in Microsoft Exchange, and is being actively exploited in the wild

Thread to track issue follows: — Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) September 29, 2022

GTSC has released very few details regarding these zero-day bugs. Still, its researchers did reveal that the requests used in this exploit chain are similar to those used in attacks targeting the ProxyShell vulnerabilities.

The exploit works in two stages:

Requests with a similar format to the ProxyShell vulnerability: autodiscover/autodiscover.json?@evil.com/<Exchange-backend-endpoint>&Email=autodiscover/autodiscover.json%3f@evil.com. The use of the link above to access a component in the backend where the RCE could be implemented.

""The version number of these Exchange servers showed that the latest update had already installed, so an exploitation using Proxyshell vulnerability was impossible,"" the researchers said.

Temporary mitigation available

Until Microsoft releases security updates to address the two zero-days, GTSC shared temporary mitigation that would block attack attempts by adding a new IIS server rule using the URL Rewrite Rule module:

In Autodiscover at FrontEnd, select tab URL Rewrite, and then Request Blocking. Add string “.*autodiscover\.json.*\@.*Powershell.*“ to the URL Path. Condition input: Choose {REQUEST_URI}

""We recommend all organizations/enterprises around the world that are using Microsoft Exchange Server to check, review, and apply the above temporary remedy as soon as possible to avoid potential serious damages,"" GTSC added.

Admins who want to check if their Exchange servers have already been compromised using this exploit can run the following PowerShell command to scan IIS log files for indicators of compromise:

Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path <Path_IIS_Logs> -Filter ""*.log"" | Select-String -Pattern 'powershell.*autodiscover\.json.*\@.*200'

Singapore launches cybersecurity certification program to recognize good security practices

Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency (CSA) launched a new certification program to recognize enterprises that have adopted and implemented good cybersecurity practices. The certification comprises of two cybersecurity marks: Cyber Essentials, which recognizes small and medium enterprises that have put in place cyber hygiene measures, and Cyber Trust, a mark of distinction to recognize larger or more digitalized enterprises with comprehensive measures and practices.

To support enterprises in their journeys to attaining certification, the CSA also developed a toolkit for IT teams and curated an initial ecosystem of partners with product and service offerings that can help enterprises address requirements of the marks. “Supply chain cyberattacks will continue to proliferate in the digital space, and in time to come, companies could be required to demonstrate their cybersecurity posture when they conduct business as a way of providing greater assurance to their customers,” said David Koh, chief executive of CSA.

Singapore sets out licensing framework for cybersecurity service providers

Singapore’s CSA set out a licensing framework for cybersecurity service providers and established the Cybersecurity Services Regulation Office (CSRO) to administer it and facilitate liaisons with the industry and wider public on all licensing-related matters. The framework aims to better safeguard consumers’ interests and addresses the information asymmetry between consumers and cybersecurity service providers, along with improving service provider standards and standing over time, Singapore’s CSA stated.

It added that two types of cybersecurity service providers would be licensed – those providing penetration testing and managed security operations center monitoring services. “These two services are prioritized because service providers performing such services can have significant access into their clients’ computer systems and sensitive information,” the CSA wrote. “In the event that the access is abused, the client’s operations could be disrupted. In addition, these services are already widely available and adopted in the market, and hence have the potential to cause significant impact on the overall cybersecurity landscape.”

Australia launches REDSPICE to bolster national cybersecurity

The Australian federal government’s Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) announced the launch of the Resilience – Effects – Defence – SPace – Intelligence – Cyber – Enablers (REDSPICE) initiative to enhance the cyber resiliency and defense of national systems and critical infrastructure, with $9.9 billion (AUD) to be invested in bolstering Australia’s national cybersecurity capabilities over the next decade. Through REDSPICE, ASD said it will expand the range and sophistication of its intelligence, offensive, and defensive cyber capabilities. “REDSPICE is the necessary and timely change needed for ASD to continue its contribution to making Australia secure, in both peacetime and conflict,” wrote Rachel Noble, director general of ASD.

UK sets out new nuclear cybersecurity strategy

The UK government outlined plans for a new cybersecurity strategy to protect the nations’ nuclear sector. Its aim is to build a comprehensive understanding of current sector cybersecurity strengths and challenges with key objectives to be achieved by 2026, as part of its wider National Cyber Strategy 2022. In the 2022 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy, the UK government outlined the goal of creating a civil nuclear sector which effectively manages and mitigates cyber risk in a collaborative and mature manner, with resilience in responding to and recovering from incidents. The new plans seek to build on existing understanding surrounding nuclear cybersecurity and introduce four key objectives which the sector should achieve within the next four years:

Appropriately prioritizing cybersecurity as part of a holistic risk management approach, underpinned by a common risk understanding and outcome-focused regulation. Taking proactive action to mitigate supply chain cyber risks in the face of evolving threats, legacy challenges, and adoption of new technologies. Enhancing resilience by preparing for and responding collaboratively to cyber incidents to minimize impacts and recovery time. Collaborating to increase cyber maturity, develop cyber skills and promote a positive security culture.

These objectives will be delivered via several priority and supporting activities and overseen by a programmatic approach to delivery. These include Cyber Adversary Simulation (CyAS) assessments and other threat-informed testing activities across the sector’s critical IT and OT systems, baseline cybersecurity standards for the civil nuclear supply chain, and collaboration across the sector on third-party and component assurance and management.

Victoria state government invests $100,000 to train women in cybersecurity

The Victoria state government in Australia announced that it was investing $100,000 AUD in an initiative to train women with one year of experience in the IT sector or three years in cyber to either begin a career or prepare for leadership roles in cybersecurity. The initiative was launched in partnership with the Australian Women in Security Network (AWSN). The state government labelled the scheme as a program designed to improve female representation in the workforce, as the Australian Bureau of Statistics found women make up just 31% of local digital technology workers. The program, which began in July, includes specialist training, coaching and mentoring services, as well as attendance to workshops and networking events.

UK opens applications for Cyber Security Advisory Board

The UK government opened applications for membership of the Government Cyber Security Advisory Board (GCSAB). The aim of the GCSAB is to build on the success of the External Challenge Panel that brought industry and academic perspectives to support the development of the government’s wider Cyber Security Strategy, which was launched in January 2022 to help build a cyber-resilient public sector. The government stated that the GCSAB will be comprised of independent, external experts to build better links between government, the private sector, and academia, providing perspectives and input on addressing the challenges of government cybersecurity, as per a posting on its website. It invited candidates with cybersecurity expertise or competence or knowledge in the areas of strategy, standards, and assurance; governance, risk, and management program delivery; cyber detection and response technology; and cyber skills and culture to submit Expressions of Interest (EoI) for membership of the GCSAB, which will meet virtually every two months.

US proposals spell out 5G security advancements

The US government introduced a proposed five-step 5G Security Evaluation Process Investigation to address gaps in existing security assessment guidance and standards that arise from new features and services in 5G technologies. “The intent of this joint security evaluation process is to provide a uniform and flexible approach that federal agencies can use to evaluate, understand, and address security and resilience assessment gaps with their technology assessment standards and policies,” said Eric Goldstein, executive assistant director for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). “Such a process will provide assurance that the government enterprise system is protected and cybercriminals cannot gain backdoor entry into agency networks through 5G technology.” Specifically, the agencies involved seek to get ahead of the curve before any federal office conducts a security assessment to obtain authorization to operate (ATO). The five steps put forward were:

Define the federal 5G use case. Identify the assessment boundary. Identify security requirements. Map security requirements to federal guidance. Assess security guidance gaps and alternatives.

UK proposes new code of practice to enhance app security and privacy

The UK government called for input from the technology sector on enhancing security and privacy requirements for app stores and app development. The consultation period came in the wake of a new report from the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) that revealed that apps containing malicious malware or those that have been poorly developed are putting users at significant risk. The UK government said it therefore aims to establish a new code of practice which will set out baseline security and privacy requirements for apps. Under new proposals, app stores for smartphones, game consoles, TVs, and other smart devices could be asked to commit to a new code of practice to boost app security and privacy standards, which would be the first such measure in the world, stated a press release on the UK government’s website. “The proposed code would require stores to have a vulnerability reporting process for each app so flaws can be found and fixed quicker. They would need to share more security and privacy information in an accessible way including why an app needs access to users’ contacts and location,” it added.

June

Israel announces The Cyber-Dome project to elevate national cybersecurity

The Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD) outlined its new national cybersecurity project The Cyber-Dome – a big data and AI overall approach to proactive defense. Announced by Gaby Portnoy, director general of INCD, the project aims to diminish cyberattacks in the country by elevating national cybersecurity through new mechanisms in the national cyber perimeter. “The Cyber-Dome will also provide tools and services to elevate the protection of the national assets as a whole. It will synchronize nation-level real-time detection, analysis, and mitigation of threats,” Portnoy stated. “We need to protect our national assets in the best possible way and make cybersecurity protocols we use for critical infrastructure available for more sectorial organizations – government and private.”

Canada introduces new legislation to enhance cybersecurity

The Canadian government introduced proposed legislation to better protect Canadians and bolster cybersecurity across the financial, telecommunications, energy, and transportation sectors. Bill C-26, An Act Respecting Cyber Security (ARCS), sought to replace the Telecommunications Act to add security as a policy objective, bringing telecommunications in line with other critical sectors. “This will provide the government with the legal authority to mandate any necessary action to secure Canada’s telecommunications system. This includes prohibiting Canadian companies from using products and services from high-risk suppliers,” the government wrote. Furthermore, this legislation introduced the Critical Cyber Systems Protection Act (CCSPA) which lays a foundation for securing Canada’s critical infrastructure. “These legislative measures will help to further protect Canadians and defend our critical infrastructure in an evolving and increasingly complex digital environment,” commented Anita Anand, minister of national defense.

Germany bolsters cyber defenses in response to Russian cyberthreats

The German government announced plans to increase the nation’s cyber defenses in response to possible new threats from Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. New measures put forward by Interior Minister Nancy Faeser involve promoting cyber resilience among small and medium enterprises and businesses that provide critical services such as transport, food, health, energy, and water supply, along with the introduction of a secure central video conferencing system for the federal government. A centralized platform for the exchange of information on cyberattacks between state and federal structures was also outlined, as were plans to modernize IT infrastructure of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency and police. Commenting, Faeser said, “The sea change we are facing in view of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine requires a strategic repositioning and significant investment in our cybersecurity.”",cybersecurity,csoonline.com

Requests with a similar format to the ProxyShell vulnerability: autodiscover/autodiscover.json?@evil.com/<Exchange-backend-endpoint>&Email=autodiscover/autodiscover.json%3f@evil.com. The use of the link above to access a component in the backend where the RCE could be implemented.

""The version number of these Exchange servers showed that the latest update had already installed, so an exploitation using Proxyshell vulnerability was impossible,"" the researchers said.

Temporary mitigation available

Until Microsoft releases security updates to address the two zero-days, GTSC shared temporary mitigation that would block attack attempts by adding a new IIS server rule using the URL Rewrite Rule module:

In Autodiscover at FrontEnd, select tab URL Rewrite, and then Request Blocking. Add string “.*autodiscover\.json.*\@.*Powershell.*“ to the URL Path. Condition input: Choose {REQUEST_URI}

""We recommend all organizations/enterprises around the world that are using Microsoft Exchange Server to check, review, and apply the above temporary remedy as soon as possible to avoid potential serious damages,"" GTSC added.

Admins who want to check if their Exchange servers have already been compromised using this exploit can run the following PowerShell command to scan IIS log files for indicators of compromise:

Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path <Path_IIS_Logs> -Filter ""*.log"" | Select-String -Pattern 'powershell.*autodiscover\.json.*\@.*200'

Microsoft and ZDI spokespersons were not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today.

For the panel titled “OEM Visions for a Circular Economy,” hosted by ERI, Dillon addressed the expert panelists on the importance of responsible recycling and the role innovation and sustainability play in the industry. The discussion took a deep dive into what the Circular Economy means to electronics manufacturers and what they are doing to support it. Dillon assembled an all-star panel for the event, which took place on the main stage before a packed room.

The panelists included:

read more",https://www.securityweek.com/auth0-finds-no-breach-following-source-code-compromise,"Okta-owned Auth0 this week announced that it has not identified an intrusion into its environment after a third-party said they were in the possession of older source code repositories.

In late August, after Okta was informed by an individual that they possessed copies of certain Auth0 code repositories dating from October 2020 and earlier, the company launched an investigation that did not reveal a potential data breach.

The investigation, the company says, “confirmed that there was no evidence of unauthorized access to our environments, or those of our customers, nor any evidence of any data exfiltration or persistent access”.

Auth0 notes that it also decided to retain a cybersecurity forensics firm to investigate the claim, and that both investigations have arrived at the same conclusion.

Furthermore, the company says that it has taken the necessary precautions to ensure that the exposed code cannot be used to access its network or any customer environments.

“Our investigation has not revealed any customer impact from this event, and no action is required by our customers. Additionally, we confirm that the Auth0 service remains fully operational and secure,” the company says.

It has not shared any information on how the source code may have been obtained.

Auth0 offers an authentication and authorization platform that provides organizations with various customization and monitoring options, and with support for multi-factor authentication.

In May 2021, Okta completed a $6.5 billion acquisition of Auth0, which continues to operate as an independent business unit.

The hacker group has deployed malware which conducts the attack.

This latest variant of the campaign is being scrutinised by the cybersecurity company SentinelOne.

The cybersecurity company found out that the hacker group used decoy documents for advertising positions for the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange platform called Crypto.com and is carrying out the hacks accordingly.

The latest variant of the hacking campaign has been called “Operation In(ter)ception”. Reportedly, the phishing campaign only targets Mac users by far.

The malware used for the hacks has been found to be identical to the ones used in fake Coinbase job postings.

Last month, researchers observed and found out that Lazarus used fake Coinbase job openings to trick only macOS users into downloading malware.

How Did The Group Conduct Hacks On the Crypto.com Platform

This has been considered to be an orchestrated hack. These hackers have camouflaged malware as job postings from popular crypto exchanges.

This is conducted by using well-designed and legitimate-seeming PDF documents displaying advertising vacancies for various positions, such as Art Director-Concept Art (NFT) in Singapore.

According to a report from SentinelOne, this new crypto job lure included targeting other victims by contacting them on LinkedIn messaging by Lazarus.

Providing additional details regarding the hacker campaign, SentinelOne stated,

Although it is not clear at this stage how the malware is being distributed, earlier reports suggested that threat actors were attracting victims via targeted messaging on LinkedIn.

These two fake job advertisements are just the latest in a host of attacks which have been called Operation In(ter)ception, and which in turn is a part of a broader campaign which falls under the broader hacking operation called Operation Dream Job.

Less Clarity On How The Malware Is Being Distributed

The security company looking into this mentioned that it is still unclear as to how the malware is being circulated.

Considering the technicalities, SentinelOne said that the first stage dropper is a Mach-O binary, which is the same as a template binary that has been used in the Coinbase variant.

The first stage consists of creating a new folder in the user’s library that drops a persistence agent.

The primary purpose of the second stage is to extract and execute the third-stage binary, which acts as a downloader from the C2 server.

The advisory read,

The threat actors have made no effort to encrypt or obfuscate any of the binaries, possibly indicating short-term campaigns and/or little fear of detection by their targets.

SentinelOne also mentioned that Operation In(ter)ception also seems to be extending the targets from users of crypto exchange platforms to their employees, as it looks like “what may be a combined effort to conduct both espionage and cryptocurrency theft.”

The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, revealed on Thursday that in addition to completing a review of Australia’s privacy laws, the Albanese government will look to legislate “even more urgent reforms” later this year or in early 2023.

The immediate reforms could include penalties, safeguards on personal information and strengthening requirements for companies to notify customers of breaches.

On Thursday, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, endorsed changes to data retention laws.

Albanese told FiveAA Radio that requiring companies to dispose of data when they no longer need it, such as after a customer leaves a provider, was a “pretty commonsense proposal” and confirmed it was under consideration.

Earlier, Dreyfus told reporters in Canberra the government was considering whether companies “should be permitted to go on keeping data when the purpose of collecting it in the first place might have been no more than establishing someone’s identity”.

Checking a customer’s driver’s licence or passport number to establish their identity “should be the end, one might think, of the company keeping all that data”, he said.

“They don’t seem to me to have a valid reason for saying we need to keep that for the next decade.

“Obviously the more data that’s kept, the bigger a problem there is about keeping it safe, the bigger a problem there is about the potential damage that’s going to be done by a huge hack [like the one] that’s occurred here.”

Labor has talked up the need for tougher laws since the Optus attack affected up to 10 million customers, including 2.8 million people who had their licence or passport number leaked.

The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, has suggested reforms will include increasing the maximum penalties for data breaches – currently capped at $2.2m – and extending a power to set minimum cybersecurity standards to telcos.

On Thursday, Dreyfus told ABC radio the foreign minister had written to Optus asking it to pay for Australians’ replacement passports and the prime minister had “made very clear … it is going to be a matter for Optus to pay for costs incurred by Australians as a result of the data breach that has occurred”.

Dreyfus said Australians were “rightly concerned” about the exposure of personal information, and warned Optus it expects “continuing cooperation” from the telco.

Asked about privacy law reforms, Dreyfus replied: “It is a matter of urgency. We need to bring privacy laws … up to date, [and make them] fit for purpose for the digital age.”

The attorney general said he hoped to complete a “long-running review” of privacy laws by the end of 2022.

“We are also looking at even more urgent reforms we can make straight away to the Privacy Act to do things like increasing the safeguards that are already there that relate to personal information, security guidelines, and strengthening the notifiable data breaches scheme.

“We’re looking at what can be brought to parliament in the remaining sitting weeks and if possible pass this year or, if not this year, then early next year.”

The government is asking Optus to share data with banks and financial institutions so they “can take precautions to protect those Optus customers whose data has been stolen”, Dreyfus told ABC News Breakfast.

The attorney general said that “regrettably” Optus had omitted from its initial notification to customers that “some Medicare numbers in addition to passport numbers and driver’s licence numbers were included in the data breach”.

Guardian Australia understands the telecommunications industry is gearing up for changes to laws as a result of the breach, including beefed-up cybersecurity and privacy law which will put more pressure on the companies to ensure their security is up to scratch.

Simon Bush, chief executive of the Australian Information Industry Association, said the government’s privacy response should address the issues raised around the breach, particularly how long ID-check information is retained.

“The breach raised a lot of questions around people’s individual citizen’s privacy, and they’re legitimate questions, and they’re questions that both industry and government needs to look carefully at, and the Privacy Act review should be looking at these issues very seriously,” he said. “If you lose the trust of the citizen, then the government or the business doesn’t have a licence to operate.”

UNSW law researcher Tony Song said Australia should look to adopt laws similar to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation.

“Our current $2.2m limit [in corporate penalties for breaches] is nothing compared to the GDPR’s maximum of €20m or 4% of the firm’s worldwide annual revenue. For many large tech companies, that is still peanuts to them.”

Jocelinn Kang, a technical specialist at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the government should look at requiring organisations to store sensitive ID document details separately similar to the requirement for credit card providers. She said the government’s digital ID system could also play a role in minimising the data held by companies like Optus.

In a statement on Wednesday evening, Optus said it had identified 14,900 valid and unexpired Medicare ID numbers among the compromised customer records, as well as 22,000 expired numbers.

Customers with valid Medicare numbers will be contacted within 24 hours, and those with expired numbers in the coming days.

Optus parent company Singtel on Wednesday said: “We are deeply sorry to everyone affected by the data theft on our subsidiary Optus.”

“Singtel management and board are treating this incident very seriously and working closely with Optus to address what is a complex issue, holistically,” the company said in a statement.",cybersecurity,the guardian

If you’ve got a friend or family member who thinks they don’t have to worry at all about cybersecurity, pass along this article.

You’ve probably heard that Mac computers are somehow more resistant to viruses than their Windows counterparts. That’s been the conventional wisdom for years — but would you bet the safety of your personal files on it?

Think “Macs don’t get viruses”? Think again!

If only the old adage were true. The reality is a bit tougher — Macs are indeed susceptible to viruses, ransomware and other cyberthreats.

How did this myth get started? It’s due, in part, to the fact that years ago there just weren’t very many Macs out there in the world. Cybercriminals tended to focus their attention on Windows systems, because it was a more effective use of their time. Any viruses they designed to target Windows could be deployed against many more computers.

In terms of market share, Windows is still the reigning champion, but Macs have been steadily increasing in popularity for years. About 15% of all desktop/laptop computers are now running some version of macOS — that’s double the percentage of 10 years ago.

In response, cybercriminals have stepped up their attacks against Macs. New threats emerge every day, which is why some modern data backup and security solutions — like Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office — now provide native support for macOS.

Mac ransomware is a growing threat

You’ve probably seen ransomware quite a bit in the news recently. It’s currently the most popular type of malware, and Mac users are increasingly at risk.

One prime example of the growing danger is the UpdateAgent malware. While this threat first appeared in 2020, a new variant emerged earlier this year and introduced some new tricks.

By impersonating legitimate software and retrieving malicious instructions from a remote source, it managed to bypass the native protection from macOS’s Gatekeeper technology, which is designed to ensure that only trusted software is allowed to run.

It’s easy to assume that you’re “too small to target,” but unfortunately, that simply isn’t the case. Cybercriminals are taking advantage of advances in automation and other technologies to attack hundreds, even thousands of computers at once. Think of it like throwing out a big net: anyone could get caught.

From personal photos/videos to financial documents to freelance projects, most of us have significant amounts of valuable data on our home computers and mobile devices. Losing this would be devastating. And while data backups are a great idea, they’re not enough on their own to protect you from harm.

Most newer varieties of ransomware don’t just encrypt your data — they actually steal copies of it first, and upload them to a remote server. This gives cybercriminals extra leverage. Even if you refuse to pay the ransom (because you can just restore the data from backup), they may threaten to release your personal files online, or use them to plan future attacks.

There are also many cyberthreats that are “OS-agnostic,” meaning that they don’t care what operating system you’re using. For instance:

Attacks on webbased apps and services (like Microsoft 365) could lead to data loss

Phishing emails can impact anyone, anytime, causing you to download a malicious attachment or inadvertently reveal sensitive information — no matter whether you’re on a Windows computer, a Mac or even your smartphone.

Even offline events, like hardware damage or having your laptop stolen, can cause you to lose valuable files, photos and other data if they’re not safely backed up.

One thing should be clear: for Macs as well as Windows PCs, cybersecurity has become a basic need.

Protect your Mac with these tips

The quickest way to step up protection for your Mac is to make sure you’re following basic “best practices” for cybersecurity. You remember them. They are the ones you spend hours reminding everyone else to follow:

Avoiding clicking on email attachments or links from unknown senders

Installing the latest software updates as soon as they’re available

Never bypassing security settings to install apps if you’re not 100% certain of their safety

Still, even the tech-savviest among us can make mistakes or otherwise fall victim to ransomware and other cyberthreats. That’s why it’s so important to invest in cybersecurity and data backup tools, to block malware before it can harm your data — and to restore that data safely when the need arises.

Whether you need to secure your Mac, your Windows PC or even iOS and Android devices, Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office provides complete protection for your data and digital life.

It's the only personal solution with a unique integration of cybersecurity and backup technologies. Safeguard your sensitive data against all modern threats — like cutting-edge cyberattacks, accidental deletion, disk failure and device loss. Enjoy peace of mind with Acronis.

183,More Than Half of Security Pros Say Risks Higher in Cloud Than On Premise,,29/09/2022,"Report shows that forty-five percent of companies have had four or more cloud incidents in the last year
read more",https://www.securityweek.com/more-half-security-pros-say-risks-higher-cloud-premise,"Report shows that forty-five percent of companies have had four or more cloud incidents in the last year

A recent survey from machine identity solutions provider Venafi aimed to explore the complexity of cloud environments and the resulting impact on cybersecurity

Venafi surveyed 1,101 security decision makers (SDMs) in firms with more than 1,000 employees and found that eighty-one percent of companies have experienced a cloud security incident in the last year. Forty-five percent have suffered at least four security incidents in the same period. More than half of security decision makers believe that security risks are higher in the cloud than on-premise.

Twenty-four percent of the firms have more than 10,000 employees. Ninety-two percent of the SDMs are at manager level or above, with 49% at c-suite level or higher.

Most of the firms surveyed believe the underlying issue is the increasing complexity of their cloud deployments. Since these companies already host 41% of their applications in the cloud, and expect to increase this to 57% over the next 18 months, the problem is only likely to worsen in the future.

Kevin Bocek, VP of security strategy and threat intelligence at Venafi, believes, “The ripest target of attack in the cloud is identity management, especially machine identities. Each of these cloud services, containers, Kubernetes clusters and microservices need an authenticated machine identity – such as a TLS certificate – to communicate securely. If any of these identities is compromised or misconfigured, it dramatically increases security and operational risks.”

Respondents reported that the most common cloud incidents are security incidents during runtime (34%), unauthorized access (33%), misconfigurations (32%), vulnerabilities that have not been remediated (24%), and failed audits (19%).

Their primary operational concerns are hijacking of accounts, services or traffic (35%), malware or ransomware (31%), privacy/data access issues, such as those from GDPR (31%), unauthorized access (28%), and nation state attacks (26%).

The real problem lies with the often-difficult relationship between developers and security teams. Developers are required to work at speed, and security teams often have little visibility into their work. Containers are now the primary machine context in cloud native systems, using resources that don’t need to be hosted in a single location.

“This means container security is formulated around what development teams and operations teams regard as best practice,” reports Venafi in an associated blog, “and yet this will not always align with conventional enterprise security policy.”

The survey also looked at who currently has responsibility for securing cloud-based applications. Enterprise security teams, at 25%, are the most likely to manage app security in the cloud. This is followed by operations teams responsible for cloud infrastructure (23%), a collaborative effort shared between multiple teams (22%), developers writing cloud applications (16%) and DevSecOps teams (10%).

However, the sheer quantity of continuing security incidents suggests that none of these approaches is fully adequate. Venafi also asked the respondents who they thought should be responsible for cloud-based app security – and again, there is no single view. Twenty-four percent of respondents believe it should be shared between cloud infrastructure operations teams and enterprise security teams, 22% believe it should be shared across multiple teams, 16% believe responsibility should be down to the developers writing the cloud applications, and 14% think it should be the responsibility of the DevSecOps teams.

Sharing responsibility between different teams is often inefficient because each team has different priorities and objectives. “Security teams want to collaborate and share responsibility with the developers who are cloud experts, but all too often they’re left out of cloud security decisions,” says Bocek in the blog. “Developers are making cloud native tooling and architecture decisions that decide approaches to security without involving security teams. And we can already see the results of that approach: security incidents in the cloud are rapidly growing.”

His, and Venafi’s solution is to implement a control plane for machine identity. He calls it, “A perfect example of a new security model created specifically for cloud computing. This approach embeds security into developer processes and allows security teams to protect the business without slowing down engineers.”

read more",https://www.securityweek.com/nsa-cyber-specialist-army-doctor-charged-us-spying-cases,"A cyber specialist who worked at the US National Security Agency and an army doctor and his wife were charged Thursday in separate cases with seeking to sell US secrets to foreign governments.

In one case, cybersecurity expert Jareh Sebastian Dalke, 30, spent less than four weeks working at the NSA, the government's huge and powerful signals intelligence agency, before he suddenly quit, citing family problems at the end of June.

In the few weeks he was at the NSA, he printed out top secret documents, and after leaving he offered them for sale in encrypted online communications to what he thought was an agent of a foreign government.

But he was actually dealing with an undercover FBI agent.

The foreign government was not identified by the Justice Department.

But an FBI affidavit filed in court pointed to Russia, saying that Dalke was communicating via a dark web website created by the Russian international intelligence agency, the SVR, to attract leakers and turncoats.

Dalke, who the charges said had deep financial problems and had expressed unhappiness with American society, was provided two initial cryptocurrency payments worth more than $4,900, in exchange for evidence that he had top secret information.

Dalke asked for $85,000 for full documents, saying he had $237,000 in debts.

After he was paid another $11,422 worth of cryptocurrency, he and the undercover agent arranged for an electronic handover of documents in Denver, Colorado on Thursday.

Dalke was arrested at the handover location, and has been charged with three violations of the Espionage Act.

If convicted he faces a possible sentence of death or life in prison.

In a second case announced Thursday, a doctor for the US Army, Major Jamie Lee Henry, and his wife, Anna Gabrielian, a Russian-speaking instructor of anesthesiology at Johns Hopkins University, were charged with offering to sell the health information of US military and government personnel to Russia. They were apparently motivated by the Ukraine war.

An undercover FBI agent contacted Gabrielian in August after she reached out to the Russian Embassy in Washington offering the couple's assistance, according to the indictment.

In an August 17 meeting, Gabrielian told the agent that ""she was motivated by patriotism toward Russia,"" the indictment said.

Henry meanwhile told the agent that ""he was committed to assisting Russia,"" and wanted to join the Russian army in Ukraine, it said.

""The United States is using Ukrainians as a proxy for their own hatred toward Russia,"" he told the agent, according to the indictment.

The two were charged with conspiracy and multiple counts of illegally disclosing private health information.

Conspiracy charges can bring up to 20 years in prison.",cybersecurity,securityweek.com

Australia could have tough new data protection laws in place this year in an urgent response to a cyberattack on a telecommunications company that stole the personal data of 9.8 million customers, the attorney-general said on Thursday.

Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said the government would make “urgent reforms” to the Privacy Act following the unprecedented hack last week on Optus, Australia’s second-largest wireless carrier.

Dreyfus said “I think it’s possible” for the law to be changed in the four remaining weeks that Parliament is scheduled to sit this year.

""I’m going to be looking very hard over the next four weeks at whether or not we can get reforms to the Privacy Act into the Parliament before the end of the year,” Dreyfus told reporters. Parliament next sits on Oct. 25.

Dreyfus said penalties for failing to protect personal data had to be increased so that corporate boards could not dismiss fines as a “cost of doing business.”

The “absolutely huge amounts” of customer data companies held for years would have to be justified under the amended law, Dreyfus said.

“Companies need to look at data storage not as an asset, but as a liability or a potential liability,” Dreyfus said.

“For too long we have had companies solely looking at data as an asset that they can use commercially,” he added.

The government blames lax cybersecurity at Optus, a subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., also known as Singtel, for the theft of current and former customers’ personal information.

The data included passport, driver’s license and national health care identification numbers which could be used for identity theft and fraud.

Authorities are critical of Optus’s initial failure to disclose that Medicare numbers were among the stolen data. That became apparent on Tuesday when the hacker dumped the records of 10,000 customers on the dark web — six days after Optus discovered the cyberattack.

The urgent legislative response is separate from a broader review of the Privacy Act that began three years ago. The law was passed in 1988 and critics argue it badly needs to be adapted to the digital age.

Optus could potentially be fined a maximum 2 million Australian dollars ($1.3 million) for breaching the Privacy Act, the government said.

It could be fined hundreds of millions of dollars over a similar security breach under European Union laws, the government said.

Submissions to the Privacy Act review have suggested penalties for breaches equivalent to 10% of revenue from Australian operations.

Optus chief executive executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin has argued against increased fines, telling Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday: “Honestly, I’m not sure what penalties benefit anybody.”

Optus maintains it was the target of a sophisticated cyberattack that penetrated several layers of security.",cybersecurity,independent

A newly discovered cross-platform piece of malware called 'Chaos' is spreading on Linux and Windows systems to amass resources for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against online gaming firms, crypto exchanges, and rival 'stressor' sites renting DDoS-as-a-service.

The malware, which was written in Go – Google's popular cloud and systems programming language – targets Windows and Linux operating systems, and supports multiple chip architectures that allow it to reside on routers, IoT devices, smartphones, and enterprise servers. These include x86, x86-64, AMD64, MIPS, MIPS64, ARMv5-ARMv8, AArch64 and PowerPC, according to Black Lotus Labs, the cybersecurity unit of US internet infrastructure firm Lumen.

Chaos exploits known but unpatched vulnerabilities in firewall devices to gain a foothold in a network. These include critical remote code execution flaws affecting Huawei's HG532 wireless routers for homes and small businesses (CVE-2017-17215) and a newer flaw in Zyxel's routers (CVE-2022-30525).

Also: The scary future of the internet: How the tech of tomorrow will pose even bigger cybersecurity threats

Lumen suggests the malware was created by Chinese actors who picked Go to craft malware that was difficult to reverse engineer. So far it has found 100 samples of Chaos, which allows its operators to profile a host environment, send remote commands to a device, add new capabilities, spread across a network by guessing SSH private keys, and launch DDoS attacks.

The malware has recently been used for DDoS attacks targeting sites in the gaming, financial services and technology, and media and entertainment sectors. It has also targeted a cryptocurrency exchange.

""Given the suitability of the Chaos malware to operate across a range of consumer and enterprise devices, its multipurpose functionality and the stealth profile of the network infrastructure behind it, we assess with moderate confidence this activity is the work of a cybercriminal actor that is cultivating a network of infected devices to leverage for initial access, DDoS attacks and crypto mining,"" Lumen notes.

The firm believes Chaos is a new version of the Kaiji IoT malware, discovered by Linux-focused security researcher MalwareMustDie in 2020.

Kaiji was notable because it was written in Go, whereas most other IoT malware until then had been written in C or C++ – two widely used languages for programming software for 'bare metal' and embedded systems.

According to Lumen, Chaos is installed on a host device and then communicates with the embedded command and control (C2) server. The host receives several staging commands to propagate via a known vulnerability or SSH private keys.

""Based on the first set of commands, the host may receive a number of additional execution commands including performing propagation via the designated CVE and specified target lists, further exploitation of the current target, launching a specific type of DDoS attack against a specified domain or IP and port, and performing crypto mining,"" Lumen notes.

So far, Chaos infections are concentrated in Europe, but Lumen's maps also show 'hotspots' in North and South America, as well as Asia Pacific. No bots have been observed in Australia or New Zealand. Lumen saw just over 100 Chaos nodes in September, up from under 20 in April, with a big jump (~40 to ~90) between July and August.

The Chaos DDoS attacks used the UDP and TCP/SYN protocols across multiple ports. In September, the Chaos actors targeted a gaming site. Also, in mid-August, a DDoS-as-a-service provider that sells CAPTCHA bypass and 'unique' transport layer DDoS capabilities was targeted.",cybersecurity,zdnet

191,BEC attacks: Most victims aren't using multi-factor authentication – apply it now and stay safe,https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/3848ae02a180ed6cc264bc715a003817742c93db/2022/09/29/9bd6c8a1-50d6-4e45-bd95-aa18fbf24197/a-woman-looking-concerned-while-using-a-laptop-in-an-office.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,29/09/2022,Business Email Compromise (BEC) scammers are gaining access to real accounts which they're using to dupe victims into sending payments. One change could help to stop it.,https://www.zdnet.com/article/bec-attacks-most-victims-arent-using-multi-factor-authentication-apply-it-now-and-stay-safe/,"Image: Getty/LaylaBird

There has been a big rise in business email compromise (BEC) attacks – and most victims work at organisations that weren't using multi-factor authentication (MFA) to secure their accounts.

BEC attacks are one of the most lucrative forms of cyber crime: according to the FBI, the combined total lost is over $43 billion and counting, with attacks reported in at least 177 countries.

These attacks are relatively simple for cyber criminals to carry out – all they need is access to an email account and some patience as they try to trick victims into making financial transfers under false presences. This commonly involves sending messages to employees, purportedly from their boss or a colleague, that suggest a payment – often very large – must be made quickly in order to secure an important business deal.

Also: The biggest cyber-crime threat is also the one that nobody wants to talk about

More advanced BEC attacks hack into a company account and use a legitimate email address to make the payment request.

It's even been known for scammers to monitor inboxes for long periods of time, only choosing to strike when a real business transaction is about to be made – at which point they cut in and direct the payment to their own account.

With money to be made in this way, cyber criminals are increasingly turning towards BEC campaigns and businesses are falling victim. According to cybersecurity analysts at Arctic Wolf, the number of BEC attacks to which they have responded doubled between January-March and April-June – and these attacks accounted for over a third of all incidents investigated.

There was a common theme among many of the victims: according to incident responders, 80% of the organisations that fell victim to BEC attacks didn't have MFA in place.

Multi-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security for email accounts and cloud application suites, requiring the user to verify that it really was them who logged into the account, helping to protect against unauthorised intrusions – even if the attacker has the correct username and password.

Organisations that ignore MFA are leaving themselves open to BEC campaigns and other cyberattacks – despite repeated recommendations from cybersecurity agencies that it should be applied. So, why aren't they using it?

""MFA requires careful planning and coordination to implement successfully, ensuring that organizations can continue to operate without disruption. Because users require training in how to use the MFA system, this may be difficult for some organisations,"" Adrian Korn, manager of threat intelligence research at Arctic Wolf Labs, told ZDNET.

""In addition, configuring and testing a new MFA deployment across an organisation can place a heavy burden on already strained IT departments,"" he added.

Also: The scary future of the internet: How the tech of tomorrow will pose even bigger cybersecurity threats

Despite these potential restraints, applying MFA to all user accounts is one of the most significant things organisations can do to help protect their employees and their network from cyberattacks – if they're set up correctly.

""Organisations should plan their MFA deployments out well in advance to account for technical hiccups they may encounter. In addition, organisations should take time to ensure that MFA configurations are tested ahead of prime time and that users are well-trained on how to use the new MFA platform of choice,"" said Korn.

There different methods which organisations can use to provide staff with MFA. One of the most common is by using identity and access management software or authenticator apps to help manage account security by requiring login attempts to be verified by with the use of an alert sent to smartphone mobile application. Only after the push alert or code has been accepted will the user be able to login to their account.

Another way of providing users with MFA is by providing them with a hardware key which must be plugged into the device being used to login to the account before it can be accessed.

But while MFA does help to prevent cyberattacks, it isn't infallible and determined cyber criminals are finding ways to bypass it.

With BEC attacks using social engineering to trick people into thinking they're doing the right thing, it's also important for organisations to train their employees to detect when a request – even if it comes from a legitimate account – could be suspicious.

""Users should be trained to recognise suspicious financial requests. If something feels off, users should heed that instinct and inquire further. Urgent financial requests should be validated through additional means before finalising major transactions,"" said Korn.

194,EU proposes new liability rules around AI tech to protect consumers - SiliconRepublic.com,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AdobeStock_412876027.jpeg,29/09/2022,"The current EU rules around product liability are more than 40 years old, meaning they do not cover harm caused by drones and other AI tech.",https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/eu-ai-product-liability-tech-rules,"The current EU rules around product liability are more than 40 years old, meaning they do not cover harm caused by drones and other AI tech.

The European Commission has outlined a set of new proposals to enable people who are harmed by AI tech products to seek and receive compensation.

The proposals were published today (28 September). They are designed to comply with the EU’s 2021 AI Act proposal, which set out a framework for trust in AI-related technology.

Today’s AI Liability Directive aims to provide a clear and comprehensive structure for all Europeans to claim compensation in the event they are harmed by AI tech products, such as drones and robots.

The EU’s directive includes rules for businesses and consumers alike to abide by. Those who are harmed by AI products or tech can seek compensation just as they would if they were in harmed any other way.

The rules will make it easier for people who have been discriminated against by AI technology as part of the recruitment process, for example, to pursue legal action.

An example of harm that may be caused by tech products is data loss. Robots, drones, smart-home systems and other similar digital products must also comply with cybersecurity regulations around addressing vulnerabilities.

The directive builds on existing rules that manufacturers must follow around unsafe products ­– no matter how high or low-tech they are.

It is proposing a number of different strategies to modernise and adapt liability rules specifically for digital products. The existing rules around product liability in the EU are almost 40 years old, and do not cover advanced technologies such as AI.

European commissioner for internal market, Thierry Breton, said that the existing rules have “been a cornerstone of the internal market for four decades”.

“Today’s proposal will make it fit to respond to the challenges of the decades to come. The new rules will reflect global value chains, foster innovation and consumer trust, and provide stronger legal certainty for businesses involved in the green and digital transition.”

Vice-president for values and transparency, Věra Jourová, said that for AI tech to thrive in the EU, it is important for people to trust digital innovation.

She added that the new proposals would give customers “tools for remedies in case of damage caused by AI so that they have the same level of protection as with traditional technologies”. The rules will also “ensure legal certainty” for the EU’s internal market.

As well as consumer protection, the proposals are designed to foster innovation. They have laid down guarantees for the AI sector through the introduction of measures such as the right to fight a liability claim based on a presumption of causality.

The AI Liability Directive will need to be agreed with EU countries and lawmakers before it can become law.

While other solutions on the market claim to offer VPN usage insights, Nodify is the only offering that provides a granular look into which VPNs are being used across all devices to weed out bad actors and allow legitimate services to continue.

As tech providers expand their offerings and provide new safety features to users, Nodify gives organizations an unmatched level of detail around VPN traffic, usage and intent, enabling cybersecurity teams to understand the level of threat such traffic poses and set policies around that traffic.

“With the growing interest in personal privacy on the web, we’ve seen many consumers utilizing VPNs for legitimate reasons, but now more and more people are leveraging the anonymity around VPNs to cloak their location and bypass geographic boundaries set by today’s leading service providers,” said Jerrod Stoller, President of Digital Envoy, parent company of Digital Element.

“Security professionals need to understand the nuances around VPN usage on their platforms. For example, users who have opted to hide their personal information may not necessarily be trying to torrent illegal data from a remote location. Determining who is granted and denied access depends entirely on the granular data available in Nodify.”

Following the launch of Nodify in April 2022, Digital Element has introduced a new suite of updates, keeping the product at the forefront of VPN data reporting with the most extensive VPN detection system available. Notable updates include:

Higher frequency : With proxy ISP and VPNs changing rapidly, Nodify data is collected on an hourly basis and provides customers with a daily update on usage.

: With proxy ISP and VPNs changing rapidly, Nodify data is collected on an hourly basis and provides customers with a daily update on usage. Deeper insights : Going beyond the generic VPN collection, Nodify provides users with critical insights into the VPN user, including services provided by the VPN provider such as “no logging,” “multihop,” and “corporate.” These fields help clients determine the good vs the bad based on their use case.

: Going beyond the generic VPN collection, Nodify provides users with critical insights into the VPN user, including services provided by the VPN provider such as “no logging,” “multihop,” and “corporate.” These fields help clients determine the good vs the bad based on their use case. Ease of use: Nodify has a user interface that allows clients to quickly get a complete understanding of any VPN provider through a simple web dashboard.

“GPS spoofing has become a major pain point for industries ranging from streaming to gaming services. With everything from third-party apps to full-service providers now offering VPN services, it has become harder for providers to delineate what devices should be granted access. Still, accurate identification remains critical to their success,” said Jonathan Tomek, VP of Research and Development at Digital Element. “Because Nodify is API-based, we’re able to provide that granular data in the moments that matter the most. Users aren’t limited to just relying on GPS data from a phone that can easily be spoofed.”",cybersecurity,help net security

In addition to endpoint security, MSPs can now access vulnerability assessment, patch management and Domain Name System (DNS) filtering from Malwarebytes OneView.

“At Malwarebytes, we aim to serve the underserved, which is what our MSP partners are doing every day for SMBs,” said Brian Thomas, Vice President of Worldwide MSP & Channel Programs at Malwarebytes. “I joined Malwarebytes with ambitious plans that are coming to life through our amazing team and unwavering commitment to help both new and existing MSP partners keep their clients safe while catapulting their businesses to new heights.”

Delivering cybersecurity services and keeping customer environments free from malware requires a skilled team that can provide 24×7 coverage. Yet, many MSPs face constrained staff resources, skyrocketing costs and complexities of managing multiple solutions to uncover hidden threats. Today’s MSPs require streamlined and simplified solutions to help them keep pace.

The Malwarebytes OneView platform empowers MSPs to deliver endpoint security products that reduce customer malware infections and ransomware exposure. The platform allows security analysts of all skill levels to be effective from a centralized cloud-based console. With different levels of protection capabilities and threat prevention modules, MSPs can offer the right product or service to each customer, tailored to their specific needs.

This quarter, Malwarebytes has continued to build upon OneView, adding three new modules that simplify breach prevention within the same cloud interface MSPs already trust for detection and remediation:

Vulnerability Assessment, which helps users understand exposure, identify vulnerabilities, and prioritize actions to update defenses across device and server operating systems and a wide range of third-party applications.

“The continued expansion of the OneView platform empowers us to help our customers with enhanced protection modules and expert support, reducing investments in time and resources needed to protect their organizations against increasingly complex vulnerabilities,” said Daniel Mitchell, CEO of Alt-Tech.

“Our partnership with Malwarebytes means stronger and simpler protection for our SMB customers, helping them successfully navigate potential threats.”, Mitchell continued.

Malwarebytes’ initial MSP Program and OneView showed significant traction, resulting in over 250% YOY growth, with more than 2,700 new global MSP partners and strategic partnerships with Addigy, Atera, ConnectWise, Datto, GCN Group, Kaseya, Sherweb, TeamViewer and regional partner Soft Solutions.

Based on business demand and future growth projections, Malwarebytes added more than 30 employees in the last six months across the MSP team, including Nadia Karatsoreos who is dedicated to empowering MSPs to profitably grow their businesses. The company plans to continue expanding the MSP Program with further product innovation as well as additional resources and training.

“I am thrilled to be joining the Malwarebytes team during this pivotal time,” said Nadia Karatsoreos, Senior MSP Growth Strategist at Malwarebytes.

“MSPs have been tasked with keeping their clients safe from cyber threats which is not an easy feat. They not only need the tools but also a supportive vendor so they can confidently sell and serve their customers. I’m so excited that I get to continue to help MSPs grow their businesses.”, Karatsoreos continued.",cybersecurity,help net security

Explore incident response services and playbooks to strengthen your cyber defenses.,https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/ciso/22/i/incident-response-services.html,"Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2022 Series

No matter the size of a business, it faces the risk of a cyberattack. Over 50% of organizations experienced a cyberattack. And while proactive protection is ideal, there is no silver bullet when it comes to security—meaning you should plan for incident response as well. Yet, 63% of C-level executives in the US do not have an incident response plan, according to a report by Shred-It.

That’s where an incident response team comes into play. This article provides a high-level overview of incident response services and planning, as well as tips to make an informed vendor choice.

What are incident response services?

Incident response is a set of information security policies and procedures that can be leveraged to detect, respond, and eliminate cyberattacks. The goal is to minimize the scope of an attack and improve recovery time by conducting forensic analysis. In turn, businesses can achieve a higher level of cybersecurity maturity by analyzing the cause of the breach to strengthen their systems against future incidents.

There are three main types of incident response teams which vary slightly:

Computer security incident response team (CSIRT): Handles computer security incidents with a cross-functional business team.

Computer emergency response team (CERT): Focuses on partnerships with government, law enforcement, academia, and industry.

Security operations center (SOC): Responsible for directing the incident response plan in addition to other general security tasks.

A typical incident response team is composed of a manager (team leader), communications liaison (coordinator), a lead investigator, analysts, researchers, and legal representatives. Organizations can build their own in-house incident response team or leverage a third-party service.

Given the large cybersecurity skills gap, hiring and training staff may be a challenge, more businesses are opting for a third-party incident response service. Global Incident Response Service Market research report forecasts that the incident response market will grow by nearly 20% between 2022-2028.

Creating an incident response playbook

Some services will offer to create an incident response playbook or plan. But to truly optimize a service, CISOs/security leaders should own the playbook because they know their risk, operational flows, and security needs best.

Establishing an incident response playbook will surface any security gaps to address, thereby enhancing your cybersecurity posture. It can also help enterprises obtain/renew cyber insurance coverage as carriers are looking for demonstrated cyber maturity.

The Star Atlas: Showroom demo on the store gives a glimpse into the real-time game environment that players can look forward to in Star Atlas. The downloadable pre-alpha demo client combines blockchain with UE5’s Nanite, Lumen, and other cutting-edge graphics technology to deliver cinematic quality video game visuals, the company said.

“With this first pre-alpha Unreal Engine 5 module release on the Epic Games Store, Star Atlas continues to pave the way for mass adoption of Web3 gaming,” said Danny Floyd, chief product officer of ATMTA, in a statement. “By being very early to fully utilize the Epic Games game engine’s advanced all-new technologies like Nanite and Lumen, we are setting the worldwide standards for the next generation of

triple-A gaming. With every single pixel and texture expertly placed in the environment, we achieve the best immersive experience with a look and feel that rivals reality itself.”

ATMTA is aiming for a triple-A Star Atlas blockchain game.

It allows players to display the assets that they fully own. The full Showroom with expanded functionality is aimed for release in the fourth quarter of 2022. You can obtain an access key to the pre-alpha demo by joining the Star Atlas metaverse, selecting a faction, choosing your ship, and enrolling it in your faction’s fleet.

Matt Sorg, head of partner engineering at the Solana Foundation, said in a statement, “Star Atlas is a pioneer that is bolstering the entire Solana ecosystem. With an 80% reduction in development time and cost compared to building the functionality from scratch, Star Atlas is supporting and expediting the development of high-quality Solana games and lowering the barrier of entry for studios new to blockchain gaming and Solana.”

ATMTA also has a Foundation Software Development Kit (F-Kit). It enables developers to do quick and simple integration of Unreal Engine 5 with the Solana blockchain. By sharing with developers worldwide, Star Atlas is making it easier than ever for studios to build on the Solana blockchain, the company said.

Yat Siu, executive chairman of Animoca Brands (and a speaker at our upcoming GamesBeat Summit Next 2022 event), said in a statement, “Channeling the spirit of Web3, the Star Atlas F-kit paves the way for mass adoption of decentralized gaming. It instantly renders the open metaverse accessible to hundreds of millions of new entrants and enables anyone to build immersive experiences themselves, creating more opportunities through digital ownership and by giving game studios and publishers the ability to integrate the Solana blockchain into high-quality projects built on the Unreal Engine.”

Star Atlas graphic novel.

The company also revealed Star Atlas: Core, an episodic graphic novel that brings the Star Atlas metaverse, its lore, and characters to the game’s audience.

Tim McBurnie, lead artist at ATMTA, said the graphic novel takes you on a journey of a lifetime in the form of individual chapters that mark key developments in the Star Atlas lore and deepens the reader’s understanding of the Star Atlas metaverse.

Star Atlas’ economic architecture.

ATMTA also revealed Atlas Locking, a new feature in the Star Atlas DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) interface that makes the galactic economy and its marketplace even more interwoven with the governance layer. Much like the recently announced Polis Locking, players can now lock their Atlas tokens for up to five years. Dan Park said during the event that the core governance framework is in place and it will support a sustainable DAO.

Star Atlas has hundreds of thousands of followers in its Discord community and ATMTA has hundreds of employees, thanks to sales of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Wagner described the economic architecture above for Star Atlas. This is important since many NFT economies that are poorly designed result in a sudden burst in activity followed by a long slide in player numbers.

In this case, the marketplace becomes a driver of revenue into the DAO, thanks to trading fees. The majority of the economy is expected to be assets earned through gameplay. The DAO takes a 33% fee in marketplace transactions. Fees can be reduced by taking part in the Atlas Locker, where tokens are locked over a period of time.

“We’ve now completed one of our core architectural loops,” he said. “This is a huge win for all of us.”",blockchain,venturebeat

Twitter expressed concern in the past that Musk could use its internal data to build a competitor.

The texts were made public in the discovery process during Musk's court battle with Twitter.

Elon Musk shared an idea for a potential Twitter competitor with his brother Kimbal Musk ahead of offering to purchase the company, according to a series of private texts that were released amid Musk's court battle with Twitter.

""I think a new social media company is needed that is based on a blockchain and includes payments,"" Musk texted Kimbal Musk on April 10, the same day he announced he would no longer be joining Twitter's board of directors.

The billionaire had outlined his idea for the social media company the day before.

""I have an idea for a blockchain social media system that does both payments and short text messages/links like Twitter,"" Musk texted Kimbal Musk on April 9. ""You have to pay a tiny amount to register your message on the chain, which will cut out the vest majority of spam and bots. There is no throat to choke, so free speech is guaranteed.""

Musk said the site would have a ""massive real-time database"" that would keep permanent copies of messages and followers and a ""Twitter-like app on your phone"" that can access the database in the cloud.

""This could be massive,"" Musk texted his younger brother.

A few days after sending the messages, Musk offered to buy Twitter for $44 billion.

Kimbal Musk appeared to support the idea, telling his brother it could be a social media company that cuts back on ads by allowing users to ""pay for use"" and could allow users to vote off scam accounts.

""I'd love to learn more,"" Kimbal Musk responded at the time. ""I've dug deep on Web3 (not crypto as much) and the voting powers are amazing and verified. Lots you could do here for this as well.""

""It drives me crazy when I see people promoting the scam that you're giving away Bitcoin,"" Kimbal Musk wrote. ""Lots of bad people out there.""

The two brothers appeared to meet up to discuss the idea, according to a text from Kimbal Musk on April 11. Musk's righthand man Jared Birchall later presented Musk with recommendations for a software engineer ""to speak with about the blockchain idea"" on April 21.

""Great to hang yesterday,"" Kimbal Musk said. ""I'd love to help think through the structure of the Doge social media idea. Let me know how I can help.""

But, the conversation around a ""Doge"" social media platform does not appear again in the publicly available text messages.

Twitter has expressed concern in its lawsuit against Musk that the billionaire would use internal data from the company to build a competitor. In August, the Tesla CEO teased his blank website ""X.com"" as a potential Twitter competitor.

The text messages were revealed as a part of a trove of unredacted messages between Musk and several of Silicon Valley's most powerful players, including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The messages are part of the pretrial discovery process in the court battle between Twitter and Musk.

The five-day trial that will determine whether Musk will be forced to buy Twitter is set to start on October 17.",blockchain,business insider

MILAN, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Shared mobility start-up Etioca aims to list on the stock market in the United States in spring, its co-CEO said on Thursday as it unveiled a prototype of its fully-electric seven-seater plus driver taxi in Milan.

Founded and led by Israeli engineer Mark Ishakov and headquartered in Gibraltar, Etioca will not sell its taxis but has a business model based on fees paid by drivers to use them and on other services including media advertising and blockchain.

""Vehicles are not for sale, they'll be given to drivers for use under a comprehensive fee,"" Co-CEO Roberto Fiorello said, adding Etioca currently planned to generate revenue of around $1 billion for every 15,000 vehicles produced.

""We want to list at Nasdaq,"" he said.

Etioca has hired Chardan, a New York-based investment bank, to advise it on the process, it said in a statement.

The company said it plans to invest around $1.2 billion over the next three years and aimed to start production between the end of 2024 and early 2025, with a target of 45,000 vehicles in 2025 and 100,000 in 2027.

Renowned Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro will help Etioca develop its vans, which are fitted with battery-swapping technology and a modular platform allowing them to serve several purposes, including as ambulances and for firefighting, police or defence vehicles.

The company said it was currently in discussions over around 90,000 pre-orders in Italy, Israel and Latvia, adding that it is negotiating a deal with an Italian partner to use an existing facility to speed up production times.

Double Jump Tokyo announced the news earlier this week, where it shared in a Medium post that the game would be based on the Sangokushi Taisen series, a real-time strategy game predominantly played on arcades in Japan that uses real, physical cards to play with.

The Sangokushi Taisen series is based on the classic 14th century Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, where players face off against their opponents, attempting to attack the enemy's castle, with the player who has the most health winning the battle.

In a statement, Double Jump Tokyo CEO and founder Hironobu Ueno spoke of the Oasys chain the game will use, saying, it ""aims to solve obstacles for gamers, offering fast transactions and zero gas fees and providing users with a more comfortable gameplay experience.""

No details on what the game is actually going to be like were provided in the Medium post, the announcement more being about the incorporation of blockchain than anything else.

Square Enix also announced its involvement with the Oasys blockchain platform earlier this month, as part of its continued efforts to ignore one of the major themes in one of its most popular games.

Earlier this year, Sega shared some more details on its Super Game project, which at the time hadn't solidified the company's NFT plans. Sega also trademarked ""Sega NFT"" in January of this year, so despite the widespread controversy and general disdain for the technology, plans do appear to be going ahead to incorporate the technology.",blockchain,gamespot

Developer Netmarble has also launched the game's official site, providing more information on the game, including a development roadmap, playable characters, and plans for blockchain monetization.

Described as a follow up to its mobile RPG King of Fighters Allstar, the new game is an action PVP game that allows players to battle each other in real time. The developer has promised to make all King of Fighters characters playable, with 37 characters available for free at launch. Netmarble hasn't said whether any characters that may be added in subsequent updates will also be available for free, but has said the roster will continue to ""grow through special collaborations and events.""

As a free-to-play game, King of Fighters Arena appears to be basing its money around blockchain integration, including its own token called Fighters Club Token, and an NFT market based around ""Fighters Cards."" Players will be able to trade the regular in-game currency for FCT if they choose to engage in the game's blockchain economy, though KOF Arena's timing is less than ideal with the crypto market currently in a downturn.

Pre-registration is available now on the Apple Store and Google Play, with players who pre-register unlocking limited edition cosmetic rewards including the ""Fighter Illust Collection and Fighter Background Collection to adorn and represent your fighter, [and] a Limited version of Special Title and Title Panel.""",blockchain,gamespot

Author Neal Stephenson is launching his own open-source version of the metaverse Amy E. Price/Getty Images for SXSW

Science-fiction author Neal Stephenson predicted cryptocurrencies and virtual worlds – even coining the term metaverse – in his 1992 novel Snow Crash. Now, 30 years later, he is combining the two ideas by launching a blockchain-powered open metaverse. It is a move that sets him against big tech firms with their own metaverse plans, so why is he doing it and what even is an open metaverse?

Developers have pushed various versions of the metaverse for decades, but nothing has stuck. Its time may have come, though: last year Facebook rebranded as Meta with founder Mark Zuckerberg promising to spend billions of dollars to create a new virtual world in which everyone can interact, while Microsoft is also investing billions in its own version of the idea.

Stephenson, however, is proposing to build a metaverse linked to a blockchain – the technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin – so that it is entirely decentralised rather than being owned by someone. He has launched a company and blockchain called Lamina1 with the purpose of acting as a core for the open metaverse. It would handle interoperability between worlds, verify the identity of users and handle financial transactions.

Neither Lamina1 nor Stephenson responded to a request for interview, but in a white paper announcing the launch, Lamina1 says the first virtual world built on its blockchain will be called “THEEE METAVERSE” and be designed by Stephenson. It promises “a richly-imagined, interactive virtual world with an unforgettable origin story”.

Details on what exactly it will involve are scant, but when we talk about an open metaverse, there are two main possibilities. One is a metaverse created at least partially using open-source software, even if it is a commercial venture like Meta’s or Microsoft’s, just as the open-source operating system Linux underpins many of the world’s biggest commercial technology platforms. But each created world could be a separate entity.

The other option – the open metaverse – is an ecosystem of virtual worlds underpinned by open standards that allow characters to move seamlessly from one world to another, just like you click from website to website in your browser, perhaps even being able to take virtual objects and digital money with you.

There are already signs that open standards can be successful in virtual reality and the metaverse. The OpenXR standard that can describe virtual environments and how people can interact with them is supported by Meta along with computer chip makers AMD and Intel. And the Metaverse Standards Forum has been set up, including members like software firm Adobe, Meta and Google, to help settle on common standards for things like how 3D models should be represented.

Despite this promise, technology companies seem to be moving away from a fully open metaverse, potentially so they can keep control of their own virtual worlds and monetise them.

Many developers are still working to lay the groundwork for a metaverse, though, that can be built, and controlled, by the communities that use it. An Open Metaverse Alliance has also sprung up to support the effort.

One member of that alliance is Kalila Lang, founder of open-source metaverse software platform Vircadia. She says open-source architecture is vital to the future of the metaverse, but the idea of seamless interoperability between worlds is “dumb” and largely unworkable.

“When it comes to interoperability, when you make a character or when you make an item or when you make a world, one does not necessarily fit the other,” she says. “If I tried to take my character’s guns from Call of Duty and then put them into Assassin’s Creed, it’d be ridiculous. It would break the whole game. Nothing would make sense, right?”

What does make sense, says Lang, are open standards that allow the creation of open worlds free of the control of technology giants. She says that Meta using “metaverse” as a product name after decades of common usage caused “ill will” in some quarters, but that it had a silver lining in that more attention was now being paid to virtual worlds.

Meta wants to have people build worlds on top of their construct, says Lang. “Whereas what we want to do is basically be the WordPress of VR. You know, WordPress powers every kind of website imaginable, right? People extend it, hack it into whatever shape they want.”

Whether the metaverse will become a part of our everyday lives remains to be seen. Given the wide range of approaches being tested, there may be a place for all of them in some form, even if the likes of Meta have the advantage of scale on their side.",blockchain,new scientist
208,Here's My No-Brainer Cryptocurrency to Buy Right Now,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/701646/rocket-chart.jpg,29/09/2022,"Speed, low cost, and ease of use make Solana a great cryptocurrency today.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/29/heres-my-no-brainer-cryptocurrency-to-buy-right-no/,"There's a lot of debate about how cryptocurrencies add value to the digital world. Is crypto a great store of value? Is it a path to the metaverse? Is crypto disruptive to traditional businesses somehow?

I think a core answer has to be the utility that can be built on the blockchain of a given cryptocurrency. If developers can't build programs and businesses that benefit from the blockchain itself, what advantage does crypto have?

One blockchain that's built for that utility is Solana (SOL 0.07%), and it's the one cryptocurrency that I think is a no-brainer right now.

Solana's blockchain vision

The Solana blockchain uses what's called proof-of-history validation structure for transactions, which is theoretically much faster and cheaper than validation methods like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.

Actual performance of the Solana blockchain hasn't hit the 50,000 transactions per second or more it can theoretically reach, but the numbers are impressive.

As of this writing, Solana is completing 3,044 transactions per second compared to 13.3 transaction per second on the Ethereum ETH 0.26% )

Put another way, Solana performed 40 million transactions per day in Q2 2022 compared to 1 million on Ethereum, according to Nansen.

The average cost of a Solana transaction is just $0.00025.

There are between 1,000 and 1,200 active programs on Solana on any given day.

750,000 wallets are active on Solana, and 100,000 new non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are created every day.

Not every program will be used long term, and not every NFT will be valuable, but the amount of activity and development on Solana is simply astounding.

Development is happening fast

A few of the notable developments happening on Solana just this year include:

Solana Pay, which was announced earlier this year, is a payment service that could reduce transaction costs of as much as 3% for some credit card purchases to less than a penny. Within hours of launch, developers were already testing the payment network at small businesses.

In June, Solana Labs announced the Saga smartphone, an Android smartphone that has Web3 features like a ""secure element"" for private key management. This could be a model for Web3 devices in the future.

A developer called Coral recently announced a $20 million funding round to build executable NFTs and a ""Backpack"" wallet, all with the goal of giving NFTs more utility.

Sometimes, the pace of development is dizzying, but that's good for a blockchain and cryptocurrency. And most of the development is geared toward making Solana easier to use, which is what it's going to take to bring on the next generation of crypto users.

Solana is the future of the blockchain

I think cryptocurrency and the blockchain could be very disruptive technologies, but they need to be built for speed, low cost, and ease of use. Solana is the one blockchain that's focused on these factors, and there's rapid innovation in the developer community. That's why this is the best cryptocurrency to buy now, by a long shot.",blockchain,motley fool

Brendan Greene, better known (somewhat ironically) as PlayerUnknown, walked away from PUBG last year to form a new studio (opens in new tab), PlayerUnknown Productions, and take on an incredibly ambitious new open world project called Artemis (opens in new tab). The goal of Artemis is to generate realistic, dense, world-sized open worlds: To ""lend weight to the idea of, 'You see that mountain? You can climb it.'""

(That, by the way, is an old quote attributed to Todd Howard in early presentations discussing the scale of Bethesda's open-world RPG Skyrim.)

pic.twitter.com/dipZpUSeNYSeptember 3, 2021 See more

A sprawling open world in which players can wander around and do whatever they want is essentially a metaverse by another name—at least insofar as we understand them (opens in new tab)—which naturally leads to thoughts of blockchains and NFTs, neither of which are terribly popular with most gamers. In a recent interview on Nathan Brown's Hit Points (opens in new tab) blog, Greene acknowledged the metaversal connection, and the potentially negative connotations it might carry, but said he's not bothered by the possibility of a negative reaction to it.

""I’m just going to do what I’m going to do,"" Greene said. ""It’s this thing that we want to create, and it’s going to give people a lot of fun, a lot of pleasure, and a lot of meaningful things to do. But it doesn’t matter if it’s called the metaverse. I don’t care what people want to call it.""

""I do believe you should be able to extract value from a digital place; it has to be like the internet, where you can do stuff that will earn you money,"" he continued. ""But it’s not about, like, Chanel and Louis Vuitton. It’s some kid called AwesomePickle selling cool skins because he understands what people want.""

Greene made no mention of NFTs in the quick rundown of his ambitions, but it came close enough to the mark that some people took it to mean that Greene is making a blockchain-based game using NFTs for items. In response, he took to Twitter to shoot down the assumption.

""Not quite,"" Greene tweeted. ""We’re considering blockchain, or some future evolution of this tech, as a utility within our digital place, not the foundation of it.""

Not quite. We’re considering blockchain, or some future evolution of this tech, as a utility within our digital place, not the foundation of it. https://t.co/ZklHxtMI65September 28, 2022 See more

It's been more than a year since Greene left PUBG Corporation, but his new project—and its planned precursor, a smaller-scale (but still massive) tech demo called Prologue—are still very much in the ""considering"" phase. Greene attributed some of that slow start to his inexperience in building and managing a development team, but also because of the sheer magnitude of the technological challenges involved in building believable worlds of the size he envisions.

""I often say that it’s like we’re building a combustion engine in the age of horses,"" he said. ""People know how to breed horses and train them to run faster, but that doesn’t scale.""",blockchain,pc gamer

After all, Polygon is generally considered to be the premier Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, so it made sense that Polygon would benefit from The Merge as well. There was a brief spike over the summer when Polygon tokens tripled in price from $0.30 to $1, but they now seem to have settled into a trading range around $0.75.

Does this mean investors have cooled on Polygon's prospects? Or is it simply a realization that it will simply take longer than expected for Ethereum to realize all of the performance enhancements the community has promised? Either way, with the completion of The Merge behind us, this could be a good time to reevaluate the investment case for Polygon.

Battle of the Layer 2 solutions

The good news is that, even after The Merge, Ethereum will continue to rely on Layer 2 scaling solutions like Polygon to reduce ""gas fees"" and clear up blockchain congestion. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has already told us that. However, there are plenty of other Layer 2 solutions out there, including Optimism (OP -1.88%), Loopring (LRC 0.58%), and Arbitrum. So there's certainly no guarantee that Polygon will hold onto its position as the premier Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.

The problem for investors is that it is ridiculously difficult for any non-blockchain expert to make sense of what differentiates all of these solutions. The current buzz is around the ""ZK rollups"" that Polygon offers, but this probably will mean nothing to the average investor who is unfamiliar with ZK (zero knowledge) proofs. Are you willing to invest your hard-earned money into something that you don't understand? That might explain part of the reason Polygon's price hasn't been above $1 since August, despite all the excitement surrounding The Merge.

The new Layer 3 solutions

Making things more complex, Buterin recently said he's thinking about Layer 3 solutions as another way to reduce fees and congestion on Ethereum. He's not exactly sure what form these Layer 3 solutions will take, but he seems to suggest that the Layer 2 ecosystem has already matured, so it's time to look for what's next.

Unlike Layer 2 solutions, which sit right on top of the Ethereum blockchain, Layer 3 solutions will not be stackable, says Buterin. This makes issues like security and scalability much more complex. However, as soon as the first Layer 3 solution appears, investors may be tempted to move out of Layer 2 solutions and into Layer 3 solutions as they chase The Next Big Thing. What this might mean for Polygon is unclear.

High-profile brand partnerships

That's why I'm using a simple variable to determine whether Polygon is still a buy after The Merge: the number of high-profile brand partnerships it announces. There was a brief wave of euphoria after Polygon announced a partnership with Meta (META -2.71%) for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Facebook and Instagram, and another after it announced a partnership with Disney (DIS -2.27%) during the summer. Along the way, it has inked partnership deals with many other high-profile brands. In September, Polygon announced a partnership with Starbucks (SBUX -3.36%). I think these brand partnerships are the key to unlocking the full value of Polygon. As long as Polygon continues to announce similar types of partnerships, I will remain bullish on the token.

Is Polygon a buy?

Right now, I think Polygon is the clear leader in the Layer 2 blockchain business. However, it pays to watch out for competitors. Arbitrum, for example, does not yet have a crypto token, but has been widely hailed as one of the best Layer 2 scaling solutions.

At the end of the day, Polygon has the highest market cap of any Layer 2, the best technology, and the most high-profile brand partnerships. If the world's top brands are picking Polygon to help them launch their new NFT and Web3 projects, that's a huge factor for me. Polygon is still a buy after The Merge, and I'll be looking to add to my position while this crypto is trading at bargain prices of less than $1.",blockchain,motley fool

Bitcoin Takes a Morning Dip Before Rising

By James Rubin

Stocks were back to diving deep again, but not cryptos.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether and most other major altcoins sank more gently, offering the latest counterpoint in an ongoing debate whether digital assets will continue to correlate with equities, particularly from the tech sector. BTC was recently trading over $19,400, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier after recovering from an early morning plunge.

""Bitcoin’s correlation with tech stocks remains, but it isn’t breaking as bad as it has during most of this cycle,"" wrote Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya in an email, noting the tech heavy Nasdaq's steep decline Thursday and bitcoin's recent ability to tread near or above $19,000 support. ""It appears Wall Street believes crypto is close to the bottom and will become an attractive diversification strategy once the peak in Treasury yields is in place,"" Moya added.

Story continues

Ether was recently trading just above $1,330, down a little more than a percentage point from the same time a day ago. Other major cryptos traded sideways, with a slight red tint. ATOM and UNI were down about 4% and 3%, respectively. But XRP and XLM were recently up approximately 7% and 6%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, was up slightly to over 963.

Equities had a day to forget, with the Nasdaq off nearly 3% and the S&P 500 down more than 2% as investors cringed from the latest bond market tumult and a U.S. Commerce Department report confirming that the U.S. was in recession by the traditional definition of two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP). The yield for 10-year Treasurys increased to over 3.74%, not far off its highest settlement date this year, while two-year yields continue to hover well over 4%.

Markets also continued to wrestle with the newly installed British leadership's economic policy of tax cuts and expanded spending to pull the country from its current doldrums. Observers of the U.K. are concerned that the moves will exacerbate its high inflation.

Late Wednesday, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam said that CFTC-led regulation could have significant benefits for the crypto industry, including a potential boost to the price of bitcoin. “Bitcoin might double in price if there’s a CFTC-regulated market,” Behnam told attendees during a fireside chat at NYU School of Law.

Behnam's remarks underscored an increasingly widespread belief in the importance of crypto regulation.

In an appearance Thursday morning on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Greg Johnson, the co-founder and CEO of investment adviser Rubicon Crypto, said that crypto would likely continue trading at its current levels until regulatory agencies can set clear guidelines. ""We're in a purgatory that probably isn't going to go away for some time,"" Johnson said. ""Nothing meaningful is going to change in the crypto markets until we get ... regulatory clarity. That is going to allow for the next wave of meaningful adoption.""

Johnson added that clear regulation would encourage traditional financial services firms to expand in the crypto space. ""We're ready to move when we start to see traditional broker dealers and institutions not just say we have clarity, but start to hire to include enterprise-wide training of digital assets, we start to see the series 24 exam include topics and questions on digital assets.""

Will Shimmer Be the Next Big Blockchain? OATA Hopes So

By Shaurya Malwa

SINGAPORE — Crypto project IOTA unveiled its Shimmer platform Wednesday during an official launch event during the Token 2049 conference here.

The launch comes amid a flurry of blockchain upstarts, each promising to be faster and cheaper than the previous one, and often attracting hordes of venture funding. This year alone has seen the formation of networks including Sui and Aptos, alongside Ethereum-based scaling networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism.

IOTA, which enjoys its own cult following, much like other networks, said Shimmer’s unveiling followed nearly two years of testing a product that will eventually be used to test core protocol improvements and feature upgrades to IOTA-based applications in a “live” environment.

That means Shimmer is no testnet, or a blockchain used solely for testing purposes, and would instead exist as a full-scale, separate blockchain with its own SMR tokens.

Shimmer brings with it a unique model that allows budding developers to release various tokens, such as non-fungible tokens (NFT), tokenized real-world assets and stablecoins natively on a layer 1, or base, network without fees.

This is unlike other networks wherein participants usually pay fees – ranging from a few pennies to as much as a few hundred dollars – to deploy their tokens or projects.

IOTA says that such a design serves as the foundational basis for Shimmer’s smart contract execution layer, which includes full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. EVM broadly refers to an extensive database that holds all Ethereum's accounts and balances, atop which developers can create services and deploy decentralized applications (dapps).

Support for a multi-chain ecosystem

Eventually, the ShimmerEVM will allow developers from other EVM-compliant networks to access the Shimmer network using other networks, thus creating support for a multi-chain ecosystem.

Another key feature of the Shimmer network is support for bridgeless native asset transfers across the entire Shimmer ecosystem. Bridges refer to blockchain-based tools that allow users to transfer tokens between different networks. Such tools have been highly susceptible to exploits in the past year, including a $600 million attack on Ronin, a $200 million attack on Nomad and other similar exploits.

The SMR tokens were distributed to anyone staking IOTA tokens over a three-month period, with some 1.4 billion SMR generated from users staking IOTA. Some 181 million SMR were voted on by the community to the Shimmer Community Treasury (DAO), a community-governed entity that would independently fund community projects.

The launch of the ShimmerEVM chain is expected in the coming weeks on the basis of successful and adequate security tests.

The Fortress Vault helps companies across industry verticals protect their tokenized intellectual property (IP) and assets by privately storing the content with the accessibility, privacy, portability, and provenance that blockchain enables.

In a world that already functions digitally, documents can now be encrypted, stored, tracked, referenced, and accessed with clear provenance, established ownership, and records of authenticity that do not risk human error, mistaken identity, or expose private data.

Vault is an innovator in its ability to maintain the integrity of non-public data accessible through NFTs in industries like music, event ticketing, gaming, finance, transportation, real estate, and healthcare.

“NFTs aren’t just expensive jpegs,” says Kevin Lehtiniitty, co-founder and CTO of Fortress.

“NFTs are a technology that allow us to access unique or non-fungible data via a distributed ledger to prove the authenticity and establish the provenance of the asset. If you can pair the token to data that is accessible exclusively by the token holder — and only to the token holder — then NFTs become a digital key to unlock everything from music to event tickets to real estate deeds to healthcare records to estate documents, essentially to everything in the world that’s digital.”, Lehtiniitty continued.

Prior to Vault, content on the blockchain was either publicly viewable or had to be hosted on unsupervised databases on distributed computers around the world. This excluded valuable or sensitive content and intellectual property from digital assets like NFTs.

With Vault, enterprise customers can now privately store tokenized IP with a cloud-based, secure, and unified solution.

“NFTs and the blockchain will fundamentally transform every industry in our society,” adds Lehtiniitty. “By building the Fortress Vault on Google Cloud’s secure infrastructure, we are creating a vital path for Fortune 500 brands, governmental organizations, celebrities, and everyone else to build innovative new products and services on blockchain technology with privacy and compliance standards in place.”

“We look forward to teaming up with Fortress Blockchain Technologies and providing secure cloud infrastructure to help enable its new Vault platform, ” said Carlos Arena, director, Digital Assets, Google Cloud.

“Our work together reinforces our greater mission to help enable the Web3 ecosystem with scalable technology and solutions that help establish trust in the community.”, Arena continued.

Prior to launching Vault, Fortress had already begun eliminating barriers with simple, streamlined APIs that power businesses at any stage of Web3 adoption to quickly launch and scale with embeddable wallets for NFTs and fungible rewards tokens; mint NFTs; and integrate key financial services backed by a secure, regulated financial institution, Fortress Trust.

Vault is overseen by Fortress Trust, which ensures its privacy and compliance standards as a regulated entity.",blockchain,help net security

Polygon has a large user base of about 170 million addresses, of which some 300,000 are classed as active, Bernstein said. It’s growing at a pace of 80,000 new users a day.

The network was the first platform to offer scalability for Ethereum with its proof-of-stake (PoS) chain, Bernstein said, which encouraged leading decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) applications to offer their products on the system. Polygon also has lower fees, making it easier for applications such as trading platforms Uniswap and OpenSea to cater to retail demand.

The broker notes that Meta (META), Stripe, Starbucks (SBUX) and Robinhood (HOOD) all chose Polygon as their “first integration partner to build Web3 experiences.” A strong partnership pipeline gives Polygon growth and on-ramps to millions of users, it added.

The “other secret” behind Polygon has been organizational. The blockchain has hired from YouTube, Airbnb (ABNB), Electronic Arts (EA), Amazon Cloud and other large corporations to build a “truly global organization,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.

DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain without the use of traditional intermediaries. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and can be sold or traded.

With Ethereum’s recent migration to PoS, known as the Merge, the blockchain is building a “rollup-centric scalability roadmap,” the note said.

Given this context, “the supporting ecosystems such as Polygon would continue to invest in building rollup technologies such as zero-knowledge rollups, but their success is likely to be more determined by organizational and business development efforts,” Bernstein said, adding that “they are more business-orientated ecosystems focused on building a consumer gateway leveraging partnerships with leading consumer brands.”

Story continues

Polygon’s success so far, has shown its ability to build a “more mainstream customer gateway,” the note added, with focus now on the zero-knowledge (ZK) ecosystem.

The Merge is the first of five upgrades planned for the Ethereum blockchain. Rollups expand the Ethereum network by processing transactions and executing smart contracts – computer programs that run on some blockchains – on their own chains.

The IAB Tech Lab conferences, in particular, frequently gathered blockchain evangelists and ad tech experts who discussed how this technology would finally drive authentication to programmatic chains. Reduced budget waste, elimination of intermediaries and fraudulent traffic are the core challenges of ad tech that decentralized ledger promised to resolve.

As soon as the IAB Tech Lab blockchain working group started developing principles of decentralized networks, the advertising industry was believed to be standing on the threshold of massive technology introduction into a real business. Now that we’ve marched into 2022 it’s time to recollect those talks, inspect the current market and finally understand if blockchain really brings some changes into ad tech and martech scene.

The landscape of blockchain-driven solutions: from 2018 to 2022

Currently, buy-side is most enthusiastic about blockchain implementation in ad tech, because advertisers and media buyers need good quality traffic. Globally, ad fraud will most certainly cost advertisers $81 billion in 2022. Roughly speaking, ad fraud takes $1 from $5 invested in digital ads.

In 2018-2019, budding blockchain-based advertising projects provided the first opportunity to buy clean and secure traffic, enriched with genuine data about ad campaign performance. In 2019, this environment evolved, multiplying the number of blockchain marketing startups from 22 (2017) to 290 (2019), which is more than 13 times in a year. These commercial and non-commercial projects mainly function in the area of social marketing, data, commerce, content marketing, and digital advertising, where the number grew from 10 to 105.

Starting from 2019 society has shifted its attention toward NFT technology (which also uses a blockchain ledger for protecting the ownership of digital assets). With this, blockchain is featured among the top martech trends in 2022. Over 31% of industry experts think that VR/AR, Metaverse, NFT, and Blockchain technology will define the trajectory of martech and ad tech development.

Sure, right now crypto markets are not being in the best of times – the growing cryptotrading markets recently crippled in China. In January 2022, Spain and the UK also introduced new stifling regulations to eliminate crypto advertisements. However, the growth in the number of successful blockchain advertising startups signals that companies have finally started to understand the true value of technology without associating it with the token economy.

What blockchain solutions are here and how do they reshape advertising?

Let’s recall why the industry clung to blockchain technology in the first place – because it created a distributed database that could be trusted by demand and supply partners alike. When companies add a blockchain to digital advertising, they reach the next level of clarity and accountability.

Every action or impression is recorded on a distributed ledger: which user watched the ad, which advertiser bought the impression, what was the cost and the components (commissions, actual bid), and so on. This way, all data becomes auditable to every chain participant on an event-level basis. The parties themselves can detect fraud and initiate automation removal of a suspicious component from the chain.

The majority of martech-powered solutions are currently focusing on improving transparency and mitigating advertising fraud, for example:

AdEx – the platform that connects publishers and advertisers directly, reducing the middlemen and thus hidden commissions;

Rebel AI – focuses on identity to eliminate the problem of domain spoofing;

XCHNG – Fights with ad fraud thanks to the application of smart contracts;

AdBank – secures transactions between advertisers and publishers while also delivering transparency over payments;

Papyrus – ensures fairness and efficiency of media supply chains with the blockchain network.

Apart from fraud protection, blockchain solves many problems in different areas of advertising. Based on the events recorded on the ledger, document flow, and paper bookkeeping become a matter of one click automated by smart contracts.

Additionally, blockchain in martech helps to protect the interests of users, e.g. Brave browser users, actually earn revenues in the form of BAT (Basic Attention Token) in exchange for ad watching. Since global attention is also focused on privacy protection and digital ownership, most likely the next generation of blockchain startups in marketing will be developed exactly in these niches.

What about challenges?

In the absence of regulation, many blockchain pilot projects were at risk of ending up absolutely impractical. Nevertheless, the world is adapting to blockchain anyways. Luckily, market participants joined forces that contributed to faster technology adoption and regulation development. IAB Tech Lab’s initiatives support businesses in their desire to stay aware of the best practices of blockchain integration into ad stacks. A set of specific programs are constantly being developed in order to facilitate education, raise awareness and deliver a legal framework for such platform functioning.

To better understand market readiness and realize how blockchain works in the real world, the IAB Tech Lab started a blockchain pilot program that will deliver real-world algorithm for testing blockchain-based services and products.

The members that develop blockchain solutions are invited to showcase how their blockchain-based projects can work. Their advertising blockchain initiatives have deployed working mechanisms for addressing ad fraud, transparency, and efficiencies in the reconciliation of campaign data in their own way. Some have developed 2-layer protocols to accelerate transaction speed; some have automated purchases by smart contracts and others have combined IAB Tech Lab’s ads.txt, (registry of authorized sellers) with Ethereum to achieve increased inventory purchasing transparency.

The other obstacle of the past was speed. Now, blockchain transactions occur in minutes, while processes in digital marketing occur in milliseconds. This problem apparently found a partial resolution in 2019, when blockchain startups figured out how to cover the problem with multilayered protocols architecture that execute transactions outside of the main blockchain.

Loading...

Finally, the third and probably the most important problem of blockchain in ad tech is a lack of education and the shortage of professionals well-versed in blockchain implementation in advertising. Despite obviously growing curiosity and awareness, actual comprehension of blockchain, NFT, and related technologies among mass audiences is very low – even in 2022 96% of Americans fail the common quizzes that include basic crypto concepts.

However, in order to improve the state of things in this department, we need to have more educational initiatives like those presented by IAB. We also need support and educational initiatives on the local and regional levels that would raise awareness of blockchain implementation in ad tech. This awareness could encourage broader blockchain solutions implementation and would persuade companies to invest resources in employees training and education.

The takeaway

Early experiments with blockchain in advertising were quite successful, which raised the bar for subsequent projects. Marketing and advertising tech built on blockchain, NFT, and similar technologies can become the new normal, although even in 2022 it is still rather a prerogative of niche enthusiasts and small startups. Regulatory uncertainty, poor awareness, and lack of professionals are still challenges that stand in the way of the mass deployment of such solutions. However, once these obstacles are passed marketing and advertising landscape will be redefined.

It will be possible to see how much money from advertisers’ budgets reach the publisher after passing the pipeline. In turn, impressions served by websites will be easily signed and tracked. Finally, the users will be able to receive rewards for their attention and protect their digital assets.

So, obviously, blockchain in advertising doesn’t have to be overhyped, nor does it have to be underestimated. For this, we shouldn’t take it as a universal hammer able to fix every problem, but rather see it as a tool of great capacity if the problem it needs to solve is right.",blockchain,smartdatacollective.com

Although the current crypto market has been hit hard, it still attracts a lot of attention.

New York, Sept. 29, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Recently, an early blockchain sandbox game project was officially launched. Although the current crypto market has been hit hard, it still attracts a lot of attention. The so-called blockchain sandbox game actually means that players build their own world by purchasing land and basic buildings, which is similar to Lego Die Lego in traditional games. The most popular blockchain sandbox game at present is Sandbox, and the recently launched blockchain sandbox game project is RobotEra.

RobotEra is building a sandbox-like planetary reconstruction metaverse. Players will become a robot, manage their own land, and participate in the construction of the world. Players can also obtain resources from the land to create robot companions. In RobotEra, players can create freely according to their own imagination, and start a new era with other robots. Additionally, Robotera offers a shared multiverse connected to other worlds, opening theme parks, concerts, museums, and more. Create, share, operate, explore and trade in Robotera with many NFT communities.

RobotEra aims to provide players with a powerful multi-dimensional metaverse platform that integrates entertainment, creation, management, exploration and interaction, making RobotEra not only a colorful game, but a second world that can benefit from crypto currencies and digital assets.

Background

The world that RobotEra players live in is a planet of Tero that has just experienced a catastrophe, in which the aborigines and old robots have been killed in the war between the two sides. There are only 10,000 robots of various shapes hidden in the depths of the planet, who wake up after the big bang with humanized thoughts and emotions. This group of robots with human minds became the masters of this beautiful planet. Facing the ruined planet after the war, they will use their expertise to restore the planet's past prosperity and create a more brilliant civilization and future.

Story continues

Gameplay

The gameplay settings of blockchain sandbox games are more or less similar, and RobotEra adds a lot of entertainment to traditional sandbox games.

1. Similar to many blockchain sandbox games, RobotEra players get their avatars in the metaverse through Robot NFT. Robot NFT is the incarnation of players in the metaverse, through which players can interact in the game and mine , construct etc.

The difference is that although Robot NFTs cannot be created at will, players can freely edit and replace their Robot NFTs through the Robot Editor. There are a total of 10,000 Robot NFTs and are divided into seven camps, the camps are Guardian Song, Ω, Justice League, Trailblazers, War College, Lava and Desire for Paradise. These seven camps have different characteristics and attributes, and the number is also different. This setting not only increases the entertainment, but also create more room for Robot NFT appreciation.

2. In addition, RobotEra has added a lot of novel gameplay. For example, in RobotEra, Robot NFT does not have any combat attributes, it will not die nor directly participate in combat. If the player wants to take part in the battle, they must send their robot partners to do so.

Robot partners require players to assemble themselves by collecting resources. Players can assemble robot partners with different attributes and skills. Each robot partner will be a unique NFT, which can be sold in exchange for income, or can be earned while playing. Actually robot partner is a helper for the defense of the land and plundering resources, and does not appear in the game at first sight.

3. Furthermore, every blockchain sandbox game has a platform that players can build at will, and RobotEra is no exception. The planet Tero where RobotEra players live is divided into seven continents, each of which has its own unique resources for making unique robot of their own faction. Players can get a piece of their own land through airdrops or purchase by themselves. Players have absolute autonomy on their own land, they can build as they want, and trade in the market to gain profits.

If the player lacks some resources during construction, they can go to the public continent to get it. The public continent is randomly generated by the system and has a wealth of renewable resources for players to collect. In addition, it is worth noting that players who hold Robot NFT will have the opportunity to receive official land airdrops in various activities. Players who have not received the airdrop can also wait for the next wave of airdrops or purchase directly.

Technical Advantages

RobotEra not only has a complete background story and wonderful gameplay design, but also technically realizes the original development of the editor. There are currently two in-game editors in the project, the land editor and the robot editor.

Robot Editor: Players can edit their own robot protagonist (Robot NFT), or robot partners. After entering the game, players will get an officially provided robot NFT, which can be replaced later by using the robot editor to create a more personalized robot protagonist. Robot Editor is a unique utility in Planet Taro.

Land editor: After players have their own land, they can do anything in their land, such as mining and gathering resources, building houses, and making friends with robots. Obviously, the land editor can make it easier for players to create freely.

The development of the editor can enable RobotEra to have more scenarios, and the editor is currently preparing to be tested and launched.

Summary

To sum up, from the background story and the world view of the project, RobotEra's design is complete and wonderful, and it might create a more active Web 3 scene. From the perspective of gameplay design, RobotEra is similar to the design concept of many sandbox games, but has its own uniqueness. From the technical point of view, two unique editors prove the strength of the technical team.

In addition, it is worth mentioning that RobotEra is still an early blockchain sandbox game project. Although the vision and goals of the project party are very ambitious, how to develop the project in the future still needs time to witness. The greater the opportunity, the greater the challenge also.

226,On starting a crypto career in the dead of winter,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QO2OKYwmOb6iQHQ.FvyptQ--~B/aD02MDA7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/eb4846b8763111d16ab8d022c0a13481,29/09/2022,"An argument for taking the long view and studying blockchain or related technology now, even when prospects seem scary. This story is part of CoinDesk's...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starting-crypto-career-dead-winter-233801275.html,"This week at CoinDesk we’ve been highlighting the growing number of university programs that focus on blockchains and cryptocurrency. College isn’t necessarily a requirement for a solid career in the field, but for most people it’s the surest first step.

This piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week.

But now may be a strange time to think about college, especially for those hoping for a career in crypto. After a two-year stretch of unprecedented hype, we’ve entered “crypto winter,” a recurring species of downturn that has proven typical of the blockchain industry as speculation outpaces adoption, then retreats.

The huge up-and-down cycles in crypto can certainly be nerve-wracking. And this time we’re also seeing signs of broader weakness in technology jobs, with a wave of headline-generating layoffs over the summer. It’s enough to make a young person second-guess career goals that had seemed like a slam dunk just a few months ago.

But recruiters with an eye on the tech world cite three good reasons learning about blockchain makes sense, even at a moment when it suddenly feels a bit less like The Next Big Thing.

First, the skills that will get you in the door in crypto can be transferred without too much difficulty to other technology spheres. Second, anyone trained in computer science or coding will have relatively solid job prospects in nearly any kind of economy. And third, in crypto as in most fields, a downturn can actually make the early stages of a career easier in some ways by creating more freelance or gig work opportunities.

Above all, job-hunting experts say it’s important to think long term, even when news of layoffs and a slowing economy make it tempting to throw in the towel before you’ve even started.

Understanding the downturn – and when it will end

“Unfortunately, there’s a lot of discussions about hiring freezes and layoffs and the recession,” says Rick Chen of the tech-job discussion site Blind.

Blind is an anonymized forum where verified employees speak freely about what they’re seeing at their workplaces and beyond, making it a very valuable source of job market insights. Chen is head of public relations at Blind, but he says most of his job is “being the in-house journalist” – watching the anonymous chatter on the site and extracting larger trends.

Story continues

Chen says the looming economic downturn is causing particular worry for tech workers in three industries: real estate, fintech (including crypto) and the so-called gig economy. “People in corporate roles … at Instacart, Uber, Lyft. They’re concerned whether their business models are sustainable.”

But what’s behind the broad downturn in tech and crypto? In very broad strokes, COVID-19 is still in charge: Pandemic disruptions led to high inflation, and in turn central banks are raising interest rates both in the U.S. and worldwide.

That has a particularly sharp impact on so-called growth sectors of the economy, where companies often borrow money from investors to fund and market new ideas. When interest rates are higher that money tends to dry up because safer investments like bonds become relatively more attractive. That’s particularly worrying for companies like Uber that have been around for years but still show weak profitability and limited growth.

Crypto also falls very much in the growth category: While some crypto firms have strong revenue even during the current downturn, many rely on investor funds of one sort or another as they work towards broader adoption. Those funds have become more scarce, dropping by half between 2021 and the first half of 2022. That means the current job doldrums, in crypto and in tech more broadly, could end in a couple of different ways: either investment revives, or more revenue starts flowing from customers.

The good news is that, unlike Uber, crypto is still considered a big future opportunity, so investment is still flowing in – just more slowly than at the peak of the last bull market. And even now there are still jobs to be had.

“Despite this crypto winter, [blockchain firms] are still hiring,” says Chen. “No matter what, in terms of the state of the economy there are still some companies that need engineers, or need product managers. Those roles are kind of evergreen, so to speak.”

Tech is everywhere, and you can be, too

Josh Brenner, CEO of the job market Hired, agrees there are still plenty of opportunities in the tech sector as a whole, despite some high-profile layoff rounds.

“We started off the year with crazy aggressive hiring, and we’re now more at an efficient or stabilized kind of hiring for companies,” says Brenner. In many cases, the layoffs came from companies that were aiming to grow too fast and had to suddenly reverse course, rather than from companies that are shrinking or dying.

Crucially, many of the skills needed to work in crypto, especially in technical roles, are transferable to the broader tech sector, making coding, design and other skills the foundation for a robust career even if things get rocky in one specific industry.

“Every company is a tech company now,” says Brenner. “If I were to pick a skill to pick up, technically related skills are going to serve people best into the future.”

More specifically, Brenner is seeing a growing crossover between blockchain and more traditional finance. “We’ve seen that while there has been a slowdown in hiring among crypto companies, a lot of banking and finance companies are hiring people with the crypto skills,” he says. “Obviously there’s a lot of need within banking for blockchain expertise.” To pick just one recent example of why, the stalwart banking infrastructure firm SWIFT this week announced a new partnership with the blockchain project ChainLink.

On the technical end of the spectrum, transferable skills come in basically two forms, according to Brenner. On the one hand there are specific programming languages or software tools that are used across a huge range of industries. A few of these are fairly consistent – learning Python, for instance, or how to manage a company’s Amazon Web Services. But Brenner recommends learners do their own research to figure out what skills are in demand, including searching job boards and monitoring the communities around specific coding languages.

On the other hand, says Brenner, “it’s the act of actually learning a new skill that companies look for.” In other words, the most important skill for employers may be the discipline and flexibility required to learn – which is very much the point of going to college.

That focus on basic skills extends to non-technical roles, where Brenner says good communication and organizational skills are paramount, “especially in this remote [work-from-home] world that most companies are going for now.” If you’re fascinated by blockchains and also a strong writer you have a lot of options, from technical copywriting to marketing.

Compared with technical roles, though, it is a bit harder to prove your chops as, say, an email copywriter. Especially for coders, there are increasing opportunities to pass skills tests or earn specific certifications that can get your foot in the door, even without a college degree. Brenner says Hired is working to provide parallel alternatives for communications or other roles, but “it’s a much tricker process” for so-called soft skills.

That suggests non-technical careers may benefit proportionally more from the credential of a college degree. But Brenner says more and more companies are making exceptions even for those roles, as long as you’ve found other ways to show how effective you can be.

“If you have a good track record,” says Brenner, “it’s more about your outputs and what you could produce versus where you went to school.”

The smooth on-ramp: contract work and DAOs

Undergraduate programs teaching blockchain and crypto skills have only really appeared within the last few years. That means crypto still offers a lot of non-traditional pathways for those looking to enter the industry, and they’ve recently become easier to access because of the rise of DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations.

DAOs are almost by their nature great places to explore a career in crypto, learn basic skills and build a track record. They often rely on short-term contracts, with workers assigned specific tasks for the DAO. That might include anything from writing text for a website to debugging contract code. Getting those gigs requires, above all, identifying projects you’re interested in and finding out where members gather and communicate (often, on an easily accessed Discord chat server).

Getting this sort of gig work is often a lot easier than getting hired for a full-time job because neither side is making a huge commitment. They can also be a perfect fit for students still learning the ropes while mostly focused on classes.

But once team members get to know you, DAO contributions can lead to a more formal role – including non-technical roles. In fact, as I was writing this piece, a small data point popped up on Twitter.

After >1 year exclusively contributing to DAOs, today I got a full time contract signed



AMA — zeugh.lens (:D, :D) (@ZeughFromCanu) September 28, 2022

According to Zeugh, aka Ion Neto, he had been doing community management for JuiceboxDAO for about a year when the opportunity to take on a full-time role at another DAO came his way.

How a downturn can be good for freelancers

Though there are still happy stories like Zeugh’s, DAO contract opportunities have certainly been hurt by the economic and crypto-market downturn. DAOs are an exciting new frontier in the expanding blockchain universe, and largely rely on investor funds to operate. Those haven’t entirely dried up but they’ve definitely gotten scarcer.

“Many DAOs have entered into budget-reducing modes of various kinds,” says Spencer Graham. Graham is a core contributor at DAOHaus, a platform for community-driven DAOs. “Some DAOs have done the equivalent of laying off contributors, others have shifted to a constrained project-based budgeting approach, and most have decided to reduce per-contributor compensation as well.”

But there are upsides to the downturn, perhaps most importantly for those early in their careers or still in school.

“When companies are not hiring permanent workers, there is typically an increase in freelance opportunities,” says Hired’s Josh Brenner, “because those companies want to achieve the same work but need more flexibility in how they staff it.” This includes mainstream tech companies, and could mean that workers with less experience have more opportunities to add to their resumes.

The wintery downturn also offers some advantages for building a career in crypto specifically. With fewer Super Bowl commercials and Paris Hilton plugs, a lot of people briefly attracted to the surface hype tend to suddenly disappear from crypto. This can mean more opportunities for people attracted instead to the deeper goals and ideals of the crypto industry – things like financial inclusion and displacing surveillance capitalism.

Those deeper commitments are also a huge leg up for long-term and fulfilling success in the industry. In fact, looking inward and deciding precisely why you’re pursuing a crypto career may be the most important framework for planning ahead.

“The people who get into crypto are true believers,” says Blind’s Chen. “They have this kind of mental reward of working on building something new. And that’s a key motivator that might not exist if you worked at Goldman.”",blockchain,yahoo entertainment

The state has been wrestling with a number of cryptocurrency proposals, and though Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a crypto licensing and regulation bill this week – seen as a possible West Coast version of New York's BitLicense – he approved another on Wednesday that instructs county records offices to allow for the use of blockchain technology and verifiable credentials. The technology would be established in the distribution of birth, death and marriage records, allowing PDFs to be sent immediately rather than using a typical 10-day postal delivery.

The bill, introduced by California state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, represents a test of blockchain in an essential governmental function in the most populous U.S. state.

“This secure and highly convenient process will allow the average person to access their vital records and shows California is still leading the way for innovation,” Hertzberg said in a statement to CoinDesk on Thursday.

When arguing the merits of the bill to the Senate last month, Hertzberg said this is “not only a faster, cheaper, and more efficient delivery method, saving Californians both time and money, but it is also much more secure as blockchain is nearly impossible to hack.”

Also, this week in the U.S. Senate a bill to set up a governmental task force on digital identity cleared the Senate Homeland Security committee. The legislation – also reflected by a similar effort in the House – is meant to advance work at the federal and state levels toward setting up interoperable, government-approved digital identities.

“I had a class of 140, but I was restricted by the size of the room,” she said. “There were 200 students on the waiting list who didn't get in, so it was definitely received with a lot of excitement.”

This post is part of Education Week.

Despite the strong demand from students, Rabin, who specializes in cryptography, soon found the challenges that came with teaching such a broad subject with so few educational standards and course materials. With such a broad range of potentially relevant subjects to cover, Rabin says she often has to lean on the expertise of others.

“I invite all kinds of speakers to talk about things that I think are important for the blockchain but that I don't know about, such as law issues associated with blockchain, the [Securities and Exchange Commission], mining data, [non-fungible tokens] and art and things like that,” she said.

While interest in blockchain education is high, the courses that are available can vary significantly between institutions, and are often dependent on a small number of enthusiastic professors. “If I look around at courses that my friends are teaching, people are all teaching it from their vantage point,” said Rabin.

With minimal educational infrastructure – such as standards and certifications, even course materials and textbooks – to lean on, formal education in the blockchain space remains largely driven by individual professors. While they are occasionally supported by partnerships with blockchain native companies and foundations – such as Algorand Foundation, where Rabin serves as head of research – institutions of higher learning won’t be able to pump crypto graduates into the industry in significant numbers anytime soon. (In any case, only eight of 240 schools screened by CoinDesk for the Best Universities for Blockchain 2022 had an undergraduate major in blockchain.)

Story continues

“It might still be a long way out, because what would such a credential include?” she said. “Would it include the foundations of the blockchain? Would it include understanding applications on top? Things are changing daily in this field, and it takes time for these things to mature.”

Enter Tradfi

Blockchain has long had a skills problem because adoption, investment and use cases have continually outpaced the availability of talent. Up until now the industry has been able to achieve significant growth relying on those who are self-taught and those they can train themselves, but that won’t be enough to bring the industry into the mainstream.

Though it’s still relatively early days some of the biggest names in finance – including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs – are already betting big on blockchain. In fact, JPMorgan’s crypto team is already staffed by 200 full-time employees.

Blockchain has the potential to touch nearly every corner of the traditional financial industry, ranging from investment banks to private equity firms, hedge funds, law firms, payments providers and more. As a result, there will be a massive need for qualified talent with an equally broad range of blockchain-based skills throughout the sector in the years ahead.

As more traditional institutions look to grow their blockchain capabilities – and with it, their talent rosters – many are looking for some sort of educational standard. That is especially true in finance, a heavily regulated industry that has long had to maintain strict licensing and educational requirements for compliance reasons, and is accustomed to considering candidates in large part based on their formal education.

While some may fear the finance industry having an outsized influence on blockchain education, Rabin said its strongest promoters remain the blockchain-native startups, at least for now.

“At this point in time the people who are giving funds to universities to create educational programs are the blockchain companies, not the traditional financial industry, so at this point their voice is being heard more,” she said.

Up until quite recently, however, there was no such thing as formal education in blockchain, and what exists today is hardly sufficient to support a finance industry that is taking blockchain’s potential seriously, as many finally are.

The relatively young crypto industry, in near total contrast, has long prized those self-taught enthusiasts over those who descend from an ivory tower, in keeping with the decentralized, grassroots nature of the movement. That mentality, however, may soon be at risk of becoming a victim of its own success.

The self-taught pioneers of the field were so effective in convincing the rest of the world to take the space seriously that many traditional financial institutions are rapidly enhancing their blockchain capabilities and are hungry for talent; too hungry to rely on the self-taught talent pool alone. Now the market is calling for a more effective and universal education infrastructure that can help carry the industry into the future.

“There’s been a big step change in demand,” says Caroline Lo, a partner and co-leader of the financial services practice at True, a global executive talent search firm. “It started when a number of very well-known hedge funds stated that 2% of their wealth was in crypto; statements like that raised the bar of confidence that crypto is here to stay.”

Today, more than a third of traditional hedge funds invest in digital assets, according to a recent PwC report, and more than two-thirds intend to increase their holdings by the end of the year.

Lo, who spent 15 working for traditional financial institutions, says the heavily regulated industry is accustomed to hiring staff with a seal of approval from a trusted educational institution, or those who have at least passed a standard evaluation.

“For example, to become a salesperson selling derivatives you have to have achieved a certain level of knowledge in derivative understanding and risk profiles and know how the product is traded in order to sell it,” she said. “Anyone in the derivative market takes that same test, whether they’re in London or Hong Kong or New York.”

Lo explains that while many in the industry are still curious about the technology and keen to expand their blockchain capabilities, they often can’t move as quickly as they would like because of the challenges associated with qualifying talent.

“What companies go through now when they're hiring at a junior or mid level is they have to go through more rounds of interviewing than they would for a non-crypto hire in order to build confidence and consensus that this person has the required skills,” she said.

Lo added that the task is made harder by the number of enthusiasts who are self-taught but not to a sufficient degree. She explained that many can talk the talk in an interview but it’s much harder to identify those who actually have the required skills.

“If there was some kind of understanding and certification that people could achieve, it would be very helpful to the industry,” she said. “It would set a bar for quality and confidence in the industry, which could help blockchain and crypto become more mainstream within financial services.”

For the meantime Lo said most are relying on their ability to up-skill existing staff or hire candidates with relevant education in adjacent fields. There also seems to be a preference for candidates who participate in on-campus blockchain clubs, and those with some prior work experience at blockchain-related startups. She is also seeing a lot of traditional financial institutions putting together teams that combine blockchain skills with experts from other disciplines when they struggle to find enough candidates with expertise in both areas.

“For example, where we see a lot of that activity is in building up teams in payments companies,” said Lo. “What a number of firms have had to do is put together a team where some people know payments and some people know crypto, but it’s been very hard to find anyone who knows crypto payments.”

What happens to the self-taught?

While the industry is calling for more regulation, educational standards and eventually a broadly accepted credential, Lo also said it's important to exercise caution, especially in such a new and fragile field. She, like many, fears what might happen if educational requirements become too stringent, or lead companies to dismiss those without a certain credential.

“You can go too far with something like that, especially in a market that is still very early but is hugely creative,” said Lo. “You need to make sure it's set the right way so that innovation is not stifled, but it allows for fantastically innovative and creative people to have an accreditation that recognizes them as being qualified to build, create and advise on crypto.”

A field that combines technology and finance striking a balance between the self-taught and the credentialed will be delicate but vital to enabling ongoing innovation. The tech industry itself has long welcomed the talented dropout on an equal playing field with the top-tier university graduate, but finance generally has a preference for one profile over the other.

If and when a broadly accepted credential is established, however, it could serve to limit the career opportunities of those without one.

Gina Pieters, an assistant instructional professor at the University of Chicago’s Department of Economics – which offers blockchain-specific undergraduate and graduate-level courses – isn’t concerned that more formal education will push out those who are self-taught, however. That is because she said the two are rarely competing for the same career opportunities; the self-taught tend to prefer working for (or starting) blockchain native companies, as opposed to working for more traditional institutions.

“It fulfills a slightly different niche,” she said. “People will continue self-studying, and we encourage that. I don't think we are replacing that, and I don't think it's a competing product.”

Pieters explained that students who are eyeing careers in blockchain-native companies and startups tend to take those courses out of personal interest. Those who are keen on applying for roles with traditional financial institutions, however, seem confident that even a limited educational background in the field will serve as an asset.

“If students want to go to J.P. Morgan or a traditional firm, they’ll think, ‘this might give me an edge,’” she said. “For them it’s adding an additional ability to talk about when they're interviewing.”

Those who are seeking jobs in major financial institutions after graduation believe that even listing a blockchain-related course on their résumé is an asset, given the demand for such skills and the limited credentialing that exists. “With the traditional firm going into the crypto space you see a far more traditional mindset in that regard,” she said.

At the same time Pieters doesn’t think those same candidates are taking job opportunities away from the self-educated. “The self-study students would prefer a job with a crypto [or blockchain-native] firm,” she said.

As of now the two worlds work well together, with both the formally educated and self-taught finding their own place within the industry. What she and others fear, however, is that the push to establish more formal educational standards and credentials could limit opportunities for those who are self-educated.

“If firms accept sub-standard workers simply because they have formal education, that's a failure,” she said. “At the same time there are people for whom the formal education system works well, and to say we should only accept self-study learners is also unfair.”",blockchain,yahoo entertainment

Now, immudb can be used as an Ethereum Layer-2 solution using Zero-Knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) to massively increase throughput by moving computation and state-storage off-chain.

Until now, technical limitations and regulations for financial services and others have made it hard or even impossible for businesses to store data in a blockchain. With this new immudb extension, the integrity and verifiability of data stored on-premises is now also guaranteed by the public and distributed ethereum blockchain, without storing actual data outside of immudb. Users can store their data in immudb and stay compliant with regulations and still enjoy the benefit of a blockchain proof of no tampering, beyond what immudb already offers.

“The combination of the tamper-proof immudb data store with ethereum provides an added layer of security no one else has, while delivering regulatory compliance, and most importantly, maintaining the high performance of immudb that is millions of transactions per second,” said Dennis Zimmer, chief technology officer of Codenotary, the maintainer of open source immudb.

Unlike other databases, immudb is built on a zero-trust model: history is preserved and can't be changed. Data in immudb comes with cryptographic verification at every transaction to ensure there is no tampering possible. immudb can be deployed in cluster configurations for demanding applications that require high scalability, up to billions of transactions per day, and high availability. The support of both key/value along with SQL makes it simple to use immudb in new and existing applications. Support for Amazon’s S3 storage cloud provides immudb with virtually unlimited data storage capacity. With immudb’s Time Travel feature, organizations can travel back and forth in time and see the change history of their data.

immudb is capable of protecting sensitive data for workloads that require the utmost in security. Codenotary uses immudb to underpin its software supply chain security product. There have been more than 15 million downloads of immudb so far. The software can be downloaded here on GitHub. To learn more, go to https://immudb.io/enterprise.

The Bitcoin Industry

According to an industry analysis report by Research and Markets, the global Bitcoin market size is expected to be valued at $20.63 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow to $132.91 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 26.2% over the forecasted period. The drivers for this growth include the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by governments and businesses globally and the notion of decentralization of finance.

Bitcoin Miners Go Green

In the wake of soaring energy prices and rampant inflation, Bitcoin miners have changed their ways to maintain their profit margins and shifted to using clean energy to validate transactions on the network. On September 27, Bloomberg reported that according to recent data from the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance greenhouse gas emissions from Bitcoin mining operations are on the pace to decline 14.1% year over year in 2022.

“It’s a 100x Better Than Gold”: Michael Saylor’s Thoughts on Bitcoin

Michael Saylor is an American entrepreneur and co-founder of business intelligence company MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR). As of 2022, Forbes estimates Mr. Saylor’s net worth to be $1.6 billion. Michael Saylor has been a prominent backer of Bitcoin since the currency’s early days. On September 23, Michael Saylor appeared on MarketWatch’s Money Festival to discuss his outlook on Bitcoin and why he believes that “the next logical step for Bitcoin is to replace gold as a non-sovereign store of value asset” because “Bitcoin is digital gold” and “Bitcoin is 100x better than gold”. Mr. Saylor thinks that by 2030, Bitcoin will reach the value of gold, and is expected to reach a value of $500,000 per unit. Mr. Saylor also disclosed that he owns 17,732 Bitcoins as of September 23 and that he had acquired these over the past two years at roughly $9,500 per coin. Here is Michael Saylor’s long-term projection for Bitcoin:

Story continues

“I think this is the decade where Bitcoin institutionalizes from 2020 to 2030… Over the long term, I think first it becomes the trillion-dollar asset in the crypto world, then it becomes the ten trillion dollar replacement for gold as a precious metal. And over time people start to see it as a superior property to real estate or physical property because I can’t move a billion-dollar building from New York to San Francisco, but I can move a billion-dollar block of Bitcoin from New York to San Francisco…”

For investors that are looking to avoid the pervasive volatility of crypto assets and Bitcoin, companies that are involved in the Bitcoin industry can offer them passive and low-risk exposure to the digital currency. In addition to MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), prominent backers of Bitcoin and blockchain technology include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).

Huxley Peckham, head trainer for Blockchain Academy International told Cointelegraph that there are “very few qualified people in the blockchain industry, but there is big demand for qualified people,” noting that worldwide, there are at least 60 different industries using blockchain tech.

Both Peckman, and Blockchain Academy International founder Tim Bowman said it was time to rapidly expand blockchain education in schools in order to prepare for a shift in the world economy.

Peckham believes blockchain education is important as it will allow “the next generation of strategists and consultants to come out with some real grip in this industry,” noting that knowing how to apply the technology will “really enhance their career.”

He suggested blockchain is a lucrative industry to jump into, noting he’s seen various jobs in the industry commanding “$300,000 [Australian dollars] plus incentives.”

Chris Berg, co-director of RMIT University Blockchain Innovation Hub, told Cointelegraph that it is vital students have an idea “on what does the economy look like, how the economy is changing” as it relates to cryptocurrency and blockchain.

Berg firmly believes that students “need to leave year 12 with an understanding of the changing nature of the economy, and the technologies that will affect it, one of those is blockchain.”

Meanwhile, Leigh Travers, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance Australia, told Cointelegraph that it was imperative that Australian students can access the same level of high-quality education in blockchain as those seeking a career in traditional industries.

Travers noted that Binance Australia recently introduced a “Binance Internship” — allowing students to learn from the best in “Web3 and crypto” and “hopefully land jobs outside of that.”

This is alongside plans for Binance Australia to form a partnership with Australian universities so that a “blockchain master’s degree” can be established to help people “get into the Metaverse or build that out for the future.”

Bowman noted that his academy has “met with a school in Brisbane who are going to be offering a Diploma of Applied Blockchain to their year 11 and 12 students in 2023.”

Related: Top universities have added crypto to the curriculum

Blockchain Academy International is the first blockchain education facility to be approved in Australia for government-issued student loans.

This allows Australians to enroll in its blockchain courses without having to pay upfront, instead taking out a loan with the Australian government the same way university loans are provided.

Bowman said he believes young Australians are already ahead of the curve in many ways recalling a personal experience he had talking to a primary school principal who asked a sixth-grade class “who here knows what an NFT is?” which was followed by “half the class putting their hands up” before learning that “six students had already bought an NFT.”

238,Circle Product VP: USDC chain expansion part of 'multichain' vision,https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjItMDkvY2ZlNmVlOTktNGFmNC00ZmRhLWJjZTktODY3NDgyNzk2MjQ2LmpwZWc=.jpg,29/09/2022,"Speaking with Cointelegraph, Circle’s vice president of Product Joao Reginatto emphasized that devs soon won’t care what blockchain they build on, as interoperability will be key.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-product-vp-usdc-chain-expansion-part-of-multichain-vision,"USD Coin (USDC) issuers Circle have announced that it will soon roll out its stablecoin across five additional networks including Polkadot, Optimism, Near, Arbitrum and Cosmos.

The firm first dropped the news at the Converge22 event on Sept. 28 and noted that support for most of these blockchains will be rolled out by the end of 2023, while USDC on Cosmos will go live at the start of 2023.

In a Sept. 28 statement, Circle’s vice president of Product Joao Reginatto emphasized that the expansion of USDC will provide “greater liquidity and interoperability within the crypto economy,” particularly the commercial sector.

“Extending multi-chain support for USDC opens the door for institutions, exchanges, developers and more to innovate and have easier access to a trusted and stable digital dollar,” he said.

3/ Upon launch, developers will be able to use Circle APIs for fiat on/off-ramps to and from USDC in their products, as well as programmable wallets infrastructure. — Circle | #ConvergeSF22 | Sept 27-30 (@circlepay) September 28, 2022

In a follow-up interview with Cointelegraph, Reginatto outlined that while Circle initially built USDC on Ethereum as more development and activity was happening there, it always had a vision that the future would be a “multichain world.”

As such, Circle is expanding USDC support under the premise of devs preferring interoperability over working with just one network:

“We knew already at the time that there were a lot of interesting things happening in other ecosystems, and we thought that over time developers and application builders; they are not going to be so much concerned about the Layer 1 or the Layer 2 infrastructure that they’re using.”

“They will want interoperability, they will want flexibility to be able to port their solutions across ecosystems,” he added.

Reginatto did note that while Circle is pushing ahead with expanding USDC support, given the current size of the stablecoin — with a market cap of $48.9 billion — the firm won’t just jump behind any network.

He outlined that Circle conducts a lot of due diligence before it selects the next blockchain to work with.

“There’s a lot of risks that we have now that we perhaps didn’t have two or three years ago. So we take it with a lot of diligence. We have a team of folks across all the functions in the company kind of assessing all these ecosystems and prioritizing them over time.

Once the extra support is officially rolled out, USDC will be available on a total of 13 blockchains. In comparison, Circle’s main competitor Tether currently lists Tether (USDT) support for eight networks on its website.

“Upon launch, developers will be able to use Circle APIs for fiat on/off-ramps to and from USDC in their products, as well as programmable wallets infrastructure,” Circle stated on Twitter.

Related: Circle CEO says blockchain industry is transitioning from dial-up to broadband phase

Commenting on the use cases for USDC and stablecoins in the current context of crypto, Reginatto highlighted key avenues such as marketplace payouts, remittances, and global settlements for financial institutions:

“There’s no real good interoperability across all these banking systems and regional rails. Stablecoins have a really, really good value proposition for that.”

“Stripe utilizing USDC rails for marketplace payouts. Embedding that as part of their marketplace payouts products, just being able to reach people that their customers need to pay out, that with traditional rails they can’t reach. So that there is clear concrete value that the substrate can deliver for those kinds of use cases,” he added.",blockchain,cointelegraph
239,Illuvium co-founder shares plans for new ‘interoperable blockchain game’ model,https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjItMDkvM2E1NjQ2ZTAtYjFmMS00YThkLWJiZDYtZGE2N2NiN2E2M2JkLmpwZw==.jpg,29/09/2022,The role-playing blockchain game Illuvium has three games in development featuring interconnected nonfungible tokens (NFTs) which can be used across multiple games.,https://cointelegraph.com/news/illuvium-co-founder-shares-plans-for-new-interoperable-blockchain-game-model,"Kieran Warwick, co-founder of blockchain role-playing game Illuvium has lifted the curtain on a gaming concept he says has never been done before — the interoperable blockchain game (IBG).

Speaking to Cointelegraph during Token2049 in Singapore, Warwick said Illuvium has three games currently being built that will be underpinned by the same economy, governed by a single token (ILV) and connected by the blockchain — making it an interoperable experience.

“We're building something that has never been done before not in the mainstream and not in Web3.”

IBG, a term coined by Illuvium, is a series of blockchain games connected to each other, forming an ecosystem of interconnected titles that share nonfungible tokens (NFTs), a common in-game currency, or both.

Warwick says Illuvium is a “fun game” first and foremost, with player enjoyment as a cornerstone, rather than the play-to-earn (P2E) and NFT aspects of some titles on which the GameFi space has tended to focus.

He hopes the shift in focus could be the key to attracting players from the mainstream games market.

“In our genres that we're hitting, there might be roughly 500 million people that we can bring in that literally won't know that they're playing a crypto game.”

The first game is a city builder, one that Warwick says is a “combination of Sim City and Clash of Clans” where players can build and mine resources for use in the second game, “Overworld.”

Overworld focuses on exploring and capturing creatures called “Illuvials,” which Warwick compares to Pokemon, that can then be battled in the third game, which will be similar to online battle arena titles such as “Teamfight Tactics or DOTA.”

Warwick says they might not stop at three games th, adding at some point they want to “build another six games on top.”

“Imagine taking one of those assets and then going over to the racetrack and playing a Mario Kart game, but you're not buying a new Nintendo game, it's just one asset that's usable across an entire universe of games.”

At this stage, Illuvium still doesn’t have a formal release date but Warwick hopes to have a working beta in the next two or three months, with plans to publish on mobile, PC and Mac.

“I reckon probably sometime really early next year is when we'll have open beta with yields and all the aspects that we need, but not fully polished.”

Illuvium is governed by the Illuvium DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. Warwick said originally, they were going to raise $350 million in funding during the bull market, but the ongoing crypto winter has seen them scale back to between $10 million and $20 million.

Warwick also revealed he made the Australian Financial Review's, ""Young Rich List,"" again this year — but the market conditions mean the billion dollars he was worth last year are a distant memory.

Warwick jokingly noted that this was not a concern as his main motivation is only to be richer than his brother, Kain Warwick, the founder of Synthetix, who also made the Australian Financial Review's, ""Young Rich List,"" in 2022.",blockchain,cointelegraph

SYS Labs, a Corporation, is focused on driving the global mass adoption of the Syscoin blockchain through research, creation, and promotion of leading-edge Web3 applications and infrastructure aimed to attract and support mass adoption.

”It’s a new era for blockchain. SYS Labs is 100% focused on actualizing a big vision that is finally within reach; Global mass adoption and transformative financial inclusivity worldwide,” said Jagdeep Sidhu, SYS Labs CTO. “Building on top of Syscoin’s new modular stack is one of the necessary keys to unlock this ‘last mile’ achievement. Go-to dapps with mass appeal seemed impossible for blockchain just a short time ago. Recent advancements have changed everything, and more new breakthroughs are close. There are a lot of ways for SYS Labs to capitalize on this. Primarily, we will drive demand to Syscoin where it is served best.”

The combined scalability and security of Syscoin’s new tech like Proof of Data Availability (PoDA) and its Layer 2 rollups suite called Rollux, means there are a lot of new untapped use cases for blockchain that are yet to be discovered. SYS Labs already has several working products and some new ideas they are ready to get started on quickly spanning the metaverse, NFT and gamefi platforms, regulatory-compliant rollups for institutions and enterprises, decentralized identity systems, and state-of-the-art user experiences - all secured in the background by Bitcoin’s network through Syscoin’s merge-mined protocol. SYS Labs refers to this as ‘Web3 with the security of Bitcoin.’

Importantly, the company’s research will extend into other frontiers of decentralized technology. More specifically, the internet of things (IoT), as well as leveraging and supporting zero-knowledge cryptography in new ways. Both are thought to have a lot of positive and disruptive implications for the future - especially considering the potentials for A.I. and smart cities.

While a variety of recent blockchain enterprises have taken off, such as Ava Labs, Starkware and Matter Labs, SYS Labs has perhaps positioned itself advantageously by focusing on a full-stack modular blockchain that is holistically designed to support its own rollup implementations. With many of SYS Labs’ founders originating from the long-established Syscoin project, the company has a solid understanding of its own full-spectrum environment, the blockchain industry as a whole, and how to sustain and feed the roots of a Layer 1 so that value can grow upward.

Emurgo is a founding entity of the Cardano protocol and develops products, services and applications meant to support the growth of the network.

The funds, which are from Emurgo’s own capital, will be provided to projects directly building atop Cardano and to projects from other networks that build products that integrate Cardano’s network alongside their own.

Kodama said $100 million will be earmarked for investments in Africa under Emurgo’s African investment initiative. He explained that a key growth driver in the region was the use of lending and borrowing crypto services meant for daily life, as opposed to speculative purposes.

Kodama acknowledged that the growth of the Cardano network had been relatively slow compared with other networks. However, he added that Cardano was now ready with the infrastructure needed to safely expand and grow the network in the coming years.

Earlier this month, Cardano's long-awaited Vasil hard fork went live. The fork will allow the use of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps), which run on a blockchain system without a central administrator, on the network.

Looking To Diversify in a Bear Market? Consider These 6 Alternative Investments

Jeng talked to us about why crypto matters and how the space would be better heard “if it were less bombastic” and tried to understand the challenges policymakers face “in a world of few resources and support.” In turn, she talked about how, in her role at the Crypto Council, her goal is to build bridges between the crypto industry and policymakers.

Jeng also addressed the need for the industry to proactively recruit, groom and promote more female engineers and executives.

How did you come to the crypto industry?

LJ: I felt it was by happenstance. But, if you zoom it out, it makes a lot of sense. I was one of the first former regulators to work for a blockchain startup. My first startup realized that it needed someone who understood banking and securities regulation and DC policies.

Can you describe what you are doing at the Crypto Council?

LJ: I am the general counsel and chief regulatory officer at CCI. My job is to help drive policy strategy for a stronger and vibrant blockchain economy and to build bridges between the crypto industry and policymakers.

Can you talk about how your previous experience is shaping what you’re currently doing?

LJ: I was a traditional regulator for most of my career before I got into financial technology. My perspective is still one of public service and what I can do to help improve the economy and financial system for the underserved and our nation.

What excites you the most in the space?

LJ: The open and equitable access to financial services along with high transparency.

Story continues

What do you think should change in the space?

LJ: I think the crypto industry would be better heard if it were less bombastic and tried to understand the challenges policymakers face in a world of few resources and support.

Can you talk about how the industry is male-dominated and what could be done to change this?

LJ: We need more female engineers and more female founders. It’s a sad state when female founders of blockchain companies make up a single-digit percentage of the industry. I’ve worked in environments dominated by men, which inevitably skews the perspective and culture of the organization. I was at a company that had around 10% female engineers. I witnessed how hard it was for them to be heard and taken seriously even though they were fantastic.

Did you have any mentor and who are the women you admire in the space?

LJ: I wouldn’t say I’ve had the same mentors throughout the arc of my career. But I’ve been fortunate enough to have many people be generous in giving me advice at various points of my career. In the end, you still have to figure it out yourself, and being interested in what I’m doing has always been my North Star.

What could be done for the industry to be more inclusive? Which companies are making targeted efforts?

LJ: The industry should proactively recruit, groom and promote more female engineers and executives. At CCI, we are very conscious when we make hiring decisions.

Why do you think crypto matters?

“We believe that this case has become highly politicized, and that the actions of the Korean prosecutors demonstrate unfairness and a failure to uphold basic rights guaranteed under Korean law,” a Terraform Labs spokesman said to the Wall Street Journal on Sept. 28.

South Korean prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon on Sept. 14 for violations of the countries capital markets laws, but Terraform Labs laid out a defense arguing Terra, now known with its new token, Luna Classic (LUNC), isn’t legally a security, meaning it isn’t covered by capital markets laws.

The spokesman alleged prosecutors of expanding the definition of a security due to intense public pressure from the collapse of Terra and its connected algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST), now known as TerraUSD Classic (USTC):

“We believe, as do most in industry, that Luna Classic is not, and has never been, a security, despite any changes in interpretation that Korean financial officials may have recently adopted.”

The argument by Terraform Labs’ stems from the unclear regulatory status of cryptocurrencies and the companies who create and issue them.

Currently, capital market and electronic securities' systems in the country don’t include a legal definition of non-standardized securities issued through a blockchain.

The country is moving to regulate the space with its financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) preparing guidelines for security tokens by the end of 2022.

A leaked government report in May further revealed South Korea’s plans to roll out a crypto framework by 2024.

Kwon’s whereabouts remain unknown and Terraform Labs did not comment on his location citing physical security risks, but Kwon says he’s not making an effort to hide even after a notice was sent to global authorities by Interpol.",blockchain,cointelegraph

Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov announced the project at its SmartCon 2022 Conference in New York on Sept. 28 alongside SWIFT strategy director Jonathan Ehrenfeld Solé.

SWIFT is using the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) in an initial proof of concept.



CCIP will enable SWIFT messages to instruct on-chain token transfers, helping the SWIFT network become interoperable across all blockchain environments.https://t.co/8GOBNhzwCk pic.twitter.com/Pvm0Cex45e — Chainlink (@chainlink) September 28, 2022

At the conference, Solé said there is “undeniable interest from institutional investors into digital assets,” adding these traditional finance players want access to digital and traditional assets on one platform.

The PoC utilizes Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP), allowing SWIFT messages to instruct token transfers across nearly every blockchain network, which, according to Nazarov, will accelerate the adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT) blockchains across capital markets and traditional finance.

The SWIFT interbank messaging system is the most widely used platform for traditional cross-border fiat transactions, connecting over 11,000 banks around the world. In August the system recorded an average of 44.8 million messages per day.

However, transactions on SWIFT’s network can take several days to complete. The company has been exploring blockchain and DLT technology and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to facilitate faster payments.

Chainlink added this collaboration with SWIFT allows financial institutions to gain blockchain capability without replacing, developing and integrating new connectivity into legacy systems, something it said would require substantial modifications with an “exceptionally high” cost.

Related: Why interoperability is the key to blockchain technology’s mass adoption

Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach said at a panel session in May on CBDCs that he doesn’t expect SWIFT to exist in five years, likely due to the rising competition from CBDCs for cross-border payments and settlements.

A few days ago, these developments led to the completion of the Ethereum Merge.

Ethereum was developed with the Solidity programming language. However, the Merge led to the development of a new programming language, which will make it easier for developers to be part of the network.

Blockchain Developments Are the Driving Forces Behind the Ethereum Merge

The blockchain infrastructure has been one of the most disruptive technological breakthroughs of the 21st Century. Developers have been working extensively to improve the blockchain in many ways. AJ Agrawal wrote a post in Entrepreneur that focused on some of the improvements that could be made to the blockchain. These include using solutions like MetaHash to improve the existing blockchain infrastructure, using parallel subcommittees, splitting the block verification process, and leveraging other technologies to enhance privacy and scalability.

These infrastructural developments have led to a number of trends as more developers push for new advances in blockchain technology. The Ethereum network is among the entities most affected.

In an industry built on digital prowess and revolutionary technological thinking, companies that stagnate are doomed, so the Ethereum network must constantly innovate to keep pace with an ever-changing landscape, or risk being left behind.

The Ethereum Merge has shaped the future of Avalanche 2. New developments in the blockchain have given the network blistering speeds and a robust framework that poses a serious threat to Ethereum.

However, the Ethereum Merge is now upon us. Will this monumental event in crypto history allow Ethereum to swat aside its potential usurpers? Let’s find out.

What Changes Have Developers Introduced and What Does the Merge Mean for Developers Moving Forward?

Developers wrote the code for the Ethereum Merge with the Solidity programming language. However, the changes have led to the inception of an entirely new language, which will make it easier for developers to join the Ethereum community.

The Ethereum Merge has involved some significant changes in the Ethereum blockchain. Before the change took place, it operated across two different blockchains: one that focused on proof of stake and another that used proof of work. These blockchains were merged into one after the Ethereum Merge took place.

Developers actually created a new programming language to carry out the Ethereum Merge. They are releasing it to the public, so other programmers can create secure code on the EVM network.

These changes are backward compatible, so developers that already created code for the network won’t have to make modifications. They will have to make modifications to their code with future updates. However, they will have an easier time, since the network has released a new programming language that will be easier to generate code for it.

What Is The Ethereum Merge?

Originally, the Ethereum blockchain platform operated on what is known as a proof-of-work (PoW) system. PoW is a consensus mechanism, used to verify and record crypto transactions. Transactions are added as blocks to the blockchain, needing confirmation of legitimacy before being added. Blocks generate a unique hash, with participants on the network, or miners, competing to generate a hash that is equal to or less than that of the block. Once this target hash is generated, the block will be confirmed, and the winning miner will be rewarded with new cryptocurrency. PoW requires immense computing power to generate these hash codes and is the primary reason behind crypto’s negative carbon footprint.

With the Merge, Ethereum moved to a new system known as proof-of-stake (PoS). This protocol randomly selects a validator from currency holders, based on how much of the currency they have staked in the blockchain. Their coins are used as collateral when chosen, and they are then rewarded when a transaction is validated. In the PoS system, several validators are required to verify a transaction before it can go through. PoS offers several advantages over PoW: it is faster, provides more financial incentives for participants, and perhaps most importantly, significantly reduces required computational power and therefore detrimental impact on the environment.

Developers Come Up With Major Improvements to Ethereum Network as Ethereum Merge Rolls Out

Developers around the world have introduced some changes to blockchain and other infrastructural elements of the Ethereum network. These changes have had a significant effect both on Ethereum and other digital coins. They can help improve the logistics of the network, but they are equally important in helping with energy efficiency. This development is one of the biggest selling points of the recent changes since many investors are concerned about sustainability.",blockchain,dzone.com

With coyni, users can confidently execute consumer-to-consumer, consumer-to-business or business-to-business transactions using secure and reliable blockchain technology

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 29, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GreenBox POS (NASDAQ: GBOX), a financial technology company that leverages proprietary blockchain security and token technology to deliver customized payment solutions, has launched the coyni platform, featuring one of the world’s few stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars on a one-to-one ratio with near real-time attestation.

Each coyni digital token held in a wallet on the platform is matched with one U.S. dollar held in a custodial account with a federally insured financial institution. The dollars backing coyni stablecoin are not tied up in investments or converted to other cryptocurrencies — a practice that has led to the failure of other stablecoins and severe market disruption. In addition, GreenBox announced earlier this year a partnership with audit firm Armanino to attest to all coyni custodial accounts in near real-time, ensuring every coyni in circulation is always backed by a U.S. dollar.

“In the U.S., coyni is literally a digital representation of a U.S. dollar, but with what we believe is the ability to transact with greater flexibility and security than cash itself,” said Fredi Nisan, GreenBox POS CEO. “As a result, if you receive a $10 payment via the coyni platform, you can have absolute confidence that payment will not vary in value like with other cryptocurrency or even stablecoins using alternative backing methodologies. This allows coyni users to enjoy the speed and security of blockchain transactions with the stability of U.S. currency — something we don’t believe any other company offers,” he added.

Consumers and businesses can use the coyni platform for nearly any kind of payment, transfer of currency or the purchase of a myriad of different gift cards. Dollars are converted to coyni and the transaction is memorialized on the company’s secure blockchain, in the blink of an eye.

Story continues

Market turmoil with stablecoin models that are pegged using an algorithmic methodology or tie backing assets in non-liquid or risky investments have caused a great deal of industry turmoil. GreenBox is committed to having current reserves in the trust (custodial) accounts to ensure liquidity under any scenario. This means all funds will be readily available in the event all users elect to exit at the same time in a ""run-on-bank"" type scenario. To underscore this commitment, after a lengthy process of IT review, compliance checks and completing SOC 2 compliance certification, GreenBox received final approval for near real-time attestations of all custodial accounts from Armanino.

“Many companies are performing weekly or monthly attestations, but that’s a bit like an air traffic control report from several days ago,” said Nisan. “Our customers have the assurance that every coyni in circulation is backed by a U.S. dollar in our custodial accounts in close to real time, which can be verified by users on our coyni website through our link to Armanino.”

The coyni platform is currently available on Google Play and coming soon on iOS. For consumer or business account registration, please visit www.coyni.com.

Listen To The Episode Here:

Q: It’s almost like the state secretly hates you. If only someone had been warning people about this the whole time.

Natalie Smolenski: Whether they hate you or not, “hate” is almost too personal. They don't care about you. Power is sovereign in a way that is morally neutral, like the exercise of power is unaccountable, it is final, it is not subject to adjudication or contestation. This is why the enlightenment-era political theorists said the only way to have a just society was to pit power against power. The separation of powers as a foundational principle of our society. It wasn't perfect, but it was the best model that had been developed to date.

Now we see, major political party leaders explicitly arguing that we don't need the separation of powers anymore and procedurally working to undermine it. What does that mean? It means whether they like you or hate you, they will behave with impunity toward you. That's the end goal.",blockchain,bitcoin magazine

This uncertainty draws comparisons to the Dot Com crash of 2001. While there were certainly losers during that time period, the aftermath saw many of the tools we use on a daily basis now grow rapidly — like Google and Amazon. Another commonality between that early period of Web 1.0 and Web3 is the siren song drawing people from their “safe” jobs inside large companies, like IBM and Microsoft at the time, to pursue something completely different. Web3 currently lures people from the perceived safety of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, and Alphabet, Google’s parent, are both signaling impending layoffs, which makes a career in Web 2.0 less certain.

I recently caught up with Dev Varadhan, who left his role as Vice President of Delivery Experience at Amazon at the end of 2020 to join crypto company Ripple as an SVP of Engineering. I wanted to find out why someone who spent the majority of the last 20 years at Amazon opted to make the leap to Web3.

Ripple was born out of a belief that there was a better approach to cryptocurrency than the Bitcoin approach to mining. It ultimately evolved into Ripple the company, building technology solutions on the XRP Ledger, which is a layer one blockchain with all the core functionality of alternatives like Ethereum, Solana and Bitcoin. One of the core components of Ripple’s business is eliminating all the intermediaries in the payment process. While I’m always extremely skeptical of the finance side of blockchain technologies, I can see the benefit of removing many of the fee-generating layers of the current payment infrastructure that are required for building payment solutions today.

Why Leave the Safety of Big Tech?

In an interview with The New Stack, Varadhan explained how, in his view, “Web3 is different from previous generational shifts.”

“At its core, it’s about giving back power to the users,” he said about the Web3 trend. “You can break away from the world where having a social media account means having your personal data sold to advertisers, or worse. When built correctly, we can have the benefits of the internet, without handing the majority of the power to a few powerful companies. Most of the progress in Web3 has been around that restructure of control.”

That utopian shift from users being the product to users regaining control is something that I hear repeated in many of the conversations I have around Web3. Admittedly, it resonates with me too. I like the idea of being in control of how much of my data gets shared and who it gets shared with.

Varadhan sees more similarities than differences in looking at Web3 compared to the Dot Com period. “Crypto is one of the most exciting industries to be in right now,” he said. “It’s not just me, there are many people leaving the big tech giants and traditional finance to enter the space. Imagine joining Google or Amazon back in the nineties and having the opportunity to shape the internet into what it is today. That’s how I think about the crypto space today.”

That similarity extends to the opportunities available in Web3. “What motivated me to stay at Amazon for almost 15 years is that when technology is built and scaled correctly, it can have a very profound impact on people’s lives,” Varadhan said. “I’ve seen it first-hand, where it really makes a difference on a day-to-day basis. That’s how we think about it within Ripple, where the kinds of problems we solve on behalf of our customers have the same opportunity, both for engineers and all Ripplers combined, where the problems are very longitudinal and we believe when built and scaled well will have a very profound impact on the world.”

Where Is Web3 Falling Short?

I see a great deal of opportunity for Web3 to make some positive changes to the way the web works. If developers are incentivized to build applications that take advantage of some of the benefits of zero knowledge, like the ones illustrated in my article about the Aleo blockchain, the notion of users controlling their data starts to get real traction. However, we’re not there yet.

“If you look at where Web 2.0 is in the current mature state, the focus is around performance, features, and scalability,” said Varadhan. “From a Web3 improvement perspective, scale, speed, performance and convenience all require inventions we haven’t seen yet. Many Web3 applications are slower than Web 2.0 counterparts.”

Thinking about a Switch to Web3

There’s a certain safety in sticking with what you know. But there are also risks that go along with playing it safe. Each of the big tech companies has adopted its own vocabulary to describe their desire for employees to be open to change. One example is Microsoft’s growth mindset, highlighted in the culture section of their career page. Failure to have a “growth mindset” can be a career limiting move, at least if you want a job at Microsoft.

I asked Varadhan if he looks for specific skills when hiring software engineers into Web3 roles. “We look for adaptability, curiosity, and willingness to learn,” he replied, “which are all more important than pre-existing blockchain knowledge. Being technically fearless is very important, especially when you are solving problems to deliver solutions at a global scale — you invariably need to make some fundamental breakthroughs.”

He went on to break this down to four key aspects:

Deep customer understanding

Engineering strength

Ability to Invent

Operational results

He said, “I think of these as muscle groups rather than skill sets, in the sense that you’re never done. There’s no fixed state. You have to keep building.” That sounds pretty similar to what Microsoft calls a growth mindset.

Any Differences in Leading a Web3 Engineering Team?

I asked Varadhan about the differences between leading an engineering team at a company like Amazon vs. leading a team building for Web3. I anticipated a different answer than the one he gave me, which might be because the majority of the developers I’ve talked to are on teams that are very geographically distributed. He said, “I don’t think there are lots of differences. It comes back to those same things I mentioned around having a customer focus and being able to look at your own solutions through the divine discontent type of lens. You need to be critical and honest about what’s flawed, while continuing to invent.”

This perspective sounds like it could be carrying Amazon culture into the Web3 space, with a nod to Jeff Bezos’ 2017 letter to Amazon shareholders, where he wrote, “One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static – they go up.”

While Amazon is far from perfect, its focus on meeting rising customer expectations is a model that could benefit Web3 more broadly. The current state of user experience, starting with trying to use a cryptocurrency wallet for the first time, is one that comes up lacking. In that light, it may take more people like Dev Varadhan choosing to focus on Web3 to achieve the web’s next evolution.",blockchain,thenewstack.io

Ethereum, one of the most popular...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-merge-public-policy-miracle-163229792.html,"A public policy miracle happened two weeks ago and we should not let it pass quietly just because it went smoothly.

Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchains on the planet, reduced its energy consumption by about 99% and increased its cyber resilience by overhauling the way network participants validate transactions – a milestone called “The Merge.”

Now, instead of using about as much energy as all the televisions and computers in America combined annually (100 billion kilowatt hours, according to the Biden administration), Ethereum will use as much energy on an annual basis as Gibraltar, which has just 30,000 residents, all while supporting billions of dollars worth of transactions daily.

Jared A. Favole is a senior director of communications and policy at Circle, the principal operator of USD coin (USDC).

Instead of continuing to use a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, where high-end computers perform and solve energy-intensive mathematical proofs to validate transactions, Ethereum now uses a proof-of-stake model. Using proof-of-stake means network participants will instead deposit ether, the native token of Ethereum, as collateral to validate transactions. (The process to “mine” or validate transactions on the Bitcoin network still uses proof-of-work.)

The Merge is a great example of the benefits of blockchain technology. If we want better, cheaper, faster and programmable payments, constantly upgradable financial infrastructure will get us there.

The Merge also has important public policy implications that deserve attention, such as how to regulate decentralized organizations that do not have headquarters and/or employees like a traditional corporation.

The Merge could not have come at a more critical time for the blockchain and digital assets industry. The digital asset economy has lost about $2 trillion in value this year, several companies have filed for bankruptcy and a once-popular synthetic derivative that was supposed to have a stable price melted down in dramatic fashion.

All of this is forcing lawmakers in the U.S., not to mention globally, to act with a sense of urgency. On Sept. 16, multiple executive branch agencies in the U.S. released a wave of reports as part of the Biden Administration’s Executive Order on digital assets – most of which highlighted the risks of digital assets, including to the environment.

Congress is actively considering a range of bills that would regulate nearly every aspect of blockchain technology. Executive branch agencies, notably the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are jockeying for oversight of the industry.

And yet, judging by the early reaction from lawmakers, Ethereum’s Merge is going largely unnoticed despite climate change and cybersecurity being global priorities. At a hearing on digital assets two weeks ago that started just hours after Ethereum successfully transitioned to proof-of-stake, members of Congress spent hours grilling SEC Chairman Gary Gensler on, among other topics, climate change and digital assets. The Merge did not come up.

At another hearing on the same day, where members pressed CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam on a range of topics, proof-of-stake was discussed, thanks to some questions from Sens. Corey Booker (D-N.J.) and John Boozman (R-Ariz.), but only briefly.

This is surprising because the energy used by Bitcoin and Ethereum has been a central concern of lawmakers. The House Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing on the topic earlier this year titled, “Cleaning Up Cryptocurrency: The Energy Impacts of Blockchains.” On the same day as the Merge, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen detailing environmental concerns associated with crypto. The letter referenced nine earlier letters she has penned raising concerns about digital assets, but Ethereum’s Merge nor proof-of-stake was not mentioned in any of them – even though Ethereum’s transition has been years in the making.

The White House did tout the benefits of proof-of-stake in its recent report “Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-assets in the United States,” but a few mentions in one report is not enough to make up for the lack of attention from policymakers to Ethereum’s Merge. So I encourage lawmakers to hold a hearing about the benefits of having constantly upgradable financial infrastructure like Ethereum.

Right now, the U.S. government is focusing mostly on regulating through enforcement. But if we are only going after bad actors and bad actions, how much can we learn? Yes, bad actors deserve no home, but real policymaking leads to repeatable processes from which entrepreneurs can innovate, create jobs and support the U.S. economy.

It is notable that the Merge was unprompted by any regulations. But some essential questions deserve attention: What can we learn from the Merge that others can copy? What does it mean to have payment rails that can be upgraded quickly instead of over decades? What does it say about the process of generating good public policy outcomes? Was the negative attention lawmakers gave to the environmental concerns of blockchain technology enough to effect change?

It is unclear. What is clear is that the Merge is a great example of the benefits of blockchain technology. Imagine if the credit bureaus, which have been subject to multiple hacks exposing millions of people’s critical personal information, overnight instituted a change to make their business dramatically more cyber resilient as Ethereum is now because of the Merge? Or if a major credit card network instituted a change to make transactions 99% less energy intensive? Lawmakers would surely cheer them on.

I am sure lawmakers will hail the years-long introduction of FedNow, the government’s proposed real-time payments network. It is expected to be launched next year. While it does nothing to reduce energy consumption, it is expected to lead to the same sort of real-time payments already available over public blockchains like Ethereum.

The scrappy, decentralized developers who coordinated online to make the Merge such a success have pointed a way forward that we need to study. Public blockchains like Ethereum are the payment rails of the future and are nimble enough to change to fit society’s needs. Congress should not just hold hearings when something goes wrong.

As a society, we should learn from our mistakes. But we should learn from our successes, too.",blockchain,yahoo entertainment

The games industry boomed in lockdown and market value will reach $320 billion, and it is only natural that some of this money would flow into blockchain gaming companies. 
This is a post from HackRead.com Read the original post: What is Blockchain G…",https://www.hackread.com/blockchain-gaming-play-to-earn-model/,"With the popularity of cryptocurrency, blockchain gaming has become a new genre of gaming. Blockchain games are decentralized and use cryptocurrency to power their in-game economy. This allows for a more secure and transparent gaming experience.

Although blockchain gaming is still new, its impact on gaming is becoming the next big thing, and not just in terms of financial transactions. The use of blockchain can change the very nature of how games are played.

Here’s a look at how blockchain is being used in gaming, who are the players, and what it could mean for the future of this rapidly growing industry.

Blockchain-based games are already being developed and played. One example is Ethereum-based CryptoKitties, which allows players to breed and trade digital cats. Other games under development include decentralized versions of popular titles like FIFA, Call of Duty, and World of Warcraft.

The games industry boomed in lockdown and market value will reach $320 billion, and it is only natural that some of this money would flow into blockchain gaming companies. For instance, Everyrealm, one of the most active investors in and developers of the metaverse real estate ecosystem, just powered the launch of a new game on Sandbox. They previously raised $60M led by Andreessen.

There are already a number of popular blockchain gaming companies out there, each with its own unique offerings. One such example is Decentral Games which enables users to play games in the Metaverse.

The company follows the “play to earn” model. This model allows players to earn cryptocurrency (ICE Tokens) that can be traded for real-world currency. Decentral Games also completed its ICE merge recently which means ICE token emissions will drop by 55%.

According to the company, the drop is achieved by changing the type of rewards obtained by delegated players who are renting the wearable NFTs required for joining the game. From now on, instead of direct ICE rewards, they will obtain “banked ICE” which can be used to purchase wearables and join its tournaments.

“The existing play-to-earn model is broken. While offering limitless rewards to those that have invested nothing can be incredible for bootstrapping player liquidity, they are unsustainable. We’ve seen this with nearly every major GameFi project that kept this model. We’re taking a different approach. Our focus is on the long term and it centers on enabling our players to own in-game assets through their gameplay while managing the token emissions we create so that the player base can scale without issue. This is what’s going to set us apart over the next 12-18 months.” Matthew Howells-Barby, CMO -Decentral Games

For those unsure of how to get into the Metaverse; joining the Metaverse is easy and only requires a few steps to get started. First, create an account on any of the many participating websites. Once you have an account, you can begin creating your own 3D avatar.

After you have created your avatar, you can start exploring the Metaverse. There are many different ways to explore the Metaverse, including visiting virtual worlds, chatting with other users, and of course, participating in online games.

Not only is this a great way for gamers to make some extra cash, but it also helps to support the development of new and innovative games. Blockchain gaming is still in its early stages, but it has already shown great potential for changing the way we think about video game monetization.",blockchain,hackread

Astar Network , a smart contracts platform for multichain, today announces its partnership with the legendary artist Yoshitaka Amano to create and release an exclusive NFT collection on the Astar blockchain. This is the first time Mr. Amano’s fantasy worlds and characters will come to life on a blockchain, where his art can interact with the projects and communities of Astar.

Yoshitaka Amano is a renowned Japanese artist responsible for iconic artwork including Speedracer, Sandman: The Dream Hunters cover art, and, most notably, Final Fantasy. A pioneer in creating impossible worlds that pull from his interests in Western culture, Yoshitaka’s unique style of Japanese art is admired across the globe.

“Without a doubt, Yoshitaka Amano is a legendary artist in the 21st century. I am very honored to be able to work with him and host his first NFT on Astar Network,” said Sota Watanabe, founder and CEO of Astar Network.

This also marks the beginning of Astar Network’s partnership with Twin Planet to help fine arts professionals mint their digital assets on a trusted and secure network to bring their art to the public. Twin Planet is the talent management firm that represents Yoshitaka Amano and other popular artists.

“For people to see and appreciate my work is a bonus. It makes me want to draw even more. That was already the case when I was a child, and it hasn’t changed ever since,” said Yoshitaka Amano.

Astar Network will manage Yoshitaka Amano’s Candy Girl artwork, a sensational collection that features 108 angels. The art is young and glamorous, yet sophisticated and appealing to media applications – already inspiring clothing design at “Tokyo Girls Collection 2017” and high fashion at the Mitsukoshi Ginza’s “Discover Tokyo” event. Astar will build a Web3 entertainment site for the Candy Girl collection to take root in its ecosystem and branch to new galleries, entertainment, or design. Thus, NFT ownership of fine art will have a direct connection to real-world value through the partnership. Candy Girl will lead the way for Japanese content creators to own their art, music, and stories, but engage with a global audience and business.

Mr. Amano’s powerful art has led him to collaborate with over 20 authors, successfully creating illustrated books that have sold millions of copies. Now, the collaboration with both Mr. Amano and Twin Planet establishes Astar Network as the blockchain of choice for professional artists to create, auction, and exhibit their valuable artwork.

Creating this limited edition NFT collection on Astar is not only important to Japan, but also to Astar’s vision to bring the East to the West, fine art to blockchain technology, and introduce international leaders to the Web3 world.

Sabharwal’s deep understanding of global finance, along with his background working with some of the world’s largest public and private sector organizations, including the IMF, First Data / Western Union, GE Capital and others, makes him a valuable addition to an already stellar team that is both diverse in geography and in thought.

“We’re excited to welcome Sunil to our Board that includes some of today’s most influential business leaders and blue-flame thinkers in the Blockchain & Tokenization space globally,” said Tal Elyashiv, co-founder & managing partner of SPiCE VC. “Sunil’s unique background in working with large financial and regulatory organizations positions him well on our board as we continue to pioneer VC investing in a new digital economy.”

Sabharwal is president of Payments International, and was most recently Chairman of Earthport plc., a listed company on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market until its sale to Visa Inc., after years of running a successful investment firm and fulfilling substantial roles on some of Europe’s largest corporate boards. Sabharwal also served as the Board member to the IMF. He was nominated by President Obama as Alternate Executive Director and was confirmed by the United States Senate under the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in February 2016 for a period of two years. During his tenure, Sabharwal was the sole US Board member to the IMF, and upon completion received US Treasury’s Distinguished Service Award from Secretary Mnuchin.

Going beyond the world of finance and tech, Sabharwal has been involved with numerous sports & Olympic-related entities, including the IOC’s Sustainability & Legacy Commission, the International Fair Play Committee, as well as the US and International fencing federations and World Athletics, the global governing body for the sport of track & field.

“I am honored to join SPiCE’s team and work with Tal and the entire SPiCE board and support their strategic mission and vision for growth. It’s also a real pleasure to ‘re-unite’ with Rene Eichenberger, whom I have known for 20+ years going back to my GE days,” said Sunil Sabharwal, president of Payments International and now a SPiCE VC Board of Directors advisor. “I plan to work hand-in-hand with the blockchain & tokenization pioneers at SPiCE VC to not only expedite diversified access into the digital ecosystem globally, but to also help others use that access for the betterment of our local and global communities.”

SPiCE VC is officially welcoming Sunil Sabharwal as a strategic advisor just weeks after the firm announced a second investor payout - surpassing 80% Distribution to Paid-In Capital (DPI) for its investors in just a just a four-year period. Earlier this year, the VC firm closed its first and notably successful fund, SPiCE I, and introduced SPiCE II, a new fund offering investors exposure to the unprecedented growth opportunities within the expanding digital economy. SPiCE II’s focus is identifying innovative companies that stand to benefit the most from the mass proliferation of Blockchain technologies across many industries. A tokenized version of SPiCE II is expected to launch in a few months.

The partnership will provide applications being built on Polygon with access to identity and compliance solutions, and will deliver on Quadrata’s roadmap to support multiple blockchains.

There is a growing need in the blockchain space for decentralized apps (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to incorporate solutions that provide a layer of identity and compliance. Identity-verifying infrastructure allows dApps to easily confirm they are reaching real customers and complying with regulatory requirements. It also can help expand DeFi use cases and create better products because developers will have access to information about wallet accounts.

“Offering our passport technology to one of the largest public blockchains, after Ethereum, is a natural step for Quadrata. This partnership is helping us to reach new applications being built on Polygon that need access to identity and compliance natively on-chain,” said Fabrice Cheng, CEO, CTO and co-founder of Quadrata. “We’ve always believed that identity technology should not be tied to a single chain and that identity verification is without borders.”

“We’ve seen growing interest from applications who rely on identity and compliance and are excited to deploy Quadrata’s technology on our platform,” said Hamzah Khan, Head of DeFi and Labs at Polygon. “The passport identity network is a key infrastructure that is needed and will enable dApps on Polygon to innovate and broaden their product offerings.”

Quadrata is interested in partnering with any applications that are building on Polygon and looking for compliance-aware solutions. In the future, Quadrata also has plans to deploy their identity and compliance technology on all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains. To learn more please visit Quadrata.com.

About Quadrata:

Quadrata is a web3 company bringing the identity and compliance layer to decentralized applications on existing public blockchains such as Ethereum. Quadrata’s privacy preserving and sybil-resistant technology allows smart contract applications native on-chain access to information such as DID, KYC/AML risk scores and country, as well as credit reputation and accredited investors status in the future. Quadrata spun out from Spring Labs with a continued commitment to developing and promoting blockchain-based technologies.

The futures were trading lower Thursday, after the market finally posted an across-the-board winning day in which all the major indexes closed decidedly higher. The venerable S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials both ended a six-day losing streak. One big reason for the risk-on rally was interest rates plunging as buyers swooped into the Treasury complex in a big way. In addition, some feel that the Bank of England’s intervention into the bond market (it is buying its own government debt) may spark a similar change in Federal Reserve policy. Most across Wall Street feel that is extremely doubtful, given the fact that the Fed is in quantitative tightening mode and allowing $95 billion per month to run off its massive balance sheet.

The aforementioned massive drop in Treasury debt yields featured both the five-year and 10-year securities yields falling by a stunning 29 and 26 basis points, respectively. The 10-year, which had briefly breached the 4% level earlier this week, closed at 3.71%. Despite the drop, the inversion with the two-year note remained in place, as the short-term debt closed at 4.10%, a stunning 21-basis-point decline.

Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude both closed much higher Wednesday on concerns over Hurricane Ida, which slammed into the Florida coast as a massive category 4 storm. The hurricane, combined with the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reporting a modest oil inventory draw from the week ending September 23, helped to spur the big rise in the benchmarks. In addition, gasoline stocks, according to the EIA, fell by 2.4 million barrels in the reporting period, with production averaging 9.6 million barrels daily.

Natural gas also closed higher, after a big midday reversal, while both gold and Bitcoin had a solid session on Wednesday, each trading up close to 3%. Bitcoin and other cryptos got a boost on the Bank of England intervention.

Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock. Consensus analyst target data is from Refinitiv.

These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Thursday, September 29, 2022.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL): Rosenblatt upgraded the technology leader to Buy from Neutral and lifted its $160 price target to $189. BofA Securities lowered its Buy rating to Neutral and cut the target price to $160 from $185. The consensus target is $183.06. The stock closed trading on Wednesday at $149.84.

Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB): When Baird upgraded the shares to Outperform from Neutral, it boosted its $224 target price to $340. Mizuho raised its Neutral rating to Buy and raised its target to $270 from $207. The BMO Capital Markets upgraded to Outperform from Market Perform included a price objective hike to $360 from $217. The consensus target is $234.14 for now. The stock ended Wednesday at $276.61, up a stunning 40% on the day after positive clinical data on the firm’s Alzheimer drug.

In a press release Wednesday, the state’s department of justice said the agency had issued a cease-and-desist order to 23 entities, including wallets, accounts and individuals.

The announcement is part of a wider Delaware DOJ initiative to halt “pig butchering” crypto scams.

The agency urged investors to tread cautiously in online conversations about cryptocurrency transactions.

Crypto romance scams have been around for several years. They involve bad actors conversing with strangers online and instructing them to invest in crypto before siphoning off their funds. “Pig butchering” scams operate along similar principles with scammers convincing consumers to invest small amounts in crypto over time before siphoning these assets – fattening the pig before butchering it.

According to blockchain investigation agency Cipherblade, “billions” of dollars were stolen in these kinds of scams in 2021.

“Today’s order takes a first step toward protecting Delaware investors from the pig butchering scam by freezing funds at risk from further transfer by the wrongdoers,” Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said in the press release.",blockchain,yahoo entertainment

Company to Pivot into Automotive and Energy Sectors

SANTA MONICA, CA, Sept. 29, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wanderport Corporation (OTC: WDRP), a holding company formerly specializing in blockchain, digital asset and metaverse, is pleased to provide a business update including the cancellation of common shares and pivot into the automotive and energy sectors.

Share Cancellation

As part of management’s commitment to strengthen its position for growth, the Company had reached an agreement to secure and cancel an additional 10M shares of its Common stock, bringing the total shares to be cancelled to 30M. This is in addition to over 54M shares cancelled in 2021.

Management is open to further negotiation for share cancellation if necessary to support its future expansion efforts.

Automotive Sector

The Company has taken initial steps to enter the automotive sector. Its goal is to be an active participant in the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) space via manufacturing and distribution of components as well as EV related services. The Company plans to accomplish this endeavor through partnerships and creating an equity portfolio of established companies that are currently serving this industry.

Energy Sector

Wanderport is formulating plans to enter the green energy sector. Its main focus will be in the areas of clean renewable energy as well as products to serve the EV market such as charging equipment or stations.

There has been a strong global push for electric vehicles and clean energy. Recent development in the United States includes a new $5 billion infrastructure bill that will allow every state in the US, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to have access to federal funds for charging infrastructure projects.

The Company plans to participate in this sector with related products and services for the residential and commercial usage.

Manufacturing

Due to economic and geopolitical factors, there has been a sizable amount of corporations establishing manufacturing capability in Vietnam. This presents huge growth opportunities for the manufacturing sector and supply chain there. Aside from exporting, many of the products manufactured in Vietnam can also be sold to the fast growing local consumer base.

Story continues

The Company plans to capitalize on this growth trend through mergers and acquisitions, particularly as they are related to electric vehicles and consumer goods.

Divestiture

The Company has been gradually divesting its current businesses to focus on the new direction. The health coffee line will be discontinued once inventory has been depleted. All blockchain related assets have been assigned to UA Multimedia, Inc. The Company will continue to collaborate with UA on future technical projects.

Mergers and Acquisitions

Management believes that a sound path to growth is via accretive mergers and acquisitions. For the near-term, the Company plans to leverage its publicly traded status to build an equity portfolio of companies serving the automotive, energy and manufacturing sectors.

Uplisting

Management has set a goal to uplist to a fully reporting company as soon as practicable. This will enable Wanderport to access larger investors or institutions which the Company needs in order to support its long-term growth plans.

The Company will proceed to return its status to current with OTC Markets. There was no material change in its operations, share and debt issuance since the last filing.

“Wanderport is firmly committed to creating shareholder values,” commented Miki Takeuchi, CEO. “After seeing the growth opportunities in our current busines model diminished, we pivoted to the areas of automotive, energy and manufacturing which we believe have strong growth potential for the foreseeable future. We have made a few initial steps into these new ventures and plan to provide additional details soon.”

About Wanderport Corporation
