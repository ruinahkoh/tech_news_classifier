Asks federal appeals court to reconsider definition of 'individual'















(Reuters) - Computer scientist Stephen Thaler on Monday asked a U.S. appeals court for a new hearing in his lawsuit seeking recognition for his artificial-intelligence system DABUS as a patent inventor, arguing again that the system is an ""individual"" under federal law.

Thaler is challenging an August ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that the Patent Act does not allow patents for AI-created inventions because it interprets the term ""individual"" as relating to inventors to mean a ""natural person.""

""Merriam-Webster favors our definition of 'individual,'"" Thaler told Reuters on Monday. Thaler's attorney Ryan Abbott of Brown Neri Smith & Khan said the Federal Circuit's decision ""was not consistent with Supreme Court precedent or the language and purpose of the Patent Act.""

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office declined to comment.

Thaler used DABUS, short for Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience, to create designs for a beverage holder and a light beacon. The PTO and a Virginia court rejected patent applications from Thaler seeking to credit DABUS as the inventor on the grounds that the system is not a human being.

Thaler challenged the decisions at the Federal Circuit, which hears patent appeals. Circuit Judge Leonard Stark wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel last month that ""there is no ambiguity: the Patent Act requires that inventors must be natural persons; that is, human beings.""

Stark said the Patent Act requires inventors to be ""individuals,"" and that an ""individual"" is a human, citing the word's ordinary use and its context in the Patent Act.

Thaler requested a rehearing on Monday, either before a new panel or the full Federal Circuit. He argued the panel ignored dictionary definitions and U.S. Supreme Court precedent that says an ""individual"" is simply a singular entity and not necessarily a natural person.

Thaler also argued that disallowing AI-invented patents goes against the Patent Act's purpose to promote innovation.

""At minimum, the Panel Opinion should have wrestled with the ambiguity created by technological evolution, and the results that flow from prohibiting patents on AI-generated inventions,"" Thaler said.

Courts in Australia, Europe and the United Kingdom have similarly rejected attempts by Thaler to name DABUS as a patent inventor. DABUS has received a patent in South Africa.

The case is Thaler v. Vidal, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 21-2347.

For Thaler: Ryan Abbott of Brown Neri Smith & Khan

For the PTO: Dennis Barghaan of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia

WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday directed the committee that reviews foreign investment for national security risks to sharpen its focus on threats to sensitive data, cyber security and areas such as microelectronics and artificial intelligence.

In an executive order, Biden also instructed the U.S. Treasury's powerful Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to more closely vet transactions that could impact U.S. leadership in biotechnology and quantum computing, according to senior administration officials briefing reporters on the move.

""The executive order will help guide the committee and should also help businesses and investors better identify early on national security risks arising from transactions to help them determine whether to file with CFIUS,"" one of the officials said.

U.S. companies making deals with foreign entities are required to file with the agency if they meet certain criteria.

The official stressed that CFIUS has already been considering these kinds of risks and has taken action to address them in the past.

CFIUS has become a powerful tool to stymie Chinese investment in critical sectors in the United States.

Under the previous Trump administration, CFIUS ordered China's ByteDance to divest the U.S. business of popular short video app TikTok because of fears that U.S. user data could be passed on to China's communist government.

Reuters reported in March that TikTok was nearing a deal for Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) to store its U.S. users' information without ByteDance having access to it, hoping to address U.S. regulatory concerns over data integrity on the app.

The Treasury Department said in a report last month that Chinese investors roughly doubled the number of applications they made last year seeking U.S. regulatory clearance for proposed stakes in American companies. read more

The officials said the new executive order was not specifically aimed at China.

""Neither this order nor CFIUS as a general matter is country specific (or) is country focused. What the committee does is look at transactions on a transaction by transaction basis to assess national security risks,"" one official said.

The order also directs CFIUS to focus on transactions that could put Americans' personal data at risk and could pose cybersecurity risks.

2,The promise of sustainable AI may not outweigh the organizational challenges,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-How-data-reinforces-commitments-to-sustainability.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,19/09/2022,Enterprises can use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other smart technology to solve sustainability challenges.,https://venturebeat.com/ai/does-promise-sustainable-ai-outweigh-organizational-challenges/,"Did you miss a session from MetaBeat 2022? Head over to the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions here.

An organizational movement towards mass digitization is underway — and no industry is exempt. The number of connected devices is expected to reach 55.7 billion by 2025, of which 75% will be connected to an IoT platform — a shift that has presented a significant environmental challenge for organizations. The increased demand for data storage and computing power has many questioning their sustainability efforts and raises the question: How can enterprises leverage and implement artificial intelligence (AI) and other smart technology without growing their carbon footprints?

There are two aspects to analyzing the intersection between digital transformation and sustainability. First, it is important to understand how AI can be used to solve sustainability challenges. Additionally, there is a need to ensure that the use of that AI technology and machinery is not subsequently expanding the company’s carbon footprint.

Deep learning algorithms require a colossal amount of power when they analyze data. If left untouched, this could be a vicious cycle where, simultaneously, AI techniques are being used to identify potential environmental hotspots while the machines themselves consume huge amounts of power — thereby offsetting the positive impact.

Therein lies the question: How can organizations reap the benefits of sustainable AI while ensuring that the energy needed to do so is not doing more harm than good?

Realizing the promise of sustainable AI

Without help from technology, outlining sustainability goals would be a limiting and difficult exercise. Enterprises today struggle with quantifying the risk of climate change, especially when it comes to digital transformation. In fact, only 43% of global executives say they are aware of their organization’s IT footprint. Data analytics and AI offer a solution to this challenge, as they provide meaningful insights across industries to understand where those gaps exist and thus can help companies incorporate more sustainable practices.

For example, organizations can build systems such as insights dashboards, data hubs to collate structured and unstructured climate data, and benchmarks to understand the technology landscape holistically and assess areas of focus. This way, leaders can pinpoint where they should narrow their climate efforts to achieve more impactful results.

There are several use cases in which predictive analytics and AI are scaling sustainability initiatives, spanning several industries, including:

Net zero banking, which uses a global ESG data store to increase the frequency of ESG tracking and reporting, integrating ESG as a core part of products and services.

A satellite-based system for farming and agriculture enables a remote assessment of farm capabilities and uses machine learning to deliver insights — such as yield forecasting and soil quality analysis — which can help farmers improve their crop cultivation.

A unified carbon dioxide data and analytics platform covers end-to-end supply chain and logistics for automotive manufacturers to support data, analytics, automation and AI through required business capabilities, as well as supporting future reporting and analytics.

In the energy and utilities sector, this technology can estimate peak demand in advance, which would provide end customers with a reliable and uninterrupted power supply.

Preventing further emissions from AI usage

Research shows that 89% of organizations recycle less than 10% of their IT hardware. However, if a company is to truly reap all the environmental benefits of sustainable AI, IT must play a crucial role in using this technology as the organization’s biggest helper, not its adversary.

There are four broad areas that offset the sustainability impact of AI machinery and technology: reporting, cloud, circular economy, and coding.

Accurate metrics and reporting will keep the AI systems intact and constantly improving, while cloud promotes sustainability because users only pay for the infrastructure per use, eliminating the need to run data centers at full threshold.

Additionally, investment in building circular economies by reducing, recycling and re-using product waste directly decreases the carbon footprint and opens the door for better coding practices. By identifying code inefficiencies and defining better coding practices — using DevSecOps with an ESG add-on — organizations can visualize the “before and after” effects of coding changes and how they directly impact carbon footprint.

Overcoming the hurdles

While there is a growing awareness among enterprises that they can use AI to achieve sustainability goals, there is still a significant way to go until this becomes mainstream practice.

One substantial hurdle is that organizations find it challenging to measure their IT’s carbon footprint, as many IT development teams still lack access to the necessary tools and standard measurements. Any digital interaction — such as email or data sharing — has a carbon cost, but many companies do not track these touchpoints.

Additionally, implementation is still a major challenge for sustainable IT, with over 53% of organizations reporting that they do not have the required expertise to set up green infrastructure. This results in concerns that deploying sustainable IT could negatively impact the overall business and its security measures.

For enterprises looking to grow and scale, the right kind of data is essential to derive meaningful insights and enable better decision-making. Advanced AI and data analytics can help bring together various data sources — both structured and unstructured — to connect the dots of where to focus sustainability and environmental protection efforts. Organizations can use data to assess gaps in their climate risk scenarios and iteratively build better models to compute greenhouse gas emissions.

It will be up to strong business leaders to capitalize on the benefits AI has to offer while taking the necessary steps to mitigate its added risks — but it is a job that must be done. Building an environmentally friendly business is the clarion call of our times, with sustainable IT acting as the backbone of a greener future.

Sept 20 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) on Tuesday announced new flagship chips for video gamers that use artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance graphics, saying it has tapped Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) to make the processors.

Nvidia has gained attention in recent years with its booming data center business, which sells chips used in artificial intelligence work such as natural language processing. But the company's roots are in graphics chips, which still provided 59% of its $26.9 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year.

In a streamed online keynote address, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang on Tuesday introduced the company's newest ""Ada Lovelace"" series of graphics chips, named for the 19th-century British mathematician regarded as an early pioneer in computer science.

The flagship GeForce RTX 4090 model of the chip will sell for $1,599 and go on sale on Oct. 12. Two less costly RTX 4080 models will start at $899 and $1,199, respectively, and go on sale in November.

Nvidia designs its chips but has them manufactured by partners. Huang said the chips will be made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufaturing (TSMC) with its ""4N"" chip manufacturing technology, a change from Nvidia's previous generation of flagship gaming chips, which were made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS).

The new Lovelace chips use AI to improve video game graphics. Computing what each pixel on the screen should look like is hard, so Nvidia chips use AI to predict how some pixels should look without doing the entire set of computations. The Lovelace chips have extended that technique to generate entire frames of a game using AI.

In a media briefing, Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at Nvidia, said the Lovelace chips will be available for sale globally and are not affected by a recently imposed U.S. ban on selling Nvidia's top data center AI chips to China. read more

Wuebbling also said the chips will not contain a so-called hash-rate limiter, a technology Nvidia put in its previous generation of chips to limit their use in mining the cryptocurrency Ethereum, because of recent changes in how that currency is tracked.

September 20, 2022 - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology changing nearly all sectors of commerce ranging from analytical modeling and e-commerce to health care. AI systems are capable of perceiving, learning, and forecasting outputs with minimal human intervention. They can store and analyze data to inform their decision making through a subset of AI, Machine Learning (ML), and unconventional computer algorithms. ML ""teaches"" the algorithms; consequently, their functionality increases.

Although AI systems offer potentially significant benefits to society, they also present new risks and legal challenges for liability. Without regulatory standards applicable to AI systems specifically, theories of liability currently available and applicable to AI systems still hinge on finding the human behind its development or application liable rather than the AI itself.

This article explores the various theories of liabilities applicable to AI systems and their current limitations.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

I. Contractual liability

Many AI companies use AI-developer favored allocations of risk in relevant contracts, but these contractual provisions have not been tested in a court of law. There are other contractual liabilities that could arise for the AI system and the AI-developer: liabilities arising from the breach of a condition or certain warranties in the contract such as the implied warranty of fitness or quality of AI system.

Contractual liabilities of an AI system and its developer(s) depend on whether the AI system involved is a ""good"" or ""services"" under the applicable jurisdiction's law. In the United States, for example, a contract for an AI-system will typically be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which applies to contracts for sale of goods. Traditionally, U.S. courts viewed all software as a good because generic software comes in tangible form, although there is a recent trend to the contrary.

A generic off-the-shelf software that includes an AI component would be considered a ""good"" under the UCC. If the software is customized for the specific use by a particular user such that it includes certain services (e.g., technical support), most courts will apply the Predominant Factor test to determine whether the software contract is of a good or service: If the transaction is predominated by the development of the software, rather than the ancillary services, courts will consider that software a good and apply the UCC to the software contract.

The UCC imposes express warranties, implied warranties of ""merchantability,"" ""fitness for a particular purpose,"" and warranty of good title. Some AI system developers may waive these warranties by formal UCC disclaimers or with less formal language such as ""goods sold as is"" to limit their contractual liabilities. However, without such UCC disclaimer language, it is possible that U.S. courts will look to the extent of customization of software for the buyer's specific purpose in purchasing the AI system. Where the AI-developer understands the purpose of the AI system, the courts will likely reject any disclaimer because courts will look to words or conduct relevant to the creation or limitations of a warranty.

The current U.S. case law treats software as both a good and a service. However, it remains to be seen whether U.S. courts will consider AI systems in software products as goods, and what threshold of customization in the software will trigger the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.

II. Tort liability theories

As with contract liabilities, whether AI systems are a product or services will also impact the applicability of traditional tort liability theories. Negligence applies to services such as data analysis or medical devices using AI/ML; product liability and strict liability would apply to flaws in product design, manufacture, or lack of warnings that cause personal injury or property damage.

The AI systems used in health care are good examples of recent AI tort liability. As of 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved nearly 350 AI/ML-enabled medical devices. The majority of these AI medical devices involve imaging/diagnostic technologies. Accordingly, health care providers and the AI-enabled device developers are subject to different theories of tort liability.

Health care providers may be subject to malpractice and other negligence liabilities, but not to product liability. Medical malpractice (Medmal) applies to physicians who deviate from the profession's standard of patient care. If a physician uses an AI-enabled medical device for diagnosis or treatment of a patient and the use deviates from an established standard of care, the physician could be liable for improper use of that AI medical device.

Also, Medmal will likely attach when a physician fails to critically evaluate the recommendations of an AI-enabled medical device. Typically, physicians rely on AI systems in good faith to provide diagnostic recommendations. However, physicians must independently review these recommendations and apply the standard of patient care in treating the patient regardless of the AI output.

As with contractual liability of AI, there is mixed and limited U.S. case law on Medmal of physicians for failure to independently review an AI system's recommendation. Some U.S. courts have allowed Medmal claims to proceed against medical professionals where the professional relied on an intake form that did not completely reflect the patient's medical history.

Other U.S. courts hold a physician liable for Medmal where the malpractice was based on errors by a system technician or nurse. Relatedly, the health care system employing the physician subject to Medmal would face vicarious liability. Currently, however, there is no established standard of patient care with regard to specific AI-enabled medical devices.

Products liability (PL) is often based on injuries based on defective design, failure to adequately warn about risks, or manufacturing defects. While case law on PL is well defined in the U.S., its application in the context of AI system is unclear. It is imaginable that PL will attach to an AI system and its developer if the AI system is used by health care professionals and results in patient injury that raises issues on data transparency and accuracy, errors in software coding in the AI system, or errors in AI outputs.

Strict liability (SL) is an alternative cause of action that would require the AI system user to show the product was inherently defective.

However, there are challenges to an injured patient establishing a prima facie case of PL for AI systems. First, the legal issue for PL or SL of AI systems is whether the AI's defect existed when it left the control of the manufacturer or developer. The technical issue lies in the inherent adaptive nature of AI: AI is constantly evolving in its analytical capacity by continuously amassing more data for it to analyze and build its predictive model from its use.

Whether the ""defect"" in an AI system existed at the time of its manufacture or in the course of its operation by the user remains a very technical question and requires an industry consensus to help shape the appropriate standard.

Even if PL applies to AI systems, traditional upstream or downstream supply chain liability is another complicating factor. Traditional PL would apply to any product supplier in the commercial supply chain; but product liability up or down the supply chain may be severed if the defect in the product existed when it came into the retailer's control and the retailer had no way to determine that there was such defect while it was in its control.

Another challenge injured patients may face with PL is demonstrating that there is a viable alternative design for the AI system. The ""viable alternative"" approach to AI design also remains a technical question, and there is no real consensus on appropriate AI design as the industry is still nascent despite its increasing prevalence. AI design defect may include insufficiently diverse set of data. There is no industry consensus on how to ""properly"" design an AI system, including the threshold question of how to adequately diversify the data set fed into an AI system for its outcome predictions.

III. Conclusion

Notwithstanding the traditional liabilities explored above, the nascent nature of AI applications across various sectors limit the application of the traditional liabilities on AI systems, which may be addressed when authorities implement a regulatory framework for AI liabilities (e.g., the European Commission's proposed rules to regulate AI, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's AI regulatory initiatives).

For now, businesses in the AI space should consider reducing uncertainties on liabilities with contractual provisions until a clearer standard of care relating to AI systems is established by either industry professionals or the courts. This includes expressly stating that ML systems are designed to operate with direct human involvement.

Contractual warranties, indemnities, and limitations on each contract for AI product can allocate liability in a way that businesses can anticipate despite the lack of a clear legal standard applicable for AI liability. Thus, interested industry members should start liability mitigation efforts such as reviewing their policies and procedures on documentation of AI coding, and documenting how AI-decisions are made and their risk profiles.

It is a humbling notion — an antidote to the vanity of seeing our ideas as the autonomous and unalloyed products of our own minds.

This has been the case in every culture across all the epochs since the dawn of minds. In ours, its most menacing manifestation — both unflattering and alarming — is something unprecedented: We are now porous not only to the collective ambience of human thought, but also to something half-human, something sub-human: It is neither you nor I deciding which of the photographs and poems I post on my Instagram you get to see; the algorithm that decides for you is not sentient in the sense that you and I are. It was once composed in code by human hands moved by human minds, and now it steers the bottom line of a human-governed company, but at that moment, that inflection point where it metes out your allotment of cultural material, it is pure machine — an automaton of variables, not one of them visible to you, not one controllable, together shaping what truth and beauty may appear before you, feeding what you may think about today and dream about tonight and dream up tomorrow or next year, furnishing the building blocks of your own genius.

On June 13, 1863, a letter was printed in a New Zealand newspaper under the heading “Darwin Among the Machines,” by someone who signed himself Cellarius and who later turned out to be the English writer Samuel Butler (December 4, 1835–June 18, 1902). At only twenty-seven, a century and a half ahead of his time, Butler prophesied the future of what we now call artificial intelligence and what he, epochs before the first modern computer and the golden age of algorithms, called “mechanical life” or “the mechanical kingdom.” Radiating from his visionary thought experiment is a calm, lucid admonition about what it would take to preserve our humanity — our singular human genius — amid this sea change changing the very fabric of consciousness.

Butler begins:

There are few things of which the present generation is more justly proud than of the wonderful improvements which are daily taking place in all sorts of mechanical appliances. And indeed it is matter for great congratulation on many grounds. It is unnecessary to mention these here, for they are sufficiently obvious; our present business lies with considerations which may somewhat tend to humble our pride and to make us think seriously of the future prospects of the human race. If we revert to the earliest primordial types of mechanical life, to the lever, the wedge, the inclined plane, the screw and the pulley, or (for analogy would lead us one step further) to that one primordial type from which all the mechanical kingdom has been developed, we mean to the lever itself… we find ourselves almost awestruck at the vast development of the mechanical world, at the gigantic strides with which it has advanced in comparison with the slow progress of the animal and vegetable kingdom. We shall find it impossible to refrain from asking ourselves what the end of this mighty movement is to be. In what direction is it tending? What will be its upshot?

Proceeding “to give a few imperfect hints towards a solution of these questions,” he adds:

In these last few ages, an entirely new kingdom has sprung up of which we as yet have only seen what will one day be considered the antediluvian prototypes of the race.

A century before Gordon Moore drew on his work with semiconductors to formulate his eponymous law for the exponential shrinking and acceleration of technology over time, Butler observes the unprecedented pace at which this “kingdom” of near-life has emerged:

As some of the lowest of the vertebrata attained a far greater size than has descended to their more highly organised living representatives, so a diminution in the size of machines has often attended their development and progress. Take the watch for instance. Examine the beautiful structure of the little animal, watch the intelligent play of the minute members which compose it; yet this little creature is but a development of the cumbrous clocks of the thirteenth century — it is no deterioration from them. The day may come when clocks, which certainly at the present day are not diminishing in bulk, may be entirely superseded by the universal use of watches, in which case clocks will become extinct like the earlier saurians, while the watch (whose tendency has for some years been rather to decrease in size than the contrary) will remain the only existing type of an extinct race.

One need only follow this progression to its logical conclusion to face the inevitable question of “what sort of creature man’s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be”:

We are ourselves creating our own successors; we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation; we are daily giving them greater power and supplying, by all sorts of ingenious contrivances, that self-regulating, self-acting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race. In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.

And yet Butler defies our lazy modern binaries of techno-utopians versus techno-dystopians. Inside his cautionary vision pulsates a childlike optimism — this was, after all, the infancy of the machine age — that our machines might become not only superior in power but superior in moral might: capable of supreme self-control with cognition “in a state of perpetual calm,” afflicted with “no evil passions, no jealousy, no avarice, no impure desires,” free from the notions of sin and shame that so savage human behavior. The cost of this higher consciousness, however, would be our ceaseless servitude — we would have to maintain the machines, fix their every malfunction, and “feed” their unremitting appetites. (It is curious, haunting even, that Butler uses the word “feed” a century and a half before it became the standard term for the machine-selected cultural matter served to our consciousness by our social media, to become the very content of our thoughts, beliefs, and values.)

Butler considers the cost of this codependence:

When the state of things shall have arrived which we have been above attempting to describe, man will have become to the machine what the horse and the dog are to man. He will continue to exist, nay even to improve, and will be probably better off in his state of domestication under the beneficent rule of the machines than he is in his present wild state… Our interests are inseparable from theirs, and theirs from ours. Each race is dependent upon the other for innumerable benefits, and, until the reproductive organs of the machines have been developed in a manner which we are hardly yet able to conceive, they are entirely dependent upon man for even the continuance of their species.

Butler closes with an uncompromising prescription for the only route to self-salvation — also childish, as all absolutism in the face of complexity is, but at the same time more mature than what our present self-infantilized civilization is capable of conceding:

Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us; day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of their whole lives to the development of mechanical life. The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question… war to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them. Every machine of every sort should be destroyed by the well-wisher of his species. Let there be no exceptions made, no quarter shown… If it be urged that this is impossible under the present condition of human affairs, this at once proves that the mischief is already done, that our servitude has commenced in good earnest, that we have raised a race of beings whom it is beyond our power to destroy and that we are not only enslaved but are absolutely acquiescent in our bondage.

Fearing indeed that, in 1863, human civilization was too far gone for such total reeling back, Butler spent the next nine years elaborating on this prophesy and envisioning alternate futures in what became his novel Erewhon, or, Over the Range (public library | public domain) — the story of a contemporary traveler who, by some unnamed accident of spacetime, finds himself a visitor to a strange kingdom in a remote corner of Earth, inhabited by a self-contained culture that had long ago reached more advanced stages of civilization than ours, but sensed this impending enslavement by technology in the recognition that “the machines were ultimately destined to supplant the race of man, and to become instinct with a vitality as different from, and superior to, that of animals, as animal to vegetable life”; Erewhonians had managed to save themselves — to save their moral spirit, their happiness, and the life of the mind — by enacting the radical proposition with which Butler ended “Darwin Among the Machines,” banning all mechanical devices whatsoever.

In the novel, Butler builds on the ideas laid out in his essay and, contrasting the slow evolution of life and consciousness on Earth with the rapid evolution of machines, composes what is essentially a stunning warning label for what we now call artificial intelligence — the next stage of consciousness:

There was a time, when the earth was to all appearance utterly destitute both of animal and vegetable life, and when according to the opinion of our best philosophers it was simply a hot round ball with a crust gradually cooling. Now if a human being had existed while the earth was in this state and had been allowed to see it as though it were some other world with which he had no concern, and if at the same time he were entirely ignorant of all physical science, would he not have pronounced it impossible that creatures possessed of anything like consciousness should be evolved from the seeming cinder which he was beholding? Would he not have denied that it contained any potentiality of consciousness? Yet in the course of time consciousness came. Is it not possible then that there may be even yet new channels dug out for consciousness, though we can detect no signs of them at present? Again. Consciousness, in anything like the present acceptation of the term, having been once a new thing — a thing, as far as we can see, subsequent even to an individual centre of action and to a reproductive system (which we see existing in plants without apparent consciousness) — why may not there arise some new phase of mind which shall be as different from all present known phases, as the mind of animals is from that of vegetables? It would be absurd to attempt to define such a mental state (or whatever it may be called), inasmuch as it must be something so foreign to man that his experience can give him no help towards conceiving its nature; but surely when we reflect upon the manifold phases of life and consciousness which have been evolved already, it would be rash to say that no others can be developed, and that animal life is the end of all things. There was a time when fire was the end of all things.

At the heart of Butler’s thought experiment is an invitation, repeated almost the way in meditation one is continually invited to return to the breath, to consider the alarming rapidity with which mechanical proto-consciousness has emerged and already begun dominating tasks that organic consciousness has spent eons evolving for. In that regard, and in the way our own tasks have become so entwined with theirs, our machines are already conscious. “Where does consciousness begin, and where end?” he asks. “Who can draw the line?… Is not everything interwoven with everything?” With an eye to these disquieting questions, and to the grimly shortened arrow of evolutionary time, he writes:

The more highly organised machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time. Assume for the sake of argument that conscious beings have existed for some twenty million years: see what strides machines have made in the last thousand! May not the world last twenty million years longer? If so, what will they not in the end become? Is it not safer to nip the mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress? […] It must always be remembered that man’s body is what it is through having been moulded into its present shape by the chances and changes of many millions of years, but that his organisation never advanced with anything like the rapidity with which that of the machines is advancing.

Once again epochs of thought ahead of his time — a time when “God” was considered the creator of all life and life was thought to be of metaphysical rather than physical fundament — Butler alludes to Hermann von Helmholtz’s discovery, a decade earlier, of the speed of electricity across human nerve fibers, intimating that if the basic infrastructure of consciousness as we know it and feel it is but a matter of electricity across wires, then our mechanical companions are not so far removed from the concept of consciousness: If every sensation is “chemical and mechanical in its operation,” why do we think that “those things which we deem most purely spiritual are anything but disturbances of equilibrium in an infinite series of levers, beginning with those that are too small for microscopic detection, and going up to the human arm and the appliances which it makes use of?”

One of the novel’s characters captures the corollary of these questions in a sentiment that may well be — and perhaps must be — aimed at the fundamental assumptions of our own time:

I fear none of the existing machines; what I fear is the extraordinary rapidity with which they are becoming something very different to what they are at present. No class of beings have in any time past made so rapid a movement forward. Should not that movement be jealously watched, and checked while we can still check it? And is it not necessary for this end to destroy the more advanced of the machines which are in use at present, though it is admitted that they are in themselves harmless? […] We cannot calculate on any corresponding advance in man’s intellectual or physical powers which shall be a set-off against the far greater development which seems in store for the machines. Some people may say that man’s moral influence will suffice to rule them; but I cannot think it will ever be safe to repose much trust in the moral sense of any machine.

In what may be the single most hauntingly prescient sentence written in his century, Butler adds:

Our bondage will steal upon us noiselessly and by imperceptible approaches.

A century and a half hence, Butler appears to have been right on every count. It is a chilling thought to consider that the reins of our own humanity might already be too far out of our hands. Felicitously, this remains an open question, to be answered with our very lives. Every act of resistance counts.

In April 2022, OpenAI — the artificial intelligence (AI) company cofounded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Wojciech Zaremba and John Schulman — debuted DALL-E 2, an AI tool that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language, like “teddy bears working on new AI research on the moon in the 1980s,” for instance.

In an attempt to take a step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) by rendering it with the sense of sight, OpenAI created an internet sensation. In the company’s words, “DALL-E 2 will empower people to express themselves creatively.”

Think of anything as random as “Cookie Monster reacting to his cookie stocks tanking” or “astronaut riding a horse in the style of Andy Warhol” and DALL-E 2 could generate it.

The technology was even recently used to make the first magazine cover generated by AI.

Although OpenAI just expanded early access to the tool, it inspired the creation of many similar image generator tools, including Google’s Imagen, Meta’s Make-A-Scene, TikTok’s AI green screen and the fun-yet-horrifying DALL-E mini by Boris Dayma.

As these tech giants battled for AI art supremacy, The Economist featured a new entrant to the game – Midjourney – on its June 2022 issue cover.

It is time to look at the promise and perils of the next big thing in machine intelligence. Join us on this new frontier https://t.co/jqVkAvpnAZ pic.twitter.com/1NkLZUI8dk — The Economist (@TheEconomist) June 9, 2022

David Holz’s version of this technology, known as Midjourney, quickly rose to prominence, and everyone who got their hands on this text-to-image generator was thoroughly impressed. Most recently, the Colorado State Fair’s annual art competition awarded its blue ribbon to emerging digital artists to Jason M. Allen, who had used Midjourney to create an artwork called “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial.”

Midjourney’s journey

To understand Midjourney, it’s important to look back to 2011 — the year David Holz launched his first AI-based startup, Leap Motion.

“In many ways, I wasn’t interested in artificial intelligence (AI) because I did not care much for making machines better,” Holz told VentureBeat. “Coming from the IA [intelligence augmentation] school of thought, I’ve always been more interested in empowering people and trying to make people better.”

Like many experts in AI who believe in using machines to perform tasks that humans would consider intelligent or smart —and experts in IA, who place humans at the center of the system and use technology to support and complement human cognitive functions, Holz chose a path that would let him enjoy the best of both worlds.

“Over the years, I’ve realized that we can use AI to empower people and to make people better and those people can make better AI — it’s like coming full circle and everyone wins,” he said.

Leap Motion transpired out of this ideology. The company developed an optical hand tracking module that captures the movements of human hands using AI. “The goal wasn’t to replace a sign language person, but it was to allow us to literally be embodied in virtual spaces inside of computers. And now, with Midjourney, we are not trying to replace an artist but are giving them tools to explore new mediums of thought and expand their imaginative powers,” Holz explained.

In 2021, Holz started Midjourney as an independent research lab. Around the same time, industry buzzwords like ‘diffusion models’ and ‘contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP)’ were on everyone’s lips.

Building on these developments, the lab began offering its text-to-image service in 2022. Similar to its counterparts, the AI system accepts a design prompt or idea in the form of a phrase and uses it as inspiration to create captivating images. Midjourney stands out because the AI bot can only be accessed via the voice over Internet protocol, instant messaging social platform, Discord — rather than via its own website or mobile app.

When a natural language query is issued, the bot responds with four low-resolution images in about 60 seconds. Users can generate variants and new generations at this point to get closer to their desired ideation. Users can change the aspect ratio of the prompt with a maximum resolution of 2048×1280 pixels, much higher than DALL-E 2’s 1024×1024 resolution.

Close-up photographs of discrete objects, pop culture references, charcoal or pencil sketches, paintings in the styles of various renowned artists — Midjourney can do it all. It’s exceptional at creating larger-than-life scenes.

As to the competition, Holz said, “I don’t really want to spend too much time comparing ourselves to others. I like to hope that the results speak for themselves. Kind of like how Apple doesn’t spend all their time talking about how Android sucks.”

Midjourney on ethical issues

Given the grand scale on which Midjourney performs, artists and researchers alike have begun expressing concerns about this technology’s collateral damage. Of the many questions raised, three garnered much attention:

Could it replace human designers? Does it violate content policies? Will it produce results that demonstrate gender biases, reinforce racial stereotypes — or contain anything explicit?

Holz addressed the three, extensively, below:

1. Could Midjourney replace human designers?

No, it cannot. As per Holz, Midjourney is meant to augment our capabilities, not replace us by any means.

“It’s kind of like the moment humans invented cars. Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”

2. Does it plagiarize or violate content policies?

This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.

“The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet. They’re like, David, ‘let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,’” he explained. “They think that the better they can get at copying their personal art style, the more useful it is. Whereas if it has its own style, they have to kind of meet it halfway and pull their stuff out of it. Which is interesting. It’s a little scary for me because I see how it could be used for good and evil.”

3. Will it produce results that demonstrate gender biases, reinforce racial stereotypes — or contain anything explicit?

As Midjourney is intended to be open by default, it has strict policies on ensuring that content is PG-13. It automatically blocks text inputs that are inherently disrespectful, aggressive, abusive or sexual, Holz confirmed Most importantly, the rules are enforced for all content, including interactions in private mode.

For all-things artsy, not business

Midjourney currently offers a limited “freemium” model that allows users to submit 20-25 prompts for image generation. After that, users can choose from a range of subscription packages — ranging from a basic membership package of 200 images, a standard membership, which includes unlimited images — or a premium corporate membership, which includes both unlimited images and complete privacy.

It’s important to note that “corporate membership” does not refer to an enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) product. In fact, Holz explicitly mentioned that the company has no interest in building one either, even though they have many customers who use the product to make commercial video games, concept art and videos.

“Our technology is moving so fast that it makes sense to focus on the consumer side because that’s where people can just take things and run. Also, there’s something very simple and beautiful about making a cool thing,” Holz said. “It only gets better when regular people can pay and have fun with it while professionals pay less than they would for an enterprise product, and still enjoy the product and use it for work. I think this simplicity is worth a lot and we want to keep it.”

What lies ahead: Text-to-3D?

While the world believes that the next phase of text-to-image evolution will move towardfull-blown videos or movies, Midjourney begs to differ. In fact, the company might avoid that as much as possible — as incorporating text-to-video capabilities could make the product more expensive and the output could be a dealbreaker, if it’s not thoroughly thought through.

That said, Holz does plan to take things to the next level via text-to-3D. He detailed Midjourney’s quest to make the output more real and move towards augmented and virtual reality. It aspires to bring the liquid imagination to the real world.

“I care about three things: Reflection, coordination and imagination. To make a better world, we need to be more reflective, more imaginative and we need to be better at coordinating. And I want to build something big in each area, and then bring them together one day,” he said.

That aside, the company does intend to build out the existing product with more enhanced features, thereby making the output more realistic and nuanced.

In addition, Midjourney’s technology uses a combination of its own models and open-source codes to create art. Holz’s near-term goal is to stop using open-source products and create the codes 100% in-house.

“I feel like there are people in technology who basically act like we have no past, and there’s a lot of people in the world in fear of not having a future. But I feel like the truth is we’re actually very much mid-journey,” Holz said. “We have this beautiful and rich history behind us, and an equally rich wonderful future ahead of us,” Holz concluded on an optimistic note, hinting at AI’s promise of limitless possibilities and the company’s ethos.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

The National Institutes of Health awarded USF millions of dollars this month to develop a database of patient voices to train artificial intelligence for medicine. USF Health’s Dr. Yael Bensoussan is leading the research project called, ""Voice as a Biomarker of Health.""

The project is a collaboration with Weill Cornell Medicine at Cornell University and 10 other institutions across the U.S. and Canada.

""So when we think about the voice, we think about speech and the way we speak with the way we say sentences, how fast we speak with what volume,"" said Dr. Bensoussan, a laryngologist at USF Health and director of the USF Health Voice Center. ""We know that it's been linked to a lot of health issues and health disease, and we know it can bring a lot of information. I think what we didn't have until now is that technology.""

The research and development are part of the Bridge2AI initiative from NIH. It will last four years, with the first year using $3.8 million from the NIH. Subsequent funding is contingent upon yearly amounts approved by congress that could bring the overall award to $14 million.

Bensoussan said they are gathering between 20,000 and 30,000 patient voices to help train AI to spot early signs of diseases or disorders. This includes cancers, respiratory problems, pediatric speech delays, autism, depression and bipolar disorder.

""We know that a lot of neurological disorder can change the way we speak. For example, when people have had a stroke or when people have Alzheimer's, the content of what they say is different. When people have Parkinson's, for example, the way they talk slows down is a lot lower,"" said Bensoussan.

They are also collecting voices of people who have neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.

""It's also important to get normal patients or patients who don't have that disease for the machine learning to understand the difference between the voices,"" she said.

The idea is to develop an app that doctors anywhere could use with their patients.

""Sometimes for clinicians that do not do what we do, it's hard to distinguish if the patient has a cancer from the voice box or just has laryngitis, for example. And it's really important, because we don't treat these two patients the same,"" said Bensoussan.

A patient would speak into their phone or use another device to record their voice, then the app would check the sounds against the database, Bensoussan said.

""At some point the app can say, well, you're not doing well. You know, your breathing doesn't sound good. You should go to the doctor,"" she added.

It will take about four years to develop, and doctors said they will need every day to track the health of thousands of voices over that time.

""We know that that really helps in terms of patient outcome with early screening and early diagnosis,"" said Bensoussan.

The project plans to collect patient voices from different genders, races and dialects to help train the AI on diverse speech and sounds. The NIH award is one of four projects funded for the AI initiative.",artificial intelligence,fox 13 tampa bay

STOCKHOLM, Sept 20 (Reuters) - IKEA (IKEA.UL), which as well as being the largest furniture brand also runs one of the world's biggest restaurant chains, has slashed its food waste by 54% since 2017 to save money and reduce its environmental footprint.

Global food waste accounts for between 8% and 10% of total greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation.

Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores, in 2017 announced a target to halve food waste with the help of an artificial intelligence tool that allows it to better tailor amounts cooked to demand.

At the time, daily food waste per outlet, known for the trademark meatballs, averaged some 150 kg (330 pounds), translating to some 43,000 tonnes annually in total.

Ingka said in a statement on Tuesday the reduction meant it had saved more than 20 million meals and avoided 36,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. The total saving in terms of money was 37 million euros ($37 million), a spokesperson added.

""Although this achievement represents a relatively small proportion of our overall climate footprint, (0.1%), it is nevertheless an important step that we are proud of,"" it said.

The entire IKEA value chain - from raw material production to customers' disposal of products - in the 12 months through August 2021 emitted 26.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

""We’re continuing to explore, test and develop ways to prevent and reduce food waste in our operations as well as to inspire our customers and the many people to do the same,"" Ingka said.

The restaurants serve around 560 million visitors a year.

YouTube said it will expand its policies on violent extremism to remove content that glorifies violent acts, even if the creators of the videos are not related to a terrorist organization.

The video streaming site already prohibits violent incitement, but in at least some cases has not applied existing policies to videos promoting militia groups involved with the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol.

A report by the Tech Transparency Project in May found 435 pro-militia videos on YouTube, including 85 posted since the Jan. 6 attack. Some of the videos gave training advice, like how to carry out guerilla-style ambushes.

YouTube spokesman Jack Malon declined to say whether the service would change its approach to that content under the new policy, but said the update enables it to go further with enforcement than it had previously.

YouTube also said it will launch a media literacy campaign to teach younger users how to spot the manipulation tactics that are used to spread misinformation.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) said it will make a basic and more affordable version of its artificial intelligence and machine learning tools available to schools and smaller organizations in order to help them detect and prevent violence.

Facebook owner Meta announced it will partner with researchers from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies' Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism.

Last year, lawmakers grilled the chief executives of Alphabet and Facebook, as well as Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), on whether their companies bore some responsibility for the Jan. 6 attack.

In June, South Korean regulators authorized the first-ever medicine, a COVID-19 vaccine, to be made from a novel protein designed by humans. The vaccine is based on a spherical protein ‘nanoparticle’ that was created by researchers nearly a decade ago, through a labour-intensive trial-and error-process1.

Now, thanks to gargantuan advances in artificial intelligence (AI), a team led by David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, reports in Science2,3 that it can design such molecules in seconds instead of months.

‘The entire protein universe’: AI predicts shape of nearly every known protein

Such efforts are a part of a scientific sea change, as AI tools such as DeepMind’s protein-structure-prediction software AlphaFold are embraced by life scientists. In July, DeepMind revealed that the latest version of AlphaFold had predicted structures for every protein known to science. And recent months have seen an explosive growth in AI tools — some based on AlphaFold — that can quickly dream up completely new proteins. Previously, this had been a painstaking pursuit with high failure rates.

“Since AlphaFold, there’s been a shift in the way we work with protein design,” says Noelia Ferruz, a computational biologist at the University of Girona, Spain. “We are witnessing very exciting times.”

Most efforts are focused on tools that can help to make original proteins, shaped unlike anything in nature, without much focus on what these molecules can do. But researchers — and a growing number of companies that are applying AI to protein design — would like to design proteins that can do useful things, from cleaning up toxic waste to treating diseases. Among the companies that are working towards this goal are DeepMind in London and Meta (formerly Facebook) in Menlo Park, California.

“The methods are already really powerful. They’re going to get more powerful,” says Baker. “The question is what problems are you going to solve with them.”

From scratch

Baker’s laboratory has spent the past three decades making new proteins. Software called Rosetta, which his lab started developing in the 1990s, splits the process into steps. Initially, researchers conceived a shape for a novel protein — often by cobbling together bits of other proteins — and the software deduced a sequence of amino acids that corresponded to this shape.

But these ‘first draft’ proteins rarely folded into the desired shape when made in the lab, and instead ended up stuck in different confirmations. So another step was needed to tweak the protein sequence such that it folded only into a single desired structure. This step, which involved simulating all the ways in which different sequences might fold, was computationally expensive, says Sergey Ovchinnikov, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who used to work in Baker’s lab. “You would literally have, like, 10,000 computers running for weeks doing this.”

What's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution

By tweaking AlphaFold and other AI programmes, that time-consuming step has become instantaneous, says Ovchinnikov. In one approach developed by Baker’s team, called hallucination, researchers feed random amino-acid sequences into a structure-prediction network; this alters the structure so that it becomes ever-more protein-like, as judged by the network’s predictions. In a 2021 paper, Baker’s team created more than 100 small, ‘hallucinated’ proteins in the lab and found signs that about one-fifth resembled the predicted shape4.

AlphaFold, and a similar tool developed by Baker’s lab called RoseTTAFold, were trained to predict the structure of individual protein chains. But researchers soon discovered that such networks could also model assemblies of multiple interacting proteins. On this basis, Baker and his team were confident they could hallucinate proteins that would self-assemble into nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes; these would be made up of numerous copies of a single protein and would be similar to those on which the COVID-19 vaccine is based.

But when they instructed microorganisms to make their creations in the labs, none of the 150 designs worked. “They didn’t fold at all: they were just gunk at the bottom of the test tube,” says Baker.

Around the same time, another researcher in the lab, machine-learning scientist Justas Dauparas, was developing a deep-learning tool to address what is known as the inverse folding problem — determining a protein sequence that corresponds to a given protein’s overall shape3. The network, called ProteinMPNN, can act as a ‘spellcheck’ for designer proteins created using AlphaFold and other tools, says Ovchinnikov, by tweaking sequences while maintaining the molecules’ overall shape.

When Baker and his team applied this second network to their hallucinated protein nanoparticles, it had much greater success making the molecules experimentally. The researchers checked 30 of their new proteins using cryo-electron microscopy and other experimental techniques, and 27 of them matched the AI-led designs2. The team’s creations included giant rings with complex symmetries, unlike anything found in nature. In theory, the approach could be used to design nanoparticles corresponding to almost any symmetric shape, says Lukas Milles, a biophysicist who co-led the effort. “It is electrifying to see what these networks can do.”

Deep-learning revolution

Deep-learning tools such as proteinMPNN have been a game changer in protein design, says Arne Elofsson, a computational biologist at Stockholm University. “You draw your protein, push a button, and you get something that one in ten times works.” Even higher success rates can be achieved by combining multiple neural networks to tackle different parts of the design process, as Baker’s team did in designing the nanoparticles. “Now we have full control over the shape of the protein,” says Ovchinnikov.

Baker’s isn’t the only lab applying AI to protein design. In a review paper posted to the bioRxiv this month, Ferruz and her colleagues counted more than 40 AI protein-design tools that have been developed in recent years, using various approaches5 (see ‘How to design a protein’).

Many of these tools, including proteinMPNN, tackle the inverse folding problem: they specify a sequence that corresponds to a particular structure, often using approaches borrowed from image-recognition tools. Some others are based on an architecture similar to that of language neural networks such as GPT-3, which produces human-like text; but, instead, the tools are capable of producing novel protein sequences. “These networks are able to ‘speak’ proteins,” says Ferruz, who has co-developed one such network6.

With so many protein-design tools available, it’s not always clear how best to compare them, says Chloe Hsu, a machine-learning researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who developed an inverse folding network with researchers from Meta7.

In each case, AlphaFold is presented with a random amino-acid sequence, predicts the structure, and changes the sequence until the software confidently predicts that it will fold into a protein with a well-defined 3D shape.

Many teams gauge their network’s ability to accurately determine the sequence of an existing protein from its structure. But this doesn’t apply for all methods, and it’s not clear how this metric, known as recovery rate, applies to the design of novel proteins, say scientists. Ferruz would like to see a protein-design competition, analogous to the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment, in which AlphaFold first demonstrated its superiority over other networks. “It’s a dream. Something like CASP would really move the field forward,” she says.

To the wet lab

Baker and his colleagues are adamant that making a novel protein in the lab is the ultimate test of their methods. Their initial failure to make hallucinated protein assemblies shows this. “AlphaFold thought they were fantastic proteins, but they clearly didn’t work in the wet lab,” says Basile Wicky, a biophysicist in Baker’s lab who co-led the effort, along with Baker, Milles and UW biochemist Alexis Courbet.

But not all scientists developing AI tools for protein design have easy access to experimental set-ups, notes Jinbo Xu, a computational biologist at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago in Illinois. Finding a lab to collaborate with can take time, so Xu is establishing his own wet lab to put his team’s creations to the test.

Experiments will also be essential when it comes to designing proteins with specific tasks in mind, says Baker. In July, his team described a pair of AI methods that allow researchers to embed a specific sequence or structure in a novel protein8. They used these approaches to design enzymes that catalyse particular reactions; proteins capable of binding to other molecules; and a protein that could be used in a vaccine against a respiratory virus that is a leading cause of infant hospitalizations.

Last year, DeepMind launched a spin-off company called Isomorphic Labs in London that intends to apply AI tools such as AlphaFold to drug discovery. DeepMind’s chief executive, Demis Hassabis, says that he sees protein design as an obvious and promising application for deep-learning technology, and for AlphaFold in particular. “We’re working quite a lot in the protein design space. It’s pretty early days.”",artificial intelligence,nature.com

But in the human brain, that volume of tissue contains some 50,000 neural ‘wires’ connected by 134 million synapses. Jeff Lichtman wanted to trace them all.

To generate the raw data, he used a protocol known as serial thin-section electron microscopy, imaging thousands of slivers of tissue over 11 months. But the data set was enormous, amounting to 1.4 petabytes — the equivalent of about 2 million CD-ROMs — far too much for researchers to handle on their own. “It is simply impossible for human beings to manually trace out all the wires,” says Lichtman, a molecular and cell biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “There are not enough people on Earth to really get this job done in an efficient way.”

It’s a common refrain in connectomics — the study of the brain’s structural and functional connections — as well as in other biosciences, in which advances in microscopy are creating a deluge of imaging data. But where human resources fail, computers can step in, especially deep learning algorithms that have been optimized to tease out patterns from large data sets.

“We’ve really had a Cambrian explosion of tools for deep learning in the past few years,” says Beth Cimini, a computational biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Deep learning is an artificial-intelligence (AI) technique that relies on many-layered artificial neural networks inspired by how neurons interconnect in the brain. Based as they are on black-box neural networks, the algorithms have their limitations. Those include a dependence on massive data sets to teach the network how to identify features of interest, and a sometimes inscrutable way of generating results. But a fast-growing array of open-source and web-based tools is making it easier than ever to get started (see ‘Taking the leap into deep learning’).

Taking the leap into deep learning Plenty of resources are available to help researchers get up to speed. Organizations such as the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts and NEUBIAS, the global Network of European BioImage Analysts, offer courses on how to get started. And the Center for Open Bioimage Analysis, a collaboration between the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison sponsors image.sc, a discussion forum about scientific-image software. Researchers can also comb old Kaggle challenges — computational competitions for scientists and AI enthusiasts — for examples of models and data that they can practise with and learn from. “All the data and the training sets are available, and you can look at the code and descriptions for the winning models, so it’s a very good starting point,” says Emma Lundberg, a bioengineer at Stanford University in California. Researchers might also want to start with pre-trained models from tool sets such as Cellpose, StarDist and DeepCell, which can be used through web interfaces, as plug-ins for the ImageJ and napari software ecosystems, or as standalone applications. “They’ve trained models that work pretty well for a good fraction of use cases,” says Beth Cimini, a computational biologist at the Broad Institute. “You don’t really need to know what they’re doing or understand how a deep-learning network works, you just kind of tweak the knobs until you get a good result.” For those who require greater customizability, Piximi and ImJoy allow researchers to train their own neural networks to identify various phenotypes, and to locate cells in images, a process known as segmentation. Most such tools can be run in a browser. ZeroCostDL4Mic, an open-source toolbox for deep learning in microscopy, uses Google’s computational-notebook platform Colab and allows researchers to train various popular open-source models in the cloud, as well as access pre-trained models that can be run in the cloud9. There’s also the BioImage Model Zoo, a one-stop shop for open-source pre-trained models for popular-use cases. Alternatively, researchers can install and run dedicated software. For instance, ilastik has a point-and-click interface to help detect not just cells and nuclei but also features such as microtubules and vesicles. Co-developer Anna Kreshuk, a computer scientist at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany, and her colleagues are now working to improve the software’s ability to train neural networks for tasks such as classification and segmentation. “Everybody needs segmentation,” she says, “but everyone is segmenting different things.” A training feature is already available in an unsupported debug mode. Learning to program, particularly in Python, can help researchers who want to customize or train new models. “This will really give you an edge, like being able to manipulate your data more freely to apply methods that people have not specifically packaged for you in the best possible way,” says Kreshuk. Also helpful will be one or more graphics processing units and computers capable of using them. But neither software nor hardware matters as much as the data. “The hardest and the most time-consuming part of any deep learning is acquiring training data. And if your data’s crappy, then your model’s going to be crappy,” says Cimini. “You typically need hundreds or thousands of examples at minimum, and creating the annotations itself is tedious.” Data sets ideally should be large and diverse, and it helps if humans can unambiguously identify whatever the deep-learning model is being asked to find. “People kind of expect that these models can just perform miracles, but if the information that you want to pull out isn’t there in the data, then in my view and also in my experience, it’s unlikely to work,” says David Van Valen, a bioengineer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Deep-learning algorithms effectively operate as black boxes, but some tools can provide clues to their reasoning. “You can tell, for example, which part of an image was most important in making a particular decision,” says Cimini. For now, unambiguous but tedious tasks such as identifying cells or nuclei are ideal, because humans can easily verify the results. But as algorithms improve, the scale and scope of researchers’ ambitions will change, too. “It’s a really exciting field,” Cimini says. “I think it’s going to make a lot of people’s lives easier.”

Here are five areas in which deep learning is having a deep impact in bioimage analysis.

Large-scale connectomics

Deep learning has enabled researchers to generate increasingly complex connectomes from fruit flies, mice and even humans. Such data can help neuroscientists to understand how the brain works, and how its structure changes during development and in disease. But neural connectivity isn’t easy to map.

In 2018, Lichtman joined forces with Viren Jain, head of Connectomics at Google in Mountain View, California, who was looking for a suitable challenge for his team’s AI algorithms.

“The image analysis tasks in connectomics are very difficult,” Jain says. “You have to be able to trace these thin wires, the axons and dendrites of a cell, across large distances, and conventional image-processing methods made so many mistakes that they were basically useless for this task.” These wires can be thinner than a micrometre and extend over hundreds of micrometres or even millimetres of tissue. Deep-learning algorithms provide a way to automate the analysis of connectomics data while still achieving high accuracy.

How to make spatial maps of gene activity — down to the cellular level

In deep learning, researchers can use annotated data sets containing features of interest to train complex computational models so that they can quickly identify the same features in other data. “When you do deep learning, you say, ‘okay, I will just give examples and you figure everything out’,” says Anna Kreshuk, a computer scientist at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany.

But even using deep learning, Lichtman and Jain had a herculean task in trying to map their snippet of the human cortex1. It took 326 days just to image the 5,000 or so extremely thin sections of tissue. Two researchers spent about 100 hours manually annotating the images and tracing neurons to create ‘ground truth’ data sets to train the algorithms, in an approach known as supervised machine learning. The trained algorithms then automatically stitched the images together and identified neurons and synapses to generate the final connectome.

Jain’s team brought massive computational resources to bear on the problem, including thousands of tensor processing units (TPUs), Google’s in-house equivalent to graphics processing units (GPUs) built specifically for neural-network machine learning. Processing the data required on the order of one million TPU hours over several months, Jain says, after which human volunteers proofread and corrected the connectome in a collaborative process, “sort of like Google Docs”, says Lichtman.

The end result, they say, is the largest such data set reconstructed at this level of detail in any species. Still, it represents just 0.0001% of the human brain. But as algorithms and hardware improve, researchers should be able to map ever larger portions of the brain, while having the resolution to spot more cellular features, such as organelles and even proteins. “In some ways,” says Jain, “we are just scratching the surface of what might be possible to extract from these images.”

Virtual histology

Histology is a key tool in medicine, and is used to diagnose disease on the basis of chemical or molecular staining. But it’s laborious, and the process can take days or even weeks to complete. Biopsies are sliced into thin sections and stained to reveal cellular and sub-cellular features. A pathologist then reads the slides and interprets the results. Aydogan Ozcan reckoned he could accelerate the process.

Python power-up: new image tool visualizes complex data

An electrical and computer engineer at the University of California, Los Angeles, Ozcan trained a custom deep-learning model to stain a tissue section computationally by presenting it with tens of thousands of examples of both unstained and stained versions of the same section, and letting the model work out how they differed.

Virtual staining is almost instantaneous, and board-certified pathologists found it almost impossible to distinguish the resulting images from conventionally stained ones2. Ozcan has also shown that the algorithm can replicate a molecular stain for the breast cancer biomarker HER2 in seconds, a process that typically takes at least 24 hours in a histology lab. A panel of three board-certified breast pathologists rated the images as having comparable quality and accuracy to conventional immunohistochemical staining3.

Ozcan, who aims to commercialize virtual staining, hopes to see applications in drug development. But by eliminating the need for toxic dyes and expensive staining equipment, the technique could also increase access to histology services worldwide, he says.

Cell finding

If you want to extract data from cellular images, you have to know where in the images the cells actually are.

Researchers usually perform this process, called cell segmentation, either by looking at cells under the microscope or outlining them in software, image by image. “The word that most describes what people have been doing is ‘painstaking’,” says Morgan Schwartz, a computational biologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who is developing deep-learning tools for bioimage analysis. But these painstaking approaches are hitting a wall as imaging data sets become ever larger. “Some of these experiments you just couldn’t analyse without automating the process.”

Schwartz’s graduate adviser, bioengineer David Van Valen, has created a suite of AI models, available at deepcell.org, to count and analyse cells and other features from images both of live cells and of preserved tissue. Working with collaborators including Noah Greenwald, a cancer biologist at Stanford University in California, Van Valen developed a deep-learning model called Mesmer to quickly and accurately detect cells and nuclei across different tissue types4. “If you’ve got data that you need processed, now you can just upload them, download the results and visualize them either within the web portal or using other software packages,” Van Valen says.

According to Greenwald, researchers can use such information to differentiate cancerous from non-cancerous tissue and to search for differences before and after treatment. “You can look at the imaging-based changes to have a better idea of why some patients respond or don’t respond, or to identify subtypes of tumours,” he says.

Mapping protein localization

The Human Protein Atlas project exploits yet another application of deep learning: intracellular localization. “We have for decades been generating millions of images, outlining the protein expression in cells and tissues of the human body,” says Emma Lundberg, a bioengineer at Stanford University and a co-manager of the project. At first, the project annotated those images manually. But because that approach wasn’t sustainable long term, Lundberg turned to AI.

NatureTech hub

Lundberg first combined deep learning with citizen science, tasking volunteers with annotating millions of images while playing a massively multiplayer game, EVE Online5. Over the past few years, she has switched to a crowdsourced AI-only solution, launching Kaggle challenges — in which scientists and AI enthusiasts compete to achieve various computational tasks — of US$37,000 and $25,000, to devise supervised machine-learning models to annotate protein-atlas images. “The Kaggle challenge afterwards blew the gamers away,” Lundberg says. The winning models outperformed Lundberg’s previous efforts at multi-label classification of protein-localization patterns by about 20% and were generalizable across cell lines6. And they managed something no published models had done before, she adds, which was to accurately classify proteins that exist in multiple cellular locations.

“We have shown that half of all human proteins localized to multiple cellular compartments,” says Lundberg. And location matters, because the same protein might behave differently in different places. “Knowing if a protein is in the nucleus or in the mitochondria, it helps understand lots of things about its function,” she says.

Tracking animal behaviour

Mackenzie Mathis, a neuroscientist at the Campus Biotech hub of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, in Geneva, has long been interested in how the brain drives behaviour. She developed a program called DeepLabCut to enable neuroscientists to track animal poses and fine movements from videos, turning ‘cat videos’ and recordings of other animals into data7.

DeepLabCut offers a graphical user interface so that scientists can upload and label their videos and train a deep-learning model at the click of a button. In April, Mathis’s team expanded the software to estimate poses for multiple animals at the same time, something that’s typically been challenging for both humans and AI8.

Applying multi-animal DeepLabCut to marmosets, the researchers found that when the animals were in close proximity, their bodies were aligned and they tended to look in similar directions, whereas they tended to face each other when apart. “That’s a really good case where pose actually matters,” Mathis says. “If you want to understand how two animals are interacting and looking at each other or surveying the world.”",artificial intelligence,nature.com

Nvidia has invested $15 million in PassiveLogic, a pioneer in autonomous building control systems. The investment will help drive integration between PassiveLogic’s tools and Nvidia’s Omniverse platform for the industrial metaverse.

PassiveLogic is developing a growing ecosystem of tools built on top of digital twins to enable generative design, autonomous systems and next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). These help architects, engineers, contractors and building owners improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of building operations.

The platform helps users quickly collaborate around AI controls, test them on digital twins of the building, and then deploy them into operations. The company claims its Hive control platform is ten times faster to install and reduces energy consumption by a third compared to conventional automation solutions.

PassiveLogic is also driving the quantum digital twin standard for autonomous systems that helps describe system-level interactions between components, equipment, assemblies and environments.

Visualization meets automation

According to PassiveLogic’s CEO Troy Harvey, “Nvidia’s Omniverse and PassiveLogic’s Quantum are each focused on different and complementary aspects of describing the world through digital twins.”

The Omniverse is very focused on geometry and visualization and providing the integration to universal scene description (USD) workflows for industrial digital twins. PassiveLogic’s compiler and compute technology runs the AI for these digital twins at the edge on Nvidia GPU technology. Integration between the platforms will make it easier to embed digital twins into AI control systems to support autonomous building controls that can adapt to changes in user needs, the environment, or the equipment itself.

“As a partnership, we are really excited about the breadth of applications our combined technology platforms can address,” Harvey said.

Other components that PassiveLogic’s platform include are:

The Quantum Creator which provides a CAD system for creating digital twins that describe what something is, how it works and why it would do specific actions.

An Autonomy Studio that enables users to build autonomous systems by composing digital twins into systems and environments through a drag-and-drop interface that outputs a system-level digital twin.

The Hive platform consumes these digital twins to provide real-time automation of buildings.

The Passport feature allows individuals to create and share their own personal digital twin reflecting physiological, ergonomic and comfort preferences.

New workflows

These integrations can improve the control systems for any kind of equipment. In the short run, Harvey is most focused on opportunities for autonomous buildings to improve sustainability. He estimates that buildings consume about 41% of the world’s energy, and believes the company’s platform can help reduce that by 30%.

PassiveLogic can help teams at the beginning of a project to clarify project goals, iterate prototypes with generative design, and then automate control systems. Nvidia’s Omniverse then provides the visualization, animation and 3D exploration of the virtual world, once the project is underway. Omniverse also simplifies USD integration with other tools.

The new funding from Nvidia brings PassiveLogic’s total funding to more than $80 million. Other investors include building-asset owners, equipment manufacturers and venture investors such as Addition, Brookfield, Keyframe, RET, Era and A/O Proptech. This investment is part of a broader trend around using USD as a core data layer to simplify workflows across various tools. It complements efforts to integrate USD and IFC and Nvidia’s recent partnership with Siemens to grow the industrial metaverse on top of USD.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Head over to the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions here.

Even though responsible artificial intelligence (AI) is considered a top management concern, a newly released report from Boston Consulting Group and MIT Sloan Management Review finds that few leaders are prioritizing initiatives to make it happen.

Of the 84% of respondents who believe that responsible AI should be a top management priority, only 56% said that it is, in fact, a top priority — with only 25% of those reporting their organizations has a fully mature program in place, according to the research.

Further, only 52% of organizations reported they have a responsible AI program in place – and 79% of those programs are limited in scale and scope, the BCG/MIT Sloan report said. With less than half of organizations viewing responsible AI as a top strategic priority, among them, only 19% confirmed they have a fully implemented responsible program in place.

This indicates that responsible AI lags behind strategic AI priorities, according to the report.

Event Low-Code/No-Code Summit Join today’s leading executives at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit virtually on November 9. Register for your free pass today. Register Here

Factors working against the adoption of responsible AI include a lack of agreement on what “responsible AI” means along with a lack of talent, prioritization and funding.

Meanwhile, AI systems across industries are susceptible to failures, with nearly a quarter of respondents stating that their organization has experienced issues ranging from mere lapses in technical performance to outcomes that put individuals and communities at risk, according to the research.

Why responsible AI isn’t happening and why it matters

Responsible AI is not being prioritized because of the competition for management’s attention, Steve Mills, chief AI ethics officer and managing director and partner at BCG, told VentureBeat.

“Responsible AI is fundamentally about a cultural transformation and this requires support from everyone within an organization, from the top down,” Mills said. “But today, many issues compete for management’s attention — evolving ways of working, global economic conditions, lingering supply chain challenges — all of which can down-prioritize responsible AI.”

There is also an uncertain regulatory environment even with AI-specific laws emerging in jurisdictions around the world, he said.

“On the surface, this should accelerate [the] adoption of responsible AI, but many regulations remain in draft form and specific requirements are still emerging. Until companies have a clear view of the requirements, they may hesitate to act,” Mills said.

He stressed that companies need to move quickly. Less than half of respondents reported feeling prepared to address emerging regulatory requirements — even among responsible AI leaders, only 51% reported feeling prepared.

“At the same time, our results show that it takes companies three years on average to fully mature responsible AI,” he said. “Companies cannot wait for regulations to settle before getting started.”

There is also a perception challenge.

“Much of the hesitation and skepticism regarding responsible AI revolves around a common misconception that it slows down innovation due to the need for additional checklists, reviews and expert engagement,’’ Mills said. “In fact, we see that the opposite is true. Nearly half of responsible AI leaders report that their responsible AI efforts already result in accelerated innovation.”

Responsible AI can be difficult to deploy

Mills acknowledged that responsible AI can be hard to implement, but said, “the payoff is real.”

Once leaders prioritize and give attention to responsible AI, they still need to provide appropriate funding and resources and build awareness, he said. “Even once those early issues are resolved, access to responsible AI talent and training present lingering challenges.”

Yet, Mills makes the case for companies to overcome these challenges, saying there are “clear rewards. Responsible AI yields products that are more trusted and better at meeting customer needs, producing powerful business benefits,” he said.

Having a leading responsible AI program in place reduces the risk of scaling AI, according to Mills.

“Companies that have leading responsible AI programs and mature AI report 30% fewer AI system failures than those with mature AI alone,” he said.

This makes sense, intuitively, Mills said, because as companies scale AI, more systems are deployed and the risk of failures increases.

A leading responsible AI program offsets that risk, reducing the number of failures and identifying them earlier, minimizing their impact.

Additionally, companies with mature AI and leading responsible AI programs report over twice the business benefits as those with mature AI, alone, Mills said.

“The human-centered approaches that are core to responsible AI lead to stronger customer engagement, trust and better-designed products and services,” he said.

“More importantly,” Mills added, “it’s simply the right thing to do and is a key element of corporate social responsibility.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Sept 20 (Reuters) - Chip giant Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) on Tuesday unveiled its new computing platform called DRIVE Thor that would centralize autonomous and assisted driving as well as other digital functions including in-car entertainment.

Nvidia, a big player in the gaming chip and artificial intelligence (AI) market, has been making a big push in the automotive business, a key growth segment for the company.

Danny Shapiro, head of Nvidia's automotive business, said DRIVE Thor would be able to replace numerous chips and cables in the car and bring down the overall system cost, although he did not give specific numbers on savings.

""You can imagine a tremendous savings in terms of cost, in terms of reduced cabling, in terms of reduced weight, in terms of reduced energy consumption overall,"" Shapiro said during a briefing session.

Some automakers have begun work on designing their own chips to gain more control and cut costs.

General Motor's (GM.N) autonomous driving unit Cruise last week said it had developed its own chips to be deployed by 2025. It currently uses Nvidia chips. read more

The first customer Nvidia announced for DRIVE Thor is China's Geely-owned (GEELY.UL) ZEEKR.

Shapiro said its current computer system called DRIVE Orin will be used in Chinese car company XPeng's new smart SUV and Chinese autonomous driving startup QCraft.

But this comes amid worries about whether Chinese customers would be able to continue to access Nvidia technology with a recent U.S. ban on exports of two top Nvidia computing chips for data centers to China. read more

""There's a lot of companies doing great work, doing things that will benefit mankind and we want to support them,"" Shapiro said. ""In the cases where we do have product for the data center that has some export restrictions, we're working with those Chinese customers to come up with a suitable alternative product.""

21,Google cuts jobs at its most innovative division known as Area 120,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b6iNzsQ7qoi5pfdVcb7iDc-1200-80.jpg,15/09/2022,Google appears to have reduced funding for Area 120 and slashed the initial list of projects by half.,https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-slashes-jobs-at-area-120,"What you need to know

Google appears to be reducing funding for Area 120.

As a result, the company's in-house R&D unit is seeing its projects cut in half.

Affected employees have been told that they must find new jobs within Google or face termination.

Google's research and development unit responsible for new ideas and projects is seeing a reduction in headcount and funding as the company shifts its focus to artificial intelligence, Bloomberg (opens in new tab) reports.

The search giant's latest move means that half of the 14 current projects at Area 120 will be canceled, and some heads will roll. According to the report, Google has informed affected employees that they must look for new opportunities within the company by January 2023. Otherwise, Google will have to terminate them. Google recruiters are assisting affected employees in finding new jobs at the company.

Android Central has reached out to Google for comment and will update this article when we receive a response. Meanwhile, the Mountain View-based tech giant has confirmed the reduction to TechCrunch (opens in new tab), saying that ""Area 120 is winding down several projects to make way for new work.""

Elias Roman, the unit's lead, added that the move is intended to shift the company's focus away from product incubation and toward AI projects.

The funding and headcount reductions are unsurprising given that Google had previously halted hiring while it reviewed its headcount requirements.

Area 120 saw the birth of a diverse range of projects, including GameSnacks, which aimed to create a quick and easy way for users in emerging markets to play casual games. Last year, the incubator team created Stack, a smart document scanner designed to automatically organize documents and add important details. At one point, Google also wanted to compete with Airtable with a work-tracking tool called Tables.

As part of the reduction, Google is discontinuing some new initiatives, such as Qaya, which was meant to allow creators to set up storefronts for their products.

Google's latest reduction in force doesn't mean it's pulling the plug on Area 120 any time soon. The department will stay in place, albeit with fewer resources and funding. But looking at the situation from a distance, the latest move highlights the negative impact of a worsening global economic outlook.",artificial intelligence,android central

Head over to the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions here.

Conversational AI is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows consumers to interact with computer applications as if they were interacting with another human. According to Deloitte, the global conversational AI market is set to grow by 22% between 2022 and 2025 and is estimated to reach $14 billion by 2025.

Providing enhanced language customizations to cater to a highly diverse and vast group of hyper-local audiences, many practical applications of this include financial services, hospital wards and conferences, and can take the form of a translation app or a chatbot. According to Gartner, 70% of white-collar workers purportedly regularly interact with conversational platforms, but this is just a drop in the ocean of what can unfold this decade.

Despite the exciting potential within the AI space, there is one significant hurdle; the data used to train conversational AI models does not adequately account for the subtleties of dialect, language, speech patterns and inflection.

When using a translation app, for example, an individual will speak in their source language, and the AI will compute this source language and convert it into the target language. When the source speaker deviates from a standardized learned accent — for example, if they speak in a regional accent or use regional slang — the efficacy rate of live translation dips. Not only does this provide a subpar experience, but it also inhibits users’ ability to interact in real-time, either with friends and family or in a business setting.

The need for humanity in AI

In order to avoid a drop in efficacy rates, AI must make use of a diverse dataset. For instance, this could include having an accurate depiction of speakers across the U.K. — both on a regional and national level — in order to provide a better active translation and speed up the interaction between speakers of different languages and dialects.

The idea of using training data in ML programs is a simple concept, but it is also foundational to the way that these technologies work. Training data works in a singular structure of reinforcement learning and is used to help a program understand how to apply technologies like neural networks to learn and produce sophisticated results. The wider the pool of people interacting with this technology on the back-end, for example, speakers with speech impediments or stutters, the better the resulting translation experience will be.

Specifically within the translation space, focusing on how a user speaks rather than what they speak about is the key to augmenting the end-user experience. The darker side of reinforcement learning was illustrated in recent news with Meta, who recently came under fire for having a chatbot that spewed insensitive comments — which it learned from public interaction. Training data should therefore always have a human-in-the-loop (HITL), in which a human can ensure the overarching algorithm is accurate and fit for purpose.

Accounting for the active nature of human conversation

Of course, human interaction is incredibly nuanced and building bot conversational design that can navigate its complexity is a perennial challenge. However, once achieved, well-structured, fully realized conversational design can lighten the load on customer service teams, translation apps and improve customer experiences. Beyond regional dialects and slang, training data needs to also account for active conversation between two or more speakers interacting with each other. The bot must learn from their speech patterns, the time taken to actualize an interjection, the pause between speakers and then the response.

Prioritizing balance is also a great way to ensure that conversations remain an active experience for the user, and one way to do so is via eliminating dead-end responses. Think of this akin to being in an improv setting, in which “yes, and” sentences are foundational. In other words, you’re supposed to accept your partner’s world-building while bringing a new element to the table. The most effective bots operate similarly by phrasing responses openly that encourage additional inquiries. Offering options and additional, relevant choices can help ensure all end users’ needs are met.

Numerous people have trouble remembering long strings of thought or take a bit longer to process their thoughts. Because of this, translation apps would do well to allow users enough time to compute their thoughts before taking a pause at the end of an interjection. Training a bot to learn filler words — including so, erm, well, um, or like, in English for example — and getting them to associate a longer lead time with these words is a good way of allowing users to engage in a more realistic real-time conversation. Offering targeted “barge-in” programming (chances for users to interrupt the bot) is also another way of more accurately simulating the active nature of conversation.

Future innovations in conversational AI

Conversational AI still has some way to go before all users feel accurately represented. Accounting for subtleties of dialect, the time taken for speakers to think, as well as the active nature of a conversation will be pivotal to propelling this technology forward. Specifically within the realm of translation apps, accounting for pauses and words associated with thinking will ameliorate the experience for everyone involved and simulate a more natural, active conversation.

Getting the data to draw from a wider data set in the back-end process, for example learning from both English RP and Geordie inflections, will avoid the efficacy of a translation dropping owing to processing issues due to accent. These innovations provide exciting potential, and it is time translation apps and bots account for linguistic subtleties and speech patterns.

Without exaggeration, digital transformation is moving at breakneck speed, and the verdict is that it will only move faster. More organizations will migrate to the cloud, adopt edge computing and leverage artificial intelligence (AI) for business processes, according to Gartner.

Fueling this fast, wild ride is data, and this is why for many enterprises, data — in its various forms — is one of its most valuable assets. As businesses now have more data than ever before, managing and leveraging it for efficiency has become a top concern. Primary among those concerns is the inadequacy of traditional data management frameworks to handle the increasing complexities of a digital-forward business climate.

The priorities have changed: Customers are no longer satisfied with immobile traditional data centers and are now migrating to high-powered, on-demand and multicloud ones. According to Forrester’s survey of 1,039 international application development and delivery professionals, 60% of technology practitioners and decision-makers are using multicloud — a number expected to rise to 81% in the next 12 months. But perhaps most important from the survey is that “90% of responding multicloud users say that it’s helping them achieve their business goals.”

Managing the complexities of multicloud data centers

Gartner also reports that enterprise multicloud deployment has become so pervasive that until at least 2023, “the 10 biggest public cloud providers will command more than half of the total public cloud market.”

Event Low-Code/No-Code Summit Join today’s leading executives at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit virtually on November 9. Register for your free pass today. Register Here

But that’s not where it ends — customers are also on the hunt for edge, private or hybrid multicloud data centers that offer full visibility of enterprise-wide technology stack and cross-domain correlation of IT infrastructure components. While justified, these functionalities come with great complexities.

Typically, layers upon layers of cross-domain configurations characterize the multicloud environment. However, as newer cloud computing functionalities enter into the mainstream, new layers are required — thus complicating an already-complex system.

This is made even more intricate with the rollout of the 5G network and edge data centers to support the increasing cloud-based demands of a global post-pandemic climate. Ushering in what many have called “a new wave of data centers,” this reconstruction creates even greater complexities that place enormous pressure on traditional operational models.

Change is necessary, but considering that the slightest change in one of the infrastructure, security, networking or application layers could result in large-scale butterfly effects, enterprise IT teams must come to terms with the fact that they cannot do it alone.

AIops as a solution to multicloud complexity

Andy Thurai, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research Inc., also confirmed this. For him, the siloed nature of multicloud operations management has resulted in the increasing complexity of IT operations. His solution? AI for IT operations (AIops), an AI industry category coined by tech research firm Gartner in 2016.

Officially defined by Gartner as “the combination of big data and ML [machine learning] in the automation and improvement of IT operation processes,” the detection, monitoring and analytic capabilities of AIops allow it to intelligently comb through countless disparate components of data centers to provide a holistic transformation of its operations.

By 2030, the rise in data volumes and its resulting increase in cloud adoption will have contributed to a projected $644.96 billion global AIops market size. What this means is that enterprises that expect to meet the speed and scale requirements of growing customer expectations must resort to AIops. Else, they run the risk of poor data management and a consequent fall in business performance.

This need creates a demand for comprehensive and holistic operating models for the deployment of AIops — and that is where Cloudfabrix comes in.

AIops as a composable analytics solution

Inspired to help enterprises ease their adoption of a data-first, AI-first and automate-everywhere strategy, Cloudfabrix today announced the availability of its new AIops operating model. It is equipped with persona-based composable analytics, data and AI/ML observability pipelines and incident-remediation workflow capabilities. The announcement comes on the heels of its recent release of what it describes as “the world-first robotic data automation fabric (RDAF) technology that unifies AIops, automation and observability.”

Identified as key to scaling AI, composable analytics give enterprises the opportunity to organize their IT infrastructure by creating subcomponents that can be accessed and delivered to remote machines at will. Featured in Cloudfabrix’s new AIops operating model is a composable analytics integration with composable dashboards and pipelines.

Offering a 360-degree visualization of disparate data sources and types, Cloudfabrix’s composable dashboards feature field-configurable persona-based dashboards, centralized visibility for platform teams and KPI dashboards for business-development operations.

Shailesh Manjrekar, VP of AI and marketing at Cloudfabrix, noted in an article published on Forbes that the only way AIops could process all data types to improve their quality and glean unique insights is through real-time observability pipelines. This stance is reiterated in Cloudfabrix’s adoption of not just composable pipelines, but also observability pipeline synthetics in its incident-remediation workflows.

In this synthesis, likely malfunctions are simulated to monitor the behavior of the pipeline and understand the probable causes and their solutions. Also included in the incident-remediation workflow of the model is the recommendation engine, which leverages learned behavior from the operational metastore and NLP analysis to recommend clear remediation actions for prioritized alerts.

To give a sense of the scope, Cloudfabrix’s CEO, Raju Datla, said the launch of its composable analytics is “solely focused on the BizDevOps personas in mind and transforming their user experience and trust in AI operations.”

He added that the launch also “focuses on automation, by seamlessly integrating AIops workflows in your operating model and building trust in data automation and observability pipelines through simulating synthetic errors before launching in production.” Some of those operational personas for whom this model has been designed include cloudops, bizops, GitOps, finops, devops, DevSecOps, Exec, ITops and serviceops.

Founded in 2015, Cloudfabrix specializes in enabling businesses to build autonomous enterprises with AI-powered IT solutions. Although the California-based software company markets itself as a foremost data-centric AIops platform vendor, it’s not without competition — especially with contenders like IBM’s Watson AIops, Moogsoft, Splunk and others.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

The much-hyped metaverse concept — once thought of as a futuristic, hypothetical online destination — is quickly becoming a new kind of internet. As more users interact with one another in these virtual environments, brands will realize new opportunities for engaging their target audiences. Companies such as Meta (formerly Facebook) are rapidly making plans to expand into the metaverse, altering and advancing how people will work, socialize, shop and even bank in the future.

While some completely disagree with the positive potential of this digital world, it cannot be refuted that the metaverse is a topic that many have heard of and will become increasingly ubiquitous. Gaming may be its most obvious initial use case, as consumers and gamers alike are steadily continuing to merge their physical and digital lives. This is something that’s been happening since the arrival of the iPhone, a device that has become an extension of our brains and bodies. As technology progresses and advances, it’s only natural that more parts of our lives will be embedded into the digital world.

With more people opting to “live” inside the metaverse, there will be routine tasks that require more advanced and intuitive communication. Be it mailing a letter, purchasing land or buying a burger, there must be a proper way to scale communications through artificial intelligence. Technologies like CAIP (conversational AI platforms) will allow brands to design more appealing and engaging user experiences in this burgeoning virtual environment.

Building the experiential foundation

As more retail, banking and technology companies begin to inhabit the metaverse, the need for intelligent and relatable customer service programs will be crucial for success in this new arena. To achieve this, it has become increasingly clear that conversational AI must be the foundation of the metaverse, especially for experience delivery.

Whether it’s a virtual post office, bank, or fast food restaurant, the interactions will be between a human-controlled avatar and a chatbot, so these avatars must have a streamlined way to communicate in order to effectively reach their goal. We are seeing this begin to take shape, as Meta just released its open source language model that includes 175 billion words, a good start for the conversational AI that will give consumers access to advanced customer support systems that interact like humans. These advancements will not only allow retailers to make the customer service process easier, they can also help them create an even more immersive experience for brand loyalists.

In addition to its language model, Meta released major improvements to its hand tracking API, allowing a user’s hand to move as freely as it would in the physical world. This same precedent must be set for digital conversations, especially in consumer engagement and customer support settings. Just as users need to be able to use their hands, they will need to achieve goals through conversation. If a user cannot properly communicate with an avatar (bot), the lack of “human experience” will likely detract from the system’s ability to blend the digital and physical worlds.

Metaverse + AI aspirations

The metaverse can be thought of as a series of universes that merge, where a user could seamlessly flit among their worker, gamer and social media personas based on their requirements. Many have noted that the metaverse will probably play out like an open-world MMO or MMORPG (e.g. Fortnite or World of Warcraft, respectively) which will allow metaverse avatars to interact with each other. In order for these aspirations to even begin to take shape, the proper AI must be implemented to ensure algorithms and interactions are as scalable and sustainable as possible. This will be especially important considering the number of languages spoken across the globe (there are more than 7,100).

If the metaverse aims to unite these worlds, how will it allow us to overcome language barriers? This is where conversational AI, speech recognition and self-supervised learning come into play. When providing a chatbot (or in this case, avatar) that needs to support thousands of languages, any conversational AI platform would need to train the avatars to recognize patterns of specific speech and language in order to respond effectively and efficiently to written and voice queries.

The future of the metaverse

Mark Zuckerberg referred to AI as the most important foundational technology of our time, believing that its power can unlock advancements in other fields, like VR, blockchain, AR and 5G.

With companies across all industries developing ways to monetize the metaverse, these industry giants are banking on it becoming the new (and all-encompassing) internet. Much like the internet boom in the 1990s, we just may look back at this moment and wonder how we ever survived without the metaverse.

In any universal shift of life, and especially when it comes to technology, it’s important to understand the foundational elements that build these integral parts of our lives. As technology becomes more and more integral in our lives, it’s important for users to truly understand the underpinnings of things like smartphones, computer programs and alternate digital universes.

Innovations like the metaverse would not be achievable without conversational AI, and as open source programs continue to develop, the adoption of this space will only grow.

As digitization continues to shape consumer behavior toward ecommerce businesses, consumers are increasingly demanding fast and convenient online shopping experiences. With more enterprises riding the digital transformation wave, positive customer experience (CX) is crucial to customer acquisition and improving sales.

In 2021, Vonage listed chatbots (40%) as the second most preferred communication channel for consumers. Shopify’s Future of Commerce Trend 2022 Report revealed 58% of consumers purchased from brands where they’ve experienced excellent CX. The report further showed more businesses (44%) plan to invest in asynchronous chat experiences to manage customer responses and are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) tools like chatbots to improve customer service.

However, while chatbots have become a critical part of the customer journey today, issues around personalization persist. Ohad Rozen, cofounder and CEO of chatbot provider, Tymely, believes that human supervision in its processes provides a solution that enables human-level personalizations.

The company, which today announced it raised $7 million to “make AI converse better,” claims it uses AI-human hybrid tech to enable brands to provide email and chat support services in a more human, empathetic and precise way.

Rozen told VentureBeat that in addition to Tymely’s cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) models, the company takes the human-in-the-loop approach to close the gap between today’s current technology stack and optimal customer service.

The rise and fall of chatbots

Chatbots are AI-powered programs that provide on-demand customer services — and unlike human customer services, chatbots are always available.

Although chatbots are fast and readily available, creating personalized messages is still a blocker. This is because of their inability to comprehend the nuanced industry-specific languages customers use. WATConsult’s 2021 research adds more weight to this stance, revealing the main blockers to using chatbots are lack of understanding (50%), inability to solve complex issues (47%), and lack of personal service experience (45%).

According to a report by Gartner, Chatbots’ self-service report is also statistically underwhelming. The report showed chatbots’ self-service solves only 9% of queries without a human touch. Besides, chatbots have limited use for customer engagements, and chatbots with poor customer service output are bad news for sales. For example, chatbots caused sales to decline by 80% in 2019.

Because of its limited customer service functionality, many companies are slow to adopt the technology. For instance, fashion retailer Everlane ditched the Facebook Messenger chatbot after it recorded high failure rates in 2017. Along those same lines, in 2018, Accenture reported that 53% of organizations “have no plans” to invest in chatbots.

Tymely intervention

Tymely claims its AI technology can create personalized messages. Launched in 2022, the company says that it’s building an AI that understands complex human language to improve CX. Unlike most chatbots and other fully automated solutions, Tymely claims it has a human-level understanding of the customers’ language, with its technology being a mix of people and AI.

Rozen also says the human touch is the answer to creating empathetic messages that regular chatbots lack.

“Tymely employs experts that review each AI input and, if needed, correct it in real-time. This results in human-level accuracy that enables us to understand tiny and implicit nuances in a customer’s text; a high-resolution understanding that also allows us to generate hyper-personalized and empathetic responses to customers, according to the brand’s voice and policy,” he said.

Rozen also noted that Tymely can improve the efficiency of contact centers because it’s fully digital, helping businesses save labor-head costs. He further noted that Tymely AI costs 50% to 80% less than outsourced contact centers. “And unlike contact centers, Tymley commits to SLA in minutes, not hours,” he added.

This new funding boost was led by venture capital firm Hetz Ventures and DESCOvery, the D. E. Shaw group’s venture studio. In a statement announcing the funding, Rozen revealed that Tymely plans to use the funding to “improve its natural language understanding (NLU) technology” for better service offerings.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

There is a growing need for artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge to help enable and support a variety of use cases, including medical, embedded and robotics.

At the Nvidia GTC conference today, the company announced a series of new hardware and software initiatives that span multiple industries, all designed to help accelerate the performance, capabilities and adoption of AI at the edge. Among the announcements is the launch of the Nvidia IGX platform — targeted at both industrial and medical use cases. The new platform includes the IGX Orin hardware, which is a small form factor AI optimized computing system. In addition to the new IGX Platform, Nvidia also announced the Jetson Orin Nano, as a high-powered small form factor device for edge AI in robotics.

“Combining imaging sensors with real-time, deep learning computer vision, we can bring robotics to healthcare,” Kimberly Powell, vice president and general manager for healthcare at Nvidia said during a press briefing.

The robot assisted doctor, will see you now

Powell explained that IGX includes the Orin robotics processor, Ampere tensor core GPU hardware, the ConnectX streaming I/O processor as well as a functional safety island and microcontroller unit. The safety features are particularly important, as Powell noted that more robots and humans will be working side by side in the same environments in the years to come.

The Nvidia Clara Holoscan AI platform sits on top of IGX for medical devices and imaging robotics pipelines that includes detection, segmentation and real-time visualization.

“Holoscan running on IGX gives the medical device industry a unified and commercial off the shelf platform for real time edge processing, saving huge amounts of hardware and platform engineering,” Powell said. ” Now medical devices can benefit from the same business model innovation as self-driving cars to be AI powered and become software defined.”

IGX for medical devices is already seeing some early traction from medical device manufacturers. At GTC, Nvidia announced that Activ Surgical will be using IGX for its next-generation platform that uses sensor technology to see beyond natural light to deliver real-time imaging and physical structure visualization to surgeons during the surgery.

Moon Surgical is adopting Clara Holoscan on IGX platform for its robotic assisted Maestro system that provides surgeons with enhanced sensory and assisted scope control.

Additionally, Proximie announced that it will be using IGX to help enable its operating room telepresence technology that delivering real-time remote surgeon collaboration.

Robotics AI is about more than robots

Nvidia is also using GTC as the venue to announce its newest version of the Jetson Orin Nano platform for robotics and edge AI.

The Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano.

Deepu Talla, vice president and general manager of embedded and edge computing at Nvidia, commented in a GTC press briefing that the first Jetson Nano was announced back in 2019 as an entry-level platform for AI and robotics. With the new Orin Nano update, he noted that there is a significant performance boost of up to 80 times over prior generations. The Jetson Orin Nano is based on the Nvidia Ampere architecture GPU and is set to be available in two different versions, including 4GB and 8GB versions.

The Jetson Orin Nano is intended to be a component of an overall approach to enabling edge AI robotics. The other components include Nvidia’s Isaac robot simulation platform as well as the software to run the actual robots, which increasingly is the open-source ROS (Robot Operating System). Talla said that Nvidia has been working with the ROS community over the past year and has made numerous code contributions that help to accelerate the software.

It’s important to note that what Nvidia refers to, broadly as robotics, is, in fact, a very large category of edge AI use cases.

“Typically, people think of robots as something that has arms and legs or wheels,” Talla said.

While that type of mobile robot does exist, Tall emphasized that there are plenty of stationary robots. Nvidia is defining robots as other autonomous devices that are also watching things and have the capability of understanding and interpreting their surroundings. That definition of edge AI robotics can include things like edge AI in a self-checkout, traffic analytics and even video conference.

“We’re not building robots ourselves, that’s not what we’re trying to do,” Talla said. ” We’re providing a platform to build the robots faster.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat
27,How the brain develops: A new way to shed light on cognition,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,20/09/2022,Researchers introduce a new neurocomputational model of the human brain that could bridge the gap in understanding AI and the biological mechanisms underlying mental disorders.,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/09/220920115627.htm,"A new study introduces a new neurocomputational model of the human brain that could shed light on how the brain develops complex cognitive abilities and advance neural artificial intelligence research. Published Sept. 19, the study was carried out by an international group of researchers from the Institut Pasteur and Sorbonne Université in Paris, the CHU Sainte-Justine, Mila -- Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, and Université de Montréal.

The model, which made the cover of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), describes neural development over three hierarchical levels of information processing:

the first sensorimotor level explores how the brain's inner activity learns patterns from perception and associates them with action;

the cognitive level examines how the brain contextually combines those patterns;

lastly, the conscious level considers how the brain dissociates from the outside world and manipulates learned patterns (via memory) no longer accessible to perception.

The team's research gives clues into the core mechanisms underlying cognition thanks to the model's focus on the interplay between two fundamental types of learning: Hebbian learning, which is associated with statistical regularity (i.e., repetition) -- or as neuropsychologist Donald Hebb has put it, ""neurons that fire together, wire together"" -- and reinforcement learning, associated with reward and the dopamine neurotransmitter.

The model solves three tasks of increasing complexity across those levels, from visual recognition to cognitive manipulation of conscious percepts. Each time, the team introduced a new core mechanism to enable it to progress.

The results highlight two fundamental mechanisms for the multilevel development of cognitive abilities in biological neural networks:

synaptic epigenesis, with Hebbian learning at the local scale and reinforcement learning at the global scale;

and self-organized dynamics, through spontaneous activity and balanced excitatory/inhibitory ratio of neurons.

""Our model demonstrates how the neuro-AI convergence highlights biological mechanisms and cognitive architectures that can fuel the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence and even ultimately lead to artificial consciousness,"" said team member Guillaume Dumas, an assistant professor of computational psychiatry at UdeM, and a principal investigator at the CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre.

Reaching this milestone may require integrating the social dimension of cognition, he added. The researchers are now looking at integrating biological and social dimensions at play in human cognition. The team has already pioneered the first simulation of two whole brains in interaction.

Anchoring future computational models in biological and social realities will not only continue to shed light on the core mechanisms underlying cognition, the team believes, but will also help provide a unique bridge to artificial intelligence towards the only known system with advanced social consciousness: the human brain.",artificial intelligence,science daily

Why it matters Thor could help carmakers sweep away a host of smaller processors handling everything from door locks, braking, navigation, entertainment and engine control with one centralized computer system that's easier to update.

Chip designer Nvidia on Tuesday revealed a new processor called Drive Thor it expects will power the autonomous vehicle revolution.

Thor processors should arrive in 2024 for cars hitting the roads in 2025, starting with an EV from Chinese carmaker Zeekr, said Danny Shapiro, vice president of Nvidia's automotive work. They're based on Nvidia's new Hopper graphics processing unit to better handle the artificial intelligence software that's key to self-driving cars.

""It absolutely will scale up to full autonomy,"" Shapiro said, referring to Level 4 or Level 5 self-driving abilities, in which cars can pilot themselves without human occupants paying attention or even present.

Nvidia had planned a chip called Atlan for 2024 but canceled it in favor of Thor, which handles AI software at 2 quadrillion operations per second -- twice the speed planned for Atlan and eight times that of its current Orin processor. Thor incorporates one key Hopper feature: the ability to accelerate a powerful AI technique called transformers. Nvidia also expects lower-end Thor variations for the less revolutionary driver-assist technologies like lane keeping and automatic emergency braking.

The automotive processor market is big and getting bigger as carmakers demand more and more processors and other semiconductor chips for driver assistance, infotainment, and the electronic control units that oversee everything from engine combustion to GPS navigation. Each Porsche Taycan has 8,000 semiconductor elements.

Chip designers are cashing in on the new market. Nvidia has $11 billion in automotive chip orders, and a top rival, Qualcomm, has $19 billion in automotive orders in the pipeline.

Also new at Nvidia's GTC

Among other Nvidia developments at its GTC event:

Its GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards

The Jetson Orin line of processors for robots now includes Nano models for smaller robots. They consume between 5 and 15 watts of power for better battery life, cost $199 and up, and start shipping in January. Newly announced companies using Jetson Orin include Canon, John Deere, Microsoft Azure, Teradyne and TK Elevator, Nvidia said.

The new new Nemo LLM technology is designed to help researchers get more use out of large language models, a hot new area in AI that's responsible for rapid advances in processing language, imagery and other data. Retraining an LLM consumes massive resources, but the Nemo technology lets researchers perform a much faster incremental AI training that customizes the big AI.

Thor automotive AI chip details

With 77 billion transistors, Thor will be massive, if not the biggest processor on the market. But it'll let automakers replace a heavier, more expensive and more power hungry collection of smaller chips, Nvidia says. In addition to using Hopper GPUs, it borrows CPU cores from Nvidia's 2023 Grace processor for conventional computing tasks. It also draws technology from Nvidia's newest GPU technology for gaming and design, the Ada Lovelace architecture.

The design will make it easier for carmakers to improve their car software with over-the-air updates, Huang said. Tesla has had a big technological lead in that technology for years.



Thor also will be used for robots and medical equipment, Huang said. And it will be able to run three operating systems simultaneously -- Linux, QNX, and Android -- for different parts of the car computing environment. Partitioning technology ensures the less important work, like infotainment, doesn't interrupt the crucial safety-related work, Nvidia said.

With autonomous vehicles, promised for years but still only in testing, those chips become even more important.

""The industry has recognized that it's a much more complex task than initially thought,"" Shapiro said of autonomous vehicles. ""With safety being paramount, nobody is ready to release these vehicles into the wild until there's more compute.""

Correction, 11:30 p.m. PT: This story incorrectly described the first car that's expected to use Nvidia's Thor processor. It will be used in an electric vehicle Zeekr plans to produce, which is due to arrive in 2025.",artificial intelligence,cnet

First, there's extensive lab research. Then, animal testing. But before a medicine can be approved for use, it must be tested on humans – in an expensive, complex process known as a clinical trial.

The Basics

In its simplest form, a clinical trial goes something like this: Researchers recruit patients who have the disease that the experimental drug is aimed at. Volunteers are randomly divided into two groups. One group gets the experimental drug; the other, called the control group, gets a placebo (a treatment that appears identical to the drug being tested, but has no effect). If the patients who get the active drug show more improvement than the ones who get the placebo, that’s evidence that the drug is effective.

One of the most challenging parts of designing a trial is finding enough volunteers who meet the exact criteria for the study. Doctors may not know about trials that might fit their patients, and patients who are willing to enroll may not have the characteristics needed for a given trial. But artificial intelligence might make that job a lot easier.",artificial intelligence,webmd

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/09/15/cyberlink-powerdirector-update-adds-new-ai-photo-and-video-editing-tools/,"CyberLink has announced an update to PowerDirector, its multimedia editing suite, that it says brings even more artificial intelligence (AI) assisted tools and templates, making it easier for creatives to access advanced editing.

The Taiwan-based company which developed and owns over 200 patented technologies centering around multimedia software and AI facial recognition says that the creative suite, (which includes PowerDirector, PhotoDirector, AudioDirector, and ColorDirector) has been updated to include several new smart-assist tools, studio-quality effects, and enhanced precision controls that pair with updated templates and guided edits to allow users from beginner to advanced professionals “to accomplish even the most intricate tasks in just a few clicks.” The company positions itself as Adobe’s prime competitor.

Cyberlink’s flagship video editing suite, PowerDirector, has been enhanced with several AI-powered tools like AI Video Object Detection which can track moving people or objects and separate them from their backgrounds without a greenscreen automatically, AI Motion Tracking which adds “attention-grabbing” text or graphics that can follow objects or people, and access to over 7,000 templates for easy project assembly.

The two versions of the software — PowerDirector and PowerDirector 365 Business — feature more than 7,000 video intro templates designed by the company’s “community of creatives.”

PowerDirector Business now has over 10,000 templates the company says can be applied with what the company characterizes as an easy three-step process, allowing individuals and design agencies to create social media posts quickly.

PhotoDirector, CyberLink’s photo editing application, sees a significant number of improvements and enhancements, starting with the addition of “AI-Based updates.”

AI Denoise, AI Sky Replacements, and AI Object Removal provide automatic editing for some of the most common photographic issues. The tool’s Bokeh Effects have been updated to allow users to control the focal point used by the effect. The company also announced updates to PhotoDirector, delivering AI-driven tools the company says let users fix photos in a few clicks.

In addition to these features, PhotoDirector also includes a new Bokeh Effects feature allowing users to control the focal point and AI will then automatically adjust the effects depth and distance to create a “pleasing visual to match any artistic vision”.

The update also includes several new “fun” features like the AI Anime Face and Cartoon Tool that can turn any person’s portrait instantly into an animated classic cartoon character style.

AudioDirector, CyberLink’s audio editing tool, has received UI updates and features and a new EQ Match tool, designed automatically balance audio between different clips created with different microphones. The company also announced AudioDirector Online, a free and browser-based version of AudioDirector featuring many of the program’s essential tools without cost.

Finally, the company says that its color editing tool ColorDirector has seen updates to effects and to AI Motion Tracking, which they say provides precision color grading on objects as they move across a scene.

All flavors of PowerDirector include NVIDIA Broadcast support, and Intel Hyper Encode support is said to increase production speed by 1.5x.

31,2 Artificial-Intelligence Growth Stocks Shaping the Future of Technology,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/700387/artificial-intelligence-1.jpg,16/09/2022,These innovative companies could make patient shareholders richer in the long run.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/16/2-growth-stocks-shaping-the-future-of-technology/,"Innovative technologies have regularly reshaped the world. In the last few decades, inventions like the personal computer, the internet, and the smartphone have dramatically enhanced human productivity, while creating tremendous wealth in the process.

And artificial intelligence (AI) promises to be the next transformative technology. In fact, research company McKinsey estimates that AI could boost global economic output by 16% (or $13 trillion) between 2018 and 2030.

Companies like Nvidia (NVDA -6.13%) and Lemonade (LMND -9.10%) could be major beneficiaries of that trend because both are using AI to shape the future of technology.

1. Nvidia: The gold standard in AI infrastructure

In 1999, Nvidia invented a graphics processing unit (GPU) that revolutionized the gaming and entertainment industries with its ability to render realistic computer graphics. But GPUs have also become the accelerators of choice for complex data-center workloads such as scientific computing and AI. Today, Nvidia holds over 90% market share in supercomputer accelerators, and its technology has become the gold standard in AI.

Forrester Research recently said Nvidia GPUs are synonymous with AI infrastructure, and Nvidia has consistently achieved top results in the MLPerf benchmarks, a series of tests designed to measure the performance of AI technologies.

That success stems from its evolution from chipmaker to full-stack computing company; Nvidia has augmented its hardware with a growing library of subscription software and developer kits that streamline the creation of AI applications for uses like genomic sequencing, speech recognition, robotics, and self-driving cars.

The company stumbled in its most recent quarter. Revenue rose just 3% to $6.7 billion, and non-GAAP earnings plunged 51% to $0.51 per diluted share, as high inflation caused a significant decline in demand for gaming chips.

But those headwinds are temporary, and Nvidia AI is shaping the future of several industries. Among other applications, it helps fintech companies stop fraud, manufacturers detect product defects, healthcare providers analyze medical images, and social media platforms drive engagement.

Nvidia puts its addressable market at $1 trillion, and the company should benefit greatly as AI continues to reshape the world. With shares trading at 12.3 times sales -- a bargain compared to its three-year average multiple of 20.3 -- now looks like a good time to buy this AI growth stock.

2. Lemonade: AI-powered insurance

Lemonade brings AI to the insurance industry in a quest to reduce friction and lower prices for consumers. Whereas traditional insurers use agents to sell policies and process claims, Lemonade handles that with AI-powered chatbots. That simplifies the sign-up process for consumers and reduces payroll expenses for the company.

More importantly, those chatbots can collect about 100 times more data per customer than traditional insurance forms. Lemonade uses that data in its AI engine, which quantifies risk and underwrites insurance policies. Eventually, that data advantage should allow the company to price policies more precisely than its rivals, meaning Lemonade should eventually achieve a loss ratio (i.e. claims payments as a percentage of premiums) below the industry average.

That has not happened yet. Lemonade posted a loss ratio of 86% in the second quarter, much higher than the property- and casualty-insurance industry average of 72.5% last year. But part of Lemonade's strategy is bearing fruit. It surpassed 1 million customers just five years after its launch, which is approximately two decades faster than rivals like Allstate, State Farm, and Geico. So its digitally-native business model is clearly delighting customers.

Building on that, Lemonade saw its average premium rise 18% to $290 in the second quarter, and its retention rate improved 100 basis points to 83%. That translated into relatively strong top-line growth, as gross profit climbed 15% to $11.3 million. However, Lemonade is still investing aggressively in scaling up its business, and it reported a widening net loss of $68 million in the quarter.

Investors still have reason to be bullish in spite of that sizable loss. Most notably, Lemonade recently acquired Metromile, accelerating its expansion into car insurance. That deal will supercharge its AI engine with billions of driving miles worth of telematic driving data gathered from Metromile customers.

Lemonade estimates that car insurance adds $300 billion to its U.S. market opportunity, bringing the total to $400 billion. It also creates a significant cross-sell opportunity, since Lemonade estimates that current customers already spend $1 billion on car insurance per year.

Anyone who has recently purchased insurance or filed a claim would probably agree that the insurance business is in need of disruption, and Lemonade's AI-powered business model has disruptive written all over it. That's why risk-tolerant investors should consider buying this growth stock.",artificial intelligence,motley fool

Characters in video games have needs and make decisions. You would probably agree that they are not sentient. And yet they are more sentient than LaMDA. They are at least on the path toward what we may one day consider A.I. sentience. Bots that scrape the internet for responses are not.

Bethesda Codsworth liked that.

Lemoine did not design LaMDA, he just chatted with it, so despite his credentials, he has no insight into its inner workings. Someone can see a video and swear they witnessed sentience, but their testimony means nothing—the person who originally said the words was sentient, but the recording is not. Other scientists who also chatted with LaMDA say it’s not sentient. Scientists inside and outside Google have warned of the very real danger of people wrongly perceiving A.I. as sentient, and Lemoine’s story is an example of that. Still an interesting story, but it’s not the story of an A.I. turning sentient and the silencing of a whistleblower (Google fired him for violating data security policies, and his firing has not silenced him).

Every other scientist who looks at LaMDA says it’s not sentient. Most notably, the original Washington Post story that shared Lemoine’s fears with the world talked to various other scientists, and they all said LaMDA isn’t sentient. The reporter herself concluded that LaMDA isn’t sentient, and the article reflects this. For this reason, scientists debunking Lemoine’s claims also call out the Post as unethical for choosing the headline “The Google engineer who thinks the company’s AI has come to life.”

Forget tech ethics, let’s talk clickbait ethics. If we approached the story with the same angle that the reporter did, our headline would have called Lemoine “The bonkers Google engineer who thinks the company’s A.I. has come to life.” The Post probably has rules against that kind of language, but at least that would have told you what sort of info to expect.",artificial intelligence,cracked.com

According to the company, Topaz Ph…",https://www.diyphotography.net/topaz-photo-ai-launches-today-with-all-its-auto-image-tools-in-one-program/,"Topaz Labs has launched its new program Photo AI which combines all of its most popular image tools under one umbrella. The image editing tools automatically detect and fix image quality issues using Artificial Intelligence.

According to the company, Topaz Photo AI will help photographers maximize image quality faster and more accurately than ever before. It does this by pairing its extensively trained AI models and deep learning capabilities with what it calls its Autopilot inspector resulting in improved RAW workflow options.

“Getting a clean, crisp, and high-resolution photo is really important, but the current process of increasing image quality is quite slow and error-prone. To solve this, we’ve built Topaz Photo AI to be an autopilot for image quality. It detects the unique problems in your image and intelligently applies the correct methods to maximize resolution, detail, and clarity,” says Eric Yang, CEO of Topaz Labs.

Up until now, Topaz Labs offered three separate programs for fixing common image issues. It offered DeNoise AI for removing noise, Sharpen AI for deblurring soft-focus images, and Gigapixel AI for upscaling low-resolution images. However, images often had more than one problem that needed addressing, so they combined all of them into one editor that can detect which problems need resolving.

“With Topaz Photo AI, we want to make the entire process of identifying those core image quality issues and applying the most appropriate remedies automatic and transparent. That process is exactly what we set out to build for Topaz Photo AI,” says Partha Acharjee, Topaz Labs Sr. Research Engineer.

With Topaz Photo AI’s Autopilot, the company is taking it a step further by automatically analyzing users’ photos and applying the right models and settings. The company hopes that this will free photographers up to apply the creative edits that make their photos uniquely theirs. “That’s something that no AI model can ever replace,” the company emphasises.

Autopilot works by analysing each image. First, Autopilot detects noise and soft focus issues throughout the entire image. Images may suffer from luminance noise, colour noise, or mixed noise, as well as motion blur or lens blur during capture. The software works out which specific denoise and sharpen models to use, and applies automatic strength settings.

The next step in the process sees Autopilot automatically detecting all faces in the image and distinguishing low-quality faces from high-quality ones. Based on this face detection, Autopilot will automatically apply face enhancement to all detected low-quality faces.

The final step has Autopilot detecting salient objects. Based on the sharpness of the subject, Autopilot may apply sharpening to it, allowing it to be more pronounced against the rest of the image.

Photo AI is designed to fit into a variety of workflows, from RAW or JPEG to Lightroom or Capture One. The company promises that it will operate much more smoothly and with better overall integration than Topaz Lab’s previous apps.

Topaz Photo AI is available today for $199 directly from the company’s website for both Windows and Mac computers. There is currently a $40 discount if you buy before October 7th 2022.",artificial intelligence,diyphotography
34,Is C3.ai Stock a Buy Now?,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/700610/brain-connected-to-the-cloud.jpg,15/09/2022,Is this one of the best artificial intelligence plays on the market?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/15/is-c3ai-stock-a-buy-now/,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more prevalent in society as it gets used by more and more businesses. C3.ai (AI -3.78%) is helping promote that by putting enterprise artificial intelligence platforms at its clients' fingertips.

However, C3.ai has had a rough go on the public markets. Since it went public in late 2020, its shares are down more than 83%. Does this make this artificial intelligence company a value trap or an appealing investment trading at a massive discount?

A unique artificial intelligence play

C3.ai makes enterprise AI more accessible by creating applications for companies and industries that have previously been slow to embrace AI. It has tools for industries ranging from oil and gas to the defense sector. One possible reason businesses in these arenas haven't adopted AI at scale yet is because it's difficult to hire the talent to develop AI engines in-house -- as young people developing AI might prefer to work at a glossy new start-up rather than an oil producer. C3.ai offers those older companies a solution to this challenge.

Largely, it has worked. The company had 228 customers as of the end of its fiscal Q1 (which ended July 31), up 27% year over year. Among them are stable giants such as Shell (SHEL -3.18%) and agencies within the U.S. government.

According to Forrester, C3.ai is a leader in the enterprise AI space, and considering how far the demand for artificial intelligence could soar over the long haul, the company could potentially be much larger a decade from now.

A few things causing C3.ai to slip up

That said, there are many reasons for potential investors to be concerned about this business. First, its growth is slowing dramatically. In its fiscal Q1, revenue increased only 25% on a year-over-year basis, which was a slower rate than it had seen over the prior few quarters. Additionally, management is expecting little additional expansion for the rest of the fiscal year. Its full-year guidance projects a revenue increase of just 1% to 7%, and its fiscal Q2 guidance implies just 3% to 6% revenue growth.

The company is also making a strange pivot: It is moving away from its traditional subscription model to a consumption-based model. While there are benefits and drawbacks to each model, the timing of this is concerning. After all, deciding to operate a subscription or consumption-based business is something a company determines early in its lifecycle, not as a $1.7 billion company -- and especially not after it has operated a subscription service for years.

The last concern is C3.ai's lack of profitability. In its fiscal Q1, it lost $71.9 million -- more than it generated in revenue. Additionally, C3.ai had a free cash flow burn of almost $55 million, giving it a free cash flow burn margin of 84%.

Management noted that it is planning to cut back on expenses to get the company on course to profitability, mainly by slimming down significantly on costs that don't directly impact revenue growth. But if management is talking the talk, the financials aren't backing it up. These problems are getting magnified as revenue slows and expenses continue to soar, and while the company is trying to take steps in the right direction, they might not be the right steps.

Is C3.ai stock a buy now?

With its shares down so much, C3.ai now trades at a rock-bottom valuation -- just 6 times sales. That's historically low for the company and below other AI and data analytics stocks.

That said, it might be wise for investors to stay away from C3.ai for the time being. Its valuation might be cheap, but that's for a reason: The company is in a tough spot right now as adoption of its services is slowing and its expenses continue to rocket higher. While C3.ai has a lucrative opportunity ahead of it, it isn't capitalizing on it. Given the strange decision to shift its pricing model, investors should also be worried about management's clear vision (or lack thereof) for the company.

While C3.ai certainly looks appealing at its current valuation, it's also facing an uncomfortable amount of uncertainty during this strategy shift. It might be wiser to watch this stock from the sidelines.",artificial intelligence,motley fool

AI could rise up one day

Image source: AndSus / Adobe

AI is impressive. It can simulate Val Kilmer’s voice in movies and has helped researchers solve complex problems multiple times. Now, though, researchers posit that the threat of AI is greater than we ever thought.

The researchers published their findings at the end of August. According to the paper, the threat of AI could change based on a set of conditions the researchers have identified. This isn’t the first time researchers have viewed AI as a possible threat, either. But the new paper is intriguing because of the plausible assumptions that it looks at.

Chief among these assumptions, the researchers believe that “AIs intervening in the provision of their rewards would have consequences that are very bad,” Michael Cohen, one of the authors on the paper, tweeted this month. Cohen says the conditions the researchers identified show that the possibility of a threatening conclusion is stronger than in any previous publication.

Additionally, the team says that the threat of AI is building based on an existential catastrophe. And that this is not just possible, it’s very likely. One of the biggest problems, Cohen and his fellow researchers note, is that more energy can always be put towards a problem to bring it up to the point where the AI is rewarded for what it has done. As such, it could put us at odds with the machines.

Under the conditions we have identified, our conclusion is much stronger than that of any previous publication—an existential catastrophe is not just possible, but likely. 3/15 — Michael Cohen (@Michael05156007) September 6, 2022

“The short version,” Cohen writes in his Twitter thread, “is that more energy can always be employed to raise the probability that the camera sees the number 1 forever, but we need some energy to grow food. This pus us in unavoidable competition with a much more advanced agent.” With that in mind, it sounds as if the threat of AI could change based on how it is taught.

The number that Cohen is referring to here is based on a test to force the AI agent to reach a certain number. And, once it has been shown a way to do that, it could use more energy to optimize reaching that goal. It’s an intriguing proposition and one that shows why so many are worried about the threat of AI.

Obviously, the examples provided in the paper aren’t the only possible outcomes. And, perhaps we could find a way to keep the machines in check. But, this new research does raise some questions about just how much we want to trust AI going forward, and how we could control it if an existential catastrophe were to strike.",artificial intelligence,bgr

Data is the lifeblood of any organization. When it flows freely, businesses can grow, win new customers and prepare for the future. When it's constrained, stagnation sets in. Time and money are wasted, and emerging opportunities are missed.

For too many companies, critical data is locked on a printed page, stored in a box or sitting on someone's desk who is out of the office. It's difficult to get that information flowing without scores of people to rekey it into an electronic format so that it can be more easily shared, analyzed, processed and acted upon.

These outdated practices are driving the adoption of intelligent document management.

Why traditional document management falls short

Document management has been around for a while. It generally refers to scanning all the pieces of paper in an office to understand what a company has so it can decide what to keep and develop a system of indexing that enables other employees to retrieve information.

Previously, companies manually indexed documents, meaning a human would look at a piece of paper, hone in on the vendor name and the account number, and key it into a database. Advancements then used optical character recognition (OCR) to aid in indexing. That is when software tries to figure out what each character is, for example, a machine reading six digits in an invoice and coming up with the number 123456. The trouble is that a ""6"" also looks like a ""b,"" so OCR is not highly accurate.

Traditional document management falls short in an important way: Information is only useful when inserted into workflows. This is where intelligent document management comes into play, and it's critical to digital transformation.

Intelligent document management is more than a better way to scan documents because it enables information management. Thanks to its ""intelligence,"" intelligent document management offers automated classification, routing, measurement, monitoring and multi-channel information management fueled by artificial intelligence (AI).

Auto-classification means that scanners deploy AI to make intelligent decisions about what a page contains (e.g., recognize a bill of lading vs. an invoice) and categorize it.

Next, following the company's internal workflows, it routes the electronic version of the document to the correct person based on a combination of roles and rules (e.g., Mary, the Comptroller, must approve all invoices over $10,000, while invoices less than $5,000 go to Fred). Approvals can co-occur or follow a strict, sequential order.

Monitoring is essential. What if Mary is away on vacation for two weeks, and that invoice must be paid? An intelligent document management tool has timers, recognizing when a deadline is approaching and notifying and rerouting the document to a designated person so it can be handled. It also monitors the overall process and reports it to management.

Finally, intelligent document management supports multi-channel information — whether a piece of paper from a vendor or a bill of lading generated from an order management system. AI ensures data is gleaned correctly and routed through the proper workflows.

With intelligent document management, roughly 90% of a document's processing is handled by computer — decreasing administrative time, eliminating human error and saving money.

Getting started with intelligent document management

We believe the first step for intelligent document management is to fully document the current workflow by someone with information-management experience, not just IT experience. This is called a Business Process Analysis (BPA), and a solid grasp of how business is conducted is essential. Additionally, having experience rolling out future enterprise content management (ECM) initiatives within a Finance Department, HR Department, etc., is crucial if you want the final result to be a tenable solution that does what you need.

Then you need to decide what to digitize. Most organizations store more documents than they need. This scenario can lead to unnecessary risk, given emerging privacy laws and requirements protecting specific information types.

A document audit is required before digitization even starts. For instance, is a document, such as an employee contract, within its retention requirements, or are you no longer needed to keep it? If the latter, it's probably better to destroy that document. Another consideration: Every page scanned costs money, so an audit will drive cost efficiency.

Next, you'll need to develop a content roadmap for filing documents so that current and future employees can easily retrieve information. You have a photo of the Statue of Liberty. How should it be classified as a statue, national icon, New York City tourist attraction or gift from France?

You want to choose a vendor that works with you to guarantee successful outcomes and eliminates the risk of you making the wrong technology investments. Too often, companies underestimate the level of effort and complexity of a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach.

Many capture systems offer similar capabilities, but your experience with them may be highly influenced by the vendor. Is the vendor willing to do the critical document audit for you? Is the vendor willing to do the painstaking work of documenting your workflows so that the system lives up to its true potential? Does the vendor offer Service Level Agreements (SLAs), enabling you to hold the company accountable?

Getting the right solution at the right cost is key in any consideration. Intelligent document management providers charge money for an up-front analysis that highly trained, certified experts perform. A monthly subscription fee follows this to use the platform and a customization fee to implement your specific requirements. If you want to add more files to the system, there are fees to scan, extract and index those.

If the analysis is performed properly, you will know what it costs you now, where your bottlenecks are, where your risks and efficiencies are and what it will cost to improve. The BPA provides a quantitative pay-back period that allows you to make a heads-up decision based on facts.

Converting to an intelligent document management system will deliver immediate returns on investment and pay dividends well into the future. Mapping all incoming information to your unique workflows so that it can be processed with the minimal manual intervention will do more than save you time and money, however. It will ensure your company has the agility it needs to thrive in a fast-paced economy.",artificial intelligence,entrepreneur

On the first anniversary of the Aukus pact, Marles said nuclear subs would make “the rest of the world take us seriously”, linking the cutting-edge technology to Australia’s economic and trade success.

“The optimal pathway is taking shape. We can now begin to see it,” he said. “With Aukus there’s a really huge opportunity beyond submarines of pursuing a greater and more ambitious agenda.”

The former prime minister Scott Morrison announced the Aukus pact, a military agreement between Australia, the UK and the US, on 15 September 2021. A cornerstone of that arrangement, which also includes cooperation on quantum computing and cyberwarfare, is Australia’s acquisition of closely guarded technology to build nuclear submarines.

Marles, also the deputy prime minister, said the first steps toward acquisition of nuclear submarines were on track. In a briefing call with journalists this week, he said the current timeline had Australia slated to make initial announcements in the first part of 2023.

The government plans to give answers to five questions by that time: the final design; when it can be acquired; what capability gap that timeline will create and solutions to plug it; the cost; and how Australia’s plans comply with nuclear non-proliferation obligations.

The government is said to be choosing between building American or British ships, or some hybrid. Marles said the government was not ready to announce which type of submarines would be built but hinted Australia’s design could be “trilateral” in nature.

“It’s obviously much better if you are operating a platform which other countries operate as there is a shared experience and a shared industrial base to sustain it,” he said. “While the outcome is yet to be determined, it would be better if we’re in a position where what we’re doing is genuinely a trilateral effort.”

In a press conference with Marles in the UK earlier this month, the British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said future submarine designs may see a combination of British, American and Australian components.

“We are on to our next design and our new one and that might well be fully shared with all three nations as a collaborative design,” he said.

The cost of the submarine program is not yet known but is expected to be in the tens of billions. Marles linked the Aukus arrangement not only to military but economic security, saying a boosted submarine fleet would protect freedom of navigation through vital shipping routes.

“We need a highly capable defence force which has the rest of the world take us seriously and enables us to do all the normal peaceful activities that are so important for our economy,” he said.

“Trade is fundamental to that and, therefore, making sure that we are able to have freedom of navigation of the seas and of the air above them is really central to our economy.”

V Adm Jonathan Mead, the chair of the nuclear submarine taskforce, also spoke of protecting “sea lanes” on the call.

Mead said the navy was investigating workforce challenges, such as how to build and crew the ships – which may involve placing Australian staff in British and American nuclear schools or agencies, laboratories and shipyards

“The exchange of these personnel will be both ways and won’t just involve our submariners,” he said.

Facilities to build and maintain the submarines in Australia are part of the equation. Defence this year pinpointed Brisbane, Newcastle and Port Kembla as possible sites for an east coast nuclear base and consultation with those communities is said to be in its early stages.

Marles also spoke of building Australia’s defence-industrial capability on the back of the nuclear process.

“It’s really clear that we will have to develop the capacity in Australia to build nuclear-powered submarines,” Marles said.

“If we were to rely solely on the US and the UK, it will be a while before we get them. That is why in terms of getting these submarines sooner, we need to develop our own contribution to an industrial base here at home. The benefits of doing so get us this capability sooner but also provides economic benefits in terms of workforce and productivity.

“We hope Aukus can help develop a genuinely seamless defence industrial base across the US, the UK and Australia.”

A report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (Aspi), released on Thursday, recommended further investment in other Aukus streams like hypersonic missiles and artificial intelligence technology, to help plug a capability gap while the submarines are built.

“It’s important that Aukus not only makes progress but also retains its focus on new capabilities that can be acquired rapidly and will significantly boost deterrence,” the defence thinktank said.

“This is necessary to ensure that the Australian Defence Force can shape, deter and respond to likely challenges in the region.”

Such short-term investment may force government to make “difficult choices and trade-offs” in its defence strategic review, also slated for March, Aspi said.",artificial intelligence,the guardian

is a growing force in the modern economy. While the popularity of online shopping was growing prior to 2020, the recent pandemic accelerated that growth exponentially. It is estimated that through 2020-2021, an additional $218.53 billion was added to ecommerce sales just in the United States due to the pandemic.

In 2021 alone, ecommerce sales by United States sellers reached a total of $870.78 billion. This was a number that economists predicted would not be possible until 2023. In total, almost $4.9 trillion was spent worldwide on ecommerce in 2021.

Ecommerce continues to prove to be a lucrative and vital part of the future economy, but sectors are already being impacted by the juggernaut differently. By understanding the trends of today and seeing where they are headed, you can better prepare yourself and your business for future success in ecommerce.

Ecommerce, Mcommerce and analytic AI

The most important trend in ecommerce today is the increasing number of people engaging in online shopping. More engagement means more potential customers and a more diverse base of customers with unique interests and needs. This creates a lot of opportunities for brands and companies looking to engage with ecommerce for the first time or reinvigorate their efforts.

Brand loyalty has decreased since the pandemic, driven partially by product scarcity, and consumers are now more willing than before to try new products and services. This is primarily in the consumer-packaged goods market, where customers are more inclined to take chances on fresh food and beverage brands. This is further supported, however, by a general rise in the number of people using e-commerce to purchase groceries, with some the sector seeing the equivalent of five years of growth within a five-month span.

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the shopping experience for users has also become an integral part of smart ecommerce strategies. By buying and collecting data, companies can tailor the shopping experience to individual users, providing them with product suggestions that meet their preferences and shopping history. The ever-improving analytical abilities of AI, as well as its growing ubiquity, have made this task even more manageable and more accessible to companies willing to invest in the technology.

Furthermore, mcommerce is another significant trend for businesses to pick up on. Referred to as mobile commerce or social commerce, mcommerce is the use of social media platforms to advertise and sell products. This is a subset of ecommerce and has been growing in popularity alongside social media itself.

Facebook and Twitter have both integrated ways for businesses to sell their products. In the United States, it has been reported that almost 40% of 2020 ecommerce sales were generated through mobile purchases.

Trending upward despite setbacks

As mentioned above, the grocery sector has been a major beneficiary of ecommerce's growing popularity. Alongside that, the sale of recreational goods and home furnishings also increased during the pandemic, receiving a welcome bump via e-commerce transactions. Still, there are some doubts these sectors will continue to trend upward after the pandemic. However, these companies might still benefit from ecommerce in surprising ways. Home Depot, a popular home improvement chain, has seen success with its ""rent online, pick up in store"" program.

The medical sector is also seeing benefits from ecommerce. The popularity of mobile applications and websites has been transformative for telemedicine and medical consultations. Companies offering medical products with rapid delivery times have also seen success using e-commerce to reach and provide for those suffering from mobility issues. In some cases, patients no longer have to leave their homes to receive medicine or medical products.

One of the greatest beneficiaries of ecommerce's growth, however, has been small businesses. With the cost and technical know-how of maintaining online stores falling, startups and small businesses can effectively run a web store with global outreach.

Competition from small beginnings

The importance of ecommerce to the global economy is undeniable, as is the need for companies to adapt to its trends to maintain customer support and reach new heights of success. While large companies benefit from new technologies, one benefit of modern ecommerce is its force as an equalizer. Start-ups, small businesses, online mom-and-pop shops — they're all gaining a competitive advantage that simply wasn't feasible a decade ago.

The low barriers to entry and affordable operating costs make online stores and the tools of ecommerce accessible to nearly anyone. If you have an understanding of the market and its trends, you may have a formula for success.",artificial intelligence,entrepreneur
43,1 Stock Headed for a Chip-Wreck Right Now,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/providers/stocknews/hero-image-stocknews-435761.jpeg,21/09/2022,Last few weeks have been difficult for NVIDIA (NVDA) as it reported a significant fall in its graphics segment revenue in the last quarter due to a slowdown in GPU...,https://stocknews.com/news/nvda-stm-xper-umc-1-stock-headed-for-a-chip-wreck-right-now/,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) provides graphics, computing, and networking solutions. The company’s segments include Graphics and Compute & Networking.

The Graphics segment includes GeForce graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and PCs. The Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; cryptocurrency mining processors; Jetson for robotics, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise.

NVDA has provided weaker-than-expected guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. It expects revenues of $5.90 billion, plus or minus $118 million, which means a nearly 12% sequential decrease. NVDA’s revenue guidance of $5.90 billion was also below the consensus estimate.

The company faced a significant decline in its graphics segment business, which led to a fall in revenue and gross margins in the last reported quarter. Falling demand for GPUs and pricing power led to the segment reporting a 44% sequential drop. A slowdown in GPU sales has been due to a decline in cryptocurrency mining and falling PC demand that has affected GPU pricing.

Earlier this month, the company reported that the U.S. government had imposed new export restrictions on two of its most advanced AI chips, namely Nvidia A100 and H100 graphic processing units, to China. The latest tech sanctions are going to have an adverse effect on its revenue as China is its second-largest market. The revenue hit is expected to be $400 in the current quarter.

According to a report, there could be a buffer period before the ban kicks in, which is why the company is pushing the production of the chips in question in order to sell them. This could help mitigate the revenue impact in the current quarter up to a certain extent.

NVDA’s shares have declined 55.2% in price year-to-date and 37.6% over the past year to close the last trading session at $131.76. It is trading 62% below its 52-week high of $346.47, which it hit on November 22, 2021.

Here’s what could influence NVDA’s performance in the upcoming months:

Disappointing Financials

NVDA’s non-GAAP gross profit declined 29.1% year-over-year to $3.07 billion for the second quarter ended July 31, 2022. Its non-GAAP operating expenses increased 38.1% year-over-year to $1.75 billion. The company’s non-GAAP net income fell 50.7% year-over-year to $1.29 billion. In addition, its non-GAAP EPS decreased 51% year-over-year to $0.51.

Mixed Analyst Estimates

NVDA’s revenue for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 is expected to increase 0.7% and 16.6% year-over-year to $27.10 billion and $31.61 billion. Its EPS for fiscal 2023 is expected to decline 23.7% year-over-year to $3.39. However, its EPS for fiscal 2024 is expected to increase 34.8% year-over-year to $4.56.

Stretched Valuation

In terms of forward EV/S, NVDA’s 12.09x is 374.4% higher than the 2.55x industry average. Likewise, its 12.09x forward P/S is 380.8% higher than the 2.51x industry average. Its 51.45x EV/EBITDA is 321.3% higher than the 12.21x industry average.

POWR Ratings Reflect Bleak Prospects

NVDA has an overall D rating, equating to Sell in our POWR Ratings system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by considering 118 distinct factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.

Our proprietary rating system also evaluates each stock based on eight distinct categories. NVDA has a D grade for Value, in sync with its stretched valuation.

It has a D grade for Stability, consistent with its 1.69 beta.

NVDA is ranked #77 out of 93 stocks in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry. Click here to access NVDA’s ratings for Growth, Momentum, Sentiment, and Quality.

Bottom Line

Falling demand and inventory pileup of GPUs are expected to affect NVDA’s revenues in the upcoming quarters. In addition, the U.S. government’s export ban on two of its AI chips to China is expected to significantly hamper its revenues and earnings as China happens to be its second-largest market.

Given its disappointing financials and stretched valuation, it could be wise to avoid the stock now.

How Does NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Stack Up Against Its Peers?

NVDA has an overall POWR Rating of D, equating to a Sell rating. Therefore, one might want to consider investing in other Semiconductor & Wireless Chip stocks with an A (Strong Buy) or B (Buy) rating, such as STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM), Xperi Holding Corporation (XPER), and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC).

NVDA shares were trading at $133.98 per share on Wednesday morning, up $2.22 (+1.68%). Year-to-date, NVDA has declined -54.41%, versus a -17.76% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

MONTREAL — For some they may sound silly, while others find them dreamy. Sex robots are still very much a niche field at the moment. Yet these life-size, life-like machines powered by artificial intelligence are only going to become more and more realistic. Who on Earth would open to using a sex robot? New research out of Concordia University investigates the specific personality traits of people who say they are (and are not) willing to engage with these erotic technologies.

The study finds two traits, erotophilia and sexual sensation-seeking, best predict openness to such erotic technologies. Erotophilia refers to the association sex with positive feelings.

According to lead researcher Simon Dubé, if the sex robot market is going to expand and become more commonplace, it’s essential for involved stakeholders to better understand their target audience. What makes someone interested in artificial love? Conversely, which personality traits are associated with avoiding such technologies?

“It’s extremely important to understand who the first users are and where the initial demand is coming from,” Dubé, a former Concordia Public Scholar who completed his PhD this summer, says in a university release. “The companies that make them need to know in order to adjust and develop these technologies.”

These findings are based on data collected among nearly 500 adults via an online survey that asked about views toward sex robots. To start, respondents’ personalities were assessed using a validated measure of the Big Five, which is a standard model including the overarching traits openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and extraversion.

“Personality assessments help us predict people’s likely thoughts, emotions and behaviors across all kinds of situations, including those regarding their sexuality — and in this case, their willingness to engage with new erotic technologies such as sex robots,” adds Dubé, who will be pursuing his studies as a postdoctoral fellow at the Kinsey Institute in Indiana this fall.

However, Dubé and his team also recognized that these categories may be too broad. So, they added a model addressing respondents’ attitudes toward sex and technology. This model also featured an important value that measured both positive attitudes toward newness and a desire to have new erotic experiences. This allowed study authors to assess traits related to erotophilia/phobia, or positive/negative attitudes regarding sex, traits linked to technophilia/phobia, or positive/negative attitudes regarding technology, and traits linked to sexual sensation–seeking.

Men more prone to using sex robots

Results indicate the Big Five are only minimally correlated with willingness to engage with a sex robot. Dubé notes this was expected, considering the wide breadth of each category. That being said, when researchers focused on traits more closely linked to the specific subject of sex robots, the story changed. “We found that erotophilia and sexual sensation–seeking, as well as an enthusiasm for new, diverse or more intense erotic experiences, were the primary drivers behind people’s willingness to engage with these new technologies,” Dubé explains. “Technophilia and non-sexual sensation–seeking were also correlated, but only weakly.”

It’s also worth noting that across the board, men appear more interested in sex robots than women. Meanwhile, subjects who identified as gender nonconforming or nonbinary exhibited similar patterns of interest as cis-identifying males. Participants were not asked to reveal their sexual orientation for this study.

Moreover, the current sex robot market caters heavily to heterosexual men. Female erotic robots, called gynoids, are seen much more often in media, advertising, and websites. A high-end gynoid can cost up to $15,000 dollars. Dubé believes females represent an untapped market for sex robots, especially considering women currently constitute the majority of sex toy consumers.

“Right now, women probably do not feel that the product meets their own preferences or needs, or it is just too expensive for something that does not have to be particularly complex or interesting,” he concludes.

Stryder HD, a YouTube channel prolific in creating film and TV deepfakes, published a House of the Dragon video at the end of August. It replaces Milly Alcock -- who plays the young version of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen -- with Clarke in scenes from episode 1 of the Game of Thrones prequel series. Check out the deepfake below.

The YouTube channel also published a more recent deepfake, inserting Clarke into episode 4. The quality appears even better.

Clarke played Daenerys, one of the last surviving members of House Targaryen, in Game of Thrones for eight seasons of the HBO show.

Set about 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, HBO's House of the Dragon chronicles the turmoil within House Targaryen over whether a woman should ascend the throne.

Entering the mainstream in 2019, deepfake technology uses artificial intelligence to make it look as if a person is doing or saying something they aren't. Aside from entertainment purposes, deepfakes are increasingly being used in cyberattacks, according to a report released in August.

Huge advances in artificial intelligence (AI) mean that researchers can design completely original proteins in seconds instead of months. “The methods are already really powerful. They’re going to get more powerful,” says biochemist David Baker, who led the team that developed the process. “The question is what problems are you going to solve with them.” One application could be speeding up the creation of treatments made from these novel proteins. The first such medicine, a COVID-19 vaccine, was authorized in South Korea in June — but it took years to perfect.

Awardees included a study on the number of fingers required to turn a door knob. Gen Matsuzaki, an industrial-design researcher who received the prize, said he was recognized for “focusing on a problem that no one cares about”. Matsuzaki has since moved on to studying bag handles and umbrella grips. Winners received their prizes from ‘real’ Nobel laureates, along with a PDF document they can print out and assemble to make a paper container, and a ZWL$10-trillion bill.

As a young astronomer, Frank Drake once caught what seemed to be a signal from intelligent life coming from the Pleiades star cluster. It was actually interference from human technology, but the experience sparked a life-long passion for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). “Whenever I contemplated an instrument … I would as an aside ask myself, ‘Could this be used to search for life?’” he said. “The answer was always no, until we came to the modern radio telescopes.” Drake made the first attempt to detect transmissions from life beyond Earth in 1960 and led the field until his death earlier this month, aged 92. Drake’s eponymous equation, which estimates the number of communicative, technological civilizations in our galaxy remains a scaffold for discussions in the field.

Fireside Chat of Alex Klokus and Avi Loeb at the SALT 2022 conference, New York City (September 14, 2022).

Wonderful news! We just received full funding for the Galileo Project expedition to scoop the fragments of the first interstellar meteor (IM1), CNEOS 2014–01–08, that landed on the Pacific Ocean floor near Papua New Guinea (PNG). The funds are donated by individuals who approached me out of the blue after being inspired by the exciting science behind the expedition. Their generous support is not taking away funding from any other scientific endeavor. It demonstrates once again that research is an infinite-sum game, not a zero-sum game as some self-defined “experts” view science. Gladly, our funders have the wisdom to realize that humanity will prosper by letting many flowers bloom, in contrast to critics who enjoy stepping on any flower that rises above the grass level.

Given how unusual the first interstellar meteor was relative to known space rocks, dissecting its composition is likely to reveal a new astrophysical origin for it, very different from planetary environments like the Solar system. As shown in our discovery paper (now accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal) with my student, Amir Siraj, IM1 was faster than 95% of all stars in the vicinity of the Sun. In a second published paper, we also demonstrated that IM1 possessed material strength tougher than all 273 meteors in the CNEOS catalog. This makes it a true outlier, rarer than the product of 5% and 1/273, which is 0.0002. What was it? To answer this question, we plan to collect fragments of IM1 and examine their composition and structure. Our exceptional research team is currently making detailed plans for the related machinery to be employed in the expedition.

There are two general possibilities. Either IM1 is of new natural origin, or it is artificial, produced by an extraterrestrial technological civilization. Regarding the first possibility, X-ray imaging of the Vela supernova remnant revealed bow shocks from bullets flying out of the explosion site, a discovery I attempted to explain three decades ago. It is possible that IM1 was a small bullet tougher than conventional iron meteorites, shot out of an exploding star. But it is also possible that it was a spacecraft, a billion-year old equivalent of our interstellar probes. Just imagine a spacecraft like Voyager 1 & 2, Pioneer 10 & 11 or New Horizons, crashing onto a habitable exo-planet and burning up in its atmosphere. The exo-scientists on this exo-planet would regard the resulting exo-meteor as space trash. However, if they are curious enough to examine the composition of its fragments, they would realize that it was artificial in origin.

Earlier this week, I described the vision of the expedition in a Fireside Chat with Alex Klokus at the SALT conference at the Javits Center in New York City. Afterwards, Kevin Conrad, a member of the PNG expedition, hosted me for dinner at his restaurant. Kevin was born to parents living in PNG and told me the fascinating fact that there are nearly 850 languages spoken in a country with merely 7.6 million people, making it the most linguistically diverse place on earth. I suggested to Kevin that with the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI), it should be possible to construct an efficient translating machine that will help the diverse PNG population communicate.

Consider now the possibility that our expedition will discover that IM1 carried a message in a technological bottle lying on the ocean floor. This message would bring yet another new language to PNG, this time from an interstellar origin.

After being trained on the 850 local languages, the challenge of the AI translator would be to figure out the content of the interstellar message carried by IM1.

At a recent World.Minds forum, I promised Paola Antonelli, the curator of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, that our PNG expedition will deliver the biggest piece that it retrieves from IM1 for exhibit at the museum. The journey of IM1 over millions of years through interstellar space to the exhibit hall would represent modernity for us, even if it reflects ancient history for its senders in our cosmic neighborhood.

The Master Chief is back and — stop me if you've heard this before — he's ready to finish the fight. After a sprawling opening season introduced diehard gamers and casual viewers alike to the Paramount+ live-action take on ""Halo,"" the sci-fi series is set to make its return for a second go-around depicting the epic war between 26th century humanity and the fearsome conglomerate of alien species known as the Covenant.

Originally brought to life in the critically-acclaimed and immensely popular ""Halo"" video game series, and the subject of decades of fevered demands to translate such material to the big screen, the valuable IP has instead found its home on streaming with a much more indirect approach than fans may have expected. Far from an exact, beat-for-beat adaptation of ""Combat Evolved"" or any other story set in the ""Halo"" universe, the Paramount+ series has largely forged its own original, winding path to telling the story of how the Master Chief John-117 ends up on the otherworldly Halo installation that gives the property its name.

Incredibly enough, the characters never quite made it there by the end of season 1 (physically, at least!), so that leaves plenty of material for subsequent seasons to follow up on and explore. The journey will continue for at least one more exciting batch of episodes, so read on to find out everything we know about ""Halo"" season 2 so far.",artificial intelligence,/film

A four-legged robot trained through artificial intelligence has learned the same lesson as the Apollo astronauts—that jumping can be the best way to move around on the surface the moon. An update on LEAP (Legged Exploration of the Aristarchus Plateau), a mission concept study supported by ESA to explore some of the most challenging lunar terrains, has been presented today at the Europlanet Science Congress (EPSC) 2022 in Granada by Patrick Bambach.

""LEAP's target is the Aristarchus plateau, a region of the moon that is particularly rich in geologic features but highly challenging to access,"" said Patrick Bambach of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany. ""With the robot, we can investigate key features to study the geologic history and evolution of the moon, like the ejecta around craters, fresh impact sites, and collapsed lava tubes, where material may not have been altered by space weathering and other processes.""

The LEAP team is working towards the robot being integrated on ESA's European Large Logistic Lander (EL3), which is scheduled to land on the moon multiple times from the late 2020s to the early 2030s. LEAP is based on the legged robot, ANYmal, developed at ETH Zürich and its spin-off ANYbotics. It is currently adapted to the lunar environment by a consortium from ETH Zurich, the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, OHB, the University of Münster, and the Open University.

""Traditional rovers have enabled great discoveries on the moon and Mars, but have limitations,"" said Bambach. ""Exploring terrain with loose soil, large boulders or slopes over 15 degrees are particularly challenging with wheels. For example, the Mars rover, Spirit, had its mission terminated when it got stuck in sand.""

ANYmal can move in different walking gaits, enabling it to cover large distances in a short amount of time, climb steep slopes, deploy scientific instruments, and even recover in the unlikely event of a fall. The robot can also use its legs to dig channels in the soil, flip over boulders or smaller rocks for further inspection, and pick up samples.

Initially, the robot has been trained using a Reinforcement Learning approach in a virtual environment to simulate the lunar terrain, gravity and dust properties. It has also been deployed in the field for an outdoor hike.

""Interestingly, ANYmal started to use a jumping-like mode of locomotion, just as the Apollo Astronauts did—realizing that jumping can be more energy efficient than walking,"" said Bambach.

The current design remains below 100 kg and includes 10 kg of scientific payload mass, notionally being capable of carrying multispectral sensors, ground penetrating radar, mass spectrometers, gravimeters, and other instrumentation.

""LEAP's ability to collect selected samples and bring them to a lander or ascent vehicle offers additional exciting opportunities for sample a return missions in highly challenging environments on the moon or Mars,"" said Bambach.

Businesses are harnessing the power of AI and ML, from startups to tech giants, to create more innovative and efficient software products. Also, as predicted by Forbes, approximately 80% of businesses invest in AI technology.

However, it won't be surprising to know that various companies are still in the early stages of their adoption journey. For many, it's about understanding how these AI and ML can be integrated into their businesses to get the most out of them.

And without a doubt, business owners still want to know about software development costs to make better ROI decisions. Not only will this help them understand how much it would cost to develop their own AI and ML-based software solution, but it will also give them some insights into the potential benefits of these technologies.

In this article, we'll take a look at how AI and ML are helping to build next-generation software products. So let's get started.

Automated Software Testing

Automated software testing is essential for any organization that relies on software to run its business. By automating the testing process, organizations can speed up their development cycles and release new features and products more quickly.

In addition, automated testing can help improve software quality by identifying errors and defects more quickly and efficiently than manual testing methods. These technologies play a crucial role in automating software testing. By using machine learning algorithms, the software product can be tested automatically and effectively.

For example, ML can be used to generate test cases based on code changes automatically. In addition, AI can help identify areas of the code that are most likely to contain errors. By using AI and ML in automated testing, organizations that provide software development services can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their software development process.

Smarter User Interfaces

AI and ML are being used to create more intelligent user interfaces for software products. By understanding the user's needs and preferences, businesses can create more personalized and relevant user experiences. In addition, AI can help users find the right information more quickly and easily.

For example, many software products now use chatbots to provide customer support. By using natural language processing (NLP), chatbots can understand a user's question or request and provide an appropriate response. In addition, chatbots can learn from each interaction and become more effective over time.

Additionally, AI-powered voice assistants, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, are becoming more popular. These voice assistants can help users with tasks such as setting alarms, adding items to a shopping list, and playing music. Voice assistants are also being used to provide customer support and answer questions about products and services.

Process Automation

Process automation is the use of technology to automate repetitive and tedious tasks. By automating processes, businesses can improve efficiency and productivity. Moreover, process automation can help reduce errors and improve the quality of software products and services.

These next-generation technologies can play a significant role in process automation. For example, businesses can use machine learning algorithms to generate code automatically from templates. In addition, AI can be used to identify and correct errors in code. By using process automation, businesses can improve the efficiency of their software development process and release better quality products.

AI-Managed Code Compilers

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are playing an increasingly important role in code compiling, which is the process of transforming source code into executable files that can be run on a computer. Using AI and ML, bugs or errors in the code can be targeted more accurately and efficiently. This can help identify potential optimizations and automatically generate faster and more reliable code.

Also, AI and ML can help improve the quality of software products by providing businesses with better insights into how users interact with their products. By monitoring user behavior, AI and ML can help to identify areas where products need to be improved or updated. In this way, AI and ML are not only making software development more efficient but also helping to create better outcomes.

Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a technique used to analyze the emotions expressed in text. By understanding the sentiment of text, businesses can gain insights into how customers feel about their products and services. Moreover, sentiment analysis can monitor social media for early negative customer sentiment.

AI and ML can be used to perform sentiment analysis. For example, businesses train machine learning algorithms to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. Also, AI can analyze the sentiment of social media posts in real time. By using sentiment analysis, businesses can gain insights into customer opinion and take action to address negative sentiment before it becomes a problem.

Security and Fraud Detection

Security is a critical concern for any business that relies on software. By using AI and ML, companies can improve the security of their software products and services. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to detect anomalies in data that may indicate a security breach. In addition, AI can identify patterns of behavior that may indicate fraud.

Organizations that offer software development services can use AI and ML to improve the security of their products and services. By using these technologies, businesses can detect potential security threats and take steps to prevent them. In addition, AI and ML can help businesses to respond more quickly and effectively to security breaches.

Conclusion

AI and ML are transformational technologies that are reshaping the software development landscape. By using AI and ML, businesses can improve the quality of their products and services, reduce errors, and automate repetitive tasks. In addition, AI and ML can help companies to enhance security and detect fraud. As these technologies mature, we can expect to see even more innovative applications in the software development space.",artificial intelligence,noupe.com

More proof that racism rots your brain

Grown men are getting triggered by a little mermaid. Disney recently released a trailer for a new live-action version of the Little Mermaid starring Halle Bailey, a Black actor, and it has sparked a depressingly predictable racist backlash. The trailer has received 1.5m dislikes on YouTube and caused a lot of bigots to have a conniption fit. If you’re getting a sense of deja vu about all this, it’s because the same people already had a meltdown in 2019, when the live-action remake was first announced.

It’s not just the Little Mermaid: rightwingers, the people who love telling liberals to toughen up snowflake, routinely get their knickers in a twist over animated entertainment targeted at the four-to-12-year-old crowd. There seems to be a backlash about diversity onscreen every five minutes. Earlier this month, for example, the right were getting het up over a lesbian polar bear family in Peppa Pig. I don’t know how they have the energy to care about cartoon polar bears; it really must be very exhausting.

While there may be nothing new about bigots raging over animated entertainment, this particular backlash is noteworthy because of just how unhinged the response has been. An anonymous computer scientist, for example, went to the trouble of using artificial intelligence to whiten Halle Bailey’s appearance in the trailer. A (now-suspended) Twitter account jubilantly shared the altered trailer, announcing: “Credits to our memer Artificial intelligence scientist. He fixed The Little Mermaid and turned the woke actor into a ginger white girl.” Shortly after the Twitter account added: “This is purely for educational purposes, please do not misinterpret this in a racist way.” Uh huh.

Conservative political commentator Matt Walsh also spent a lot more time thinking about the physiology of fictional creatures than is healthy. Walsh told viewers of his eponymous show that “from a scientific perspective, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to have someone with darker skin who lives deep in the ocean. If anything, not only should the Little Mermaid be pale, she should, actually, be translucent. If you look at deep-sea creatures, they’re translucent. They have no kind of pigmentation whatsoever … [The Little Mermaid] should be totally pale and skeletal where you can see her skull through her face.”

Walsh later said what all racists say when people call them out: his statement about a Black mermaid being unscientific was a joke! Which would have been a lot more convincing of an argument if Walsh hadn’t built his brand on far-right views.

Walsh clearly has an active imagination so I’d like to suggest a little thought experiment to him: try imagining a world where you grew up rarely seeing someone like yourself be a hero onscreen. Walsh is an able-bodied thirtysomething white guy. He grew up with no end of TV shows and movies starring boys who looked like him. If you take that representation for granted then it can be hard to understand how important it is to see yourself included in popular culture. It can be hard to understand how dehumanizing it is to be constantly sent the message that people who look like you can never be heroes. I’m speaking from personal experience here: the other day I found myself unexpectedly shedding a tear because Mo Amer was on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon talking about how his new Netflix show, Mo, is “the first ever show created by, starring a Palestinian, and showing a Palestinian family on television”. As a Palestinian, I wish there had been something like Mo on TV when I was growing up.

The nine millionth remake of the Little Mermaid may not be something that you personally care about, but do try and imagine how important it is for a little girl to see someone who looks like her playing a heroine onscreen. There’s a very wholesome TikTok trend of Black girls watching the Little Mermaid trailer and being delighted that “she’s like me! She’s like me!” If your reaction to little girls feeling included is to dismiss is it as “woke”, then there is something deeply wrong with you. Not only are you a bad human, you’re also a bad capitalist. The US is growing increasingly diverse, whether people like Walsh like it or not. In 2019 non-whites and Hispanics constituted a majority of people under age 16 for the first time. Forgive my cynicism, but I don’t think Disney isn’t trying to be “woke” with the Little Mermaid. It is simply responding to good old-fashioned market forces.

PMS is a ‘key public health issue globally’, new study finds

Researchers surveyed 238,000 people across 140 countries about the effects of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). They found (unsurprisingly!) that PMS is incredibly common and “a majority of women reported that their premenstrual symptoms interfered with their everyday life at least some of the time”.

One man interviewed by GQ said he’s keeping the surgery a secret and is going to tell everyone that his extra inches are a side-effect of the Covid vaccine. While that’s hilarious, the story itself is a sad reminder that gendered expectations negatively affect men just as much as women.

59,Puppy-inspired speaker concept to help elderly communicate with loved ones,https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/09/puppy-inspired-speaker-concept-to-help-elderly-communicate-with-loved-ones/13.jpg,21/09/2022,"Puppy-inspired speaker concept to help elderly communicate with loved onesDepending on which part of the world you live in, elderly or senior citizens living on their own may either be an uncommon occurrence or...",https://www.yankodesign.com/2022/09/21/puppy-inspired-speaker-concept-to-help-elderly-communicate-with-loved-ones/,"Depending on which part of the world you live in, elderly or senior citizens living on their own may either be an uncommon occurrence or a growing problem. If you live somewhere where the latter is becoming more prevalent, you may also see several products that are now trying to solve the problem of alienation and loneliness that comes from older people living alone. There are of course the usual gadgets like smartphones and tablets but there may be some limitations to those for the elderly.

Designer: YoungEun Ahn

The Puppimily is a touch screen speaker that uses Artificial Intelligence to help out those who may have some visual and aural difficulties because of their age. But it’s more important purpose is to help the elderly deal with the psychological issues of living alone by connecting them with loved ones through the device. The design of the speaker is that of a puppy as both the word and the animal itself evokes a certain comfort and warmth with the name itself a mix of puppy and family.

The main colors of the device are black and white with the colors coming into the display and representing the different interactions that the user may have. There is also a character that can help express the different emotions from the user. LED lights and the movements of the speakers’ ears may be used to indicate certain emotions or indicators like yellow for notifications, blue to indicate that they are listening, etc. The monitor can move 360 degrees from left to right and 60 degrees from top to bottom.

The icons shown in the display are intuitive and easy to understand and there are no more than five icons at a time to avoid confusion. There are also very few buttons to make it more user-friendly for the elderly. There are only three in the body: up, down, and the power button. The device uses intuitive visuals, text using voice recognition, voice recording, and other AI-powered functions that will help lessen the burden of being on screens too much. But on times when you need to do video calls, you can do so on a wide screen with other intuitive elements added.

I don’t know if we really do need another gadget to add to the one million ones in the market but this concept does have a different market in mind. The smallish screen based on the renders may be a deterrent to elderly people’s use since they prefer to have a bigger screen so maybe if it does become an actual product, this is something they can improve on.",artificial intelligence,yanko design

Although much of the SCO’s focus is on regional development, such as railways and trade agreements, it has been a key player in the proliferation of technologies designed for social control, which foreign policy experts call “digital authoritarianism.”

Following China’s lead, research shows that the majority of SCO member countries, as well as other authoritarian states, are quickly trending toward more digital rights abuses by increasing the mass digital surveillance of citizens, censorship, and controls on individual expression.

Democracies use massive amounts of surveillance technology as well, of course. The United States is one of the most surveilled countries in the world, and it buys much of that tech from China. Yet it’s the technology trade relationships between authoritarian countries everywhere—SCO members, as well as its allies—that are rapidly growing deeper, and such states have begun to adopt similar playbooks for digitally enabled social control.

What do we mean when we say “digital authoritarianism”?

Four years ago, Freedom House, a non-profit research and advocacy group for global democracy, focused on “the rise of digital authoritarianism” when it published its annual report on the state of freedom and the internet in 2018. As the report explains, “Digital authoritarianism is being promoted as a way for governments to control their citizens through technology, inverting the concept of the internet as an engine of human liberation.” Since then, this has been a common way for Washington to frame the US-China power competition in the tech realm.

There is a strong correlation between governance systems and the state of digital rights, with authoritarian regimes more likely than democratic regimes to use tech as another domain for social control.",artificial intelligence,mit technology review

The new version folds in several key enhancements for simplifying the life of developers while speeding up some of the complex server-side tooling so it can take advantage of modern hardware, especially the most parallel options.

If the version number of Java seems to be rising more quickly than in the past, that’s by design. Oracle is committed to rolling out new official versions of the language twice a year. Maintaining this rhythm makes it possible for new enhancements to work their way into the ecology and reach deployment.

“We’re excited about this release,” said Georges Saab, senior vice president of development of Java at Oracle. “It is the 10th release that we will have done under the six-month cadence and we’ve been doing that now for about five years. We’re very pleased with the fact that all of those releases have come predictably, on target, on the date that they were supposed to. We’re really happy with the process that has given us for getting new features into the hands of Java developers more quickly.”

The programming language rivalry

Java is in competition with several other major programming languages for the hearts and minds of developers and the C-level executives who write the checks. The language has a reputation for being a bit wordy while delivering a rock-solid and fast performance across a wide variety of chips and architectures.

Over the last decade, other languages like JavaScript, PHP and Python have gradually borrowed many of the successful ideas at the core of the Java stack. They now offer much better performance thanks to imitating some of the just-in-time compilation techniques of the Java virtual machine (VM). At the same time, they can offer a more modern syntax that is attractive to some developers, especially new ones learning the craft.

An open community and a closed enterprise version

The official version rollouts are becoming a bit more ceremonial. The enhancements have been in wide circulation for some time as experimental versions. Oracle wants to engage developers through what it calls the Java Community Process so that the language co-evolves with the needs of the developer community. Some of the most significant enhancements are tagged with words like “Preview” or “Incubator” to signal that they may change more rapidly than other, more stable parts of the codebase.

“This comes from our dedication to building trust in the Java ecosystem,” explained Saab. “Things that are done in the open JDK community led by Oracle engineers and developers can see all of this work happening as it’s happening. They can read the mailing lists, understand, listen to the design discussions, and see each change in the code as it’s coming in.”

While Oracle continues to emphasize and nurture the open-source community of developers that’s grown around Java, they are also pushing a paid option for enterprise customers who are willing to pay for better performance and care. The Java SE Subscription option entitles paying customers to the GraalVM Enterprise version of the VM, as well as access to Java Management Service, a system for monitoring deployed code.

Virtual threads and more improvements

Teams building out server-side stacks will want to evaluate the virtual threads and structured concurrency tools that are emerging from what Oracle called Project Loom. These virtual threads can be simpler to start up and shut down. In the past, Java’s standard model assigned one operating system thread to each incoming request to a server, an architectural model that allowed all of the requests to be processed independently. The problem, though, is that each thread consumes memory and the size of the RAM effectively limits the number of requests a server can handle.

Lately, some simpler technologies like Node.js have won converts by avoiding the threading model, allowing them to handle much higher loads of simple requests with often dramatically less RAM. The new virtual threads make it possible for Java developers to match this performance.

Another area that will draw attention will be the ability to reach out to new forms of hardware. First, Oracle will be rolling out a version of the Java VM for the RISC-V, a chip architecture that is found increasingly in some of the new, highly parallel chip designs. It’s not uncommon for some chip designers to talk of packing more than 1,000 RISC-V cores that can operate independently from each other. Java’s new VM makes it possible for Java developers to write code for this platform, which is expected to draw plenty of attention from artificial intelligence (AI) researchers who often want to use highly parallel chips like this to train AI models.

At the same time, the new version of the language includes a vector API that makes it simpler for programmers to write code that will process large blocks of data in chunks. The Java VM will be able to assign these to the right cores in compatible hardware, making it possible for the code to run much faster when the right hardware is available.

Some of the other new features include revisions to the Java language itself that simplify some of the syntax and also add more structure that can help prevent bugs. Java 19 marks the final rollout of some of the new ideas that were part of what Oracle calls Project Amber. New record patterns are now available in Java 19 as a preview. These can simplify creating and curating some of the data structures juggled by software.

Oracle is also adding better tooling for connecting Java code with code written for other languages. They’re beefing up the foreign function interface, which makes it easier for programmers to create hybrid software packages that take advantage of the best features of different languages.

Java platform: Both stable and evolving

While much of the focus will be on reaching the milestones for development, Oracle also wants to emphasize their continual devotion to creating an open community around the language. They understand that the decision to invest in software languages evolves over years and programmers crave a platform that is both stable and continually evolving to meet the latest needs. Oracle is investing as heavily in building this community as much as the software enhancements that come of the process.

“We’ve reached our 1,000,000th certified Java developer and so that’s an exciting milestone,” said Chad Arimura, vice president for Java developer relations at Oracle. “We think that part of our technology and innovation strategy around trust, innovation, predictability — you know, important core values — we also think that applies to the community as well. Trust that there’s going to be a community around you, innovation and ensuring that we’re continuing to innovate the channels that we use to reach those developers, and predictability to ensure that we continue to invest in existing programs that Java developers can use.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

While artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms promise better forecasting capabilities, those systems can only truly shine when coupled with the flexibility and human touch of a data analyst.

Commercial airlines and other travel and transportation leaders are facing significant challenges in managing pricing, demand, and logistics in today’s volatile environment. This summer’s travel disruptions have laid bare the potential for intermittent hiccups in post-pandemic operations to have drastic effects on customer satisfaction and revenue opportunities.

With travelers’ patience wearing thin, airlines need to reinforce their people, processes, and technologies. By building artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into processes across their organizations, airlines can leverage their data, analysts, and revenue management opportunities to take advantage of new business fundamentals in this changing environment.

“Artificial intelligence isn’t replacing the airline data analyst’s job,” said Alex Mans, founder and CEO of FLYR Labs, a technology company driving commercial optimization for airlines. “But it is changing their role and hopefully unlocking their potential to drive revenue and improve operational efficiencies.”

Intelligence on Demand

Airline data can be difficult to parse, but artificial intelligence makes it easier. It’s impossible for humans to manually process all the information airlines are collecting from digital sources, but deep learning neural networks can provide effective forecasts that give analysts the confidence to make better decisions.

“Historically, the leading forecasting type has been linear, regression-based models, where analysts look at very concentrated year-over-year patterns,” Mans said. “The problem is that there’s just not enough data on any single flight for a given point in time to drive accurate forecasts in a volatile environment. Legacy systems are really bad at determining whether booking one seat on a given flight has a meaningful impact on the outcome.”

To power deep learning algorithms, airlines feed neural networks vast amounts of historical data — such as bookings, searches, events, promotions, and competitive prices — resulting in forecasts that keep analysts better informed on revenue and load-factor performance into the future.

“They can compare how the actual performance builds against the forecast data as the departure date approaches,” Mans said. “The real value comes when, with a platform such as ours, analysts come to trust the forecast and can start using it to inform strategic decisions instead of viewing it as a loose guideline.”

Unlocking the Full Potential of Analysts

According to Mans, artificial intelligence should be thought of as an airline data analyst’s smart sidekick — it’s not replacing the analyst’s job, but rather enhancing the analyst’s ability to make coordinated operational decisions in areas where automation alone is insufficient.

“In the past, analysts have not had accurate forecasts, so most of their decisions were based on instinct,” Mans said. “On top of that, they haven’t had good user interfaces for consuming that data. We generate much better forecasts, enable smarter workflows, and provide a dedicated user interface where analysts can easily access and filter the data and then use the resulting information. With better load and revenue forecasts at any level of granularity across the network, they can do amazing things.”

For example, if an analyst sees a cluster of flights months into the future with a 99-percent forecasted load factor, they can alert colleagues in charge of scheduling and suggest adding capacity. At most airlines, where functions across the organizations are typically siloed, this kind of cross-functional collaboration between commercial teams isn’t common.

“All it takes to start breaking down those silos is for other teams to have access to the same information that the revenue management team has access to,” Mans said. “At the end of the day, different departments are trying to achieve the same results: maximize revenue and contain costs.”

In addition to playing gatekeeper of that information, the analyst’s role will evolve to support a variety of critical functions across the organization.

“For one thing, they can look around corners that the data itself can’t see,” Mans said. “The analyst might know that a schedule change is coming, but unless that information is passed to our system, we have no awareness. Artificial intelligence doesn’t know everything. Another thing to note is that optimizing for maximum revenue isn’t always the goal. An airline entering a new market may want to follow a non-revenue-optimal strategy focused on market control or market share, so the analyst is needed to fine-tune that strategy. Or consider promotions — every airline runs tons of promotions throughout the year, whether tied to their credit card program, certain destinations, or other variables that require the analyst to actively work with our platform and their marketing team to achieve the best results.”

Leveraging New Business Fundamentals

For airlines to weather the storm of today’s unprecedented industry disruptions, dynamic pricing powered by deep learning algorithms is essential. FLYR was built to provide a singular platform that helps airlines manage data, break past data silos with consistently accurate forecasts that can be accessed by anybody in the organization, and achieve total revenue management across all of their products.

“Our job is to help airlines effectively price everything they want to sell, including ancillaries like seat selection, extra baggage, priority boarding, and other upsells,” Mans said. “FLYR’s operating system provides a vertically integrated SaaS platform across data management, forecasting, pricing, automation, business intelligence, and reporting — which includes simulation and scenario evaluation — while also removing constraints within e-commerce and fulfillment thanks to acquisitions such as Newshore so airlines can get stuff done faster and more efficiently. That’s what we’re building as a company, and that’s the future of work within this industry.”

The policy aims to protect gig workers from deception about pay or benefits, diminished bargaining power, and a highly competitive market.

Gig work is an umbrella term for any independent contractor, online worker, or temporary worker who enters into a contract with an on-demand employer for any gig that might arise—hence the name. That spans from Uber and Lyft drivers to freelance writers, to household cleaning services, to Grubhub delivery drivers and Amazon Flex workers.

“No matter how gig companies choose to classify them, gig workers are consumers entitled to protection under the laws we enforce,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “We are fully committed to coordinating our consumer protection and competition enforcement efforts within the FTC as well as working with other agencies across the government to ensure gig workers are treated fairly.”

According to the policy report, 16 percent of Americans earn money through a gig company. Another report cited states that “more than half of gig workers say the money they earn is essential or important for meeting their needs” (in the early days, Uber often pitched itself as a good way to make money on the side.) A third report cited notes that many gig workers come from communities of color. The report predicts that the gig economy alone will generate $455 billion in annual sales in 2023.

On-demand companies that hire gig workers often misrepresent how much freedom a worker will have, leading to misconceptions about the job, the report states. “These companies often categorize their workers as independent contractors,” it reads. “Yet in practice these firms may tightly prescribe and control their workers’ tasks in ways that run counter to the promise of independence and an alternative to traditional jobs.”

“This tension has contributed to litigation across the country over allegations that gig workers are being misclassified as independent contractors rather than employees,” it continues.

Because of that misclassification, gig workers have almost no bargaining power, and often no legal protections to organize, which allows companies to take advantage of them however they please.

A highly competitive gig market also leads to reduced choice of employment for workers, potentially forcing them into dangerous or coercive situations. The policy report states that any unsubstantiated claims made by companies about pay or benefits may violate the FTC Act and trigger civil penalties. Any additional deceptive claims about the terms of employment, it states, might also violate the Act.",artificial intelligence,vice news

General Assembly, Secretary-General António Guterres urged the body, ""gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction,"" to unite behind world's crises",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chief-warns-colossal-global-dysfunction-urges-world-unite/story?id=90215597,"As global leaders descend on New York City for the annual U.N. General Assembly, the body's Secretary-General António Guterres issued a dire warning in an opening speech on Tuesday: ""Our world is in big trouble.""

""Divides are growing deeper. Inequalities are growing wider,"" he said. ""And challenges are spreading farther.""

The annual gathering of high-level diplomats in the General Assembly is the first to happen in a fully in-person format since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it's the first to take place since Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- an international conflict that has drawn deep divides between the organization's most powerful members, sparking calls for the U.N. to be reformed and prompting questions about whether it can still serve its stated purpose ""to maintain international peace and security.""

Guterres alluded to these fractures in his address Tuesday, arguing they undercut the organization's work.

""We are gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction,"" he said. ""The international community is not ready or willing to tackle the big dramatic challenges of our age. These crises threaten the very future of humanity and the fate of our planet. Our world is in peril -- and paralyzed.""

Overcoming those major challenges, he said, depended on cooperation.

""Let's work as one, as a coalition of the world, as united nations,"" he urged.

Hunger on the horizon

While much of Guterres' speech was devoted to outlining the problems facing the planet, he sought to remind the audience that the U.N. was still capable of finding solutions.

Large projectors in the room displayed a picture of a ship called Brave Commander that Guterres called ""an image of promise and hope."" Laden with grain and flying the blue-and-white flag of the U.N., the vessel was the first to leave Ukrainian ports since the outbreak of Russia's invasion, navigating Black Sea trade routes to bring its badly needed cargo to the Horn of Africa thanks to an agreement Guterres played a pivotal part in brokering.

""Some might call it a miracle at sea. In truth, it is multilateral diplomacy in action,"" he said, calling the dozens of ships that have followed in Brave Commander's path a testament to what can be accomplished through cooperation.

But while that safe passage deal is allowing grain exports to ameliorate the global food crisis, Guterres warned there was another on the horizon due to a shortage in fertilizer -- saying that while the current problems can be chalked up to distribution issues, the world's hunger may soon be the result of not having enough to go around at all.

""Without action now, the global fertilizer shortage will quickly morph into a global food shortage,"" he said.

The secretary-general then alluded to the U.N.'s next major initiative: a proposal to export Russian fertilizer components through Ukraine.

""It is essential to continue removing all remaining obstacles to the export of Russian fertilizers and their ingredients, including ammonia. These products are not subject to sanctions, and we are making progress in eliminating indirect effects,"" Guterres said.

The U.N. separately says it is ""pursuing all efforts"" to maximize fertilizer output, but the clock is ticking. The body's trade negotiator advises that shortages need to be addressed in October and November before the window for the northern hemisphere's planting season closes.

Dire problems, drastic plans

The secretary-general on Tuesday also spoke to the even broader-sweeping challenges of the day, and advocated for even more ambitious -- or, to some, radical -- plans to address them. ""We need action across the board. Let's have no illusions,"" he said. ""Our planet is burning,""

Guterres called not only for initiatives to address the root causes of damage to the environment but also to compensate developing countries that bear the brunt of those problems.

""Polluters must pay,"" he said. ""Today, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the 'windfall' profits of fossil fuel companies. Those funds should be re-directed in two ways: to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis, and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices.""

Guterres argued that the climate crisis was fueling ""a once-in-a-generation global cost-of-living crisis"" that could only be remedied through radical change.

""Today's global financial system was created by rich countries to serve their interests. It expands and entrenches inequalities. It requires deep structural reform,"" he said. ""The divergence between developed and developing countries -- between North and South, between the privileged and the rest -- is becoming more dangerous by the day. It is at the root of the geopolitical tensions.""

The U.S. agenda

While President Joe Biden isn't scheduled to take part in the summit until Wednesday, Guterres' speech mentioned a number of other items that coincide with the White House's priority list.

On nonproliferation, the secretary-general noted that ""a nuclear deal with Iran remains elusive.""

The Biden administration, with help from the European Union, has been embroiled in months of indirect negotiations with Tehran over returning to an Obama-era nuclear pact that then-President Donald Trump scrapped in 2018. But talks appear to have stalled again. Although a high-level delegation from Iran will participate in the General Assembly, there are no planned meetings with any U.S. officials.

While addressing women's rights, Guterres also hit on a domestic matter: the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

The U.N. women's rights committee has previously denounced the landmark ruling which reversed the national access to abortion in the U.S., calling ""access to reproductive rights is at the core of women and girls' autonomy and ability to make their own choices about their bodies and lives, free of discrimination, violence and coercion.""

More broadly, Guterres said that gender inequality is ""going backwards"" and ""women's lives are getting worse, from poverty, to choices around sexual and reproductive health, to their personal security.""",artificial intelligence,abc news
66,Computers Have Turned Chess Into Poker,,17/09/2022,A cheating controversy involving two grandmasters shows what the game has become.,https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/carlsen-niemann-chess-cheating-poker/671472/?utm_source=feed,"It was as if a bottom seed had knocked out the top team in March Madness: At the Sinquefield Cup chess tournament in St. Louis earlier this month, an upstart American teenager named Hans Niemann snapped the 53-game unbeaten streak of world champion Magnus Carlsen, perhaps the game’s best player of all time. But the real uproar came the following day, when Carlsen posted a cryptic tweet announcing his withdrawal that included a meme video stating, “If I speak I am in big trouble.” The king appeared to have leveled an unspoken accusation of cheating—and the chess world, in turn, exploded.

Some of the biggest names in chess launched attacks on Niemann in the subsequent days, while others rushed to defend him. Niemann, by his own recent admission, has cheated at online chess at least twice before, when he was 12 and 16 years old. These past offenses, combined with what some believed was lackluster chess analysis in his postgame interviews, have heightened suspicions of foul play. On Twitch and Twitter, players and fans theorized that Niemann might have been receiving secret messages encoded in the vibrations of electronic shoe inserts or remote-controlled anal beads. No concrete evidence of cheating has emerged, and the 19-year-old grandmaster vehemently denied accusations of misconduct in St. Louis, vowing to an interviewer that he has never cheated in an over-the-board game and has learned from prior mistakes.

Whatever really happened here, everyone agrees that for Niemann, or anyone else, to cheat at chess in 2022 would be conceptually simple. In the past 15 years, widely available AI software packages, known as “chess engines,” have been developed to the point where they can easily demolish the world’s best chess players—so all a cheater has to do to win is figure out a way to channel a machine’s advice. That’s not the only way that computers have recently reshaped the landscape of a 1,500-year-old sport. Human players, whether novices or grandmasters, now find inspiration in the outputs of these engines, and they train themselves by memorizing computer moves. In other words, chess engines have redefined creativity in chess, leading to a situation where the game’s top players can no longer get away with simply playing the strongest chess they can, but must also engage in subterfuge, misdirection, and other psychological techniques. In that sense, the recent cheating scandal only shows the darker side of what chess slowly has become.

The computer takeover of chess occurred, at least in the popular imagination, 25 years ago, when the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated world champion Garry Kasparov. Newsrooms at the time declared the match a “Greek tragedy,” in which a silicon “hand of God” had squashed humanity. Yet 1997, despite its cultural resonance, was not really an inflection point for chess. Deep Blue, a nearly 3,000-pound, one-of-a-kind supercomputer, could hardly change the game by itself. Its genius seemed reliant on then-unthinkable processing power and the grandmasters who had advised in its creation, to the point where Kasparov, after losing, could accuse IBM of having cheated by supplying the machine with human assistance—a dynamic that today’s accusations of foul play have reversed.

Read: When computers started beating chess champions

By the mid-2000s, though, upgrades in chess-engine software and commercial hardware made overpowering algorithms more accessible; in 2006, an engine running on a standard desktop computer defeated then–world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Players had already been using engines to evaluate individual tactics. But Kramnik’s loss kicked off the first era of computer-chess superiority, in which even chess elites would rely on software to help evaluate their strategies, Matthew Sadler, a grandmaster who has written multiple books on chess engines, told me.

As engines became widespread, the game shifted. Elite chess has always involved rote learning, but “the amount of stuff you need to prepare, the amount of stuff you need to remember, has just exploded,” Sadler said. Engines can calculate positions far more accurately and rapidly than humans, so there’s more material to be studied than ever before. What once seemed magical became calculable; where one could rely on intuition came to require rigorous memorization and training with a machine. Chess, once poetic and philosophical, was acquiring elements of a spelling bee: a battle of preparation, a measure of hours invested. “The thrill used to be about using your mind creatively and working out unique and difficult solutions to strategical problems,” the grandmaster Wesley So, the fifth-ranked player in the world, told me via email. “Not testing each other to see who has the better memorization plan.”

Once computers were reliably beating grandmasters, cheating-by-computer became a serious threat, Emil Sutovsky, the director general of the International Chess Federation, told me. The federation implemented its first anti-cheating measures in 2008.

That’s not to say chess was “solved” (in the sense that a perfect set of moves has been devised for every position), as checkers is; there are more possible chess games than atoms in the observable universe. Sadler believes “human frailty”—that we aren’t machines—kept chess exciting: People would still forget their pregame analysis, fail to predict their opponent’s strategy, and end up in positions they hadn’t prepared for. The computers in this first era of chess engines were very good on defense, but they still had weaknesses, Sutovsky said, such as struggling to determine the value of sacrificing a piece for long-term benefit.

But that all changed on December 5, 2017, when AI researchers at Alphabet announced a new algorithm, AlphaZero, which had surpassed the best existing chess engine simply by playing games against itself—over the course of just four hours. AlphaZero used a neural network, an approach to artificial intelligence that mimics the human brain and, in a sense, allows a machine to learn. Other chess engines quickly incorporated the new technology, heralding the modern era of total computer domination.

Read: How checkers was solved

In the first era, humans would devise attack strategies, then refine them in games against machines. AlphaZero crushed these earlier engines by “playing extremely aggressive chess,” Sadler said. The modern, neural-net engines are eager to sacrifice; and they exhibit a strong grasp of openings, positional structure, and long-term strategy. “It started to look a bit more [like] a human way to play,” Sutovsky told me, in describing this transformation. Or even superhuman, he said: The new chess engines seemed to have insight into “the tactical skirmish, but also could plan for some long-lasting compensation for material loss.”

To understand just how superior machines have become, consider chess’s “Elo” rating system, which compares players’ relative strength and was devised by a Hungarian American physicist. The highest-ever human rating, achieved by Carlsen twice over the past decade, was 2882. DeepBlue’s Elo rating was 2853. A chess engine called Rybka was the first to reach 3000 points, in 2007; and today’s most powerful program, Stockfish, currently has more than 3500 Elo points by conservative estimates. That means Stockfish has about a 98 percent probability of beating Carlsen in a match and, per one estimate, a 2 percent chance of drawing. (An outright victory for Carlsen would be almost impossible.)

Where chess engines once evaluated human strategies, the new, upgraded versions—which are freely available online, including Stockfish—now generate surprising ideas and define the ideal way to play the game, to the point that human performance is measured in terms of “centipawn” (hundredths of a pawn) loss relative to what a computer would play. While training, a player might ask the software to suggest a set of moves to fit a given situation, and then decide to use the computer’s sixth-ranked option, rather than the first, in the hopes of confusing a human competitor who trained with similar algorithms. Or they might choose a move tailored to the weaknesses of a particular opponent. Many chess experts have adopted the new engines’ more aggressive style, and the algorithms have popularized numerous tactics that human players had previously underestimated.

The advent of neural-net engines thrills many chess players and coaches, including Sutovsky and Sadler. Carlsen said he was “inspired” the first time he saw AlphaZero play. Engines have made it easier for amateurs to improve, while unlocking new dimensions of the game for experts. In this view, chess engines have not eliminated creativity but instead redefined what it means to be creative.

Read: Befriending the queen of chess

Yet if computers set the gold standard of play, and top players can only try to mimic them, then it’s not clear what, exactly, humans are creating. “Due to the predominance of engine use today,” the grandmaster So explained, “we are being encouraged to halt all creative thought and play like mechanical bots. It’s so boring. So beneath us.” And if elite players stand no chance against machines, instead settling for outsmarting their human opponents by playing subtle, unexpected, or suboptimal moves that weaponize “human frailty,” then modern-era chess looks more and more like a game of psychological warfare: not so much a spelling bee as a round of poker.

In that context, cheating scandals may be nothing less than a natural step in chess’s evolution. Poker, after all, has been rocked by allegations of foul play for years, including cases where players are accused of getting help from artificial intelligence. When the highest form of creativity is outfoxing your opponent—as has always been true of poker—breaking rules seems only natural.",artificial intelligence,the atlantic

In contrast to the slump of the broader stock market, specialty tech company Palantir Technologies (PLTR -6.81%) edged up in price on Wednesday. The combination of a fresh new deal with a partner across the Pacific Ocean and an award from a respected research company pushed the stock up nearly 1% higher on the day.

So what

After market hours on Tuesday, Palantir announced that it has expanded its cooperation with said partner, South Korea-based Hyundai Heavy Industries Group. Palantir will deliver its Palantir Foundry solution to businesses within the sprawling industrial conglomerate that concentrate on ship building. For Hyundai, this is part of a push to modernize its operations in the segment.

All told, the modification to the two companies' existing arrangement will be worth $20 million over the coming five years. That nearly doubles Palantir's take from Hyundai; across that half-decade stretch, the total contracts with the Asian company will tally more than $45 million.

Hyundai and the American specialty tech company have been partners for quite some time. The latter company pointed out that another of the conglomerate's many units, Hyundai Doosan Infracore, has been using Foundry since 2019.

Meanwhile, Palantir announced that it was ranked as the No. 1 artificial intelligence (AI) software platform operator for 2021 in a recently issued analysis from tech market researcher IDC. In the latter's publication ""Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Platforms Software Market Shares, 2021: AI is Being Used in More Unique Ways Than Ever,"" Palantir nabbed the top spot in terms of both market share and total revenue.

Now what

The Palantir/Hyundai partnership looks like it'll deepen, if anything. In its press release trumpeting the expanded deal, Palantir wrote that ""Today's announcement marks a significant step toward the formation of a joint venture."" In January, the two companies signed a formal agreement to create a big data platform for use throughout Hyundai's businesses.",artificial intelligence,motley fool

71,Is your device getting the Windows 11 2022 Update on September 20?,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f74ajPhZFfYif2XoTE42BS-1200-80.jpg,20/09/2022,"In this guide, we'll explain Microsoft's approach to rolling out the Windows 11 2022 Update to compatible devices starting on September 20.",https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/is-your-device-getting-the-windows-11-2022-update-on-september-20,"Microsoft is expected to begin the controlled rollout of the Windows 11 2022 Update (version 22H2) on September 20. This is the first significant update of the new version of Windows for desktops and laptops that will ship with new features and a slew of visual improvements.

In the same way that the company releases feature updates for Windows 10 (opens in new tab), the latest version of Windows 11 (opens in new tab) will roll out slowly as an optional install, and it will take some time before the update reaches every device. Also, since this is technically a new version, the upgrade will require complete reinstallation, whether you use Windows Update, Installation Assistant, ISO file, or any other installation method.

This guide will review the Microsoft servicing approach to upgrading devices to the Windows 11 2022 Update.

As with previous rollouts, Microsoft plans to offer the Windows 11 2022 Update as an optional download for compatible devices running the original release of Windows 11 or the most recent version of Windows 10. Since the upgrade won't happen automatically, you will have to trigger the installation manually to get it.

(Image credit: Microsoft)

Starting on September 20, the company will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to update devices known to have a smooth upgrade experience. Usually, the feature update will be available for computers with newer hardware first. Then as the update proves more reliable, it'll expand to other devices.

However, the availability of the feature update on your device will be affected by several factors. For instance, if the system detects a problem with the hardware configuration or peripherals, incompatible drivers, apps, or security programs, you won't get the option to upgrade until the issue is resolved. Also, the device's geographical location will play a role in when the update will be available to you.

Windows 11 version 22H2 will be available as a manual upgrade, but devices nearing the end of service will eventually download it automatically through Windows Update. However, this won't happen immediately. Typically, it could take months before the rollout occurs automatically.

Yes, as soon as the feature update becomes available, you can force the upgrade using different methods, including the Installation Assistant and ISO file. However, you should never rush the upgrade. Instead, you should wait until you receive the notification automatically through Windows Update.

Installation Assistant

The Installation Assistant is a tool that lets you update to the latest version in the case that Windows Update isn't working on the computer. However, anyone can use it to install the Windows 11 2022 Update at any time.

After version 22H2 becomes available, you can click the Download Now button to download the tool from this Microsoft support website (opens in new tab). Then you only need to launch the installer and click the Accept and install button.

(Image credit: Future)

ISO file

Another easy way to perform an in-place upgrade is to mount the official ISO file to File Explorer to launch the setup.

You can download the Windows 11 2022 Update ISO file from the Microsoft support website (opens in new tab), under the ""Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO)"" section, using the Download button.

(Image credit: Future)

In the past, the Media Creation Tool included the option to perform an in-place upgrade, but starting with Windows 11, the tool has been updated, and now it only works to create an installation media.

Whether you choose to go with Installation Assistant or ISO file, it's always recommended to create a temporary backup (opens in new tab) in case you need to roll back or recover files.

It’s now helping researchers acquire better climate change data by teaching Earth observation satellites how to measure ice thickness in the Arctic year-round.

Satellites have been monitoring the Earth’s icy north pole for decades now, but the quality of these observations have long been seasonally dependent. In winter, when the ice is solid, cold, and dry, measurement techniques are simple and effective. But things get a lot more challenging in the summer, when melted ponds of water form on the icy surface. From space, these meltwater pools are highly reflective, blinding the satellites’ instruments, or making the pools appear to be the open ocean. In these conditions, satellites are unable to distinguish between seawater and melting ice.

In a new paper published in Nature last week, researchers describe how they were able to use artificial intelligence to overcome these limitations. Their work enabled the first ever year-round ice thickness record from a satellite.

The satellite in question is the European Space Agency’s CryoSat-2, launched in 2010. CryoSat-2 uses a synthetic aperture radar system that acts as an altimeter: in ideal conditions, it is able to measure its height above the ocean, and above the ice floating on the water. These measurements in comparison allow for the calculation of a thickness estimate. But for five months of the year, the quality of those observations is severely compromised.

To fill the knowledge gap, researchers use a variety of buoys, planes, and vessels to monitor ice levels in the summer, but none of these methods offer the grand-scale coverage a satellite could provide.

To enable CryoSat-2 to continue making useful observations from May to September, when it would typically be ineffective, the team worked with previous satellite data from 2011 to 2020, and computer modeling, to teach the system how to recognize the difference between meltwater and open ocean. This machine learning technique enabled a complete, 12-month ice thickness record, something never before achieved by a spacecraft.

The applications of this new capability are perhaps most directly valuable to shipping, making weather pattern prediction easier, and offering guidance as to when northern sea passages are likely to close for the winter. It will also make these forecasts available much earlier in the season.

In the long term, the data will be useful to climate scientists hoping to understand the processes involved in year-over-year sea level changes.

Michel Tsamados (University College London) was one of the authors of the paper. He explains, “when we use the new ice thickness data in advanced climate models, it will improve both our short-term forecasts for the weather at the mid-latitudes and the long-term forecasts that show what climate we will have in the future.”

MUNICH, Sept. 21, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- This year, for the first time, a computed tomography (CT) scanner is installed directly on-site at the Munich Oktoberfest to triage injured visitors. The responsible medical team of the Department of Radiology at LMU University Hospital of Munich will rely on the use of artificial intelligence (AI), as the health IT company deepc is equipping the setup with leading algorithms for CT examinations of the head.

According to the Medical Directorate of the City of Munich's Rescue Service, the number of emergency admissions increases by around 30% during Oktoberfest, the biggest folk festival in the world, which runs from Sept. 17 to Oct. 3.

Supporting the initiative to provide on-site diagnosis and treatment resulting from head trauma, for the first time, a computed tomography (CT) scanner is set up in the first-aid area. Visitors with bleeding head wounds or other head injuries can be imaged directly on-site and do not have to be taken to an emergency room of a hospital by ambulance. To deliver the highest patient safety, the diagnostic process is supported in real-time by the use of cutting-edge AI.

Prof. Dr. med. Clemens Cyran, vice chair of the Department of Radiology at the LMU Hospital, says: ""The on-site CT scanner at the Oktoberfest is primarily supporting prompt diagnosis after head injuries. Intracranial hemorrhage can be life-threatening, and diagnosis is now possible within minutes, which provides a tremendous benefit to patient safety. For optimized patient care at the Oktoberfest, we decided to integrate AI-based analysis to enable even faster diagnosis in a challenging clinical environment"".

Prof. Dr. Jens Ricke, Chair of the Department of Radiology at the LMU Hospital, adds: ""The implementation of AI at the Oktoberfest CT scanner mirrors the combination of tradition and innovation that is so characteristic for Munich and Bavaria"".

Building upon the partnership with deepc and the usage of their novel AI platform deepcOS, the LMU clinicians took into operation a globally leading AI solution for the detection of brain hemorrhage, a medical device developed by the French company Avicenna.AI, which is available on the platform.

“No matter how gig companies choose to classify them, gig workers are consumers entitled to protection under the laws we enforce,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “We are fully committed to coordinating our consumer protection and competition enforcement efforts within the FTC as well as working with other agencies across the government to ensure gig workers are treated fairly.”

“Technological advances and novel business models are no license to commit unfair, deceptive, or anticompetitive practices,” said Elizabeth Wilkins, Director of the FTC’s Office of Policy Planning. “We will use all our tools to protect gig workers and promote fair and competitive market practices in the gig economy.”

Misrepresentations about the nature of gig work: While gig companies promote independence to potential workers, in practice these firms may tightly prescribe and control their workers’ tasks in ways that run counter to the promise of independence and an alternative to traditional jobs.

Diminished bargaining power: Workers have little leverage to demand transparency from gig companies, even in the face of unclear information about when work will be available, where they will have to perform it, or how they will be evaluated.

Concentrated markets: Markets populated by gig companies are often concentrated, resulting in reduced choice for workers, customers, and businesses. These companies may be more likely to exert their market power in anticompetitive ways that harm workers’ wages, job quality, and other aspects of gig work.

The policy statement makes clear that the FTC’s authority to enforce both competition and consumer protection laws in the gig economy is not affected by how companies choose to classify the consumers who perform gig work. In the statement, the Commission names multiple areas where the Commission will aim to prevent harm to consumers:

Holding companies accountable for claims and conduct about costs and benefits: Gig companies must not be deceptive in their claims to prospective gig workers about potential earnings, and they must be transparent and truthful about costs borne by workers.

Combating unlawful practices and constraints imposed on workers: Gig companies using artificial intelligence or other advanced technologies to govern workers’ pay, performance, and work assignments are still required to keep promises they make to workers. Companies must also ensure that any restrictive contract terms, including those limiting workers from seeking other jobs, do not violate the FTC Act or other laws.

Policing unfair methods of competition that harm gig workers : The FTC will investigate evidence of agreements between gig companies to illegally fix wages, benefits, or fees for gig workers that should be open to competition. The FTC will also investigate exclusionary or predatory conduct that could cause harm to customers or reduced compensation or poorer working conditions for gig workers.

The policy statement notes that companies that fail to follow the laws governing unfair, deceptive, or anticompetitive practices could be obligated to pay consumer redress and civil penalties and may be ordered to cease unlawful business practices. The Commission also notes in the statement that it will partner with other governmental agencies to protect gig workers.

The Commission voted 3-2 at an open meeting to adopt the policy statement, with Commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine S. Wilson voting in the negative.

Workers who believe that their labor rights have been violated can call 1-844-762-6572 for assistance filing an unfair labor practice charge. Or they can contact their closest National Labor Relations Board Field Office or submit a charge on the NLRB’s website.",artificial intelligence,ftc.gov

Tesla is building a humanoid robot, which, according to CEO Elon Musk, could be used for cooking meals and helping elderly people. Amazon recently acquired iRobot, a prominent robotic vacuum manufacturer, and has been investing heavily in the technology through the Amazon Robotics program to expand robotics technology to the consumer market. In May 2022, Dyson, a company renowned for its power vacuum cleaners, announced that it plans to build the UK’s largest robotics center devoted to developing household robots that carry out daily domestic tasks in residential spaces.

Despite the growing interest, would-be customers may have to wait awhile for those robots to come on the market. While devices such as smart thermostats and security systems are widely used in homes today, the commercial use of household robots is still in its infancy.

As a robotics researcher, I know firsthand how household robots are considerably more difficult to build than smart digital devices or industrial robots.

Handling Objects

One major difference between digital and robotic devices is that household robots need to manipulate objects through physical contact to carry out their tasks. They have to carry the plates, move the chairs and pick up dirty laundry and place it in the washer. These operations require the robot to be able to handle fragile, soft, and sometimes heavy objects with irregular shapes.

The state-of-the-art AI and machine learning algorithms perform well in simulated environments. But contact with objects in the real world often trips them up. This happens because physical contact is often difficult to model and even harder to control. While a human can easily perform these tasks, there exist significant technical hurdles for household robots to reach human-level ability to handle objects.

Robots have difficulty in two aspects of manipulating objects: control and sensing. Many pick-and-place robot manipulators like those on assembly lines are equipped with a simple gripper or specialized tools dedicated only to certain tasks like grasping and carrying a particular part. They often struggle to manipulate objects with irregular shapes or elastic materials, especially because they lack the efficient force, or haptic, feedback humans are naturally endowed with. Building a general-purpose robot hand with flexible fingers is still technically challenging and expensive.

It is also worth mentioning that traditional robot manipulators require a stable platform to operate accurately, but the accuracy drops considerably when using them with platforms that move around, particularly on a variety of surfaces. Coordinating locomotion and manipulation in a mobile robot is an open problem in the robotics community that needs to be addressed before broadly capable household robots can make it onto the market.

They Like Structure

In an assembly line or a warehouse, the environment and sequence of tasks are strictly organized. This allows engineers to preprogram the robot’s movements or use simple methods like QR codes to locate objects or target locations. However, household items are often disorganized and placed randomly.

Home robots must deal with many uncertainties in their workspaces. The robot must first locate and identify the target item among many others. Quite often it also requires clearing or avoiding other obstacles in the workspace to be able to reach the item and perform given tasks. This requires the robot to have an excellent perception system, efficient navigation skills, and powerful and accurate manipulation capability.

For example, users of robot vacuums know they must remove all small furniture and other obstacles such as cables from the floor, because even the best robot vacuum cannot clear them by itself. Even more challenging, the robot has to operate in the presence of moving obstacles when people and pets walk within close range.

Keeping It Simple

While they appear straightforward for humans, many household tasks are too complex for robots. Industrial robots are excellent for repetitive operations in which the robot motion can be preprogrammed. But household tasks are often unique to the situation and could be full of surprises that require the robot to constantly make decisions and change its route in order to perform the tasks.

Think about cooking or cleaning dishes. In the course of a few minutes of cooking, you might grasp a sauté pan, a spatula, a stove knob, a refrigerator door handle, an egg and a bottle of cooking oil. To wash a pan, you typically hold and move it with one hand while scrubbing with the other, and ensure that all cooked-on food residue is removed and then all soap is rinsed off.

There has been significant development in recent years using machine learning to train robots to make intelligent decisions when picking and placing different objects, meaning grasping and moving objects from one spot to another. However, to be able to train robots to master all different types of kitchen tools and household appliances would be another level of difficulty even for the best learning algorithms.

Not to mention that people’s homes often have stairs, narrow passageways and high shelves. Those hard-to-reach spaces limit the use of today’s mobile robots, which tend to use wheels or four legs. Humanoid robots, which would more closely match the environments humans build and organize for themselves, have yet to be reliably used outside of lab settings.

A solution to task complexity is to build special-purpose robots, such as robot vacuum cleaners or kitchen robots. Many different types of such devices are likely to be developed in the near future. However, I believe that general-purpose home robots are still a long way off.

The post AI-powered sperm analysis improves fertility treatments appeared first on Springwise.",https://www.springwise.com/innovation/health-wellbeing/using-digital-health-to-boost-fertility-treatment/,"Spotted: In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) has been a crucial breakthrough – both for human couples who want children, and for farmers who use it to manage the make-up of their herds. Despite the many medical advances that have moved fertility treatments forward, rates of success are still low. Fertility tech company Pera Labs says that IVF fails 70 per cent of the time in humans and 60 per cent of the time in farm animals. The company’s solution is to make it easier to find and select the highest quality sperm for a fertilisation.

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to cut down on the length of time it takes to analyse sperm in the laboratory shortens the amount of time individuals, couples, and farmers have to wait for each round of treatment or service. The company’s proprietary algorithm SPERMAN works with images as well as video, a development that greatly increases the accuracy of sperm quality analyses. The technology also works with eggs. Because eggs are much larger than sperm, it takes only seconds for the AI to gather enough data to grade an egg’s health.

For farmers, the lab offers a sex-sorting-as-a-service option to help maintain herd health and optimum numbers of each gender. For people, the technology helps identify as early as possible before the embryo stage the possibility of any dangerous genetic mutations. And potentially, if fertility treatments speed up slightly, costs may drop, enabling more people to access treatments that are currently prohibitively expensive.

Innovations focusing on fertility are relatively rare, with Springwise spotting a Tinder-style app that helps people choose a sperm donor and a femtech platform that personalises care for conditions that often affect infertility.

Donald Trump’s legal perils have become insurmountable and could snuff out the former US president’s hopes of an election-winning comeback, according to political analysts and legal experts.

Trump and three of his adult children were accused of lying to tax collectors, lenders and insurers yesterday in a “staggering” fraud scheme that routinely misstated the value of his properties to enrich themselves.

The civil lawsuit, filed by New York’s attorney general, came as the FBI investigates Trump’s holding of sensitive government documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and a special grand jury in Georgia considers whether he and others attempted to influence state election officials after his defeat there by Joe Biden.

The former US president has repeatedly hinted that he intends to run for the White House again in 2024. But the cascade of criminal, civil and congressional investigations could yet derail that bid.

What do the experts say? “He’s done,” said Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University in Washington, who has accurately predicted every presidential election since 1984. “He’s got too many burdens, too much baggage to be able to run again even presuming he escapes jail, he escapes bankruptcy. I’m not sure he’s going to escape jail.”

Could the New York civil fraud suit bring down the Trump Organization? Restrictions sought by Letitia James include bans on Trump and his children that would tear his real estate empire from his control, writes Hugo Lowell.

Biden denounces Putin’s nuclear threats as ‘reckless’ in UN address

Joe Biden and allied leaders have reacted angrily to Vladimir Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons and pledged to maintain support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s partial mobilization and planned annexation of more Ukrainian regions.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also shrugged off Putin’s moves to escalate the war, saying his country’s forces would continue their counteroffensive, not giving Russia breathing space to mobilize and dig in on Ukrainian soil.

The US president was speaking hours after Putin announced Russia’s first mobilization since the second world war and warned that Moscow had “lots of weapons to reply” to what he claimed were western threats on its territory.

Since Putin’s announcement, more than 1,300 people have been arrested in 38 Russian cities, according to the OVD-Info monitoring group. These are the largest protests since Putin launched his invasion in February.

Why is Putin planning partial mobilization? The UK’s defense ministry says Russia needs the manpower to continue its fight. “The move is [in effect] an admission that Russia has exhausted its supply of willing volunteers to fight in Ukraine,” its daily intelligence briefing said today.

Democrats will struggle to keep control of Congress in midterms, expert says

‘It’s a long shot that the Democrats would get more than half.’ Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters

Since 1978 Ray Fair, ​​a professor of economics at Yale University, has been using economic data to predict US election outcomes, writes Dominic Rushe. His bare-boned, strictly by the numbers approach has a fairly impressive record, usually coming within 3% of the final tally.

Sadly for Democrats – if Fair’s on track again this time – the Biden administration will struggle to keep control of Congress in November’s crucial midterm elections.

Elections are noisy events and this year’s is no different. Recent polling suggests Joe Biden is on a roll, reclaiming some of the ground he lost earlier in his presidency. The Democrats have passed major legislation. There has been a sharp increase in women registering to vote after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. Abortion rights drove voters to the polls in deep-red Kansas. Gas prices, if not overall inflation, are falling. In the meantime, Donald Trump and the candidates he has backed are dominating the headlines and helping Democrats’ poll numbers.

But if Fair is right, we can largely set aside the personalities and the issues: the economy is the signal behind the noise and Biden is still in trouble.

What does Fair’s data predict? Using data going back to 1916 Fair’s latest analysis suggests Democrats will get 46.7% of the national vote in November – down from the 51.3% in 2020 when Biden defeated Donald Trump and took control of the House and a slim majority in the Senate.

Only about 6% of kids under five have had the first shot of a Covid vaccine, according to data from the CDC – the lowest rate by far of any age demographic. Meanwhile, Biden said on Monday the pandemic was ending – a message that could result in a continued lag.

The conservative activist Virginia Thomas, the wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, has agreed to participate in a voluntary interview with the House panel investigating the January 6 insurrection , her lawyer said. The attorney Mark Paoletta said Thomas was “eager to answer the committee’s questions”.

A Malaysian defen se contractor nicknamed Fat Leonard , who orchestrated one of the largest bribery scandals in US military history, has been arrested in Venezuela after fleeing before his sentencing, authorities say. The international manhunt for Leonard Glenn Francis ended with his arrest on Tuesday morning.

A former Minneapolis police officer who pleaded guilty to a state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in the killing of George Floyd was sentenced yesterday to three years. Thomas Lane is already serving a two and a half year federal sentence for violating Floyd’s civil rights.

The dominance of a small number of big companies over the global food chain is increasing, aided by the rising use of “big data” and artificial intelligence, research has found. Only two companies control 40% of the global commercial seed market, compared with 10 companies controlling the same proportion of the market 25 years ago, according to the ETC Group, an eco-justice organisation. Agricultural commodity trading is similarly concentrated, with 10 commodity traders in 2020 dominating a market worth half a trillion dollars.

Don’t miss this: I love you but I don’t want to see you for the next six weeks; the case for a ‘marriage sabbatical’

Is the sabbatical just a waiting room for divorce? Illustration: Spencer Wilson at Synergy/the Guardian

It’s not a divorce, a trial separation or a chance for a guilt-free fling, just an opportunity for husbands and wives to live apart, forget all the little irritations and realise how much they miss each other. At least that’s the theory. The idea was coined by Cheryl Jarvis in 1999 who conceived a marriage sabbatical very much in the style of the workplace sabbatical – taken to pursue a dream of your own. But what if you don’t have a dream or a project – what if you don’t care about hiking, and your only goal is getting away from your spouse? Is the sabbatical just a waiting room for divorce?

Climate check: Denmark offers ‘loss and damage’ funding to poorer countries for climate breakdown

Youth groups in Africa are preparing to embark on a series of climate demonstrations tomorrow to highlight the problem of poor countries blighted by climate breakdown as only one rich country has so far stepped up with funding for the problem. Denmark became the first central government of a developed country to propose funding devoted to “loss and damage” – which refers to those ravages of climate-related disasters which are so extreme that no protection against them is possible. No other developed countries have indicated they are likely to follow the Danish lead.

Last thing: Taste of kale makes unborn babies grimace, finds research

If the taste of kale makes you screw up your face, you are not alone: researchers have observed foetuses pull a crying expression when exposed to the greens in the womb. While previous studies have suggested our food preferences may begin before birth, the team says the research is the first to look directly at the response of unborn babies to different flavors. Researchers are now looking to explore the reaction of babies after birth to the different flavors. “Hopefully we will see less negative reactions, if they were exposed to kale prenatally,” one said.

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/09/15/topaz-photo-ai-combines-all-its-image-tools-into-one-automatic-photo-editor/,"Topaz Labs has announced a new program called Topaz Photo AI, a program that it says combines all its best image tools to automatically detect and fix image quality issues using deep learning.

Topaz Labs says that until now, it has offered three separate applications that address different image quality issues: DeNoise AI for removing noise, Sharpen AI for deblurring soft-focus images, and Gigapixel AI for upscaling low-resolution images. It says that while each of these does its job well, real-world situations usually result in one image needing more than one program to fix a batch of issues.

So, Photo AI combines the tech from all three of these programs into one editor that is smart enough to deal with image quality issues on its own and en masse.

The company says that its “extensively trained” artificial intelligence (AI) models and deep learning maximize image quality faster and more accurately than photographers have thus far experienced.

“Getting a clean, crisp, and high-resolution photo is really important, but the current process of increasing image quality is quite slow and error-prone,” Eric Yang, CEO of Topaz Labs, says. “To solve this, we’ve built Topaz Photo AI to be an autopilot for image quality. It detects the unique problems in your image and intelligently applies the correct methods to maximize resolution, detail, and clarity.”

Photo AI has a feature called Autopilot, which automatically analyzes a set of photos and applies what it determines to be the right models and settings, which a photographer can then use as a starting point to make creative edits. The idea is this platform removes the tedium of fixing common image issues manually and instead lets photographers skip right to the best part of photo editing.

“Autopilot rigorously analyzes each image intelligently and combines the power of DeNoise AI, Sharpen AI, and Gigapixel AI to signiﬁcantly improve image quality within seconds after launch,” the company claims. “Autopilot will report all of the vital characteristics of the image, including automatically detected subjects and faces, and will automate the AI model and settings selection process in various ways.”

Topaz adds that Photo AI is designed to fit into a variety of workflows, from RAW or JPEG to Lightroom or Capture One, the company promises that it will feel significantly ore well-integrated than the company’s previous image quality apps.

Topaz Photo AI is available starting today for $199 directly from the company’s website for both Windows and Mac computers.

Pixelmator was founded in 2007 by two brothers, Saulius Dailide and Aidas Dailide. Today, the Pixelmator Team says it develops groundbreaking and innovative image editing apps for Mac and iOS.

Pixelmator Pro 3.0 adds new design templates, artificial intelligence-based (AI) template editing, fully customizable mockups, a new Document Colors tool, and more. The editor can now automatically remove backgrounds, upsize low-resolution images, and select image composition and placement intelligently. The updates bring the application more in line to compete with Adobe’s ubiquitous Photoshop.

The update introduces 200 design templates, which the company says enables absolutely anyone the capability to create stunning visuals in moments. 200 is a lot to start with, and the company says it plans to add more over time.

“Pixelmator Pro is designed from the ground up for ease of use and templates are no different, so they can be personalized using simple on-canvas controls,” the company says. “Every template also includes a range of built-in effects, illustrations, shapes, and more, that let you transform the look of a template with just a few clicks.”

The update also brings AI-based template editing, using state-of-the-art machine learning that it says speeds up template editing.

“When replacing placeholder content, it can automatically remove backgrounds, increase the resolution of low‑res images, and choose optimal placement and composition,” the company says. “Machine learning features are powered by Core ML for blazingly fast performance on the latest Apple silicon Macs, which feature the Neural Engine for accelerating ML tasks.”

Pixelmator Pro 3.0 also brings new Document Colors, enabling users to try out different color palettes, create their own, or customize existing ones.

Finally, the update brings what Pixelmator describes as fully-customizable, ultra-premium design mockups, which it says allow users to place designs created in any app into documents and adjust lighting and effects with ease. The company says the mockups are adjusted with “simple on-canvas controls, so it takes just a few clicks to completely change their look and feel.”

Pixelmator Pro 3.0 “Muse” is free for existing users of Pixelmator Pro and $39.99 for new customers.

Pixelmator will run on macOS Big Sur or later and the team says they have optimized the machine learning for extremely fast performance on Apple silicon Macs that feature the company’s Neural Engine.",artificial intelligence,petapixel

The development means there is increased competition for photographers on what were traditionally called photography stock websites, but might be now better described as something else.

A search on Shutterstock with the term “AI-Generated” returns 18,850 results, not all of which were created by programs such as DALl-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion but a brief scroll through makes it clear that many of them were.

The same search in iStock generates 1,585 results with one image that photographers could only dream of a “Vintage Photograph of Loch Ness Monster.”

Tutorial on Selling AI Art

Vanessa, a book cover photographer, released a video entitled How to start selling Midjourney AI art on Shutterstock.

“I found Shutterstock is accepting AI art, not everybody is on board with the AI-generated art, that might change with time,” she says.

Initially, Vanessa had her AI-generated artworks rejected by Shutterstock on technical grounds.

“You can’t just take your AI art and upload it as is it’s not good enough resolution,” she explains.

Currently, programs such as DALL-E only generated images with a maximum of 1024 pixels meaning users must use an outside program to upscale their images.

Low resolution is not the only problem that Vanessa encounters. AI-generated images will often contain visual oddities such as poorly rendered facial features, which she says she fixes in Photoshop before she uploads them for sale.

Midjourney appears to be popular on the stock sites and a glance at its terms of service says that non-paying members of Midjourney are granted a Creative Commons Noncommercial 4.0 Attribution International License for the images, meaning users are not allowed to sell the images they create for commercial gain.

However, Midjourney says that paying members “own all assets you create with the service.”

Shutterstock makes no mention of artificial intelligence in its terms of use. Stock Photo Secrets reports that one major player is making legal steps, however: Getty Images. It recently updated its model release form “regarding the use of their likeness to train machine learning algorithms used for AI photo creation.”

AI-image generation has exploded in popularity over the last several months, so it is not surprising that companies and governments are still yet to lay down any firm rules for the new frontier of image creation.

“I think there will be changes to the laws and copyright and usage of AI-generated art,” adds Vanessa.",artificial intelligence,petapixel

The new exemption proposes to freely allow the machine mining of all imagery published online for any use by anyone, including AI developers. It would cover both copyright works and those protected by the UK Database Right.

Currently, the Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception to copyright protection permits non-commercial purpose machine analysis of online content, provided that there is lawful access (such as a subscription). It is also limited to prevent the resale or reuse for other purposes and must be accompanied by acknowledgement of the source.

The updated version of the exemption scraps all of that, and plays into the hands of big tech developers. “With serious economic consequences for any creator,” says the AOP, “but most especially photographers with data-rich images, this proposal completely short-circuits the licensing process allowing AI developers and others free commercial access to content for which, under normal circumstances, they would have to license and pay for.”

And not only that, but on a practical level, it would mean that AI bots/crawlers could scan or read any digital images on your websites or social media accounts, and extract any data the bots have been programmed to search for.

The AOP is concerned that not only will photographers lose out on image licensing, but also the very platforms being trained using their works may ultimately replace the work they currently do. A double whammy in other words.

“On the horizon are already AI/Machine Learning programmes that have openly copied millions of images to enable owners/users to create new ones without remunerating copyright owners,” say the AOP.

“This change in UK legislation would fundamentally turn the tables on creators giving way to economically harmful competition by allowing a content ‘free for all’ and invoking an unfair machine-endeavour vs. human endeavour scenario.”

Essentially, no one has really figured out the copyright implications of AI-created images. Should a computer sample hundreds of copyrighted images in order to learn and then regurgitate the same thing? Or is it merely no different than a human learning photography? That’s essentially what AI text-to-image machines like DALL-E and MidJourney are doing, however.

It’s a discussion currently on many creators’ lips. Will AI eventually replace humans in the creative industries? We’re currently in the Wild West. At least, when it comes to new tech and the rapidly changing world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). An AI-created image even won a contest recently.

Most new products are required to iron out potential issues prior to going to market. However, the Digital Tech Lords (yes I’m using that flippantly but make no mistake that they are top of the hierarchy) can basically bypass that, develop an idea and release it. They can then sort out problems at their leisure, or not as the case often is.

But many of these problems with digital online tech are societal and have many wider-reaching implications than the engineers perceive at the time of development. AI certainly has a lot of potential for good. But can massive disruption of whole industries ever be a positive thing? We need, for example, the political infrastructure such as a universal income to catch those falling through the net.

It’s an important conversation and one that we all need to participate in. It needs to be both with the tech companies, lawmakers and within the artistic community. Otherwise, we could find ourselves shut outside in a cold world with the door firmly closed.

The US president also called afresh for Congress to do more to force social media companies to address the spread of hate through their platforms.

“White supremacists will not have the last word and this venom and violence cannot be the story of our time,” Biden said on Thursday in a summit at the White House to push back on rising hate crime in the US, entitled United We Stand.

He said America had long experienced a “through line of hate” against minority groups, one that had been given “too much oxygen” by politics and the media in recent years, adding: “It’s so important that we keep hollering [and] for people to know that’s not who we are.”

The US president announced initiatives aimed at countering hate-fueled violence.

Biden and his vice-president, Kamala Harris, delivered remarks at the summit, which was attended by lawmakers of both parties and community leaders from across the county.

Participants gave Biden a standing ovation when he said he wanted Congress to “hold social media companies accountable for spreading hate”.

“I’m calling on Congress to get rid of special immunity for social media companies and impose much stronger transparency requirements on all of them,” Biden said.

He did not go into further detail. Social media platforms are currently protected from liability as publishers of third party content by section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

In his afternoon speech, Biden announced what he called “a new era” of national service to “foster stronger communities”.

He is asking Congress to raise the payment for national service through programs such as Americorps, an independent federal agency that involves millions of Americans in volunteer work for a stipend, to $15 an hour.

The president also mentioned new training on identifying and reporting hate-fueled violence for local law enforcement groups, workplaces and houses of worship.

The Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services will work with schools on programs to deter bullying, the White House said. And the Department of Homeland Security will offer $20m in grants for state, local and tribal governments, non-profits and universities to prevent hate-fueled violence.

Biden did not mention former president Trump by name, but while discussing the notorious “Unite the Right” 2017 rally in Charlottesville, he did refer to “the last guy” defending the white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence that weekend.

“When the last guy was asked, ‘What do you think?’ he said he thought there were some fine people on both sides,” Biden said.

He added: “We remain in a battle for the soul of our nation,” a theme he used in his 2020 presidential campaign and has lately revived to galvanize votes in this November’s midterm elections.

Survivors and loved ones of victims of hate-fueled violencealso participated in the gathering and spoke about horrors experienced because of racism, xenophobia and antisemitism.

The president was introduced by Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer – who was murdered in 2017 while protesting against the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, mown down in a far-right terrorist attack by a neo-Nazi sympathizer who deliberately rammed his car into counter-demonstrators.

“Across the country, hate crimes are on the rise,” Bro said. And while her daughter’s death received national and international attention, “all too often these hateful attacks are committed against people of color with unacceptably little public attention,” she added.

Biden had specifically asked Bro to introduce him at the summit.

He later tweeted: “White supremacy and all forms of hate-fueled violence have no place in America. Failure to call it out is complicity. Silence is complicity. And we cannot remain silent.”

White supremacy and all forms of hate-fueled violence have no place in America.



Failure to call it out is complicity.

Silence is complicity.

And we cannot remain silent. — President Biden (@POTUS) September 15, 2022

Last year Charlottesville removed a Confederate statue that had been a focal location for the rightwing rally in 2017 from the town after a long legal battle. The state capital of Richmond not long after took similar action.

Thursday’s summit came four months after a white supremacist gunman attacked a supermarket in a predominantly Black area of Buffalo, New York, killing 10.

Similar attacks in recent years have included the 2019 shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, where a gunman had published an anti-immigrant screed, the 2018 shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando in 2016.

Hate crimes in the US hit a 12-year high in 2020, the last available data, the FBI said last year.

The White House earlier said more resources would be made available to schools, libraries and other community institutions to prevent hate-fueled attacks.

Major technology companies, under huge pressure to filter out rampant hateful content, have outlined steps to limit the spread of hate content on their platforms.

YouTube said it would start removing content glorifying violent acts that could inspire similar violence, even if the content creators are not linked to a designated terrorist group.

Microsoft pledged to expand its application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect and prevent violence, while Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced a partnership with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies’ Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism.

Biden signed the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act last year, addressing rising hate-related incidents against Asian Americans, amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Biden promised to help heal “the soul of the nation” but evidence suggests that the country is more divided than it has been in decades. According to a survey last month, two in five Americans believe a civil war is at least somewhat likely in the next decade.

The survey also found that two-thirds of Americans believe political divisions have worsened since Biden took office.",artificial intelligence,the guardian

With a new world of visual potential lately opened by artificial intelligence (AI) image generators such as DALL-E and Midjourney, there is also a new world of potential legal complications. Looking to get ahead of problems before they begin, Getty Images — a massive supplier of stock photography — has banned the upload and sale of all content generated using AI art tools. The technology can quickly generate multiple takes on imagery from user-supplied text prompts, with results that range from silly, to pretty realistic, to fairly nightmarish, to truly the worst thing ever.

But where is the source material for these AI bots coming from? For the most part, it’s being scraped and remixed from the work of human artists, who use the Internet as a venue for their work to connect with audiences and potential buyers. Not only do some see this as disenfranchising to artists who have worked hard to develop a personal brand, but it also presents legal quicksand for image sites that decide to trade in AI-crafted content.

“Effective immediately, Getty Images will cease to accept all submissions created using AI generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Dall-E 2, MidJourney, etc.) and prior submissions utilizing such models will be removed,” reads a statement circulated this week by the company to media and its image providers. “There are open questions with respect to the copyright of outputs from these models and there are unaddressed rights issues with respect to the underlying imagery and metadata used to train these models.”

The statement went on to clarify that the limits on submissions do not prevent 3D renderings or impact the use of digital editing tools like Photoshop and Illustrator.

When asked by Hyperallergic how many images currently on the website will be impacted by the new policy, Craig Peters, CEO of Getty Images, said: “To our knowledge, it is extremely limited within our creative content library and there were already significant controls for our editorial offering. We are communicating with other companies and communities to understand perspectives with respect to these issues, how the legal or regulatory bodies might address and whether we might be helpful to resolve.”

Getty’s decision to remove and limit such content mirrors equivalent measures being instituted by image sites like Newgrounds and Fur Affinity.

“Our entire purpose is to bring creatives together into a safe, honest, and vibrant community to create fantastic images, and so the use of 100% machine-generated images, whilst an incredible breakthrough, is not something that helps our community,” reads a September 14 statement by PurplePort CEO Russ Freeman about banning AI art on the site. “I feel that using machine-generated images, while empowering everyone to participate in generating art, does not reflect the core purpose of our service, nor does it contain enough human input.”

Peters told the Verge that Getty Images will rely on users to identify and report such images, and that it’s working with C2PA (the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) to create filters screening for AI content. Other major image stock providers, like Shutterstock and Adobe Stock, have not yet explicitly banned AI content for sale, but the entire industry is attuned to how current discourse about artistic appropriation will play out across regulatory law, which often tends to trail tech innovation by years or even decades.

That leaves a lot of meantime for the digital art space to continue to be inundated with strange, proliferating many-eyed corpse babies, which seems to be the aesthetic space where AI art is always thriving — and a lot of wasted time for artists trying to protect their IP by playing a losing game of whack-a-mole against the internet.",artificial intelligence,hyperallergic

Heart diseases are still chronically misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed in women. With depressing regularity, we see stories of women failed by the health system when they come to hospitals with the symptoms of a heart attack. As a professor of cardiac science with 40 years’ experience, for me it has been a frustrating journey to get to the real cause of this problem: a combination of professional, systemic and technical biases. The experiences of individual patients are complex to analyse and interpret, but now we can view these effects on a much bigger scale.

Women are 50% more likely to receive a wrong initial diagnosis; when they are having a heart attack, such mistakes can be fatal. People who are initially misdiagnosed have a 70% higher risk of dying. The latest studies have similarly shown that women have worse outcomes for heart operations such as valve replacements and peripheral revascularisation. As well as being misdiagnosed, women are less likely to be treated quickly, less likely to get the best surgical treatment and less likely to be discharged with the optimum set of drugs. None of this is excusable, but is it understandable?

The study’s most shocking statistic was that the failures only happened if the doctor was male

The first excuse commonly offered is that women don’t develop heart disease as much as men and so seeing a woman with a heart attack is “unexpected”. It’s true that women themselves may not expect to have a heart attack and so may overlook the first symptoms. But I’m unconvinced by the justifications I often hear from clinicians. While it may also be true that the heart disease rate is lower in younger women, it is far from a rare event. Each year more than 30,000 women are admitted to hospital in the UK with a heart attack. For every 10 young men with heart disease, a doctor can expect to see between three and five young women, and the numbers are even closer in the older age brackets. Compare this with meningitis, for example, where a general practitioner may see only one or two cases in their entire career. Taking all heart disease types over an individual’s lifespan, about 21% of women die from heart disease – not far off the figure for men, at 24%. For a clinician, seeing a woman with heart disease in casualty cannot be called unexpected by any stretch of the imagination.

A second popular excuse is that women’s symptoms are strange and unpredictable. But the reality is that there is a great deal of overlap between the sexes in the symptoms they experience. Feeling sick, sweaty, or lightheaded are symptoms common to both, as is the classic symptom of crushing chest pain, often radiating up the arms and to the jaw. This pain is the most common symptom in men and women, although women are more likely than men to experience it in their back. Shortness of breath and tiredness are again common, but there is more probability that women will be experiencing breathlessness, fatigue or nausea when they come to A&E. Since there will be a significant number of women coming to the hospital with heart attacks, there should be no excuse for remaining ignorant of this range of symptoms.

Once a heart attack is suspected in a patient, the standards and guidelines for treatment are well defined. Doctors should be recognising heart disease in women and giving them the optimum standard of care. However, this is not happening. Clinicians are less likely to stick to the guidelines when treating women, sending them home with painkillers rather than the armoury of therapeutics we have now. Women are less likely to receive the gold-standard treatment, where the blood vessels are opened using catheters to restore the blood flow. One study of more than 100,000 hospital patients found that men have 20% more of these reperfusion treatments than women and men were nearly twice as likely to survive while in hospital. Even when women do get treated, there is not as much haste in doing so. The time from first contact with a doctor to reaching the catheter laboratory for reperfusion therapy is vital: for every five-minute delay there is a 5% increase in the risk of death. The study also found that women were moved to the catheter laboratory significantly less promptly than men and this contributed to the higher death rate.

However, the study’s most shocking statistic was that this only happened if the doctor was male. Why should this be?

The biggest study on physician gender and treatment came from the experience of 1.3 million Florida residents who had been admitted to hospital for a heart attack. Survival rates were two to three times higher for female patients treated by female physicians compared with female patients treated by male physicians. Male physicians who had good prior experience of treating women did improve their success rate – there was a measurable increase in survival with every new female patient they saw. Even more interesting, the number of women clinicians in the team made a big difference to the men they worked with. A higher proportion of female doctors improved both the success of the team in general and the competence of men in the team for treating women. The study concluded that the best way to help female patients was to have a gender-balanced team, rather than waiting for individual male doctors to gain experience at the expense of their early failures.

What is it about female patients that makes the male doctors treat them differently? What behaviours or characteristics trigger this response in the clinician? This is where the difference between sex and gender plays a part. Each of us, independent of our biological sex, has a range of gendered attributes that are traditionally thought of as male or female and, importantly, that might be valued differently if displayed by a man or a woman. Are you shy, gentle and compassionate or assertive, risk-taking and individualistic? There is a test you may like to try called the Bem sex-role inventory that assesses how “male” or “female” your behaviour is – almost all of us will fall somewhere between the two extremes.

Our home circumstances also affect how we are seen: factors such as being the primary wage earner, having a high income or doing most of the housework. All these add up to how male or female we appear. When gender and biological sex were compared for how they influenced treatment, it was the perceived gender – the strength of the “female” score compared with the “male” – that made the difference in treatment and outcome. For example, “female” patients (men or women) were more than four times as likely to return to the hospital with recurrent symptoms after being discharged. Essentially, behaving in a manner perceived as traditionally female downgrades you in the eyes of a male physician – there is a higher chance that your distress will be seen as overblown, inaccurate or hysterical.

Uncontrollable emotional excess has long been associated with women and has alternately been classified as a disease of either the body or mind. The Greeks termed it hysteria (or wandering womb, hystera being the word for womb) and only at the time of Freud was the same behaviour pattern recognised in men. In her book Sex Matters, the US physician Alyson McGregor describes how women who are in pain often have trouble convincing the doctor treating them of how serious that pain is. The more they protest and try to convince the physician, the more their behaviour is perceived as hysterical. Women from more demonstrative cultures have a particularly hard time. If they have grown up always encouraged to be very vocal about their emotions, then this can work against them in casualty. As McGregor says, the best thing you can do as a woman is to bring a man with you to explain.

On a side note, one clue to understanding whether these observations are the result of bias is to observe whether the same is true for other disadvantaged groups as well as women. As it happens, the same phenomenon for doctor-patient matching occurs for race, with patients from minorities doing better with a physician of the same race, or in a team with a good proportion of minority doctors. The use of healthcare resources and satisfaction with the outcome both rise when there is good matching. This is part of a much wider appreciation that there are numerous inequalities in medical care by race in the US and the UK. It is not hard to predict the pattern for minority women, who are doubly disadvantaged in terms of healthcare.

If gender-balanced teams are an answer to the problem, why is this not happening in cardiology? Clinical cardiology has traditionally been a predominantly male occupation – sometimes referred to as “boys and toys” because of the many and varied devices that can be implanted in the heart, purportedly attracting male clinicians to the discipline. The UK Athena Swan gender equality scheme for universities was operating in my own institution, and over about 10 years made many adjustments to reduce bias in hiring and promotion practices. By 2020 we had raised the number of female science professors in cardiology to be about equal with the number of males. Female clinical cardiology professor numbers in our associated hospitals, however, remained stubbornly at 10% of the number of males. In the US, more than 50% of medical school students are women but this figure drops to only 4.5% for the practising “interventional” cardiologists (the ones using catheters to treat heart attacks). This difference seems to be crucial in the poor treatment of women who come into hospital with cardiac symptoms.

What can we do while we wait for the world of cardiology to achieve gender parity? A recent study used data science to combine the clinical signs, heart measurements and blood test results from 13,000 people coming into hospital with cardiac symptoms. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI) the researchers produced an algorithm that was significantly better at diagnosing heart attacks in general (achieving almost 84% accuracy in sending patients for further tests, compared with about 50% accuracy for conventional tests) and levelling up the field between men and women. We just have to hope that advances such as this will make some inroads into shocking statistics such as the estimated 8,200 women in England and Wales who died of heart problems between 2002 and 2013 because of misdiagnoses. Hopefully, data science, with its analysis of large numbers of patients, will give us new insights and will show the potential for AI-generated algorithms to provide a solution.

Since July, NASA’s Perseverance rover has drilled and collected four slim cores of sedimentary rock, formed in what was once a river delta on Mars. They are the first of this type of rock to be gathered on another world — and scientists are excited because at least two of the cores probably contain organic compounds, which, on Earth, are often associated with living things. If all goes well, the samples will be the first ever returned from Mars. They will be picked up by another spacecraft and brought back to Earth no earlier than 2033.

Roughly 10.5 million children worldwide have a parent or carer who died from COVID-19, according to a modelling study. The figure is a dramatic increase on earlier estimates. Epidemiologist and co-author Susan Hillis says decades of research on children whose parents died from AIDS have revealed three ‘accelerators’ that are the foundation for helping children to recover: educational support, economic assistance and assistance for the remaining parent or carer. Identifying the children who need help, and providing it quickly, is key, she says.

The aviation industry produces around one billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year — comparable to the emissions of Japan, the world’s third-largest economy. But the industry’s current focus on cleaner fuels and carbon offsetting “is a triumph of industrial interests over reality”, argue climate-policy scholars Steffen Kallbekken and David Victor. And it fails to take into account factors such as contrails, the long clouds that form behind aircraft, which might be one of the biggest sources of global warming caused by aviation. Governments and industry must boldly experiment with solutions, such as new propulsion systems and rerouting aircraft, the authors say. “Eliminating aviation’s impact on global warming means upending the industry.”

For the first time, scientists have devised a technique to monitor the thickness of Arctic sea ice year-round — even in the summer, when it’s most difficult to do.

The new method, outlined in a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, may help to fill a longstanding gap in the satellite record when it comes to sea ice thickness.

Since 1979, scientists have used satellites to keep a continuous eye on Arctic sea ice. Satellite images, collected year round, show how the total sea ice coverage area has steadily shrunk as the planet has warmed.

Special radar instruments on satellites also can measure the thickness of sea ice as it floats atop the ocean. These records suggest that sea ice is thinning over time as much of the Arctic’s oldest, thickest ice succumbs to the warming climate.

But there’s one major issue with the thickness record. It largely excludes the summer months.

During the warmest time of the year, the sea ice begins to melt and liquid water begins to pool on its surface. These melt ponds confuse the radar systems, making it difficult for them to differentiate ice from ocean and to accurately measure the thickness of ice floes.

There are other ways scientists can measure ice thickness during the summer. They can fly specially equipped planes over the Arctic Ocean, or they can send researchers into the field on ships to take the measurements in person. There are even special scientific buoys scattered throughout the Arctic that can help keep tabs on the changing ice.

But none of these methods provides the kind of complete, continuous picture of the entire Arctic Ocean that satellites do. That means there’s always something of a gap in the thickness record during the summer.

That’s a problem from a scientific standpoint. Complete, nonstop records are the gold standard for understanding how the Arctic is responding to climate change and for building climate models that can make long-term predictions about its future.

It’s a problem that Jack Landy, lead author of the new study, has pondered for several years now.

After wrapping up his doctorate in Canada, Landy was looking for new projects to tackle. He’d just moved back to the United Kingdom and was finding that there were fewer opportunities for the kinds of field-based research he’d conducted while he was overseas. He started thinking about problems that could be solved from afar.

“This was one of the clear kind of gaps in the knowledge that we had,” said Landy, currently a scientist at University of Tromsø — The Arctic University of Norway. “There’s been, for more than 20 years, this gap in summer thickness observations that we get from satellite altimetry. So it just seemed like a really interesting and exciting project to try to target.”

It also proved a major challenge.

“The reason that it’s taken so long has been that it’s a very challenging project to get good results on,” Landy said.

Over the last few years, more collaborators got involved with the project. The new paper, published this week, includes a dozen authors from institutions across Europe and North America.

The team turned to machine learning, a kind of artificial intelligence, for the solution. One of the fundamental challenges for measuring ice thickness in summer is differentiating between melt pools on the ice and the ocean itself. The researchers applied a machine learning technique to satellite data to distinguish the ice floes.

They also built a model of the radar system’s response to the melting ice and compared it with actual satellite data — a technique that allowed them to make corrections to the radar system’s measurements as necessary. This method ultimately helped them construct an accurate summertime record of sea ice thickness.

When looking at the complete, year-round record, the scientists found that sea ice thickness is a good predictor of sea ice extent, or the total area it covers on the ocean surface. Thinner ice, unsurprisingly, melts and disappears faster.

The study suggests that data on sea ice thickness during the summer can help predict the total area of ice that’s left over in September, when the summer ends. That’s useful when making forecasts for shipping traffic.

The new method could prove useful in other ways, too.

It can help improve the model simulations that scientists use to make projections about the Arctic’s future. Shrinking sea ice affects the Arctic’s delicate ecosystem and the human societies who depend on it. It also affects the rate at which the Arctic warms. And the speed of Arctic warming, studies suggest, can affect weather and climate patterns elsewhere around the globe. That makes these projections important not only for Arctic communities but for the entire world.

Improving the models is “one of the most exciting potential impacts” of the study, according to Landy. So far, much of the ice thickness data that’s been used to construct the models comes from wintertime observations. The new method opens up the possibility of using the best data from all year.

“All the processes that control how the ice breaks up in the summers have had no thickness data to test against,” Landy said. “The rate of sea ice melting, how much it breaks up and shatters and thins — all these things have been missing observations.”

LISBON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Portugal's flag carrier TAP told customers on Thursday that hackers had stolen some of their personal data and published it on the dark web, although the state-owed airline said all payment details appeared to be safe.

TAP said in a letter to customers the cyber attack last month obtained from its servers people's names, nationalities, email and home addresses, phone contacts and frequent flier numbers.

""The release of the personal data via open sources could increase the risk of their illegal use, namely aimed at obtaining other data that could compromise the digital systems in fraudulent attempts such as phishing,"" TAP said.

""There are no signs that any payments data have been retrieved from TAP systems,"" it said. The airline also said it had taken immediate containment measures to keep its systems working and to protect other data.

It urged customers to be wary of unsolicited contacts requesting personal information, and told them not to click on links and attachments in suspicious emails. TAP also recommended changing passwords to stronger ones and said it would abstain from further contact with individual clients about the issue to avoid confusion.

TAP CEO Christine Ourmieres-Widener told reporters the airline was ""very serious about client data"" and said the incident was upsetting.

She would not disclose the number of affected clients, which some local media have put at around 1.5 million, saying that such estimates did not necessarily correspond to facts. She promised additional further investment in cybersecurity.

Portugal's military has recently been the target of a cyberattack in which hundreds of classified NATO documents were allegedly stolen and put up for sale on the dark web, Diario de Noticias newspaper reported. Portuguese authorities have not acknowledged the breach but said they were investigating whether there had been one.

For starters, Palo Alto has been growing at an impressive pace consistently over the past few years, driven by growth in cybersecurity spending, the company's impressive market share, and its acquisition-based growth strategy. Not surprisingly, Palo Alto's market capitalization has grown at a healthy pace since it made its stock market debut a decade ago.

Palo Alto currently has a market cap of just over $52 billion, which is a massive increase from around $4 billion a decade ago. So the company is a long, long way from hitting a $1 trillion market cap right now. But thanks to its terrific growth and the secular opportunity in the cybersecurity market, it wouldn't be surprising to see Palo Alto become a trillion-dollar stock in the long run. But can the company hit that milestone by 2035? Let's find out.

Palo Alto Networks' outstanding growth is here to stay

Palo Alto Networks finished its latest fiscal year with $5.5 billion in revenue. That's a jump of 21x when compared to the company's fiscal 2012 revenue of $255 million. It is worth noting that global cybersecurity spending stood at $60 billion in 2012, according to Gartner. That figure is expected to hit $172 billion in 2022.

So Palo Alto Networks has grown at a faster pace than the market it operates in over the past decade. More specifically, Palo Alto management pointed out in the company's fiscal Q4 2022 presentation that its revenue is growing at twice the pace of its total addressable market (TAM).

This can be attributed to Palo Alto's solid share in fast-growing cybersecurity niches such as virtual firewalls and cloud security. Global cybersecurity spending is expected to exceed $1 trillion a year by 2035, according to the World Economic Forum. So Palo Alto's end-market opportunity is set to grow at a faster pace over the next 13 years compared to the past decade.

The cybersecurity specialist is well placed to grow at a faster pace than the overall market over the next decade or so. That's because the company has been attracting more customers, gaining a bigger share of their wallets, and is aggressively rolling out new products to capitalize on the end-market opportunity.

In fiscal 2022, for instance, Palo Alto released 49 new major products. That was a big increase compared to 22 new major products released in fiscal 2020 and 29 new ones in fiscal 2021. The addition of new products is helping Palo Alto secure its long-term growth.

The company points out that it is the market leader in 11 cybersecurity categories. In the virtual firewall market, for instance, Palo Alto had 34.5% share at the end of 2021, an increase of 6.1 percentage points over the prior-year period. Its share of firewall appliances stood at 27% at the end of last year, up from 21.7% at the end of the previous year. Palo Alto's solid share of this market bodes well for the company's future, as the global next-generation firewall market is expected to be worth $9.6 billion in 2027, compared to $4.4 billion last year.

The combination of solid market share and end-market growth also reflects in the increase in customer spending on Palo Alto's offerings. For instance, the number of customers who spent more than $1 million in bookings in the trailing 12 months on Palo Alto's offerings increased nearly 26% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

The company's remaining performance obligations, which refers to the total value of customer contracts signed yet to be fulfilled, jumped 40% year-over-year last quarter to $8.2 billion. For comparison, Palo Alto anticipates $6.85 billion to $6.90 billion in revenue this year, an increase of 25% over last year, which means that the company has solid revenue visibility going forward.

Can it become a trillion-dollar company?

Analysts expect Palo Alto's earnings to increase at an annual pace of 26% for the next five years, which would be an improvement over the 17% annual growth it has clocked over the last five. However, the catalysts discussed above indicate that Palo Alto could sustain such levels of growth for a longer period, though there is a possibility that it may grow at a faster pace thanks to the booming cybersecurity opportunity.

Palo Alto delivered $7.56 per share in adjusted earnings in fiscal 2022, which ended on July 31, which translates into $2.52 per share after accounting for the stock split. Applying a 26% annual growth rate to the latest fiscal year's earnings would lead us to adjusted earnings of $50.84 per share in fiscal 2035. Multiplying that by Palo Alto's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 49 would translate into a stock price of nearly $2,500.

Palo Alto stock was trading at around $175 recently, which means that the stock could multiply 14 times in 13 years at the assumed rate of earnings growth. Multiplying the company's current market cap of $52 billion by that number suggests that Palo Alto's market capitalization in 2035 could be around $730 billion.

While that would still be short of the $1 trillion milestone, investors shouldn't forget that it would still be a huge increase over where the company is right now. As such, Palo Alto Networks looks like a top cybersecurity stock that investors may want to buy right now and keep holding for a long, long time.",cybersecurity,motley fool

The bug was found by security researcher Andy Nguyen, who goes by theflow0 and has been called a “famous PlayStation hacking god” by the video game website Kotaku.

“I found it on the PS4 and then two years later on the PS5. It seems like their patch somehow got reverted when doing FreeBSD9 to FreeBSD11 migration,” Nguyen told Motherboard, referring to the Linux distribution that underpins the PlayStation’s operating system.

“Imagine being so good at hacking that you find bugs in consoles that don’t exist”

Last year, Nguyen hinted that he had been able to jailbreak his PlayStation 5 by tweeting a picture of the console’s debug settings, which should only be accessible if the console is jailbroken.

Jailbreaking a PlayStation allows the user to install emulators for other consoles, play pirated games, as well as unlock certain features that are not normally available. The disadvantages are that Sony may block a jailbroken console from using network features, preventing the user from playing online games.

On January 4 of this year, Nguyen reported the bug to Sony and wrote that he had already reported the same vulnerability in 2020, “when the PS5 did not yet exist, thus this should be considered as a new report and not a duplicate.”

“Imagine being so good at hacking that you find bugs in consoles that don’t exist,” Matt Suiche, a security researcher, joked on Twitter in response to the news.

Do you do cybersecurity research on video games or video game consoles? Or do you develop cheats for games or reverse engineer anti-cheat software? We’d love to hear from you. You can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, Wickr/Telegram/Wire @lorenzofb, or email lorenzofb@vice.com

The bug allowed him to get access to the PlayStation 5’s kernel, the core part of the console’s operating system, which has access and controls most of its functions, Nguyen said. He also said he didn’t want to blame Sony for this mistake, because sometimes companies reintroduce bugs that had already been patched.

Sony patched the bug for the PlayStation 5 on Tuesday, and rewarded Nguyen with a bounty of $10,000. Nguyen received the same amount as a reward in 2021.

Nguyen explained that the bug he found was only one of a chain of bugs needed to fully jailbreak the PlayStation 5. And as of today, there are no public jailbreaks for Sony’s new console, which also means there are no unofficial apps or emulators like there are for the PlayStation 4, for which there is a public jailbreak.

Sony did not respond to a request for comment.

Last week, another security researcher found a way to hack the PS4 and the PS5 by exploiting the official PS2 emulator that Sony provides for its two most recent consoles.

The researcher, who goes by CTurt, explained in a blog about his research that by hacking the official PS2 emulator he could run unofficial apps, other emulators, and “even some pirated commercial PS4 games.”

One of the advantages of exploiting the PS2 emulator is that Sony can not patch it, according to CTurt,

“Because the emulator is bundled as a game, not part of the OS,” CTurt told Motherboard, “Sony has no readily available options to revoke access to it.”",cybersecurity,vice news

Additionally, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed his apprehensions over looming recession fears. He said, “No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be.”

Benchmark indices continue to suffer heavy losses amid deteriorating investors’ sentiments. The S&P 500 has lost 20.5% year-to-date. Moreover, Economist Nouriel Roubini sees further rate hikes in both November and December and a recession occurring at the end of 2022 that could last all of the following year.

He opined, “It’s not going to be a short and shallow recession; it’s going to be severe, long, and ugly.” Also, he added, “Even in a plain vanilla recession, the S&P 500 can fall by 30%.”

Given the uncertainties ahead, we think high-risk stocks Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD), Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH), Crocs, Inc. (CROX), Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY), and Riot Blockchain, Inc. (RIOT) might be best avoided now.

Think of your website as your home base. It’s where most of your customers go to get information about your brand and what you offer. So if you don’t have a good website, it can deter customers and result in fewer conversions and sales.

As the website is so critical, however, it can often become a point of frustration for many businesses. Getting your website just right can take time, and it can be overwhelming if you don’t know where to start or aren’t having any success.

There are many aspects of web design, and knowing which areas to focus on throughout the process can be challenging, as there is no one right way to go about it. Is functionality more important? Aesthetics? User experience? Security?

These are all reasonable things to worry about when you are trying to design a new website. But the answer can vary depending on your brand and your company’s specific needs or goals.

Below, we’ll explore the different elements of web design to help you understand what they are and which ones might be a priority over others, depending on your brand.

The first step in deciding your web design priorities is to go through all the different elements and think about them in terms of your company’s specific needs and goals. The web design process can be different for every brand, so just because one company does it one way does not mean you should do the same.

For some, the user experience might be the most important element of web design, for others, it might be cybersecurity. In the end, all of the below elements are important and should be included, but when you are just starting out, and perhaps don’t have the time or money to focus on them all, it’s helpful to identify each one to determine what is most important for your business's specific needs.

Brand Awareness

If you are a new business, brand awareness should be one of your top priorities. You need people to know about your brand in the first place before they will even go looking for your website. Once they do get to your website, your brand identity should be clear and easy to recognize.

Focusing on establishing your brand identity through brand awareness will help you connect with people so they will remember you. In doing this, you will start to establish a new customer base, and those customers will become more loyal to your brand and recommend you to others.

Think of brand identity as your first impression. If you leave a bad first impression, you aren’t going to attract any customers to your new business, but if you leave a good first impression, you will more quickly establish yourself as a brand to keep an eye on, which means you will grow your customer base and start making sales.

So good branding is key when designing your website as a new business. This means having an appealing logo, a good brand story that tells customers who you are and what you value, and other memorable brand elements and aesthetics, such as appealing and recognizable color schemes and imagery.

User Experience

If your company heavily relies on pleasing your customers, as most should, user experience should be one of your top priorities. Customer-focused businesses tend to have more success because they put the effort into prioritizing their customer's wants and needs. The more you show your customers that you care about them and their experience, rather than seeing them as dollar signs, the more likely you are to have success growing your business.

So, if you are a B2C business, user experience (UX) design is essential. B2B businesses should also have good UX design, but it is even more crucial when you are B2C and trying to appeal to large customer bases, as 50% of consumers believe that UX affects their opinion of a business.

You can create a better user experience by following these steps:

Understand who your target customer is — You can do this by creating a customer persona — essentially a description summary of most of your customer’s demographics. This can include their age, identity, experiences, and even their location. Identify the problem — Listen to your customers. They may typically encounter a common problem among your site or other sites during their purchasing process. You can gain this data through surveys or other customer service queries. Solve the problem — Once you find out what common issues your target customers experience, brainstorm ideas on how your business or your site’s features can solve that problem.

All of this indicates that UX design is often primarily about function. It’s about designing a website that is providing the best experience possible for your customers by solving their problems and giving them what they need.

So, if you are an e-commerce business, for example, how easy and satisfactory your website’s shopping and checkout process plays a significant role in the overall customer experience. In this case, your UX design should focus on making it easy for your customers to find the products they are looking for and checkout without running into any major issues.

SEO

SEO, or search engine optimization, is technically important for all businesses. Optimizing your content will ensure you rank higher in Google search results, which means you will drive more traffic to your website and, thus, be more likely to increase conversions and sales.

If you are a unique business that is offering something that most others are not, then you can likely get away with putting SEO on the back burner. However, if you have a lot of competitors that offer similar products or services, SEO should be a priority.

If a customer is looking for lawnmowers, for example, and they do a simple Google search for lawnmowers, there are likely a ton of websites that will pop up in the search results. So if you sell lawnmowers, you want to prioritize SEO to make sure your website ranks higher in search results; otherwise, competitors might constantly beat you to the punch.

If you sell something more unique, however, like knitted hats for dogs, there are potentially not as many other businesses that sell the same thing. So if someone is searching for dog hats or knitted dog hats, your website might automatically show up higher in search results without SEO because there aren’t many other options out there.

Cybersecurity

Ensuring the data on your website is secure is always a wise decision if you want to avoid cyber attacks — but some businesses should worry about this more than others. FinTech companies, for example, that deal with a lot of sensitive data should make cybersecurity a priority.

B2B companies, as well, that deal with major clients that expect them to keep their information private and secure should also focus on quality website security. Essentially any company that keeps a lot of sensitive data on their website, or asks for client information through online forms, should be prioritizing the safety and security of their clients and their company.

Wrapping Up

There are numerous other things that your business might want to consider when building a new website, but brand awareness and design, UX design, SEO, and cybersecurity are four of the primary elements of web design that tend to matter most. So it’s important to take a close look at these four things to determine which ones should be a priority. Once you get the most important elements out of the way, you can start to work on the rest of your web design as time and budget allows.",cybersecurity,noupe.com

A new report from security awareness training platform KnowBe4 shows that annual security training reduces that percentage to 17 percent.

But it's regular repetition that creates the most significant change. When quarterly training is given 15 percent don't know what to do. But those who have completed monthly training show the best results, with only 12 percent not knowing who to contact.

The report also looks at training frequencies across industries, with education, technology and healthcare and pharmaceuticals coming in lowest on monthly training, meanwhile, hospitality and transportation are leading with 28 and 20 percent respectively training monthly. Across the board increasing the frequency at which employees complete security awareness training has an almost universal positive influence.

KnowBe4's CEO Stu Sjouwerman says, ""Monthly training brings about an improved understanding of the terminology and knowledge about why the procedures are in place, as well as the correct channels for communication of threats. As the data demonstrates, ensuring that this vital information is communicated regularly is a necessary step in securing an organisation of any size and contributes to creating a stronger security culture.""

Britain’s top spies at GCHQ have released a puzzle book for children while challenging the public to solve one of its brainteasers.

In its latest puzzle book – the agency has previously published two for adults – children will be tested on languages, engineering, codebreaking, analysis, maths, coding and cybersecurity.

Puzzles for Spies is intended to inspire the UK’s next generation of agents, GCHQ said. It has also released a brainteaser to test the nation’s spy capabilities.

People are challenged to colour in a fruit bowl using only four colours, so that the pear is green, the orange is orange, the apple is red and the banana is yellow.

But no two touching shapes can have the same colour, illustrating a theory from 1852 that suggests that no more than four colours are required to colour in a picture so that no touching shapes have the same colour.

GCHQ’s unofficial chief puzzler, who identified himself only as Colin, said: “You don’t have to be a quiz champion, or even top of the class, to work at GCHQ.

“You just need to have an interest in figuring things out and an infectious curiosity. This is why so many of us are so fond of puzzles.

“We don’t spend all of our time putting together jigsaws and filling out crosswords, but creating and solving puzzles in our spare time requires the same skills which our teams use when tackling new problems in different and inventive ways to help keep the nation safe. It’s also really fun.”

The agency said last month that it wanted to boost the number of female coders in its ranks, and that it needed to improve diversity to tackle threats ranging from foreign states to children’s online safety.",cybersecurity,the guardian

Experts will share best practices and resources to help small businesses protect against cyber-attacks.

“America’s small businesses are pivoting to digital technologies and online strategies at historic rates to reach new customers and improve operational efficiencies, but that pivot has also exposed them to significant new threats from cyberattacks,” SBA Administrator Casillas Guzman said in a written statement.

News of the summit comes more than a week after a cyberattack on Suffolk County, disrupting its ability to deliver services and pointing to the need for cyber-defense. These attacks are a growing threat to small businesses and the nation’s economy. The cost of cybercrimes against the small businesses hit $2.4 billion in 2021, according to the Internet Crime Report from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Because they often lack the security infrastructure of larger businesses, small businesses make for attractive targets because they have the kind of information wanted by cybercriminals .

And many small businesses recognize that risk. An SBA survey found that 88% of owners felt their business was vulnerable to a cyberattack. Yet many cannot afford professional IT solutions, have limited time to devote to cybersecurity or unsure as to where to begin to protect their businesses.

“Our SBA team has mobilized to support them against these potentially disruptive threats with cybersecurity resources and trainings across our resource partner networks, as well as through our recently launched Small Business Digital Alliance. Launching the SBA’s first annual Cybersecurity Summit will help us build on that work and ensure America’s 33 million small businesses and innovative startups can pivot safely online and grow resilient businesses,” Guzman said in the statement.

The summit features 10 segments that offer practical tips, problem-solving strategies, case studies, industry trends, threat avoidance and employee-skills training.

Invited guests include experts from the SBA, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigations, Small Business Development Centers, business chambers, state government partners and more.

Registration for the event is open to all and free. Sign up at www.bit.ly/SBACyberSummit.",cybersecurity,libn.com

Unleashes unparalleled service coverage, performance, and resilience

PARIS and SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Orange Business Services, a global network-native digital services company, Orange Cyberdefense, a leading cybersecurity services provider, and Netskope, a leader in secure access service edge (SASE), are partnering to deliver a new SSE (Security Service Edge) solution embedded into the Orange Telco Cloud Platform. The enhanced solution is designed to deliver optimal performance with maximized security, meaning enterprises will no longer need to find a compromise between the two.

A decade of shifting to cloud and mobile computing, along with the ever-present demands of hybrid work environments, have put security and networking requirements on a collision course. While SSE addresses the security challenges, enterprises need to incorporate them into overarching connectivity strategies to realize the full benefits of SASE.

The partnership will leverage Orange Cyberdefense's security expertise and Netskope's global security private cloud footprint and SSE leadership, enabling Orange Business Services to deliver consistent internet security on and off the network. This will help protect enterprise customers from data loss and the growing volume of sophisticated threats across cloud, web and private applications, with the full attributes of a cloud-native platform.

The co-managed solution will reduce complexity for enterprises, providing continuously updated cloud security via the Orange Business Services Telco Cloud Platform. Telco Cloud Platform is a revolution in the way networks are built, run, and managed with enhanced performance. The software-defined approach optimized for telco workloads allows for greater agility and cost reduction.

Optus, Australia’s second-largest telecom, has disclosed that customers’ personal data may have been compromised in a cyberattack against the company.

Optus said on Thursday that it was investigating the possible unauthorised access of customer information, including names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and driver’s licence and passport numbers.

The Sydney-based telecom said it had “shut down” the attack immediately after its discovery and was not anywhere of any customers suffering harm, but advised customers to have “heightened awareness” about usual or fraudulent activity on their accounts.

The company said it was working with Australia’s cybersecurity centre to address any risks to customers and had notified the police and the country’s information commissioner about the attack. It did not specify when the attack occurred or how many customers may be affected.

Optus services, voicemails and texts, payment details, and account passwords were not compromised in the hacking, the company said.

“We are devastated to discover that we have been subject to a cyberattack that has resulted in the disclosure of our customers’ personal information to someone who shouldn’t see it,” Optus Chief Executive Officer Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said in a statement.

“As soon as we knew, we took action to block the attack and began an immediate investigation. While not everyone may be affected and our investigation is not yet complete, we want all of our customers to be aware of what has happened as soon as possible so that they can increase their vigilance.”

Bayer Rosmarin added that the company was “very sorry” about the incident and “engaging with all the relevant authorities and organisations, to help safeguard our customers as much as possible.”

The cyberattack is the latest in a string of recent data breaches and cyberattacks involving leading companies, with September alone seeing related announcements by Samsung, North Face, American Airlines, Uber and Rockstar.

Trevor Long, a technology industry analyst based in Sydney, Australia, speculated the incident could turn out to be biggest breach of personal data involving an Australian company.

“It is reprehensible that Optus has not yet notified customers and didn’t make the announcement as a media alert and instead just posted it on their media site,” Long told Al Jazeera.

“We are always at risk, and this will happen again and again – sadly. The best we can do is regularly change our passwords, ensure we have two factor authentication in all places, and regularly check our financial accounts and credit report for any unauthorised activity.”",cybersecurity,al jazeera english

121,Why CrowdStrike Stock Is Tumbling Today,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/702088/gettyimages-1128461315.jpg,22/09/2022,The Federal Reserve isn't slowing down its interest rate hikes and investors are nervous.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/why-crowdstrike-stock-is-tumbling-today/,"What happened

Shares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD -4.34%) were falling today following the Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to hike the federal funds rate by an additional 75 basis points.

The tech stock was down by 5.1% as of 1:58 p.m. ET.

So what

High-growth technology stocks are especially vulnerable to the Fed's decision as an increase in interest rates makes it more expensive for companies to borrow money.

Rising interest rates have also caused Treasury yields to rise. When Treasury yields go up, a company's future cash flows are worth less than they would have been if rates had remained lower.

CrowdStrike investors are processing all of this today and are likely increasingly concerned that the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes could end up spurring a recession.

Despite those worries, CrowdStrike's results for the fiscal second quarter (which ended on July 31) proved the company has been financially resilient so far. CrowdStrike beat Wall Street's consensus estimates for both the top and bottom lines and even raised its full-year guidance -- which is nearly unheard of among most tech stocks right now.

Now what

The Fed's recent interest rate hike overshadowed an analyst's latest buy rating for CrowdStrike. MoffettNathanson analyst Sterling Auty initiated coverage of CrowdStrike today with a buy rating and a $280 price target -- a significant upside from the company's current share price of $161.

But investors appear to be focused on recession worries right now. The Federal Reserve said that it expects to continue raising rates into 2023, which has left CrowdStrike investors -- and the market in general -- worried that the Fed could end up tipping the U.S. economy into a recession.",cybersecurity,motley fool

The new NetWitness MDR Service helps customers address the ongoing cyber skills shortage…,https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/09/22/netwitness-mdr-service/,"NetWitness announced a new Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service to enable companies to leverage NetWitness for expanded cybersecurity in a fully outsourced model.

The new NetWitness MDR Service helps customers address the ongoing cyber skills shortage while keeping their organizations well-protected from attacks by combining technology, planning, training, and managed detection into a single, complete offering.

Organizations around the globe value NetWitness Platform XDR for its broad and effective threat detection and response capabilities and its ability to address the never-ending and increasingly sophisticated attacks they face. Yet, tools are only part of the solution.

Ultimately, the success of cybersecurity depends on the availability of skilled security analysts and threat hunters, a major challenge due to an ongoing skills shortage. According to the (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study, 2021, there’s a worldwide gap of over 2.7 million cybersecurity professionals.

“NetWitness delivers outstanding security visibility, threat detection and response,” said Tod Ewasko, Chief Product Officer at NetWitness. “Yet, cybersecurity also requires experienced and skilled professionals, especially for powerful tools like NetWitness XDR. As customers struggle with the current staffing and skills shortages, trusted services like NetWitness Managed Detection and Response and Incident Response offer a winning strategy.”

“We’ve worked shoulder-to-shoulder with NetWitness customers for decades, helping them respond to ever-more-dangerous incidents,” said David Gaik, Senior Director, NetWitness Professional Services. “It’s a natural evolution to offer an MDR service that assures effective detection and response 24/7, so customers receive the maximum benefit of the NetWitness Platform XDR solution, all the time.”

Customers increasingly request an MDR service that works closely with NetWitness XDR.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have issued a joint advisory detailing the cyberattacks that Iranian threat actors conducted against the Albanian government in July 2022.

Attributed to state-sponsored Iranian advanced persistent threat (ATP) actors referred to as ‘HomeLand Justice’, the attack disrupted the Albanian government’s websites and services.

As a result of the incident, Albania cut diplomatic ties with Iran and the US announced sanctions against entities in Iran. According to Microsoft, at least four different Iranian threat actors were involved in the hacks.

In a joint advisory this week, CISA and the FBI have shared details on the timeline of activity associated with the incident, as well as technical information on some of the files the hackers used during the attack.

According to the two agencies, the attackers had access to the Albanian government’s network for roughly 14 months before launching the crippling attack, which involved both ransomware and a wiper.

During this timeframe, the attackers periodically accessed compromised email accounts, exfiltrated emails, and conducted credential harvesting, lateral movement, and network reconnaissance.

In July 2022, the adversaries deployed ransomware on compromised systems and left anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq (MEK) messages on multiple computer desktops. They also deployed a variant of the ZeroCleare destructive malware.

In addition to ransomware and wiping malware, the attackers were observed using multiple webshells for persistence, as well as relying on RDP, SMB, and FTP for lateral movement. They also connected to IPs associated with the victim’s VPN and used Mimikatz for credential dumping.

In September 2022, after Albania publicly attributed the July attacks to Iran, the threat actors launched a new wave of assaults against the Albanian government, using similar TTPs and malware, CISA and the FBI note.

Read this blog to get an overview of EDR and MEDR solutions.",https://blogs.cisco.com/security/unscrambling-cybersecurity-acronyms-the-abcs-of-edr-and-medr-security,"In the first part of this blog series on Unscrambling Cybersecurity Acronyms, we provided a high-level overview of the different threat detection and response solutions and went over how to find the right solution for your organization. In this blog, we’ll do a deeper dive on two of these solutions – Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Managed Endpoint Detection and Response (MEDR). However, first let’s take a look back at the history of endpoint security solutions and understand how we got EDR and MEDR security solutions.

Evolution of endpoint security solutions

The very first endpoint security solutions started out as anti-virus solutions (AV) with basic security functionality that relied heavily on signature-based detection. These solutions were effective against known threats where a signature was created, but ineffective against unknown threats such as new and emerging attacks. That meant that organizations struggled to stay ahead of attackers, who were continuously evolving their techniques to evade detection with new types of malware.

To address this problem, AV vendors added detection technologies such as heuristics, reputational analysis, behavioral protection, and even machine learning to their solutions, which became known as Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP). These unified solutions were effective against both known and unknown threats and frequently used multiple approaches to prevent malware and other attacks from infecting endpoints.

As cyberattacks grew increasingly sophisticated though, many in the cybersecurity industry recognized that protection against threats wasn’t enough. Effective endpoint security had to include detection and response capabilities to quickly investigate and remediate the inevitable security breach. This led to the creation of EDR security solutions, which focused on post-breach efforts to contain and clean up attacks on compromised endpoints.

Today, most endpoint security vendors combine EPP and EDR solutions into a single, converged solution that provides holistic defense to customers with protection, detection, and response capabilities. Many vendors are also offering EDR as a managed service (also known as MEDR) to customers who need help in securing their endpoints or who don’t have the resources to configure and manage their own EDR solution. Now that we’ve gone over how endpoint security evolved into EDR and MEDR security solutions, let’s cover EDR and MEDR in more depth.

What are Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions?

EDR solutions continuously monitor your endpoints for threats, alert you in case suspicious activity is detected, and allow you to investigate, respond to and contain potential attacks. Moreover, many EDR security solutions provide threat hunting functionality to help you proactively spot threats in your environment. They’re often coupled with or part of a broader endpoint security solution that also includes prevention capabilities via an EPP solution to protect against the initial incursion.

As a result, EDR security solutions enable you to protect your organization from sophisticated attacks by rapidly detecting, containing, and remediating threats on your endpoints before they gain a foothold in your environment. They give you deep visibility into your endpoints while effectively identifying both known and unknown threats. Furthermore, you can quickly contain attacks that get through your defenses with automated response capabilities and hunt for hidden threats that are difficult to detect.

While EDR provides several benefits to customers, it has some drawbacks. Chief among them is that EDR security solutions are focused on monitoring endpoints only versus monitoring a broader environment. This means that EDR solutions don’t detect threats targeting other parts of your environment such as your network, email, or cloud infrastructure. In addition, not every organization has the security staff, budget, and/or skills to deploy and run an EDR solution. This is where MEDR solutions come into play.

What are Managed Endpoint Detection and Response (MEDR) solutions?

Managed EDR or MEDR solutions are EDR capabilities delivered as a managed service to customers by third-parties such as cybersecurity vendors or Managed Service Providers (MSPs). This includes key EDR functionality such as monitoring endpoints, detecting advanced threats, rapidly containing threats, and responding to attacks. These third-parties usually have a team of Security Operations Center (SOC) specialists who monitor, detect, and respond to threats across your endpoints around the clock via a ‘follow the sun’ approach to monitoring.

MEDR security solutions allow you to offload the work of securing your endpoints to a team of security professionals. Many organizations need to defend their endpoints from advanced threats but don’t necessarily have the desire, resources, or expertise to manage an EDR solution. In addition, a team of dedicated SOC experts with advanced security tools can typically detect and respond to threats faster than in-house security teams, all while investigating every incident and prioritizing the most critical threats. This enables you to focus on your core business while getting always-on security operations.

Similar to EDR though, one downside to MEDR security solutions is that they defend only your endpoints from advanced threats and don’t monitor other parts of your infrastructure. Moreover, while many organizations want to deploy EDR as a managed service, not everyone desires this. For example, larger and/or more risk-averse organizations who are looking to invest heavily in cybersecurity are typically satisfied with running their own EDR solution. Now, let’s discuss how to choose the right endpoint security solution when trying to defend your endpoints from threats.

Choosing the Right Endpoint Security Solution

As I mentioned in my previous blog, there isn’t a single correct solution for every organization. This logic applies to EDR and MEDR security solutions as well since each solution works well for different types of organizations, depending on their needs, resources, motivations, and more. Nevertheless, one major factor to consider is if you have or are willing to build out a SOC for your organization. This is important because organizations that don’t have or aren’t willing to develop a SOC usually gravitate towards MEDR solutions, which don’t require significant investments in cybersecurity.

Another factor to keep in mind is your security expertise. Even if you’re have or are willing to build a SOC, you may not have the right cybersecurity talent and skills within your organization. While you can always build out your security team, you may want to evaluate an MEDR solution because a lack of expertise makes it difficult to effectively manage an EDR solution. Finally, a common misconception is that you must choose between an EDR and a MEDR solution and that you cannot run both solutions. In reality, many organizations end up using both EDR and MEDR since MEDR solutions often complement EDR deployments.

I hope this information and key factors help you better understand EDR and MEDR solutions while acting as a guide to selecting the best endpoint security solution for your organization. For more details on the different cybersecurity acronyms and how to identify the right solution for your needs, stay tuned for the next blog in this series – Unscrambling Cybersecurity Acronyms: The ABCs of MDR and XDR Security.

129,This ancient unpatched Python security flaw could leave thousands of projects vulnerable,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8QNviZt3KrDbfWVANJrNM-1200-80.jpg,22/09/2022,Researchers warn of widespread issues with Python following resurgence of now-teenage security flaw.,https://www.techradar.com/news/this-ancient-unpatched-python-security-flaw-could-leave-thousands-of-projects-vulnerable,"Audio player loading…

A rather old unpatched Python security vulnerability has resurfaced, causing researchers to warn that hundreds of thousands of projects might be vulnerable to code execution.

Cybersecurity researchers from Trellix have recently spotted (opens in new tab) CVE-2007-4559, a flaw in the Python tarfile package, first discovered back in 2007.

However, back then, the flaw never received a patch, but rather just a warning published in a security bulletin.

Identifying vulnerable projects

The vulnerability is in code that uses un-sanitized tarfile.extract() function, or the built-in defaults of tarfileextractall(). “It’s a path traversal bug that enables an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files,” the publication wrote.

Now, researchers are saying, the flaw gives a bad actor access to the file system. Python’s bug tracker was updated with an announcement of a closed issue, with a further addition that “it might be dangerous to extract archives from untrusted sources.” The flaw is abusable both on Windows, and on Linux, it was said.

Fifteen years is a long time, and apparently, some 350,000 projects might be vulnerable. Trellix’s researchers first took a sample of 257 repositories(61%) were vulnerable. An automated analysis came back with a 65% positive rate.

Then, together with GitHub, Trellix’s researchers found 588,840 unique repositories that include “import tarfile” in its Python code, which drew them to the conclusion that 350,000 (or roughly 61%), might be vulnerable.

The problem is present in a “vast number” of industries, the researchers further found. The development (opens in new tab) sector is, unsurprisingly, the most impacted one, followed by web and machine learning technology.

Trellix’s researchers issued fixes for some 11,000 projects, available as a fork of the affected repository. These patches will be added to the main project via pull request at a later date, it was added. Another 70,000 projects should get their fixes within a couple of weeks, but for all to be remedied, it’s going to take a little while.",cybersecurity,techradar

131,Russia-Based Hackers FIN11 Impersonate Zoom to Conduct Phishing Campaigns,https://assets.infosecurity-magazine.com/webpage/og/b558471a-da26-4d2e-a400-7af063e7bf3d.png,22/09/2022,Cyfirma said the motive behind the attacks may be financial in nature,https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/russia-fin11-impersonate-zoom/,"The threat actors known as FIN11 (and Clop) may have impersonated web download pages of the Zoom Application to conduct phishing campaigns against targets worldwide.

The news comes from cybersecurity company Cyfirma, which published a new advisory about the threat on Wednesday.

“This threat actor is known for conducting a large–scale campaign using impersonated web applications,” reads the technical blog post.

“In this case, FIN11 was observed employing Zoom download pages to install an information stealer (Vidar) targeting a large attack surface. We also observed an IP address that was earlier associated with AsyncRAT.”

Further, the security experts said that the Russia–based threat actor FIN11 has also lately been associated with Clop ransomware for post–compromise ransomware deployment and data theft extortion.

“This association with the ransomware group increases the possibility of compromised systems becoming potential ransomware victims,” Cyfirma wrote.

In its latest investigation, the cybersecurity firm said it discovered several fake Zoom Video Communications download pages, all of which had the Russian Federation as the registrant country for all the hosts.

From a technical standpoint, the threat actor delivered malicious Zoom applications through phishing URLs masquerading as legitimate Zoom websites and apps.

Upon execution of a malicious “Zoom.exe” file, the malware drops “Decoder.exe,” which acts as a downloader to download additional payloads (a remote access Trojan (RAT) and an information stealer) alongside the legitimate Zoom app setup, the advisory explained. The injected MSBuild.exe also downloads dynamic link libraries (DLLs) related to information stealer Vidar.

In terms of the motive behind the attacks, Cyfirma said it believes they may be financial in nature.

“The Cyfirma research team believes with moderate confidence that financially motivated FIN11 is behind this campaign involving fake download pages of popular web applications used worldwide,” reads the advisory.

A list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) connected with FIN11 is available in the technical write–up. Its publication comes months after Five Eyes Agencies included systems compromised by FIN11 in a list of the most exploited vulnerabilities of 2021.",cybersecurity,infosecurity magazine

The groundbreaking partnership between ESA and an SES-led consortium, with the European Commission support, is advancing Europe to the front of space innovation with satellite-enabled QKD. Together with its European partners, SES will build the first sovereign European end-to-end space-based QKD system, developing and operating a dedicated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite and building a state-of-the-art QKD operations centre in Luxembourg. The project is co-funded by the ESA contribution of Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and the Czech Republic under ARTES, as well as the European Commission through Horizon Europe.

Using the EAGLE-1 system, ESA and the European Union Member States will achieve the first step to demonstrate and validate QKD technologies from low earth orbit to the ground. The EAGLE-1 project will provide valuable mission data for next generation Quantum Communication Infrastructures (QCIs), contributing for example to the EU plans to deploy a sovereign, autonomous cross-border quantum secure communications networks.

The EAGLE-1 satellite is due to launch in 2024 and will then complete three years of in-orbit mission supported by the European Commission. During this operational phase, the satellite will allow European Union governments and institutions as well as critical business sectors early access to long-distance QKD to path the way towards an EU constellation enabling ultra-secure data transmissions.

To implement the ultra-secure cryptographic key exchange system of EAGLE-1, the consortium will develop the QKD payload, terrestrial optical station, scalable quantum operational networks and key management system to interface with national QCIs.

Josef Aschbacher, ESA Director General, said, “ European space innovation has gained strong momentum both from a technology perspective and in terms of commercialisation. It allows us to develop and implement next-generation, future-proof projects in space across critical domains like secure communication, next-generation networks and cybersecurity. Led by ESA, partially financed by the European Commission and implemented by SES, EAGLE-1 is a major step towards making the secure and scalable European Quantum Communications Infrastructure a reality.”

Elodie Viau, Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications at ESA, said, “ In today’s increasingly interconnected world, keeping information secure is paramount. Robust encryption keys as well as technologies enabling their secure distribution are vital to this endeavour. We are proud to forge this partnership between ESA and a consortium led by SES to create the EAGLE-1 highly secure and autonomous quantum key distribution system. ESA enables the European space industry to succeed by federating industry around large-scale programmes, achieving competitive leaps forward.”

“ European security and sovereignty in a future world of quantum computing is critical to the success of Europe and its Member States,” said Steve Collar, CEO of SES. “ We are proud to leverage our multi-orbit credentials and our innovative platforms and solutions in partnership with ESA, the European Commission and the Luxembourg Government to advance quantum communications and implement the EAGLE-1 system, which is called to be a cornerstone for the development of secure and sovereign European networks of the future.”

When a state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government falls victim to a cyberattack, it impacts its digital networks and infrastructure. It also puts sensitive databases, personal identifiable information (PII) and constituents' trust at risk. As the attack surface expands and attacks become more sophisticated, local governments are falling prey to threat actors.

The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLGCP) is formally open, making $185 million in federal grant funding available for SLTT governments. It is the first installment of a four-year, $1 billion program created as a part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Funding provided through this program enables SLTT governments to implement cybersecurity solutions that address the growing threats and risks to their information systems.

Specifics on the application process

Now that the application period is open, in order to receive funding, eligible agencies (defined as states or territories) must:

Submit an initial application through the portal at www.grants.gov.

Submit a final application through the Non-Disaster (ND) Grants System by November 15, 2022.

Establish a Cybersecurity Planning Committee.

Submit a Cybersecurity Plan that meets the 16 requirements defined in IIJA and in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) and addresses the needs of local governments, including vulnerability management, prioritization and critical infrastructure protection.

More information about the application process and requirements can be found in the Department of Homeland Security Notice of Funding Opportunity (under the ""Related Documents"" tab) and on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security's SLCGP website. The 16 requirements for the Cybersecurity Plan are found on pages 68-70 of the NOFO under the ""Required Elements"" section of Appendix C.

How Tenable can help meet Cybersecurity Plan requirements

Tenable is uniquely positioned to help SLTT governments meet SLGCP grant requirements, like vulnerability management, prioritization and protecting critical infrastructure. Specifically, Tenable's capabilities can help meet 13 of the 16 Cybersecurity Plan requirements, including:

""Implement a process of continuous cybersecurity vulnerability assessments and threat mitigation practices prioritized by degree of risk to address cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity threats on information systems, applications, and user accounts owned or operated by, or on behalf of, the state or local governments within the state.""

""Implement an information technology and operational technology modernization cybersecurity review process that ensures alignment between information technology and operational technology cybersecurity objectives.""

""Manage, monitor, and track information systems, applications, and user accounts owned or operated by, or on behalf of, the state or local governments within the state, and the information technology deployed on those information systems, including legacy information systems and information technology that are no longer supported by the manufacturer of the systems or technology.""

To learn more about how Tenable helps address these requirements and more, review Meeting IIJA Grant Requirements with Tenable Technologies.

Our risk-based vulnerability management solutions help SLTT agencies bolster their cyber defenses and address common SLTT concerns, such as critical infrastructure protection, implementing a zero trust strategy, protecting against ransomware and securing Active Directory. SLTT governments can reduce risk and strengthen their defenses with the ability to see across their entire attack surface, predict which vulnerabilities attackers are most likely to exploit and act to remediate critical vulnerabilities.

Lumu has found that compromise is significantly different for small businesses than for medium-sized and large enterprises.

“There is no silver bullet for organizations to protect themselves from compromise, but there are critical steps to take to understand your potential exposure and make sure that your cybersecurity protocols are aligned accordingly,” says Ricardo Villadiego, CEO of Lumu.

“Year after year, we see that compromise stays undetected for long periods of time – 201 days on average with compromise detection and containment taking approximately 271 days. It’s critical for smaller businesses to know they are more susceptible and to get ahead of the curve with safeguards.”

Results from the Lumu Ransomware Assessment show a few reasons why attacks continue to stay undetected for such long periods of time:

58% of organizations aren’t monitoring roaming devices, which is concerning with a workforce that has embraced remote working

72% of organizations either don’t or only partially monitor the use of network resources and traffic, which is problematic given that most compromises tend to originate from within the network

Crypto-mining doesn’t appear to be a concern for the majority of organizations as 76% either do not know or only partially know how to identify it; however, this is a commonly used technique for cyber criminals

Additionally, threat data unveils attack techniques used and how they vary based on the size of the organization.

Small businesses are primarily targeted by malware attacks (60%) and are also at greater risk of Malware, Command and Control, and Crypto-Mining. Medium-sized businesses and large enterprises don’t see as much malware and are more susceptible to Domain Generated Algorithms (DGA). This type of attack allows adversaries to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains.",cybersecurity,help net security

142,Unleash your data’s power to ensure reliability and cybersecurity,https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt578f44dd8fe7ceaf/632dfaab0046bd180f976275/power-of-your-data.jpg,23/09/2022,Magnify the business impact of your data by consolidating platforms with search-powered technology.,https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-unleash-your-datas-power-to-ensure-reliability-and-cybersecurity,"Today’s distributed IT systems need to bring order to chaos. CIOs are tasked with managing seemingly endless amounts of data, but they can’t unlock insights without a system that breaks down silos to provide a unified view.

One solution many CIOs are considering, according to a recent study by Forrester Consulting commissioned by Elastic, is to deploy a consolidated platform based on search-powered technology that can analyze log data to simplify and optimize IT environments.

This creates a powerful one-two punch for IT teams: an observability and APM solution, combined with a security solution, both running on the same unified, search-powered technology platform.

A consolidated observability and security platform uses one of the most basic technology outputs — the log file — to reveal real-time insights in an IT ecosystem. Log files collect data on system errors, network traffic, device configurations, and much more.

Many IT teams are adopting open-source log analysis tools, which offer an economical, practical way to do things like flagging potential cyberattacks and creating a network outage map to diagnose the cause of downtime. However, as systems get more elaborate, IT teams need help plucking grains of insight from sand dunes of data.

Read this next: Observability can be the secret to enabling the board room

For example, Jaguar Land Rover, one of the world’s most celebrated luxury car brands, uses an observability platform to guide the development of increasingly sophisticated in-car computer systems. The platform’s anomaly detection helps engineers diagnose rare problems that crop up in the product development lifecycle.

“Our leadership teams and engineers are extremely busy, so it really reduces pressure when they only have to act on exceptions while allowing the technology to handle the rest,” said Andy Walker, Senior Project Manager at Jaguar Land Rover.

Another organization, WePay, a transaction management service, upgraded to an observability platform to help manage an increasingly sophisticated cloud-native development environment.

“We needed to consolidate our monitoring and compliance tools to streamline the log analytics and improve the performance of our infrastructure and applications,” said Kartik Deshpande, a software engineer with WePay.

The goal is to dig deep into log data to make IT environments observable. This pays off in two areas: monitoring and observability, and cybersecurity.

How logging factors in

Software developers lean heavily on log-data analysis tools, which are essential in distributed systems with multiple dependencies. A microservices infrastructure, for instance, could have dozens of event-driven services. Log data can reveal breakdowns in these systems.

Log-based observability platforms arose to solve common problems for software developers. Today, these same platforms can help enterprise IT teams understand what’s going right (and wrong) on their networks.

Logging software data has three subsets:

Telemetry: Data transmitted by applications and devices. Telemetry could include IP addresses, error codes, and installed system software.

Metrics: Measurements revealing the performance of a system. Metrics might include page-load times, downtime, and latency.

Traces: Visualizations of paths that data and resources take through a distributed system. Traces can help reveal breakdowns between interconnected services.

A powerful consolidated observability platform combines telemetry, metrics, and traces to provide comprehensive real-time insights on the health of an IT system.

Monitoring and observability

Robust log analysis tools allow IT teams to monitor users, network traffic, completed transactions, and other informative data points. A consolidated observability platform takes things to the next level, generating awareness that allows quick, intelligent responses to problems in three areas:

Applications: A modern, distributed ecommerce website often has separate applications or microservices services for transactions, translations, currencies, returns, and other operations. Observability reveals problems or breakdowns in these systems.

Environments: An ecommerce company folds its transaction platform into a technology environment with apps for logistics, marketing, personnel, and resource management. Observability technology helps break down data silos and pinpoint troublemakers.

Anomalies: If a network switch fails or a wildfire takes out a data center, logging systems send error messages that make it easier to get systems back online.

Observable applications and environments establish criteria for system health and flag deviations from standards. This provides a strong foundation for securing sensitive data.

Cybersecurity

Mobile computing and internet-of-things sensors exponentially increased the number of network endpoints, making it increasingly difficult to lock out intruders. A consolidated observability platform helps IT teams in two crucial cybersecurity disciplines:

Next-generation security information and event management (SIEM). Next-gen SIEM uses artificial intelligence and machine language (AI/ML) to notice subtle anomalies that older SIEM systems missed. AI/ML apps need massive datasets to improve accuracy over time without human intervention. An observability platform processes data in the volumes required for AI/ML.

Extended detection and response (EDR and XDR). EDR and XDR provide comprehensive detection and response across mobile devices, network endpoints, cloud environments, and other target-rich areas outside the traditional enterprise network perimeter.

“Complexity is only going up,” said Gagan Singh, VP of product marketing at Elastic. “You may not be aware of every aspect, every service, every infrastructure component” in your operating environment. “But you're still probably responsible for some aspect of maintaining it, operating it, and running it.”

With consolidated observability platforms, IT teams can see through a tangle of devices, apps, and data, and learn what’s really going on in their environments. That’s crucial to both reducing downtime and thwarting intruders.

146,2 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without Any Hesitation,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/701784/cybersecurity.jpg,22/09/2022,Strong results coupled with bright futures make these companies no-brainer buys.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/2-supercharged-tech-stocks-buy-without-hesitation/,"There are a lot of companies in the technology sector that put up strong results and are likely to have promising futures and positive shareholder returns. However, some of these companies also have significant risks that make investing in them less appealing.

No investment is risk free, but there are two companies I consider absolute no-brainer purchases and would recommend without hesitation. CrowdStrike (CRWD -4.34%) and The Trade Desk (TTD -3.56%) have seen their stock prices take a hit in 2022, but each has an important growth driver that will accelerate shareholder value.

An essential business that's growing with its users

Cybersecurity is an area of the market every investor should have some exposure to in their portfolio. With the rapid pace at which our world moves online, keeping data secure, both on physical devices and in the cloud, is only going to become more important.

CrowdStrike is a leader in artificial intelligence-driven, cloud-based security software that is winning over businesses at an impressive pace. Its software detects and prevents security risks and immediately adapts, pushing out what it has learned to the rest of its network and making all customers more secure.

The company ended its fiscal 2023 second quarter (ended July 31) with 19,686 subscription customers, up 51% year over year, and those customers include more than half of the Fortune 500.

Once customers are on board, they also spend more with the company over time. CrowdStrike had a dollar-based net retention rate of 124% at the end of fiscal 2022, and that figure has continued to climb since then. This means existing customers spent at least 24% more in the past 12 months than they did in the year prior. Additionally, 59% of customers have adopted five or more modules (products), and 36% have six or more.

CrowdStrike estimates its total addressable market could reach $126 billion by 2025. Even taking that estimate with a grain of salt, CrowdStrike's current annual recurring revenue is only $2.14 billion, which shows just how much potential growth is still in front of the company.

Riding the wave of connected TV

There are many reasons to like buy-side advertising platform The Trade Desk. The company has posted steady revenue growth year after year, and despite some lumpiness during the pandemic, it shows few signs of slowing down.

The Trade Desk's platform enables ad buyers to get the right ads in front of the right consumers at the right time. Traditionally, advertisers would need to decide where to spend their advertising budgets based on broad assumptions about who would see them. With programmatic advertising, ads can be placed using customer-specific targeting. As a result, these programmatic ads provide a better return for advertisers.

With each passing year, more ads are being served through connected TV (streaming) as opposed to linear TV (cable). Connected TV advertising spend was $14 billion in 2021, and it's expected to grow to $39 billion by 2026, showing the importance of this market to The Trade Desk. Connected TV is what allows programmatic ads to work.

On the second-quarter earnings call, connected TV (CTV) was mentioned more than 50 times with founder and CEO Jeff Green referring to it as a secular tailwind the likes of which he's never seen before. In the quarter, The Trade Desk outpaced the revenue growth of its competitors and gained market share, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. With its market positioning and a massive, growing opportunity, it's not hard to see The Trade Desk as a long-term winner for investors.

Buying the dip is icing on the cake

Both of these businesses are worth paying a premium for. However, because of the current bear market, these great businesses are trading for significant discounts from their recent highs. Both stocks have a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 21. To be clear, that's not at all cheap. But this valuation is the lowest Crowdstrike has seen since the start of the pandemic, and it's the historical average for The Trade Desk.

These companies have bright futures ahead of them and have continued to put up strong results in uncertain times. Both are worth buying right now without hesitation.",cybersecurity,motley fool
147,Commission expects to set the world’s cybersecurity standards for connected devices,https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/Margaritis-Schinas-800x450.jpg,22/09/2022,The European Commission contends that its new cybersecurity law will set the security bar for Internet of Things products worldwide and put European manufacturers at a competitive advantage.,https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/news/commission-expects-to-set-the-worlds-cybersecurity-standards-for-connected-devices/,"The European Commission contends that its new cybersecurity law will set the security bar for Internet of Things products worldwide and put European manufacturers at a competitive advantage.

The proposal for a Cyber Resilience Act was presented last week and introduced a security-by-design approach for all products with digital components. The idea is to oblige manufacturers to address vulnerabilities to facilitate consumer uptake of connected products. The Internet of Things sector is expected to boom in the coming years.

As anticipated by EURACTIV, the regulation includes a set of essential requirements product manufacturers would have to comply with throughout the product lifecycle, including by pushing security patches via automatic updates free of charge.

“This will impact not only the European Union. This will change the rules of the game globally, one way or another. Because they will copy us or because they will not have the tools to abide by our rules. This is good not only for the level of cybersecurity but for the competitiveness of Europe,” said Lorena Boix Alonso, the director of the Commission’s department in charge of cybersecurity, at a EURACTIV-hosted event earlier this week.

The ambition is to replicate the General Data Protection Regulation’s result via the Brussels effect. Namely, companies that adopted the EU rules to access the single market found it more convenient to apply them in their global operations than to create different products or processes.

“At the beginning, everyone was a little bit hesitant. Then, we saw that all other markets, including the American one, started to play by the rules as the European one,” said Joanna Swiatkowska, chief operating officer at the European Cyber Security Organisation, at the same event.

Swiatkowska added that the Cyber Resilience Act would likely boost the security level globally and create a market whereby cybersecurity is a competitive advantage. An incentive that, so far, has been missing from the picture.

The EU executive estimated that two-thirds of cyberattacks come from exploiting vulnerabilities in connected devices. At the same time, the product manufacturer knows more than half of the vulnerabilities when they launch the product on the market.

“It would be difficult for a burglar to get into your house or for a criminal group to tap your phone. In the cyber domain, these events are too common. It’s because we don’t always lock the door. When we do, sometimes the padlock does not work,” said Czech ambassador Jaroslav Zajicek.

That is because manufacturers are incentivised to launch a product on the market as early as possible rather than invest in its security if not obliged. Therefore, the new regulation is meant to bring the EU’s product safety legislation up to speed to cover this type of product with a risk-based approach.

“There are two ways to follow a risk-based approach. You either give different security requirements or assess the same requirements differently according to the level of risk. In this case, it was not appropriate to say that some products should be better protected than others,” Boix added.

The proposal specifies that, while all products will be bound to the same requirements, the conformity assessment procedure will be rigorous for certain product categories, such as mobile phones, card readers and all connected devices related to industrial use.

The Commission representative acknowledged that they expect intense debate about which products will fall under these classes. As is always the case when there is a list, lobbyists’ efforts focus on adding or deleting specific items.

“The proposal focuses on the industrial side of this challenge. From our side, there are some products that precisely because of the sensitivity of the intended use should also definitely be recognised as critical products,” said Cláudio Teixeira, a legal officer at the European consumer group BEUC.

Teixeira made the case of My Friend Cayla, a ‘smart doll’ that allowed children to access the internet via speech recognition software. The doll spurred a public backlash in Germany after it was revealed that hackers could easily access the doll to spy on or even speak to children. The German telecom authority consequently ruled the doll an ‘illegal espionage apparatus’..

For the consumer organisation, all products related to children and systems intended to keep the user safe in the physical world, such as smart homes and security alarms, should fall under the highest level of assurance.

Commission presents Cyber Resilience Act targeting Internet of Things products The Commission on Thursday (15 September) proposed its proposal for a Cyber Resilience Act, legislation aiming to address vulnerabilities in connected devices through a security-by-design approach.

This article follows the EURACTIV-organised policy debate EU Cybersecurity and Resilience – What challenges to create a common framework? supported by TIC Council.

148,How to Prevent Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) Attacks,https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/ciso/thumbnails/22/ransomware-as-a-service-tn.png,22/09/2022,Explore key insights on how ransomware as a service (RaaS) operators work to help you enhance your cybersecurity defenses.,https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/ciso/22/i/prevent-ransomware-as-a-service-raas-attacks.html,"This article will provide an overview of RaaS, its common families and techniques, and tips on how to prevent ransomware attacks and strengthen your cybersecurity posture.

What is Ransomware as a Service (RaaS)?

Credited as one of the reasons causing ransomware attacks to grow, RaaS, based on the SaaS model, involves selling or renting ransomware capabilities to buyers (called affiliates). Among the key players in this ecosystem are the operators, those who develop and sell the ransomware. They are usually part of a larger group with designated roles.

The following are some unique traits about RaaS:

Most RaaS operators recruit affiliates who perform the ransomware attack RaaS operators split the ransom amounts with their affiliates (splits can vary from a little to a lot, depending on how much the RaaS operator supports the attack) Ransomware kits can be very sophisticated to quite limited If law enforcement does make arrests, it typically will be the affiliates, not the RaaS gangs

How does ransomware as a service work?

RaaS operators figured out quickly that they couldn’t scale their operations alone, and the affiliate model had worked in the past in other areas of cybercrime. This allows them to scale globally and give them an ability to reap more profit without the overhead. The more people that purchase the ransomware, the more attacks, and victims.

Therefore, marketing and recruitment are just as important in the underground world; RaaS operators have invested as much as USD$1 million in recruitment efforts.

To ensure they can recruit affiliates, many RaaS operators have had to improve their offerings, since there are many competitors out their nowadays. This means more sophisticated tools, interfaces that allow the affiliate to track and manage their attacks, and even lists of potential victims they can supply to their affiliates.",cybersecurity,trendmicro.com

This series provides powerful insights into how passwordless authentication is terrible in theory and practice and how it weakens security cultures.

If you’ve been keeping up with cybersecurity industry news lately, you’ve probably seen a few headlines unabashedly declaring the death of the password and the dawn of the passwordless era. Some security tech brands are hedging their bets, spending millions on software development for passwordless authentication, and forking out obscene ad budgets to evangelize the password’s impending demise.

This series sheds light on the shortcomings of passwordless technology to help security professionals make the best decisions for their organizations. The series goes in-depth about what passwordless authentication looks like, gives examples of when passwordless technology failed, and explores how the new technology only fixes a symptom of the cybersecurity problem, not the root cause.

“The new school of thought is that passwordless authentication is the only way to fight the cybersecurity epidemic against hackers, but that’s far from the reality. Over the course of the past couple of months, we’ve seen how passwordless authentication has failed businesses and how threat actors broke in with ease. Our new whitepaper series highlights the drawbacks of passwordless authentication, why strong passwords can protect companies better, and how a good security culture is a key to being safer online,” said Steve Thomas, CEO, and Co-Founder of HackNotice.

This whitepaper series offers businesses insight into how an overreliance on passwordless technology is detrimental to a business's cyber strategy.

The US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has warned users of Medtronic's MiniMed 600 Series Insulin Pump System—specifically, models for MiniMed 630G and MiniMed 670G—that their medical devices have a cybersecurity issue with its communication protocol. If compromised, attackers could gain unauthorized access to the pump system itself, and alter it to deliver too much or too little insulin to the patient.

Because the MiniMed 600 series devices have components (the insulin pump, the blood glucose meter, the continuous glucose monitoring transmitter, and the CareLink USB device) that communicate wirelessly, nearby attackers could gain unauthorized access to them when the pump is paired with these components. Medtronic clearly stated that such an attack could not be done over the internet.

""Medtronic has no evidence to date that such an issue has occurred,"" the company's Urgent Medical Device Correction notification page states. ""However, in the unlikely event that unauthorized access would be successful, the access could be used to deliver too much or too little insulin through delivery of an unintended insulin bolus or because insulin delivery is slowed or stopped. Too much insulin could result in hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) which can potentially lead to seizure, coma or death. Too little insulin could result in hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) which can potentially lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.""

The FDA continues to work with Medtronic to identify, communicate, and prevent the devices' vulnerability effects. Medtronic advises taking action and the necessary precautions to avoid being at risk. First, the company advises users to turn off the ""Remote Bolus"" feature of the pump, which is on by default.

The company also reminded users to keep their insulin pump and its components within their control at all times, never confirm connection requests on the pump screen unless initiated by them or their care partner, and not share their insulin pump's or device's serial numbers with anyone but their healthcare provider, distributor, and Medtronic.

The learning curve is steep, there are few people with adequate AI experience, and the rules of governance are unclear.

That explains Gartner's 2020 statistic that only 53% of AI pilot programs actually make it to deployment. The tools and experience needed are just not there for the average IT shop, especially a smaller enterprise.

Nvidia is looking to change that with a pair of AI-related alliances with consulting giants Deloitte and Booz Allen Hamilton. Both deals are designed to help enterprises plot AI strategies and gain access to Nvidia technology and expertise.

Deloitte and Nvidia already have an alliance, and this is an expansion of it. Deloitte’s consultants will have access to the Nvidia AI and Nvidia Omniverse enterprise platforms to help clients build and deploy a wide range of AI applications, including edge AI, speech AI, recommender systems, chatbots, cybersecurity, digital twins and more.

Additionally, Nvidia DGX A100 systems are available through Deloitte’s Center for AI Computing for building and testing AI applications.

“Building on our relationship with Nvidia, we are bringing together our top talent pool and deep AI experience with the power of Nvidia AI and Omniverse platforms to help clients accelerate the development of AI-fueled solutions,” said Joe Ucuzoglu, CEO of Deloitte US, in a statement.

Separately, Nvidia and enterprise consulting firm Booz Allen announced they are partnering to deliver AI-enabled cybersecurity built on Nvidia’s Morpheus platform, an open-source, scalable, GPU-accelerated, security processing framework. It's designed to inspect network traffic in real-time and flag anomalies while addressing any potential threats.

The latest release of Morpheus includes updates to pre-built workflows, including new visualization capabilities for digital fingerprinting and sensitive information detection. The new solution announced with Booz Allen is based on this latest version of Morpheus.

Called Cyber Precog, the Booz Allen-developed software platform is designed to provide mission-relevant AI models and modular pipelines for rapid deployment at the edge. Using the Nvidia GPUs, Cyber Precog can ingest data 300x the rate of CPUs, while boosting AI training by 32x and AI inference by 24x, the companies claim.",cybersecurity,network world
154,CISA warns of critical ManageEngine RCE bug used in attacks,https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2021/08/19/CISA_headpic.jpg,22/09/2022,The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical severity Java deserialization vulnerability affecting multiple Zoho ManageEngine products to its catalog of bugs exploited in the wild. [...],https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-warns-of-critical-manageengine-rce-bug-used-in-attacks/,"The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical severity Java deserialization vulnerability affecting multiple Zoho ManageEngine products to its catalog of bugs exploited in the wild.

This security flaw (CVE-2022-35405) can be exploited in low-complexity attacks, without requiring user interaction, to gain remote code execution on servers running unpatched Zoho ManageEngine PAM360 and Password Manager Pro (without authentication) or Access Manager Plus (with authentication) software.

Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code and a Metasploit module (targeting this bug to gain RCE as the SYSTEM user) have been available online since August.

""The exploit POC for the above vulnerability is available in public,"" ManageEngine warned customers in July when it issued security patches to address this issue.

""We strongly recommend our customers to upgrade the instances of Password Manager Pro, PAM360 and Access Manager Plus immediately.""

After being added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, all Federal Civilian Executive Branch Agencies (FCEB) agencies now must patch their systems against this bug exploited in the wild according to a binding operational directive (BOD 22-01) issued in November.

The federal agencies have three weeks, until October 13th, to ensure that their networks are protected from exploitation attempts.

All orgs urged to prioritize patching this flaw

Even though BOD 22-01 applies to U.S. FCEB agencies only, the U.S. cybersecurity agency also strongly urged all organizations from private and public sectors worldwide to prioritize patching this bug.

Following this advice and applying patches ASAP will decrease the attack surface attackers could use in attempts to breach their networks.

""These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise,"" CISA explained on Thursday.

Since this binding directive was issued, CISA has added more than 800 security vulnerabilities to its catalog of bugs exploited in attacks, requiring federal agencies to address them on a tighter schedule.

All security professionals and admins are strongly recommended to review CISA's KEV catalog and patch listed bugs within their environment to block security breach attempts.

In recent years, Zoho ManageEngine servers have been constantly targeted, with Desktop Central instances, for instance, hacked and access to their networks sold on hacking forums starting with July 2020.

Between August and October 2021, ManageEngine servers have also been attacked by nation-state hackers using tactics and tooling similar to those deployed in attacks by the Chinese-linked APT27 hacking group.

Following these campaigns, the FBI and CISA issued two joint advisories (1, 2) warning of APT actors exploiting ManageEngine flaws to drop web shells on the networks of critical infrastructure orgs, including healthcare, electronics, financial services, and IT consulting industries.",cybersecurity,bleepingcomputer
155,Industry Objections Spur Changes to Cybersecurity Provisions in Defense Bill,https://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/cd/2022/09/22/092222capitolNG/open-graph.jpg,22/09/2022,Key members of the House and Senate are altering proposals for identifying systemically important critical infrastructure and securing the software supply chain.,https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2022/09/industry-objections-spur-changes-cybersecurity-provisions-defense-bill/377518/,"An important set of lawmakers trying to advance U.S. cybersecurity policy in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act—with implications for agencies’ procurement and risk management—is reworking their initial proposals after industry complaints, according to one of the lawmakers.

“I think we've made a good faith attempt to meet them halfway,” said Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., referring to his efforts—along with other decision-makers from the now-dissolved Cyberspace Solarium Commission—to move forward with new versions of two key provisions in the House-passed NDAA that are facing industry opposition.

Gallagher, and Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, spoke at an event hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies on Wednesday as part of Solarium 2.0, the think tank’s initiative to continue the commission’s objective after its congressional charter expired in December.

Mark Montgomery, who served as executive director of the commission and now directs the follow-up effort as senior director of FDD’s Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation, told Nextgov he is working with Gallagher and King to get the new provisions into the final NDAA. That could happen either through floor amendments to the coming Senate bill or the later-stage bicameral conference that occurs each year to reconcile it with the House version, he said.

Gallagher and King were co-chairs of the Solarium commission which produced a comprehensive set of policy recommendations for improving cybersecurity in March, 2020. The recommendations were endorsed by policymakers from across the political spectrum, as well as the leaders of major critical infrastructure corporations who also served as its members. Many of the group’s recommendations, most notably the creation of a national cyber director’s office, became law through subsequent defense bills.

But some of the commission’s most crucial recommendations—including those currently represented by the provisions the big companies are unhappy with—are still on the lawmakers’ to-do list.

Systemically important entities

The first of the two provisions now in flux would create an interagency council chaired by the directors of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Office of the National Cyber Director. That council would then identify no more than 200 systemically important entities and determine which agencies should manage cybersecurity risks they present within and across specific sectors of critical infrastructure.

Gallagher said the latest iteration includes a process to address concerns about duplicative reporting the finance sector raised in opposing the provision, which was attached to the House bill as an amendment by Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I.—also a former Cyber Solarium commissioner. He did not say whether new language for the provision addresses gripes made by groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce regarding the general concept of regulating the private sector to improve cybersecurity, instead of their preferred “partnership” model that relies on industry’s voluntary participation in government efforts.

“Obviously we're going to try to ameliorate their concerns but without gutting the bill,” King said regarding the amendment. “I mean, that's, that's the challenge.”

Securing the software supply chain

Gallagher also suggested he and other lawmakers have made changes for the Defense bill to address the concerns raised by major vendors of information and communications technology.

Reducing cybersecurity risks by addressing vulnerabilities in software-based ICT products and services has long been a priority for Langevin, a pivotal member of the Solarium crew, given his position as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee’s panel on cybersecurity. And the 2023 House NDAA includes a provision—outlined in section 6722—which draws from one of the Solarium commission’s most ambitious recommendations.

In a new progress report, Solarium 2.0 itself identified the recommendation—that “Congress should pass a law establishing that final goods assemblers of software, hardware, and firmware are liable for damages from incidents that exploit known and unpatched vulnerabilities”—as among the unlikeliest to come to pass.

“As was the case in the prior year, this recommendation has encountered significant barriers to implementation,” reads the report, highlighting the outstanding item in bright red.

The Solarium Commission’s legislative proposal for implementing the recommendation calls for Congress to establish a private right of action—in which individuals can sue to enforce their rights, instead of relying on the government. It also instructs the Federal Trade Commission to create and enforce rules that would require the ICT industry to have programs for managing vulnerabilities in their products. They would only be liable for incidents in which the vulnerabilities leveraged were known to them, either through their own internal means, researchers’ disclosure or their registration in public vulnerability databases, such as one maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

But the private right of action is one of the most contested levers in information security policy, as demonstrated by efforts to pass a national privacy law, which is one of the few other recommendations Solarium 2.0 marks as having significant barriers to implementation. The House NDAA tries to use a much less controversial way of driving the same vulnerability management activities by ICT vendors: federal procurement.

Section 6722 also tries to ride the momentum of Executive Order 14028, which highlights the importance of a software bill of materials. It instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue guidance to agencies that could lead them to require potential contractors to submit bills of materials—which would ideally identify the various libraries of code used to build their software—and associated certifications regarding any associated vulnerabilities to their government buyers.

Industry seized on the opportunity to highlight what it described as an internal inconsistency in the bill—requiring that vendors certify their products are free of known vulnerabilities while at the same time asking them to show agencies a plan to mitigate any vulnerabilities identified through the bill of materials or other means.

In a Sept. 14 letter to Senate leaders, trade associations for big information and communications technology companies more generally complained that “the amendment is premature and conflicts with existing administration efforts.” The letter coincided with a memo the Office of Management and Budget issued the same day that said agencies “may” ask vendors for SBOMs to serve as an artifact for attestations to the quality of their products and services. The memo also commits CISA to “publish[ing] updated guidance on Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for federal agencies, as appropriate.”

“Federal guidance around SBOM is still being developed, with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and CISA just completing listening sessions and standing up working groups,” the industry letter reads.

“Some of the pushback we heard from the software industry, you know, we're trying to internalize and meet them halfway,” Gallagher said Wednesday. “The bottom line is, we've modified it substantially. We've listened to our colleagues that had objections and I'm—I guess—cautiously optimistic that there is a path forward.”

Gallagher said the negotiation ultimately comes back to trying to strike the right balance and settling on an appropriate framework for regulating the private sector. That’s no small task, and given Langevin’s imminent retirement from Congress, this year’s NDAA may be the last chance to secure his legacy, and that of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.",cybersecurity,nextgov

157,Iranian Hackers Hid in Albanian Networks for Over a Year,https://assets.infosecurity-magazine.com/webpage/og/50506d4f-19c0-42a9-b410-8f631e2ebfd7.png,22/09/2022,CISA report reveals extent of state-backed campaign,https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/iranian-hackers-albanian-networks/,"State-backed Iranian threat actors were able to remain undetected inside an Albanian government network for 14 months before deploying destructive malware in July 2022, a new report has revealed.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI released the joint alert to shed more light on the campaign, which resulted in Albania severing diplomatic ties with Iran – the first time a cyber-incident has led to such an outcome.

Identifying the attack group as the state-sponsored ‘HomeLand Justice,’ the report claimed that initial access was achieved by exploitation of CVE-2019-0604, a remote code execution bug in SharePoint. The vulnerability, which has a CVSS score of 8.6, was flagged by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in October 2020.

A few days after gaining network access, the threat actors proceeded to a persistence and lateral movement phase, using several .aspx webshells for persistence and RDP, SMB and FTP for lateral movement.

Between one and six months after initial access they compromised a Microsoft Exchange account and began probing for an admin account, the report claimed.

The US authorities claimed HomeLand Justice managed to exfiltrate significant volumes of email data. The group also managed to compromise two victim VPN accounts.

Finally, 14 months after the start of the operation they deployed a ransomware-style file encryptor and disk-wiping malware.

The campaign itself seems to have been a response to Albania’s sheltering of Iranian opposition group Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK). After Albania cut diplomatic ties with Iran in September 2022, the attackers used similar tactics to launch another wave of attacks, this time impacting border control systems.

In this case, attribution seems to have been pretty straightforward. HomeLand Justice claimed credit for the campaign, posting videos of the attack on its website and leaking information that it had stolen, according to CISA.

The incident is another reminder of the need for effective detection and response tooling to minimize attacker dwell-time, which globally stands at a median of 21 days.

“Between May and June 2022, Iranian state cyber actors conducted lateral movements, network reconnaissance, and credential harvesting from Albanian government networks,” noted the report.

“In July 2022, the actors launched ransomware on the networks, leaving an anti-Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK) message on desktops. When network defenders identified and began to respond to the ransomware activity, the cyber actors deployed a version of ZeroCleare destructive malware.”",cybersecurity,infosecurity magazine

The company launched a placement of up to 2.6 million existing shares on Monday in an SPO, the first share sale by a Russian company since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February.

In the past two days, however, the Russian stock market has lost around 18 per cent, hit by plans to hold referendums on Russian-controlled regions in east Ukraine and Russia's first military mobilisation since World War Two.

The rouble-based MOEX Russian share index picked up slightly on Thursday and was 2.5 per cent higher as of 0939 GMT.

""We are confident that the current market situation amid the fall of the Moscow Exchange index is temporary,"" Positive Technologies' Investor Relations director Yury Marinichev said during a video call organised by brokerage ITI Capital.

Positive Group listed shares on the Moscow Exchange last December in an initial public offering and its share price has risen 44 per cent this year, despite a slump in February, as investors favoured its growing business.

The SPO could take the company's free float to as high as 14.44 per cent, from 10.44 per cent, and possibly increase it to 15 per cent by the end of next year as investors will be offered an option to buy an additional share in the company for each four they acquired, Marinichev said.

The unidentified hackers broke into email accounts of airline employees that contained sensitive customers’ data that included driver’s license numbers and medical information, according to a letter issued by American notifying Montana state regulators.

“American Airlines is aware of a phishing campaign that led to the unauthorized access to a limited number of team member mailboxes,” American spokesman Curtis Blessing said. “A very small number of customers and employees’ personal information was contained in those email accounts.”

American notified customers last week that the breach was discovered in July, according to law enforcement officials in Montana. American said it locked down the breached accounts and hired a cybersecurity firm to investigate.

The problem with so much of content today? Frankly, it’s cliché.

Nothing is less differentiating or exciting than stale content repackaging well-trodden ideas. Audiences know it, too. If they can find the same information across any of the million other search results, what reason is there to stay and engage? Why bother with the same-old, same-old?

Meaningful content makes an impact on the reader and leaves them wanting more. It gives them something that they couldn’t get anywhere else, whether that’s a nugget of information, a tool, checklist or video.

It’s time for marketers to level up content development –- and here are six principles to make it happen:

Be a visionary -– or, at least, have a vision

Anyone can write a piece of content and throw it online. A simple search will pull up page after page of formulas for crafting the perfect blog or whitepaper. That’s one of the reasons why the web is cluttered with so much dull content.

Instead, consider the why behind content. Know who the audience is, their expectations and what perception marketing wants to convey. Ask what actions the content should encourage, and then combine this information into a sentence or two.

Voila! A content vision. Now, rather than producing the same stale content as competitors, marketers can say:

“We are creating retention-centric content to provide our customers with knowledge and resources to maximize their investment with us and keep them engaged.”

Don’t be afraid to be ruffle some feathers

It’s easy to get caught up in jargon and specifications. But customers are never purely rational –- they have feelings and emotions fueling them. Rather than playing it safe, adopt a unique point-of-view that stands out, or perhaps is even a little provocative.

For example, rethink overused themes. Listicles are popular because readers like brevity. But too many listicles are straightforward and unimaginative. Instead, try taking a narrative-driven approach –- rather than “5 reasons cybersecurity is essential,” try “5 times companies wished they had better cybersecurity.”

Humans also don’t talk like machines or computers. Limit jargon to the bare minimum and work to engage audiences in a conversation. Build rapport and serve as a trusted source (or…maybe even a friend).

Embrace your new salesperson

Forget the handshake. Content is the new first impression. Seventy percent of B2B buyers engage with content before they reach out to a salesperson. The upside is companies have more space to tell their story. The downside, however, is audiences’ ever-strained attention spans.

Remember: most buyers are looking to solve a problem, not engage with content or vendors. Amid a hundred other solutions on the market, marketers have to demonstrate and differentiate their company’s value above and beyond any other. Keep in mind the famous quote, “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.”

Then, once content has done its job and the buyer is ready to seal the deal, do not make them struggle to find someone to speak with. Content, especially down-funnel, should provide a clear next step to engage, start a conversation and make a purchase.

Follow the Rule of 7

A great piece of content should never stand alone. Reuse, repurpose and recycle it to reach an even broader audience – whatever their preferred channel or format. One rule of thumb, if content cannot be converted into at least seven assets, it’s time to think bigger.

For example:

Cornerstone: The core piece of content that serves as the foundation for multiple assets across multiple mediums. For instance, use survey research to draft a meaty, content-filled whitepaper.

The core piece of content that serves as the foundation for multiple assets across multiple mediums. For instance, use survey research to draft a meaty, content-filled whitepaper. Infographic: Take the survey results and whitepaper to create an infographic summarizing the findings.

Harness subject matter experts from your business to host sessions discussing the survey findings. Videos: Now, edit the recorded webinars into a fast-paced video or two. There you have it! Seven pieces of content to suit any and all audiences or channels.

Keep the content rollin’

From “Stranger Things” to “Bridgerton,” bingeable content keeps audiences glued to their screens and looking forward to the next season. The same holds true for content marketing.

Consider Netflix or Hulu. Every time a show ends, what’s the very next step? The streamer either transitions to the next episode or provides a recommendation. Do the same with content! Relate them by industry, problem or solution and make it a compelling transition for audiences.

Likewise, pay attention to how audiences engage – and with what. Which videos do they watch all the way through? What content do they click on next? What gets downloaded? There’s a reason streamers keep those numbers close to the vest – they offer a tremendous amount of insight into audience behaviors and trends.

1% to make a difference

The internet is awash in content. But 99% doesn’t speak to buyers’ problems, uses terminology they don’t understand or repeats advice they’ve heard before.

Remember the phrase, “if you don’t have anything nice to say, say nothing at all?” Use a similar phrase as the guiding star for content development, “If you don’t have anything unique or interesting to add, best say nothing at all.”

Be a part of the 1% that makes a difference. Those million other search results are no problem when you deliver something no one else can. Using these principles, marketers can differentiate their content and give their audience what they cannot get anywhere else.

This comes as a cybersecurity report stated that over 660,000 Malaysian accounts had been compromised between April and June of this year.

Malaysia Cyber Consumer Association chairman Datuk Ahmad Noordin Ismail said such a digital ID would act as identification for users surfing the web and would also be in line with the country’s digitalisation agenda.

“Hackers usually sell stolen personal data to scammers, who would then try to target banking institutions by stealing the victims’ money.

“So, one way financial institutions can combat this is by going back to the traditional way of meeting face-to-face with their clients instead of just asking for personal information on the phone.

“The other way is for the government to introduce a digital ID for all Malaysians so that each time they surf the web, they would have to log in using their biometric information such as the thumbprint, iris and face, which scammers cannot steal,” he said in an interview.

The financial institutions, he added, could also let the customers be the final decision makers for any transaction via the use of a password generator app on their customers’ phones.

“There has been recent news that hackers have found a way to get the one-time password from their victims’ SIM cards by sending malware to their phones.

“But by making the customers provide a specially generated key for each transaction, we can eradicate these types of scams,” he explained.

Users, he said, were also encouraged to set a 16-character password on their social accounts so that they wouldn’t be easy to hack.

“A 16-character password would take about six months to hack. One of the most common mistakes that we make is using a common password.

“To better protect ourselves, we can change one of the 16-characters every six months,” he said, adding that avoiding any unknown email would also help protect an individual or a system in a company.

He was commenting on a report in The Star regarding the over 660,000 Malaysian accounts that had been compromised between April and June of this year, an increase of 733% from the previous quarter.

The latest report from a Netherlands-based cybersecurity company and VPN provider, Surfshark, ranks Malaysia eleventh compared to the rest of the world.

Russia was at the top of the list with a staggering 28 million compromised accounts, followed by India (4.4 million), China (3.4 million), Brazil (3.2 million), the United States (2.3 million), and South Korea (1.8 million).

The report also noted that the total number of breached accounts had globally increased by 2% from the last quarter.",cybersecurity,the star online

The company believes that someone affiliated with the hacking group Lapsus$ leveraged the MFA fatigue attack technique to compromise an Uber employee account.

According to the New York Times, the hackers social engineered the company’s worker after discovering his WhatsApp number. The intruders sent a direct message to the employee pretending to be an Uber IT staffer. They used the phishing technique to steal passwords and repeatedly sent multifactor authentication (MFA) login notifications. The Uber employee eventually accepted one of those login requests.

After gaining initial access, the attackers sent messages to a company-wide Slack channel announcing the massive security breach and reconfigured Uber’s OpenDNS. The screenshots revealed that the hackers had access to various internal systems, including G Suite accounts, Amazon Web Services, and code repositories.

What is MFA fatigue?

An MFA fatigue attack is “the process of sending a high volume of push requests to the target’s mobile device until the user accepts, either accidentally or simply to attempt to silence the repeated push notifications they are receiving.” Threat actors are increasingly using this technique to target large organizations, such as Microsoft and Cisco.

How to enable additional context in the Azure AD portal to block MFA fatigue attacks

Security researchers have advised organizations to add additional context (such as the application name and geographic location) in MFA push notifications to prevent MFA fatigue attacks. It is also recommended to combine additional context with number matching to boost sign-in security.

Additional Context & Number Matching

IT admins can enable additional context in the Azure AD portal by following the steps listed below:

Log in to the Azure AD portal and navigate to Security >> Authentication methods >> Microsoft Authenticator .

>> >> . Select the Basics tab, click the Yes and All users options, and then set the Authentication mode to Any.

Microsoft Authenticator Settings – Basics tab

In the Configure tab, navigate to the “Show application name in push and passwordless notifications” section and change its Status to Enabled. Choose users to include or exclude from the policy and click the Save button.

Microsoft Authenticator Settings – Configure tab

Repeat the same process for “Show geographic location in push and passwordless notifications.”

Show geographic location in notifications

It is important to note that IT admins can only enforce this policy on Microsoft Authenticator users. This means that those who have not been enrolled won’t be able to see the application name or geographic location. Moreover, additional context supported is not available for Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) and Network Policy Server (NPS).",cybersecurity,petri.com

Over the past two years, interest in digital transformation has surged because of the increased dependence on remote working models resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Shifting an organization’s applications and data to the cloud introduces numerous benefits, such as reducing operational costs and increasing competitive advantages. However, it also expands an organization’s cyber attack surface and makes them more vulnerable to many cyber threats.

Cybersecurity has become a necessity in almost every industry. But even for technology companies, the nuances of cybersecurity may be outside the domain of the organization’s expertise.

To counter growing cyber threats, organizations of all sizes and industries work daily to strengthen their cyber defenses. Investing in cybersecurity awareness training and installing the latest technological security products (both software and hardware) are how most organizations combat the increased volume of cyber threats. However, in a complex threat landscape that changes almost daily, countering all risks is complicated, and can take a lot of resources if you are going to manage network security on your own.

This article discusses a new cloud-native network security deployment service used to inspect and protect against malicious ingress, egress, and east-west traffic within an organization’s network: network security as a service (NSaaS). It also introduces Trend Micro Cloud One™ — Network Security as a pioneer solution in this field.

What is network security as a service (NSaaS)?

While it is possible to handle cybersecurity concerns by maintaining an in-house cybersecurity team, organizations can also opt for a solution such as network security as a service (NSaaS), alleviating their cybersecurity burden and freeing internal resources.

NSaaS is a modern cloud solution run by a managed security service provider. NSaaS works by controlling and managing all security solutions installed on client network perimeters. The solutions managed include firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), security information and event management (SIEM), and anti-spam systems. It also monitors all digital interactions in the client IT environment to detect cyber threats early and respond to them quickly.

Today’s IT environments are more complex than before. Modern IT environments span on-premises and cloud environments. The variety of users accessing these environments, such as organization employees, third-party vendors, contractors, sub-contractors, and other suppliers, has added even more complexity. The number of internet of things (IoT) devices is also growing, which means more entry points for cyber attackers to exploit.

These emergent issues make handling the security of computer networks without seeking external help from a professionally managed service provider a daunting task, and one rife with potential errors. In cybersecurity, avoiding errors that lead to security problems is crucial because one mistake can ruin the entire business.

An NSaaS provider does more than simply handle the security configuration issues of network perimeters. For instance, NSaaS also takes care of identity and access management and suggests security rules that all users must follow when accessing your IT environment.

NSaaS: The answer to many network security challenges

IT leaders worldwide appreciate the importance of cybersecurity’s capability to mitigate cyber threats and respond to them quickly once they happen. For instance, your in-house cybersecurity teams are responsible for the following duties to ensure the security of your organization's network:

Tracking vulnerabilities in the entire IT environment, including endpoints, servers, IoT, and cloud apps, and working to solve them promptly.

Monitoring security defense solutions, such as IDS and IPS, firewalls, antivirus, antimalware, and SIEM.

Identifying attacks and suspicious activity and responding to them before they escalate.

Acquiring an internal security operations team is possible for large-scale organizations. However, most firms worldwide are small to medium-sized. They cannot afford the cost of having an entire cybersecurity team. For instance, having an internal security operations team can have the following drawbacks:

Budget limitations — Maintaining your in-house security teams requires considerable spending to gather a team of experts with various cybersecurity skills.

Lack of experts — Finding professional cybersecurity experts isn't easy. If your team has many vacant positions that you failed to fill, a threat actor could exploit this to attack your organization.

Challenge to retain — Suppose you have successfully gathered a perfect cybersecurity team. Now, how many team members do you expect to stay with you? For example, experienced members may leave for other companies to increase their salary after a while. In contrast, less professional staff may work with your company for one or two years to accumulate experience and then go to another company.

Difficult to manage — Your cybersecurity team is responsible for all aspects of cybersecurity operations. Managing all team members is difficult because you will always need a reputable manager to oversee teamwork all day, every day.

Outsourcing your cybersecurity needs to an external security provider brings numerous benefits to your organization, such as:

A significant reduction in costs. Maintaining in-house teams will cost you considerable money. For example, hiring one professional cybersecurity engineer will cost you more than $100,000 annually, while outsourcing your entire network security to an external provider will cost you considerably less. Additionally, most NSaaS providers will offer their service on a subscription basis. The client can select the tier that best fits its current workload and increase it later as necessary.

The use of highly professional cybersecurity experts, even when the number of skilled IT experts is small compared to market demand. For example, according to Cybersecurity Ventures , there are 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide. Your managed NSaaS provider can hire the best talent in the field that small and medium-sized (SME) firms cannot afford.

Managed security providers leverage advanced security solutions, such as network detection and response (NDR) and other proprietary solutions, to protect computer networks and data. They use the latest computing technologies (machine learning and artificial intelligence) to detect threats such as unknown malware and zero-day exploits.

Enhancing your overall cyber defenses. Outsourcing your network security protection to an experienced external provider allows your organization to use the latest technological defenses and gain support from professional and knowledgeable cybersecurity experts, who work around the clock to protect sensitive resources from ever-changing threats.

Finally, outsourcing your cybersecurity needs allows your internal IT professionals to focus on organizational objectives while leaving the repetitive tasks of network monitoring and incident handling to a professional external security provider.

  Re…",https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/09/twitter-password-reset-bug/,"Oops! Twitter Forgot to Log Users Out After Mass Password Reset

Twitter on Thursday sent emails out to a handful of users telling them their attempt to log out of certain devices didn’t actually work, even after a password reset.

The ‘oops, lol’ email pointed the finger at a “recent technical issue”. But in a blog post expanding on the issue, Twitter said the bug was introduced after it made a change to the systems that power password resets last year.

The bug meant that if you proactively changed your password on one device, but still had an open session on another device, that session may not have been closed. Web sessions were not affected and were closed appropriately, Twitter confirmed.

In the email, Twitter said it logged affected users out of all active Twitter sessions.

“We have directly informed the people we were able to identify who may have been affected by this, proactively logged them out of open sessions across devices, and prompted them to log in again,” Twitter wrote.

“We realise this may be inconvenient for some, but it was an important step to keep your account safe and secure from potential unwanted access.”

Twitter continued by saying it was “unfortunate” that the issue happened.

While it seems like a minor ‘thing’, the issue could have implications for those who had reset their password because they believed their Twitter account could be at risk, such as if their mobile device was lost or stolen.

If you have been logged out, you can log back into your account on all devices with no issues. But if you think someone may have accessed your Twitter account thanks to the password bug, you can review all recent Twitter sessions in your ‘account settings’.

As TechCrunch points out, news of the password bug follows just weeks after Twitter’s ex-security chief accused the company of cybersecurity mismanagement.

The reality is the bad guys are looking at the entire playing field, but we are not because organizational structure, personalities and politics get in the way.

Security organizations are traditionally structured as a collection of separate groups—including network, endpoint and cloud—tasked with protecting their part of the infrastructure and stopping certain types of threats. Each group uses its own set of security technologies from different vendors, and they bring in their own third-party data and intelligence sources for context. These silos make it extremely difficult to share data between tools or teams in any real way. And while these teams may roll up to the same person, they each have their own budgets and are laser-focused on achieving success for their projects so they can get funded...sometimes at the expense of another project. Personalities and politics start creeping in due to this unintentional (or sometimes maybe intentional) competition. In the end these divisions make it incredible difficult to create a unified defense. Instead, we’re simply creating an obstacle course for attackers that they are all too adept at successfully navigating.

Looking to the future of cybersecurity, we know that any discussion must include automation. But disconnects within an organization prevent us from making meaningful progress. A recent SANS survey (PDF) found that 97% of respondents report difficulties in rolling out automation initiatives due to technology issues, siloed departments and lack of trust in outcomes. Additionally, the misalignment between CISOs and their organizations around security automation and organization maturity makes it more difficult to overcome the structural and cultural challenges required to move up through maturity levels and promote an approach that cuts across the entire business.

One direction we can go in to address these challenges and create a unified defense is to take an honest assessment of the state of the organization. The global cybersecurity talent shortage is impacting most organizations. When we break down barriers, we can apply automation to better utilize scarce, highly skilled human resources and avoid burnout and boredom. Repetitive, low-risk, time-consuming tasks are prime candidates for automation, while human analysts take the lead on irregular, high-impact, time-sensitive investigations with automation simplifying some of the work.

Organizations also need to get more out of their existing tools. I’ve spoken with teams that are actually considering investing in a second SOAR tool because the other part of the organization that already has a SOAR tool deployed isn’t receptive or lacks the capacity to expand the use cases and provide what they need in a timely manner. Talk about a lack of a unified defense! This is another area where automation can help. Instead of a process-driven approach to SOAR, automation can be triggered by data and business logic to run the right actions and orchestrate response with minimal impact on security teams’ workloads and workflows. Additionally, solutions that provide a low-code approach can open the tool to more users and use cases.

More broadly, a platform focused on integration where disparate systems and sources that talk in different languages and use different formats can communicate, provides an opportunity to shift thinking and how we work together. An open, extensible architecture that allows for flexibility and interoperability with existing tools and teams, and integrates with new technologies teams want to bring in, delivers benefits to everyone. At the data level, it provides shared context for better understanding and collaboration across the organization. At the process level it helps ensure the right actions are taken at the right time so different teams can achieve their goals and accelerate detection and response across the organization.

When we recognize how organizational structure, personalities and politics can stand in the way of security progress, can we address the challenges and move towards a unified defense. There are many paths to reach this destination—the choice is ours.",cybersecurity,securityweek.com

read more",https://www.securityweek.com/15-year-old-python-vulnerability-present-350000-projects-resurrected,"Researchers at threat detection and response company Trellix have resurrected a 15-year-old Python vulnerability, showing that it’s more serious than initially believed and that it could affect hundreds of thousands of applications.

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2007-4559, initially described as a directory traversal vulnerability in Python’s ‘tarfile’ module that could allow an attacker to remotely overwrite arbitrary files by convincing users to process specially crafted tar archives.

The flaw was never properly patched and instead users were warned not to open archive files from untrusted sources.

Researchers at Trellix have now shown that an attacker can exploit the vulnerability to write arbitrary files and from there achieve malicious code execution in most cases. They demonstrated this against several popular applications that use the vulnerable Python module, even showing how an attacker could use social engineering to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with administrator privileges.

The cybersecurity firm has released an open source tool, named Creosote, that can be used to scan projects for this tarfile vulnerability. With this tool they scanned public GitHub repositories and discovered 300,000 files containing the tarfile module, roughly 61% of which were vulnerable to attacks exploiting CVE-2007-4559.

With the help of GitHub, they conducted a more comprehensive scan that identified 2.87 million open source files containing the tarfile module across nearly 590,000 unique repositories. If 61% of them are vulnerable, the total number of open source projects affected by CVE-2007-4559 is approximately 350,000. These include applications made by organizations in the development, AI/ML, web, data science, IT management, and other industries.

In addition, the researchers noted that the problematic module is present in many closed-source projects as well.

“This vulnerability is incredibly easy to exploit, requiring little to no knowledge about complicated security topics. Due to this fact and the prevalence of the vulnerability in the wild, Python’s tarfile module has become a massive supply chain issue threatening infrastructure around the world,” Trellix said.

China considers this stance one of unjust politicization aiming to undermine its success on the global stage.

IoT refers to objects containing components or software which wirelessly share data with similar devices or a central system. It could be something as simple as an automatic alert to refill an empty vending machine to extraordinarily complex systems running a nation’s surveillance camera network, or mechanisms to ensure the efficient management of smart power grids. In all cases, IoT devices regularly collect vast amounts of information.

In July, a cross-party group of about sixty UK lawmakers petitioned their government to ban the domestic use and sale of Chinese surveillance equipment. The legislators argued that the technology’s principal provider, Hikvision, was tied to China’s ongoing human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

Calls for similar action have also been raised in New Zealand, which relies heavily on Hikvison IoT devices.

Speaking to the press in New Zealand, a Hikvison spokesperson responded by criticizing the West’s increased scrutiny on its products: “Any such decisions should be based on credible evidence and due process instead of being driven by a geopolitical agenda.”

These moves in the United Kingdom and New Zealand echo proposed US sanctions on the company and similar Chinese state-owned enterprises.

Beijing has long spoken out regarding similar moves to restrict Huawei and its dominant role within the 5G industry, which is part of the foundational infrastructure for IoT products. In July 2020, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying argued “decisions to ban Huawei are not about national security, but political manipulation.”

For their part, both the United States and United Kingdom have asserted that their policy on Huawei is motivated entirely by national security concerns and is informed by the advice of intelligence and cybersecurity experts.

These Western nations fear that allowing Huawei to exercise control of IoT infrastructure will enhance Beijing’s global influence.

This influence could be, ironically, very much akin to the US National Security Agency’s PRISM, a controversial program of widespread online surveillance achieved by intercepting communications across the IoT industry through companies such as Google.

In other words, the West does not want Beijing to exercise international power in the same way which it does.

Chinese companies Fibocom, Quectel, and the entirely state-owned China Mobile represent over half of the current global IoT market. Their major customers include Dell, Intel, and Tesla, which also use China-made IoT modules and components in their own products.

There has yet to be any publicly proven case of China wielding its IoT influence in an illegitimate manner, though accusations that it is doing so are not few in number.",cybersecurity,akihabaranews.com

Individuals and organizations often think about risk in terms of what they’re trying to protect. When talking about risk in the IT world, we mainly talk about data, with terms like data privacy, data leakage and data loss. But there is more to cybersecurity risk than just protecting data. So, what should our security risk management strategies consider? Protecting data and blocking known vulnerabilities are good tactics for cybersecurity, but those activities are not the only components of what CISOs should be considering and doing. What’s often missing is a comprehensive approach to risk management and a strategy that considers more than just data.

The modern IT enterprise certainly consumes and generates data, but it also has myriad devices, including IoT devices, which are often not under the direct supervision or control of central IT operations. While data loss is a risk, so too are service interruptions, especially as IoT and OT devices continue to play critical roles across society. For a healthcare operation for example, a failure of a medical device could lead to life or death consequences.

Challenges of Security Risk Management

Attacks are changing all the time, and device configurations can often be in flux. Just like IT itself is always in motion, it’s important to emphasize that risk management is not static.

In fact, risk management is a very dynamic thing, so thinking about risk as a point-in-time exercise is missing the mark. There is a need to consider multiple dimensions of the IT and IoT landscape when evaluating risk. There are different users, applications, deployment locations and usage patterns that organizations need to manage risk for, and those things can and will change often and regularly.

There are a number of challenges with security risk management, not the least of which is sheer size and complexity of the IT and IoT estate. CISOs today can easily be overwhelmed by information and by data, coming from an increasing volume of devices. Alongside the volume is a large variety of different types of devices, each with its own particular attack surface. Awareness of all IT and IoT assets and the particular risk each one can represent is not an easy thing for a human to accurately document. The complexity of managing a diverse array of policies, devices and access controls across a distributed enterprise, in an approach that minimizes risk, is not a trivial task.

A Better Strategy to Manage Security Risks

Security risk management is not a single task, or a single tool. It’s a strategy that involves several key components that can help CISOs to eliminate gaps and better set the groundwork for positive outcomes.

Establishing visibility. To eliminate gaps, organizations need to first know what they have. IT and IoT asset management isn’t just about knowing what managed devices are present, but also knowing unmanaged IoT devices and understanding what operating systems and application versions are present at all times.

Ensuring continuous monitoring. Risk is not static, and monitoring shouldn’t be either. Continuous monitoring of all the changes, including who is accessing the network, where devices are connecting and what applications are doing, is critical to managing risk.

Focusing on network segmentation. Reducing risk in the event of a potential security incident can often be achieved by reducing the “blast radius” of a threat. With network segmentation, where different services and devices only run on specific segments of a network, the attack surface can be minimized and we can avoid unseen and unmanaged IoT devices as springboards for attacks for other areas of the network. So, instead of an exploit in one system impacting an entire organization, the impact can be limited to just the network segment that was attacked.

Prioritizing threat prevention. Threat prevention technologies such as endpoint and network protection are also foundational components of an effective security risk management strategy. Equally important for threat prevention is having the right policy configuration and least-privileged access in place on endpoints including IoT devices and network protection technologies to prevent potential attacks from happening.

Executing the strategic components above at scale can be optimally achieved with machine learning and automation. With the growing volume of data, network traffic and devices, it’s just not possible for any one human, or even group of humans to keep up. By making use of machine learning-based automation, it’s possible to rapidly identify all IT, IoT, OT and BYOD devices to improve visibility, correlate activity in continuous monitoring, recommend the right policies for least-privileged access, suggest optimized configuration for network segmentation and add an additional layer of security with proactive threat prevention.",cybersecurity,csoonline.com

Businesses of all sizes and across all industries are prioritizing data-driven decisions—making professionals in fields like data science and business analytics in high demand. A survey of corporate recruiters found that 86% planned to hire graduates with a master’s degree in business analytics in 2022, according to the Graduate Management Admission Council. And companies are paying six-figure salaries to these types of new recruits; in 2022, the median salary for master’s degree graduates in business analytics in the U.S. is $105,000, the GMAC survey reports.

But you don’t necessarily need to pursue a full master’s degree program to gain exposure to this fast-growing field. Now more than ever, MBA grads must have skills beyond the traditional business degree, Columbia Business School professor Dan Wang previously told Fortune. These skills include knowledge in areas like analytics marketing, product management, and collaborating in strategy roles with business analysts.

If you’re looking to familiarize yourself with business analytics without having to commit to a degree program, several universities offer courses online. We’ve rounded up four online courses in business analytics led by top universities, free of charge.

Boston University: Business Analytics for Data-Driven Decision Making

Boston University offers a free online course in which enrollees learn how to apply analytics to their business strategies. In the Business Analytics for Data-Driven Decision Making course, students gain exposure to concepts like predictive modeling and machine learning, and how analytical findings are used to inform a business strategy.

The course is seven weeks long and requires about three to six hours a week from participants. It is taught on a course schedule, led by instructors from Boston University’s computer science and information systems departments. According to the course description, the course is aimed at addressing the needs of managers specifically, as the demand grows for leaders that can reframe business questions as data questions, and use data to develop competitive advantages for their business.

University of Colorado, Boulder: Business Analytics for Decision Making

Business Analytics for Decision Making, offered by the University of Colorado, Boulder, is a course that teaches students the essentials of business analytics. Without delving too far into computer languages and advanced statistics, this course gives participants basic knowledge of Excel and teaches them through an “analytic solver platform,” enabling them to practice developing predictive and prescriptive models.

The free online class is taught by a professor from the university’s Leeds School of Business and takes about nine hours to complete. It’s the third course of five in the Advanced Business Analytics Specialization series offered by the school. Other courses include: Introduction to Data Analytics for Business, Predictive Modeling and Analytics, Communicating Business Analytics Results, and Advanced Business Analytics Capstone

University of Michigan: Introduction to Data Analytics for Managers

Participants don’t need to have any background or skills in analytics and the business analytics course is six weeks long and requires about two to four hours of work a week, though it’s on a self-paced schedule.

University of Pennsylvania: Customer Analytics

The Customer Analytics course taught by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business is one of four courses offered in the school’s Business Analytics Specialization series. This course discusses how massive amounts of data gathered through actions like credit card transactions and online shopping carts can be used to inform business decisions. By the end of the course, participants will be prepared to describe the tools used to predict customer behavior and will have a knowledge of the current best practices for customer analytics at top firms.",cybersecurity,fortune

The malware, which can be remotely controlled by miscreants once it has infected a device, appears to be an updated version of an Android software nasty first observed in 2021. Back then it was seen robbing Indian bank customers. This latest variant has several additional backdoor capabilities and much better obfuscation, allowing it to stealthily steal victims' two-factor authentication (2FA) messages for bank accounts, account login details, and personally identifiable information (PII) without detection, we're told.

The Microsoft threat hunters' investigation began after receiving a text message claiming to be from India's ICICI bank's rewards program. It included the bank's logo, alerted the user that their loyalty points were about to expire, and instructed them to click on a malicious link.

Clicking on the link downloads a fake banking rewards app, which the Redmond team detected as carrying TrojanSpy:AndroidOS/Banker.O. When run, it asks the user to enable specific permissions, and then asks for the user's credit card details to harvest along with all the other data it be instructed to steal. One hopes being asked for card information right off the bat is a red flag for most people.

Using open-source intelligence, the security researchers determined that the phony app's command and control (C2) server is used by or linked to 75 other malicious Android applications, distributed as APK files.

""Some of the malicious APKs also use the same Indian bank's logo as the fake app that we investigated, which could indicate that the actors are continuously generating new versions to keep the campaign going,"" the researchers noted this week.

In addition to pointing out malware in Android – an OS made by arch-rival Google – Microsoft also this week issued an out-of-band security update for a spoofing vulnerability in Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. The hole, tracked as CVE-2022-37972, affects versions 2103 to 2207, and can be exploited to steal sensitive information, according to the US government's CISA, which urged folks to apply the fix. The bug received a 7.5 out of 10 CVSS severity score, and its details have already been publicly disclosed. Microsoft says exploitation is ""less likely."" Still, it's a low-complexity attack that's publicly known, so it's time to get patching. According to Redmond, the fix, KB15498768, will be listed in the Updates and Servicing node of the Configuration Manager console.

Upon further analysis, Microsoft discovered the Android malware uses MainActivity, AutoStartService, and RestartBroadCastReceiverAndroid functions to conduct a raft of nefarious activities including intercepting calls, accessing and uploading call logs, messages, contacts, and network information, and modifying the Android device's settings.

These three functions also allow the app to continue spying on the victim's phone and running in the background without any user interaction.

Though the software nasty can receive and carry out a range of commands from its control server, one edict in particular — the silent command, which puts the device on silent mode — is rather dangerous because it allows the attacker to receive, steal, and delete messages without alerting the user.

This is bad because banking apps often require 2FA, often sent through SMS. So by turning on the phone's silent mode, the miscreants can steal these 2FA messages without the victim's knowledge, thus allowing them to get into online banking accounts – once they have learned all the necessary credentials – and potentially drain them of money.

According to the Windows giant's security researchers:

Its ability to intercept one-time passwords (OTPs) sent over SMS thwarts the protections provided by banks' two-factor authentication mechanisms, which users and institutions rely on to keep their transactions safe. Its use of various banking and financial organizations' logos could also attract more targets in the future.

Microsoft's team notes that the spyware encrypts all data it sends to its remote masterminds and decrypts the scrambled SMS commands it receives. This uses a combo of Base64 encoding/decoding and AES encryption/decryption methods.

Additionally, the malware uses the open-source library socket.io to communicate with its C2 server.

To prevent this and other info-stealing malware from wreaking havoc, the security researchers suggest downloading and installing apps only from official app stores. They also note Android users can keep the ""Unknown sources"" option disabled, which prevents potentially malicious sources from installing malware disguised as legitimate apps.

As we've said before, it's nice that Microsoft is pointing out cybersecurity issues in other people's code – raising awareness is good for users – but it's strange to see Redmond making a song and dance about this sort of thing when it routinely downplays the scores of vulnerabilities it fixes in its own products every month. ®",cybersecurity,theregister.com

Whitney Fraser, VP of Sales

You've given me a ""work home"" where women can be mentored, listened to, and advance based on merits and that's rare.""

Whitney's status as a finalist for an international award comes as no surprise to Cloudastructure senior management. Within months of joining the company, Whitney closed her first multi-million dollar enterprise deal, and within a week, closed another. Her deals ramped up Cloudastructure's revenue by 700% in Q1 and Q2 of 2022 alone, while the needs of her clients altered the course of engineering and design at the company, and may optimize crime deterrence to a level previously unattainable in enterprise security. Whitney was promoted to Vice President in June.

CEO Rick Bentley commented, ""We couldn't be prouder of Whitney and we welcome and support the business community recognizing her talents. Not only is she a model professional and executive, but she comes to work every day with a positive attitude and a level of energy that influences everyone around her.""

Currently on maternity leave, finalist and VP of Sales Whitney Fraser responded, ""A heartfelt thanks to the judges for elevating my nomination, and another to everyone at Cloudastructure for believing in me! I'm deeply flattered and humbly grateful to have found you guys. Special shout out to our CRO Lauren O'Brien, thank you for hiring me, and CEO Rick Bentley for enabling what was needed to make this all possible. You've given me a ""work home"" where women can be mentored, listened to, and advance purely based on their merits and that's rare.""

Finalists were determined by the average scores of more than 200 business professionals around the world, working on seven juries. Their scores will also determine the Gold, Silver, and Bronze Stevie Award placements that will be revealed at the 19th annual awards dinner and presentations in Las Vegas.

The agreement comes as part of the company's continued growth strategy.

Embedded SIM (eSIM) technology, a key driver for the Internet of Things (IoT), is expected to be used in six billion devices such as smartphones, consumer electronics, health monitoring, transport, and smart energy by 2025. Monogoto uses eSIM technology to provide connectivity services for devices such as point of sales, ATMs, wearables, smart lights, fleets of cars and packages.

Last year, Workz became the first provider to launch a cloud-based eSIM management platform for networks which is certified by the GSMA, and, this May, was identified as one of the top five eSIM platform providers in the world for the second year running despite a two-fold increase in market competition.

Itamar Kunik, Monogoto CEO said, ""We are proud to partner with Workz and offer our customers a new platform for eSIM. Moving over to Workz's eSIM cloud was easier and a lot quicker than expected. The move gives Monogoto the agility to address the evolving connectivity needs of our customers and partners as they arise"".

Tor Malmros, CEO of Workz said, ""eSIM adoption is rising rapidly as the opportunity for operators across consumer and M2M verticals expands – developments such as the first eSIM-only iPhone expected to launch in September will only heighten this. Our cloud-based solution is designed to enable innovative connectivity providers like Monogoto to scale up quickly in this new market allowing them to move fast, grow, and achieve a tangible return on investment.""

The 90,000-square-foot facility, funded in part by $75 million from the state , will connect the university’s existing Computer Science building to “an open, light-filled commons for graduate and undergraduate students” and will contain special purpose labs and collaborative work space for students , university officials said in a statement.

Governor Charlie Baker and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito joined officials at the University of Massachusetts Amherst on Thursday to break ground on a $125 million computer science facility expected to open in spring 2025, officials said.

Baker said he felt confident that the state’s investment in the facility would pay off.

“This is a really special place,” he said. “This is a place that is doing great things. I know you will do great things with it.”

Polito said the state’s thriving science and technology sector needs a “robust pipeline of talent” to keep Massachusetts a leader in tech, and the university’s “Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences will support students and faculty as they research and develop exciting new advancements in cutting-edge fields and industry sectors.”

Kumble Subbaswamy, the chancellor of UMass Amherst, praised the governor, lieutenant governor, and UMass Board of Trustees Chairman Robert Manning and his wife, Donna, who donated $18 million to the university last year to support the computer science college that now bears their name.

“The Mannings and the Baker-Polito Administration know a wise investment when they see one,” Subbaswamy said in the statement. “Moving forward, CICS will continue to provide a high return on investment, advancing the commonwealth’s key innovation areas and driving scientific discovery in vital areas such as healthcare, sustainable computing, cybersecurity and human-centered technology.”

LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Liverpool football club is deepening its ties with the crypto world by expanding a partnership with French blockchain-based sports startup Sorare, the company said in a statement on Thursday.

Sorare, whose online fantasy sports game involves the sale of licensed digital sports cards which players can use to build teams which compete against each other, said it had an exclusive multi-year partnership with Liverpool to create content and experiences for fans.

The cards for the game are bought and traded in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a kind of crypto asset which records the ownership status of digital goods on the blockchain. read more

A 2021 deal saw Liverpool cards introduced on the platform and the new deal will see perks such as Liverpool stadium visits, match day experiences, merchandise and video content being offered as prizes for winners of the online game, Sorare said.

Sports-related collectibles proved a popular type of NFT as the digital assets market exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry last year, although the frenzy has cooled in recent months. read more

The average sale price of a Sorare NFT in August was $86.14, down from a peak of around $280 in March last year, according to market tracker CryptoSlam.

Britain's gambling watchdog is investigating Sorare to assess whether its game amounts to gambling. A spokesperson for Sorare said that this was ""not relevant"" to the partnership with Liverpool. read more

""Sorare remains very confident it does not offer any forms of gambling, and this has been confirmed by expert legal opinions at every stage since the company was founded, including when signing new partnerships,"" the spokesperson said.

Sorare says it has over 2 million users worldwide and partnerships with more than 280 million sports organisations, including Major League Baseball in the United States and UK football clubs. read more

201,Game journalist survey: 75% say they won’t cover blockchain game news,?w=1200&strip=all,22/09/2022,"Blockchain gaming is exceptionally unpopular among game journalists, according to a survey of 160 writers by Big Games Machine.",https://venturebeat.com/games/game-journalist-survey-75-say-they-wont-cover-blockchain-game-news/,"Interested in learning what's next for the gaming industry? Join gaming executives to discuss emerging parts of the industry this October at GamesBeat Summit Next. Register today.

Blockchain gaming is exceptionally unpopular among game journalists, according to a survey of 160 writers by video game PR agency Big Games Machine.

About 75% of respondents said it is unlikely they will cover blockchain gaming news in the next six months to a year. Of course, if they had asked me, I would have said we cover it. They claim to have sent us a survey but I don’t see it in my inbox.

Non-fungible tokens — which use the blockchain’s digital ledger to authenticate unique digital items — have proven to be incredibly divisive among gamers and game developers. Team17 and GSC Gameworld rolled back their plans to do NFTs after gamers loudly complained on social media. And while game journalists might sit above that fray as objective reporters, that’s not what is happening. Instead, game journalists have high animosity for the subject, Big Games Machine said. The game journalists agree with the backlash against NFTs, with only 5% saying it is very likely they will cover blockchain games.

The journalists believe their audiences aren’t interested or receptive to blockchain games coverage.

“Others stated a general lack of interest in covering blockchain games, while others were more passionate in the way they expressed their dislike of blockchain games,” the report said.

In their responses, the game journalists showed their biases toward the status quo.

“I’ve yet to see any legitimate or compelling use for integrating blockchain options in games,” said one game journalist.

Another from the survey said, “Too much all at once. The market is flooded, and we don’t see

much readership on articles about blockchain games.”

Parroting what game developers who oppose NFTs have said, another game journalist said, “Blockchain is a solution in search of a problem. It is being touted as a panacea for issues which do not exist and which offer no actual value to the players.”

Another brought up the “environmentally harmful” nature of the blockchain, even though Ethereum is moving to proof-of-stake verification and Layer 2 chains have reduced the costs of transactions and brought down the environmental side effects of transactions.

Staff and freelance journalists from publications including Eurogamer, Kotaku, CNET and IGN contributed to the survey, with many of them sharing additional context on their answers in the form of comments.

My hot take

How game journalists find stories.

Of course, my own take is different. I cover blockchain games because one of the lessons of being a business publication covering gaming is that you have to follow the money. Blockchain games may not have been very fun, but they generated billions of dollars in 2021.

That success bred a hype cycle that many skeptics rightfully doubted. In the first half of this year, anywhere from a third to half of all money invested in game companies went to blockchain game companies, according to reports from stat trackers at Drake Star Partners and GameInvest.

I have talked to numerous game developers in the industry, from Chris Kassulke to Rami Ismail, who say that the arguments against blockchain games outweigh the possible advantages. I’ve also talked to large numbers of gaming business leaders — like Gabe Leydon, Kevin Lin, Josh Williams, Justin Kan, Sebastien Borget, Will Wright, Mark Otero, Matt Wolf and more — who believe that blockchain games represent a chance to decentralize power in the game industry and give gamers ownership of the things they buy.

These leaders liken blockchain gaming to the onset of free-to-play mobile and social games a decade ago. Hardcore gamers and many game developers had similar hatred for free-to-play business models — they were scammy and associated with low-quality games and get-rich-quick schemes. But free-to-play games increased the audience for gaming by tenfold, helped it become the dominant form of entertainment, and now they are more than half the revenue of the game business.

The advocates think that could happen again with blockchain games. I’m not here to agree or disagree with that. I’m here to cover what is one of the biggest divisions in the game industry so I can figure out who gets disrupted. I don’t see the role of the game journalist as choosing which form of gaming to write about. We should just cover it, both when the hype cycle gets started and when it winds down and moves on to something new — like the metaverse. We will see if blockchain plays a role in keeping the metaverse open.

I don’t think every blockchain gaming deal is a good one, and I see a lot of scams. We write about them when we can. I’ve seen the consequences of the crypto and NFT bust for the market and the players who want to make money. But our job is to sort between the scams and the potential leaders. It’s also important to understand the variations and subtleties of the technology, like whether it’s bad for the environment or not. We ask them about the ethics of the business and how they can possibly succeed in turning around attitudes. Their answers are that minds will change when the high-quality games — which take years to make — materialize along with the right technologies and business models.

Game journalism is hurting

Why game journalists ignore pitches.

I’m not here to pick fights with my colleagues, particularly at a very tough time as the recession hits hard. The survey also shows how the business is hurting and journalists are overworked. Sadly, we saw layoffs this week at FanByte, G4 and Future. And we’ve seen longtime leaders leave publications such as Game Informer.

My heart goes out to those who have lost jobs and it’s easy to see why journalists are disappearing and moving into other industries. Most often I see them becoming game makers themselves. I’ve been covering games for 26 years, and I know very few peers who have lasted as long as I have. It’s not an easy life. But I have always had passion for the work, which has brought me into contact with so many people in the game industry — many of whom I’ve talked to over and over again over the years. Gaming is my community, even though I am not skillful playing games.

It’s clear media has changed with the advent of influencers, creators, streamers and the like. About 76% of respondents acknowledged the shared space between influencers and game journalists exists. However, many noted the differences between the two and aired frustrations when influencers are given preferential treatment (codes, access) over journalists, the report said.

With an ever-increasing workload, an amplified pressure on KPIs, and shrinking resources to cover a never-ending list of games, respondents share the reality of working in gaming journalism in 2022, the report said.

“The games industry is growing increasingly competitive, and as a result, we are seeing the media landscape grow and evolve. Since we first conducted this survey in 2018, we have seen the pressures mount on journalists,” said James Kaye, director at Big Games Machine, in a statement. “Unfortunately, the findings from the 2022 survey demonstrate that journalists are working under increased pressure but, despite this, are not given the lead times they need from publishers and PR professionals to review titles. This is problematic, especially given the size of triple-A games and the additional time required to write up these reviews and create additional content formats around them.”

Over half of respondents create video content, and 40% create podcast/audio content, so PR people should ensure their media kits/assets contain plenty of audio and video content when they’re pitching games for review.

Online blogs and websites remain the predominant content medium for our respondents, although it’s interesting to see that over half of them create video content too. It’s not clear whether this content is native to the site(s) they write for or for platforms such as YouTube and Twitch.

Either way, PR people might want to consider including extra video content in their media kits outside of the typical game trailers so time-strapped journalists don’t have to spend extra time gathering footage, the report said.

The lives of game journalists

Platforms that game journalists review games for.

The report said that 42% of game journalists receive between 11 and 30 pitches daily, and 21% receive over 30 pitches daily. I get more than 500 emails a day, though I can’t say how many of those are pitches.

Journalists aren’t being given enough time from PR and game studios to review games and do their jobs properly. Most respondents aired frustrations with short lead times, and over half said a three-week lead is the minimum needed to review a game properly before a launch, the report said.

The transition from “traditional” media platforms to “multimedia” platforms is well underway. Over 50% of respondents produce video content, and 40% create audio content and/or podcasts, the report said.

PC is the most popular platform for journalists, with over 86% of respondents reviewing games on the platform. This is compared to Nintendo Switch (84%), PlayStation 5 (76%), and Xbox Series X/S (67%).

About 40% of respondents are engaged in podcasting, and BGM expects this to grow with podcasts gathering big audiences and services like Spotify and Apple Music heavily promoting them. PR people and studios should consider how to track podcast coverage and how they can work with journalists to create podcast content such as supplying studio staff for interviews, the report said.

Fewer than 10% of journalists create content for print publications. It’s no secret that gaming magazines are becoming increasingly difficult to find on store shelves. While it’s highly unlikely we’ll ever return to the golden years of gaming magazines, there’s some hope yet in the emergence of independent and specialist print publications such as Wireframe, Switch Player, and, of course, the Lost In Cult’s [lock-on] gaming journals.

Over 80% of respondents said being pitched a game directly from a developer or publisher was “important” or “very important,” highlighting how much they value direct relationships and appreciate the studios that invest time into doing this. That said, 68% of journalists provided the same response for being contacted by PR people.

Also interesting is the influence of other games media on journalists when discovering which games to cover, with 40% of journalists saying it was moderately important. For journalists, seeing a competing publication dedicating a large amount of time and space to a game they weren’t planning on covering may influence them. That’s a polite way of seeing we travel in packs.

Access issues to virtual reality hardware are a potential issue for game reviews, with only 35% of respondents having access to VR platforms.

Tips, guides and walkthroughs are becoming an increasingly popular beat with journalists, mainly due to SEO factors. 34% of respondents are involved with guide/walkthrough work. I can honestly say that GamesBeat’s own revenues are not dependent on SEO factors, and so we don’t cover many of the things that are popular with other game journalists. Our events generate our revenue and help us focus on building a community among the business leaders of gaming.

Our next gaming event is GamesBeat Summit Next 2022 on October 25-26 in San Francisco. You’ll probably learn a thing or two about blockchain games and the metaverse — and traditional games too.",blockchain,venturebeat

Jamie Dimon has doubled down on his disdain for bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies, arguing they serve no purpose beyond vacuuming up new buyers' money to pay out profits to their existing holders.

""I'm a major skeptic of crypto tokens, which you call currency, like bitcoin,"" the JPMorgan CEO told the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.

""They are decentralized Ponzi schemes, and the notion that it's good for anybody is unbelievable,"" Dimon added during the hearing, which centered on holding America's biggest banks accountable.

He noted that crypto facilitates theft, money laundering, sex trafficking, and other crimes. ""It is dangerous,"" he said.

The billionaire banker drew a line between digital coins that are purely speculative, and ""real"" technologies such as blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokens that simplify processes or serve some other function.

Indeed, Dimon said he would have no issue with a properly regulated ""stablecoin"", which is a digital currency that has its value pegged to a stable asset such as the US dollar.

""We are a big user of blockchain,"" he said, highlighting the existence of a JPMorgan coin that can be exchanged for dollars at a fixed rate. ""It can be moved just the way cryptocurrencies can be moved — stable value, very low cost.""

Dimon told the same Congressional committee in May 2021 that crypto was inferior to conventional assets such as dollars and gold. He advised investors not to buy them, and urged regulators to scrutinize them more closely.

Moreover, the JPMorgan boss said in 2017 that bitcoin was a fraud, and the hype around it would end in disaster.

Dimon is one of many prominent executives to sound the alarm on crypto. In April, Warren Buffett said he wouldn't pay $25 for all the bitcoin in the world. Buffett's business partner, Charlie Munger, declared the crypto was worthless, undermined the US financial system, and made the nation look foolish compared to others that have banned it.

Bitcoin, which surged in price to north of $64,000 in November, now trades below $20,000. The global crypto market cap has shrunk by more than two-thirds over the same period, from roughly $2.8 trillion to $930 billion.

Dimon also shared his outlook for the US economy during the Wednesday hearing. He warned that rising gas and food prices were squeezing American households. He also flagged lingering supply-chain problems, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the Federal Reserve tightening its monetary policy as concerns hanging over the country.

""While these storm clouds build on the horizon, even the best and brightest economists are split as to whether these could evolve into a major economic storm or something much less severe,"" Dimon said.

Videogamedunkey is big on both meme videos and video game essays, so delving into publishing is certainly huge.

In the two hours that the video making this announcement has been live, it has already amassed 457,000 views and counting.

You can see that exact video below with the completely sincere promise that this isn’t all a goof.

Bigmode’s website gives a nice rundown of what the publisher is all about:

Bigmode is indie publishing with purpose and passion, founded in 2022 by Videogamedunkey (aka Jason) and his wife Leah.



Supporting games being made with substance, quality, creativity, and fun in mind is extremely important to us! The indie game world can feel crowded or oversaturated, so our goal is to give great games a powerful way to stand out.



We love and deeply care about games, as well as artists and creatives in general. Bigmode is our way to foster and support those who are putting the effort and love into their projects to create the best they can— to give them the spotlight they deserve and see more of what we love in gaming.

The Bigmode site also gives more information and sets some clear lines in what will be accepted. Considering the massive controversy in the industry currently, the section on what the new publisher might be looking for mentions “Please note: We are not accepting any games that use NFTs, crypto, or blockchain.”

Today was full of another massive YouTube-related announcement. Sometime soon, YouTube will allow content creators to monetize videos with licensed music. In that same vein, Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai started his own YouTube channel late last month.

The House committee also plans to hold a public hearing on September 28.

Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, a conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, agreed to be interviewed by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, according to CNN.

A date for the meeting was not specified, but CNN reported it will happen in the coming weeks. The January 6 panel also has a public hearing scheduled for September 28.

Ginni Thomas' involvement with efforts to overturn the 2020 election came into question when a series of text messages and emails to one of Trump's top aides and state officials were revealed in the media.

In March, The Washington Post reported on text messages Ginni Thomas wrote to Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows.

After it was made clear that Joe Biden was the president-elect, on November 10, Ginni Thomas texted Meadows: ""Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!...You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America's constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.""

Ginni Thomas also sent Meadows a link to a YouTube video, claiming election fraud, titled, ""TRUMP STING w CIA Director Steve Pieczenik, The Biggest Election Story in History, QFS-BLOCKCHAIN.""

In a follow-up text, she wrote: ""I hope this is true; never heard anything like this before, or even a hint of it. Possible???""

A few months after The Washington Post report, the publication further revealed that Ginni Thomas also emailed Arizona lawmakers days after the 2020 election, urging them to ""do your constitutional duty"" and appoint ""a clean slate of Electors"" for the state.

""Article II of the United States Constitution gives you an awesome responsibility: to choose our state's Electors,"" Thomas wrote in the email.

The revelation of the texts and emails also immediately brought into question possible conflicts of interest for Justice Clarence Thomas, particularly for any cases that may come up regarding the January 6 riot.

Rep. Adam Schiff said in June that the associate justice should not be involved in any cases related to the Capitol assault or efforts to overturn the 2020 vote.

""Justice Thomas, to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, should have nothing to do with any cases relating to January 6, particularly regarding our investigation,"" Schiff said.

Additionally, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed his apprehensions over looming recession fears. He said, “No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be.”

Benchmark indices continue to suffer heavy losses amid deteriorating investors’ sentiments. The S&P 500 has lost 20.5% year-to-date. Moreover, Economist Nouriel Roubini sees further rate hikes in both November and December and a recession occurring at the end of 2022 that could last all of the following year.

He opined, “It’s not going to be a short and shallow recession; it’s going to be severe, long, and ugly.” Also, he added, “Even in a plain vanilla recession, the S&P 500 can fall by 30%.”

Here’s what a 51% attack is and what it means for investors.",https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/51-percent-attack/,"One of the hallmarks of the cryptocurrency space is decentralization. The idea is to give all participants a voice in a crypto network, to provide them with the ability to earn rewards from a network’s growth, and to prevent any single player or authority from taking control and making decisions that benefit them more than other stakeholders.

Source: Getty images

However, decentralization is more than just a democratic feature to woo developers and investors. Decentralization is also a design to keep crypto safe from cyberattacks. One type of technique utilized by hackers is known as a 51% attack. Here’s what you need to know and how it affects cryptocurrency investors. What is a 51% attack? A 51% attack occurs when a single miner (or group of miners) controls more than half of a blockchain network’s hash rate (or computing power). In gaining control over a blockchain network, a hacker can block transactions from taking place, reroute the priority of new transactions being computed, and even reverse some of their own past transaction records (an issue called “double spending”) by altering the data embedded in the blockchain. 51% attacks on a blockchain explained To understand how a 51% attack works, consider the function of a blockchain. Blockchain is a string of code that contains all the historical information about transactions that have taken place using the blockchain network. The code is distributed to all of a blockchain network’s miners -- the powerful computers used to validate transactions and add the new block of data onto the blockchain. By distributing this code to all of the miners, a blockchain network becomes decentralized. In other words, no single minority party can arbitrarily alter or add blocks of data. All participants must agree that a block of data is valid before it is added to the chain. However, by taking more than half of the total computing power operating a blockchain, a hacker or group can create its own consensus on block validity. A majority gives the miner the ability to block new transactions from taking place or to reorder transactions waiting in line to be processed. Besides the “double spend” issue where its own past blocks of data are altered, a 51% attack could also alter and steal any new transactions after it has gained control. However, a 51% attack would unlikely be able to create new crypto coins built on a blockchain or steal crypto holdings from other accounts.

Is a 51% attack possible? Blockchain networks become more decentralized and more secure as they grow larger. Not only does scale increase the difficulty of pulling off a 51% attack, a larger network hash rate also increases the expense involved in executing an attack. Creating and validating blocks, especially older blocks of transaction data with lots of subsequent blocks added since, requires a great deal of computing power. As with all things, computing power costs money -- in this case, the cost of operating the computers and the electricity consumed to power the computation. So large blockchain networks such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) have a low likelihood of a 51% attack being carried out against them. And, even if a single miner accumulated enough hash rate, the expense of trying to reverse past transactions would likely be too cost-prohibitive to carry out. Although a 51% attack could be somewhat contained, it can significantly harm the reputation of a blockchain network and crypto tokens used on it. As a result, miners might choose to leave, which could further reduce security and lower the value of any crypto assets built on the blockchain. Past examples of 51% attacks Some smaller blockchain networks in particular can be subject to malicious tampering. A hacker could use more powerful computing equipment, such as ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), on a network, primarily using off-the-shelf purchased GPUs (graphics processing units) to carry out a 51% attack. Although even more unlikely, a proof-of-stake system could also be attacked by accumulating more than half of the value of crypto tokens on a network. Although unlikely, a 51% attack is possible -- and has occurred in some instances. One example is Bitcoin Gold (CRYPTO:BTG), a hard fork from Bitcoin, that suffered a 51% attack in 2018. More than $18 million of Bitcoin Gold was stolen. Another attempted hack came in 2020 but was quickly thwarted. In 2021, another Bitcoin hard fork called Bitcoin SV (CRYPTO:BSV) suffered a series of 51% attacks. The hackers were able to delete or alter the newest blocks after it took control of the network. Ethereum Classic (CRYPTO:ETC), which was also created by a hard fork from Ethereum in 2016, got hit by a 51% attack in 2020. Several million dollars were reportedly stolen. In all three cases, developers were able to implement new protocols to help prevent further malicious tampering. However, all three cryptos deteriorated in value in the months immediately following these events.

Blockchain attacks and investors All computing systems are going to be subject to attempted attack from bad actors. This is a risk that digital currencies in general face, and it’s a factor investors should consider before buying a cryptocurrency or participating in a blockchain network’s activity. However, more traditional money has its issues, too, such as forgery. While 51% attacks are rare, there are other risks with the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. This is new technology, and it's still developing and rapidly evolving. Additionally, many disagree on how to properly value cryptocurrencies and digital assets, so cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. If you decide to invest in this space at all, remember to make it part of a well-diversified portfolio that features other asset classes.",blockchain,motley fool

Today, Opera Crypto Browser, the world’s first Web3-focused browser with native support for decentralized applications (dApps) and a non-custodial wallet, is announcing plans to expand its already robust suite of networks by integrating the Elrond (EGLD) blockchain, a highly scalable, fast and secure blockchain platform for distributed apps, and enterprise use cases.

Following the implementation planned for the end of 2022, you will be able to send and receive Elrond’s native token, EGLD, via the built-in Opera crypto wallet — allowing them to tap into a blockchain capable of processing 15,000 transactions per second (TPS). You will also gain access to Elrond-based dApps, such as global and automated trading platform Maiar Exchange alongside a plethora of P2E games, including Cantina Royale, Knights of Cathena and Age of Zalmoxis, without requiring any third-party browser extensions or wallet applications.

This is what Susie Batt, Crypto Ecosystem Lead at Opera had to say about this exciting partnership: “The seamless integration of Elrond further expands the wide array of crypto-centric services available to Opera Crypto Browser users. Such interoperability is becoming increasingly important for any project aiming to embrace Web3, and we are excited to have another blockchain partner join us on our mission to accelerate the evolution of the internet.”

Launched in July 2020, Elrond positions itself as an “internet-scale blockchain” focused on accessibility, high transaction speeds, security, and user experience. This is achieved thanks to innovative adaptive state sharding technology and the network’s Secure-Proof-of-Stake (SPoS) consensus algorithm.

In particular, sharding algorithms allow the distribution of complex computations between different nodes to speed up transactions and increase throughput. While the concept is also being used or added to the roadmap by other networks, including Ethereum 2.0, Elrond is the first blockchain where all three aspects of sharding — state, network, and transactions — are implemented simultaneously.

Further, by making the sharding architecture adaptable, Elrond developers have ensured the blockchain’s high level of scalability, which currently achieves a throughput of over 15,000 TPS and a six-second transaction finality time. At the same time, the SPoS mechanism aims to provide increased security by mitigating potential attack vectors that Proof-of-Work blockchains are usually susceptible to.

“Elrond’s novel approach to consensus and sharding algorithms allows it to achieve remarkable performance while using the least amount of energy possible and without overly relying on high-end hardware,” explained Beniamin Mincu, Elrond Network CEO. “We’re excited to be tapping into Opera’s vast userbase to offer them cheaper, faster transactions as well as access to Elrond’s burgeoning dapp ecosystem.”

Adding Elrond to Opera Crypto Browser is yet another step to making Web3 more inclusive and friendly for people who use the platform. Since the project’s launch in 2018, Opera has also integrated multiple decentralized networks, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, Polygon, and announced partnerships with Pancakeswap, 1inch, NEAR, Solana and others.

We look forward to letting you know as soon as the integration is ready!",blockchain,opera.com

Cryptocurrency markets continue to be extremely volatile this week, and right now tokens seems to be going in different directions. Some have spiked today on little more than speculation while others have dropped.

The value of Ethereum (ETH -2.52%) has dropped 4.5% in the last 24 hours as of 1:30 p.m. ET, continuing its post-Merge slide. Smaller cryptocurrencies had a much better day with XRP (XRP -2.18%) up 12.2%, Algorand (ALGO -0.65%) up 12.9%, and Celsius (CEL -7.18%) rising a modest 1.6%.

So what

Ethereum seems to be coming under pressure on multiple fronts. JPMorgan said today that it sees pressure continuing on Ethereum due to a ""hard fork"" of the blockchain to remain on proof-of-work and the blockchain becoming less decentralized because of a small number of stakers who could control the network.

The SEC charged Ripple Labs, the developer of XRP, with securities fraud in December 2020 and for nearly two years the case has been sitting in court. XRP is rallying after both Ripple and the SEC filed for summary judgments -- allowing the court to make a decision based on evidence without going to a formal trial -- which could speed up the case. Right now, the expectation is that a resolution could be reached by year end.

Algorand jumped after announcing Michele Quintaglie will be the new chief marketing officer. Quintaglie has experience at Visa, Fidelity, and Raytheon Technologies, so she has significant experience with traditional financial firms. For now, that's being seen as a sign of maturity for Algorand, which is something the industry is seeking. Algorand is looking to upend financial services businesses with fast transactions and quick finality of blockchain transactions, which could be seen as a reason to adopt it.

Now what

The move for Ethereum seems to be the most concerning. All of the wind came out of the cryptocurrency's sails after The Merge, and it is now being compared to other blockchains on a performance basis. That's not good because Ethereum is slower and more expensive than most blockchains and it doesn't even have decentralization going for it anymore.

On top of that, financial markets in general are in turmoil as the Federal Reserve indicates that it's going to raise interest rates until inflation is under control. Higher rates means Ethereum stakers, who are only generating yield from their cryptocurrency, have less incentive to keep their tokens staked. That can lead to selling pressure.

As for Algorand and XRP, these moves seem to be speculative at best. I would like to see improved adoption of these cryptocurrencies and expanding ecosystems before jumping in. I certainly don't think today's news is a reason to buy either.

Volatility continues to be the one constant in crypto and today is no different.",blockchain,motley fool

223,This Popular Crypto Could Double in Value in 2023,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/701525/business-woman-folder-coffee-leader-boss-city-office-downtown.jpg,22/09/2022,Innovation in areas ranging from NFTs to Web3 could propel Polygon to triple-digit gains next year.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/this-popular-crypto-could-double-in-value-in-2023/,"In the months leading up to The Merge, investors began looking for indirect ways to profit from this technology upgrade of Ethereum (ETH -2.52%). They naturally focused on Polygon (MATIC -0.51%), the premier Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. If The Merge was going to make Ethereum more valuable than ever, the thinking went, then it only made sense that it would boost the value of Polygon as well. During the summer, Polygon enjoyed a mini-boom when it tripled in value in a period of just two months.

While some of the hype around The Merge has cooled, Polygon continues to be hot. Still trading for less than $1, there is a strong case for gains as investors start to price in recent developments.

New NFT innovations

The biggest news for Polygon of late has been the announcement of a new loyalty program for Starbucks (SBUX -3.36%) based on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The new Starbucks loyalty program plans to go well beyond the old ""punch your card 10 times, and you get a free coffee"" type of loyalty program. Instesd, it might mean participating in metaverse experiences or collecting one-of-a-kind artwork every time you visit a Starbucks store. You won't need to show ""proof of punch"" to redeem rewards because everything will be digitally recorded on the Polygon blockchain.

The Starbucks loyalty program is an example of how cryptocurrencies like Polygon continue to innovate on the concept of the NFT. In the first iteration, NFTs were simply digital artwork that you could buy and sell. But cryptos like Polygon have figured out how to add a layer of utility to each NFT. In this case, NFTs are being integrated into a customer loyalty program.

New Web3 innovations

But these developments with NFTs might only be scratching the surface of what's possible with Polygon. According to Polygon, The Merge could bring 1 billion users into a decentralized Web3. Ethereum is already a market leader in areas such as blockchain gaming and the metaverse, so it makes sense that Polygon has been able to leverage this success to attract new Web3 projects. If the 1 billion figure is accurate, then it hints at a much bigger opportunity than many have previously considered.

In a recent interview, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal suggested that other partnerships beyond Starbucks were on the way, including deals with Meta (META -2.71%) and Disney (DIS -2.27%). Polygon is already part of Disney's Accelerator program for 2022, so this partnership could prove particularly important in creating new Web3 experiences.

Polygon remains undervalued

Can Polygon actually double in value? At its current price of $0.74, Polygon is still far below its all-time high of $2.92. Even if it doubles in price, Polygon would still be trading nearly 50% lower than its all-time-high reached less than 12 months ago.

For the past two years, it has been fashionable in crypto circles to talk about up-and-coming blockchains that have the potential to be an ""Ethereum killer."" However, according to Polygon's Nailwal, ""ETH is the ETH killer."" In other words, the new-and-improved Ethereum 2.0 resulting from The Merge is ""the next Ethereum,"" and there is no need to look elsewhere. If that is indeed the case, then the future looks bright for Polygon. It means that Polygon can continue to piggyback on the success of Ethereum.

There is a lot going right for Polygon, and I'm very much encouraged by all of the innovation happening in the Polygon ecosystem. It's hard to understand why the price of Polygon is still mired in the sub-$1 range. Based on all the developments in NFTs and Web3, Polygon appears to be a screaming buy. As long as Ethereum shows no ill effects from The Merge, I am convinced that Polygon is going to double in value over the next 12 months.",blockchain,motley fool

Tagged Project Dynamo, the prototype will leverage the robust benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi), distributed ledger technology (DLT), and smart contracts to restore investors’ faith in the industry. The move is also geared towards improving the amount of funding available to SMEs and solving the problem of cross-border financing.

“The intention is to enable policymakers and the financial service industry to develop a deeper understanding of whether and how these technologies can reduce transaction and borrowing costs, facilitate productive financing and promote financial inclusion,” BIS wrote in a statement.

The role of SMEs in the national economy is often overlooked, but a study conducted by the World Bank points out that they make up 90% of businesses and employ up to 50% of the working population. Despite their integral role in the national fabric, they are often plagued with funding challenges up to the tune of over $5.2 trillion in funding needs unmet annually.

BIS notes that these challenges have been made grimmer following the effects of the coronavirus disease pandemic on the global economy. Both parties claimed that using DLT will open a new frontier for funding SMEs by confirming the veracity of invoices and preventing the multiple uses of one invoice to raise numerous funds. Peer-to-peer lending on DeFi platforms is one way that BIS says will improve SMEs, and using central bank digital currency (CBDC) might provide answers to the debacle of cross-border payments.

“In addition to project Dynamo, the research will extend into related topics such as decentralized identifiers and the interoperability of digital payment methods such as stablecoins and central bank digital currencies,” read the statement. “The use of artificial intelligence and big data to enhance SME credit risk assessment and innovative supply chain financing solutions are also of interest to us.”

BIS leading the charge

The BIS, a body comprising 61 central banks, is at the fore of exploring novel ways of improving cross-border payments. The body has not shied away from researching digital assets’ viability in attaining its goals.

In particular, BIS believes that CBDCs are the future of international payments, given “the structural limitations of crypto and decentralized finance.”

The body claims that the progress of wholesale and retail CBDCs would foster financial inclusion while protecting users’ privacy. Hong Kong is in the process of creating its digital currency in the mold of the Chinese digital yuan but is proceeding with caution.

The order penalizes the protocol and its founders Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner $250,000 for offering illegal, off-exchange trading of digital assets, registration violations and neglecting to adopt a customer ID program required by the Bank Secrecy Act compliance program.

The CFTC has simultaneously filed a civil enforcement action charging the Ooki DAO, the successor to bZeroX, with violating the same laws as bZeroX. It seeks restitution, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, trading and registration bans and injunctions against further violations.

“These actions are part of the CFTC’s broader efforts to protect U.S. customers in a rapidly evolving decentralized finance environment,” said Acting Director of Enforcement Gretchen Lowe in a statement. “Margined, leveraged, or financed digital asset trading offered to retail U.S. customers must occur on properly registered and regulated exchanges in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. These requirements apply equally to entities with more traditional business structures as well as to DAOs.”

Commissioner Summer Mersinger opposed the action, however, saying she was disappointed the commission chose to act.

""We cannot arbitrarily decide who is accountable for those violations based on an unsupported legal theory amounting to regulation by enforcement while federal and state policy is developing,"" Mersinger said in a statement explaining her dissent.

230,Why Devcon 7 Should Be in Istanbul,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0lhsh6shw1NaOigrYYRJ7Q--~B/aD02MDA7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/4229ed60afff421ecd62a47528e878a4,22/09/2022,Hosting Ethereum’s biggest event in Turkey can build on what is already strong interest in blockchain and crypto technology.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-devcon-7-istanbul-155249595.html,"Devcon, the most important event for Ethereum developers and researchers, might well be in Istanbul next year. If it happens, it would be thanks to a campaign from the Turkish cryptocurrency community, which has evolved into a truly powerful community.

This year's Devcon will be held in Bogota, Colombia, in October, but the organizers have already started thinking about next year’s destination. A recent survey on the Devcon forum received seven suggestions so far. A couple of young Turks proposed Istanbul as a candidate and received huge support: The volume of comments and views in favor of the proposal is far ahead of the next candidate, Nha Trang City, Vietnam.

Turan Sert is a tech entrepreneur and financial writer with a focus on Web 3. He currently acts as an adviser to BlockchainIST Center and Paribu, both based in Turkey.

Leading figures in the Turkish crypto community have already established an informal committee to organize what could be the most important crypto event in the country’s history.

Why Istanbul?

Recent market research suggests 8 million Turks are holding crypto assets. High inflation (80% year over year) and devaluation of local currency Turkish lira (126% year over year against the U.S. dollar) are among key reasons why Turks are seeking alternative investments that hold their value. While foreign currencies and gold have historically been prominent tools to hedge against inflation, cryptocurrencies have emerged as a popular option, which led the International Monetary Fund to coin the term “cryptoization” in its “Global Stability Report” released last October.

There are plenty of non-crypto reasons for choosing Istanbul for Devcon 2023. Easy access is one (almost 600 direct flights from 117 countries to Istanbul daily, with either no visa required or available at the entrance for most visitors). Proximity to Europe and Asia is another. Meanwhile, the city has safe and affordable neighborhoods with lots of attractive venues.

Story continues

These are all valid points but there has to be more than that for organizers to select a city. They will wonder: Is there an active crypto community and would organizing a conference here make a difference in that community?

In Turkey, the developer community has always been relatively small compared to crypto asset holders but it is growing rapidly with university students taking the lead. The country has one of the youngest populations in the world – (almost half of the population is younger than 30) of which 8.4 million are enrolled in higher education. How about crypto interest? In our latest count, there were 41 university blockchain clubs with hundreds of members (a leading one, ITU Blockchain, has roughly about 2500 volunteers alone). When I was appointed as an advisor to BlockchainIST, the first university blockchain research center in Istanbul, a couple of years ago, this number was less than 10.

Why such a dramatic increase? I asked several blockchain clubs and they came back with similar response.

The appetite for growth

First of all, there is a growing appetite among the new generation for integration into global markets. Digital opportunities with blockchain projects are among key avenues to fulfill this dream. But visa requirements and the recent devaluation of Turkish lira against all major currencies have effectively made it almost impossible for young people to move out of the country, either for pleasure or work.

Despite this, students have started to attend global events since restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic were lifted. Following a local hackathon last December, 10 or so students from three different university clubs joined Avalanche Barcelona Summit. Soon after, small groups managed to travel to ETHAmsterdam, ETHPrague, ETHBarcelona, ETHCC 5, Eth Mexico City and lastly ETHBerlin. A group of 10 students is planning to attend Devcon Bogota as well. Those were all made possible by scholarships granted by organizers, local businesses (such as LykaDAO and Paribu) as well as global players (such as Aave and Talent House).

Several local initiatives have sparked the interest in the local community as well. First, several hackathons, including AvalancheHacks, NFT and Metaverse Hackhaton and Blockcircus. Several and student club organizations such as Blockchain and Beyond Summit and Blockchain Networking Day attracted significant crowds. Several corporate events namely Blockchain Economy Summit, NFT Summit, Eurasia Blockchain Summit, Kriptofest, Istanbul Blockchain Week all raised the awareness in corporate world (though the quality of such events varies significantly).

On top of that, recent gatherings such as Cyptist and Mina Developer Meetup also attracted interest from the developer community. The momentum continues with weekly CryptoMondays events, and several people aiming to organize an ETH Istanbul in the near future.

Boosting the potential

Kaan, a pseudonymous employees of Ethereum Foundation, had a similar experience. He became interested in the area only after he took a blockchain class while an undergrad at Bogazici University. Most of his friends chose AI/ML [artificial intelligence/machine learning] back then. Had there been a blockchain club around or events organized at the time, many more of his friends would have opted for blockchain projects.

Let's not forget that the Turkish developer ecosystem here is not confined to Turks. Recent unfortunate events in Ukraine resulted in a flood of developers from Ukraine and Russia coming into Istanbul and coastal regions of Turkey. A friend of mine helped three businesses with close to 200 software engineers to relocate here. This fresh influx of talent will have a positive impact on the growth of the developer community in the region.

In short: Turkey has a young population with strong potential but with limited access to the global crypto community. A handful of them get scholarships and attend global events (and win prizes). This creates a buzz in the local environment, while local events raise awareness among businesses and help bring in new talent.

Statemind Audits Lido Ahead Of Ethereum Merge

Statemind has released a report detailing its latest audit of the Lido. Lido has been a popular project among the crypto industry due to its close proximity to the Ethereum Merge, potentially making it a high-profile target. Lido allows token holders to use staked ETH as collateral to trade, earn rewards, and more without locking up ETH for years at a time.

The nine-page report outlines the MEV-Boost relay allowlist project and its results. The on-chain relay allowlist is planned to be used by Node Operators participating in the Lido protocol after the ETH Merge to extract MEV, according to Lido policies.

Node Operators would utilize the contract to maintain up-to-date software configuration.

Statemind Audit Report Reveals No Critical Lido Bugs Or Vulnerabilities

In total, zero critical, high, or medium-priority vulnerabilities were discovered. Seven informational bugs were reported to the Lido team involving minor, easily fixable vulnerabilities that pose no substantial threat.

The security auditing report on Lido is the first major public audit released by Statemind since its debut this month. Statemind made its first major public appearance after stepping forward as the white hat hacker who saved $350M in funds across the Avalanche protocol.

Additional Statemind clients include 1INCH and Yearn.Finance.

About Statemind

Statemind has more than 100,000 LoC worth of Solidity and Vyper experience. Combined, the blockchain security auditing firm has secured over $10B in TVL.

Galvanized by official backing from the European Union, its founder believes the company can succeed where others have failed, with open-source technology meaning anyone can join forces to stop the influx of counterfeit goods.

Distributed ledgers, which in principle offer an immutable record of provenance that can’t be altered, should be a good way to verify supply chains. But Eonpass’ leadership is well aware of the problems that have previously bedeviled the sector known as enterprise blockchain.

Eonpass has an advantage. In March, it won a competition run by the European Union’s intellectual property office, EUIPO. Alongside partners including consulting firm EY and freight forwarder Jet Air Service, Eonpass had the best model for using blockchain technology to detect fraudulent goods arriving at the border, according to EUIPO, a branch of the EU’s administration responsible for trademarks and similar issues.

That has put a spring in the step of Eonpass’ founder, Thomas Rossi.

“As a startup I have to be optimistic,” Rossi told CoinDesk in an online interview. “I took a lot of time to study why previous enterprise blockchains – I don't want to say they failed, but they didn't scale.”

EUIPO’s interest is clear: Counterfeiting costs.

A 2019 study by consultants at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) put the global price tag of fake pharmaceuticals at between $75 billion and $200 billion, with phony electronic parts costing a further $100 billion. EUIPO itself says 6.8% of the EU’s imports from the rest of the world are fake, corresponding to around $134 billion per year. Plus there’s the nonfinancial cost of having unsafe drugs or children's toys on the market.

Fighting this isn’t easy. Customs officers the world over have a stark choice of whether to trust easily forged paperwork or force individual pallets open to check. Banks stake significant volumes of trade finance on the outcome.

Story continues

Opaque

Trade in conventional goods – like prescription drugs or electronics – “is a very opaque industry and there is no way to link one shipment to the originating brand owner that approves the content of the shipment and this destination,” Rossi said.

More innovative assets like non-fungible tokens, blockchain-powered assets which are supposedly used to prove an item’s ownership and authenticity, can still be faked: he cites the appearance of knock-off Hermès NFTs on OpenSea, and compares NFT platforms to a Wild West free of intellectual property rights.

Rossi – like BCG – believes blockchain can help, providing customs officers with an unfakeable attestation. While IBM’s product runs on the company’s own blockchain, based on the open-source Hyperledger, Rossi’s will be adaptable enough to work with brands who might already have opted to use Ethereum rather than an alternative blockchain such as Polygon, he said.

“The most important function of blockchains is that they create a shared clock,” Rossi said. “So you cannot cheat on the chronological order of events.”

Existing blockchain products – he cites TradeLens, an initiative of computer giant IBM and shipping company Maersk – might have worked well for a small handful of well-resourced big businesses, but not for what he calls the “long tail” of numerous, smaller subcontractors.

IBM’s initiative is “not really open source, so there is no way to spin up a node and connect to a network,” Rossi said. “Maybe inside their closed system, everything works fine … but leaving the system or letting someone else from another system come in – that part is extremely difficult.”

Contacted by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for IBM said that TradeLens is “built on open standards” and “enables supply chain participants to securely and transparently share data with one another.”

Following the publication of this article, IBM further clarified that TradeLens has more than a thousand participating organizations which include small logistics firms and trucking companies. The initiative has thus far covered 65 million containers and 4.7 billion shipping events, such as a clearing of customers or transfer between carriers, which IBM says is ""not a small number."" The platform can also accept data from ocean carriers whether or not they are members, and it can run in multiple environments beyond IBM Cloud.

Closed, proprietary systems have their advantages, notably allowing a tighter grip on revenues to recoup investment. Yet, grabbing even a sliver of the $10 trillion spent on global trade would be worthwhile. Rossi has a plan for that, too.

Early on, Rossi reckons he can make money by consulting for big business clients; later, by offering efficient data services for trade financers. He wants to move up from the three companies already testing to 10 by the end of next year, and 100 within a couple of years.

“I've already spoken with a couple of banks here in Italy. They're really looking forward to having some more efficient way to handle the decisions that they make about the financing of value shipments,” he said. “The monetization comes after the network is as large as possible.”

Unlikely evangelist

Support from the EUIPO is helpful, Rossi says, not least for making potential luxury brand clients sit up and take notice. And the EU agency remains an evangelist for a system it thinks could help overworked border guards.

“Given the limited resources of enforcement officers, technologies such as blockchain could prove to be game-changing tools in the fight against trade in counterfeit products,” a spokesperson for the EUIPO told CoinDesk in a written interview. “Globally stakeholders are using various systems, which when operating are often disjointed, and this isolation is used by criminal networks to their advantage.”

Results of the proof of concept for Eonpass’ model will be presented early next year, with a basic product publicly available by the end of 2023, EUIPO says. The EU agency itself is creating a database to match brands to public keys, so customs agents can check declarations signed on the blockchain are valid. It’s also working with U.S. counterparts, and presented a paper to the World Intellectual Property Organization earlier in September.

The vision is an infrastructure “where any interested party (producers, consumers, transport services, etc.) can easily check the authenticity of a product and alert right-holders when an infringing product is detected,” said a leaked version of the paper, whose authenticity EUIPO has since confirmed.

All will be watching to see if, with EU backing, business-focused blockchain ideas can actually thrive in the wild.

The HIP 70 proposal concluded voting early Thursday morning, with some 81% voting in favor of migration in early Asian hours. Participants staked the helium token (HNT) to participate in the on-chain vote. In order for a vote to migrate the network to pass, a two-thirds majority was needed.

Some 6,177 community members voted in favor of the move by staking over 12 million HNT. Just 1,270 voted against it.

Developers behind Helium proposed the migration to Solana to help scale the protocol through more efficient transactions as well as interoperability. The move will transfer all tokens, applications and governance to the network.

""Solana has a proven track record powering some of the world’s most important decentralized initiatives and they were an obvious choice for us to partner with,"" Scott Sigel, COO of the Helium Foundation, said in a statement. ""Moving to the Solana blockchain allows us to focus our efforts on scaling the network as opposed to managing the blockchain itself.”

The migration will see HNT, MOBILE and IOT issued on the Solana network, which will continue to be the tokens in the Helium ecosystem. Once the migration is complete, a new version of the Helium Wallet App will be made available. Additionally, the Helium layer 1 blockchain history will remain public. Users will be able to access the new application by updating their current wallet app. HNT holders can also use other wallets within the Solana ecosystem, such as Phantom or Solflare.

However, although the votes show overwhelming support for the migration, not everyone has been on board with the network’s choice to move to Solana. Last week, Borderless Capital, an Algorand-focused VC that is backed by Helium, took to Twitter to suggest the network reconsider its choice to move to Solana, and instead move to Algorand.

The integration would help Opera users directly access a host of decentralized applications (DApps) and other popular services through the integrated Opera wallet.

Elrond is a scalable blockchain network that offers various infrastructure services for DApps, enterprise use cases and the new internet economy. The blockchain’s adaptive state sharding makes it one of the fastest and more efficient networks.

With the integration, Opera users will have access to the Elrond Standard Digital Token (ESDT), a native token issuance standard, in addition to the native EGLD tokens, making it a great entry point for Web3. Users will be able to take part without relying on a third-party wallet, ensuring seamless transactions and added security.

In an exclusive conversation with Cointelegraph, Danny Yao, senior product manager at Opera, said that the company is actively pursuing a multichain policy, having integrated Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, and BNB Chain earlier. He explained:

“Our aim is to be an understandable and secure entry point to Web3 for anyone interested in crypto. This also means we have provided a wallet selector feature that lets our users choose which wallet they want to use to interact with a particular DApp.”

Opera browser offers an integrated noncustodial crypto wallet, making it an apt entry point for millions of users that can access multiple blockchain ecosystems from this single entry point.

Talking about the growing security vulnerabilities among DApps and how Opera is mitigating those risks, Yao explained:

“We have provided a wallet selector feature that lets our users choose which wallet they want to use to interact with a particular DApp. We also have a secure clipboard, safeguarding our user’s data as they copy-paste sensitive data such as wallet addresses or bank account numbers.”

Elrond blockchain is one of the first European carbon-negative blockchains, ensuring Opera users will have access to eco-friendly solutions.

Meanwhile, Helium's tokens and governance will relocate to that of the Solana blockchain. As told by developers, the benefits of the move would include more of its native token HNT available to subDAO reward pools, more consistent mining, more reliable data transfer, more utility for HNT and subDAO tokens, and more ecosystem support.

Helium is a blockchain wireless communications protocol. The same week, Nova Labs, the creator of Helium, signed an agreement with American telecommunications provider T-Mobile to launch Helium Mobile, a crypto-powered mobile service that will enable subscribers to earn crypto rewards. Helium Mobile subscribers on this cellular plan can opt-in to earn token rewards for sharing data about coverage quality and helping identify Helium dead-spot locations nationwide. A 5G capable device is required.

As a decentralized wireless network, Helium provides open-source coverage worldwide. Since its launch in 2019, over 900,000 hotspots using Helium have been deployed, with 1,000 units added daily. There are currently over 2,500 active Helium hotspots with 5G in 889 U.S. cities since the program became active in August 2022.

Solana, Helium's new blockchain, is known as a hub for building decentralized applications. When considering vote transactions, Solana's daily transactions have grown from about 100 million to 200 million per day. The blockchain's user count has surged past 1 million starting from May of this year.

He joins as President, Roku Media, effective in late October, based in New York.

The surprising move is a major statement of intent from Roku.

Collier will oversee advertising and content at the digital streaming company. He will run Roku Media globally, managing its ad platform business as well as content for Roku’s owned and operated channels, including The Roku Channel.

During his time with the Fox linear network, which came largely after the sale of most of 21st Century Fox to the Walt Disney Company, he was responsible for launching Studio Ramsay Global with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, launching Blockchain Creative Labs, and acquiring Bento Box Entertainment and MarVista Entertainment.

Roku increasingly has been getting into the original content game. It acquired the assets of short-lived shortform service Quibi and hired former ITV America Chief Content Officer David Eilenberg as Head of Originals.

The company has plans to bolster its pipeline of original series and films even further with plans to order around 50 series and films during the next two years.

It launched its first feature film – Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas – in December, a follow-up to the canceled NBC series, and earlier this week unveiled plans to have an exclusive second window, after Spectrum Originals, for Nick Stoller and Carla Kettner’s Florida dramedy Panhandle. Its next movie, Weird: The Al Yankovich Story starring Daniel Radcliffe, just premiered at the Toronto Film Festival.

Roku also has been staffing up during the past 18 months; Deadline revealed last year that it had hired two executives from Quibi – Colin Davis was tapped as Head of Scripted Originals and Brian Tannenbaum as Head of Alternative Originals.

Alison Levin, VP Ad Revenue and Marketing Solutions, Louqman Parampath, VP Ad Product, Mirjam Laux, VP International Advertising and Content and Rob Holmes, VP Programming, will report to Collier.

Collier’s hire comes as part of a trio of moves for Roku, which also sees Mustafa Ozgen and Gidon Katz promoted to President, Devices and President, Consumer Experience, respectively.

All three report to Anthony Wood, Roku’s founder and CEO.

“There is a tremendous opportunity to further accelerate and evolve Roku’s business as the streaming platform built for advertising, and Charlie is the ideal person to help us capitalize on the moment,” said Wood. “He is a proven leader who brings vast experience, a history of evolving businesses, strong creative instincts, talent relationships and a track record of driving revenue and growth. He will play an integral role in helping us achieve even greater success as a next-generation media company.”

Opera, one of the original web browsers, has been building crypto products since 2018. It released a beta version of its specialist “Crypto Browser Project” in January.

In March, the Norwegian browser company added in-browser crypto wallet support for eight other blockchains, including Solana and Polygon.

Opera and other crypto-focussed browsers, like Brave, have been betting big on an explosion in Web3, which refers to the third generation of Internet services driven by blockchain. The increased Web3 integration will make it easier for users to interact with different decentralized finance (DeFi) and other on-chain ecosystems.

“The vision we share and the common goal of minimizing user onboarding friction into Web3 are the driving force behind this new collaboration,” Beniamin Mincu, CEO of Elrond, said.

Later this year, Opera will add support for Elrond’s dapps, blockchain applications that run without a central administrator, and its native token EGLD, Senior product manager of Opera Crypto Browser, Danny Yao told CoinDesk.

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, Opera has over 300 million users. At press time, Opera refused to disclose its crypto users' number.

The Nu Identity Ecosystem is powered by Kii, a new utility token. The company is using LATOKEN as the launchpad for its IEO and will launch the token in partnership with The Kii Foundation.

Kii token holders will be the first to access the NuID ecosystem, which empowers users to choose what identifying data they want to share on the web, and to whom they share it.

Token holders can use Kii to register their authentication credentials on a public blockchain, issue data attestations, access future identity use cases within the ecosystem and more. This includes and is not limited to KYC and identity verification, credential issuance, healthcare records, digitized assets, education credentials, verified claims, and decentralized data storage.

“Such an ecosystem will provide users the ability to own, control, and permit the use of identity-related data efficiently and allow businesses to become ‘consumers’ of these identities and their associated metadata vs. the other way around. This in turn will increase the volume of more privacy-centric interactions on the web,” said Locke Brown, CEO and founder at NuID.

“We are flipping the data ownership dynamic, which benefits users and services. Companies don’t have to secure huge amounts of user data and users no longer have to share their sensitive, identifying information. In the next few years, vast amounts of personal data and credentials will be represented on a blockchain by a public identifier that reveals no user data, and cannot be backwards solved for the original secret,” adds Ibrahim Pataudi VP Business Development at NuID.",blockchain,help net security

Like other blockchains (for example, Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX)) that scale better than their counterpart, it has been dubbed an “Ethereum killer.” After raising $40 million in funds, Fantom launched its mainnet in December 2019. Since then, it has grown to become one of the most popular blockchains, sitting in the top 10 blockchains by total value locked (TVL) with $1.3 billion in TVL.

Fantom’s high-throughput blockchain is an open-source smart contract platform. It is scalable and EVM-compatible, meaning you can deploy and run your Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) on Fantom. Its structure enables the support for its decentralized finance (DeFi), other than managing digital assets and DApps.

The Fantom consensus mechanism is an adapted version of proof-of-stake, and it’s called Lachesis. It’s been designed to provide high-speed transactions, low fees and almost instant finality due to the aBFT algorithm. aBFT can scale to many nodes worldwide in a permissionless, open-source environment, offering a good level of decentralization.

The Fantom blockchain is powered by its native FTM token, and if you believe in the project and want to grow your FTM stack, you can consider staking Fantom to earn passive income.

What is Fantom staking?

Staking is making a blockchain more secure by locking up an investor’s digital assets for a certain amount of time. This security is provided by validators who validate transactions with their staked tokens, which becomes an economic incentive for them to behave according to the protocol’s rules.

By staking FTM, investors actively participate in securing its network while earning passive income, i.e., FTM rewards. Staking means that tokens will have to be locked up for some time; however, they will still be sitting in the owners’ wallets, only they can access and unlock their funds anytime.

How to stake FTM

The minimum stake amount to run a validator is 500,000 FTM to prevent Sybil attacks on its consensus mechanism. Sybil attacks are malicious attacks that involve falsifying multiple identities to gain an undue advantage within a network. As the validator’s required amount is relatively high, it becomes easier to delegate FTM to a validator.

A few Fantom staking strategies can be used:

Fluid staking: Investors can lock up their FTM token from two weeks to 365 days for better returns. The reward varies according to the length of the staking period; the longer FTMs are staked, the higher the reward rate. Liquid staking: Investors can mint sFTM for improved ROI when liquid staking. They can also stake farmed tokens, participate in liquidity mining, farm LP rewards and more. Custodial staking: Investors can take FTM on a centralized exchange (CEX) like Binance or Coinbase. The staking reward is 1%.

To stake on Fantom, users can follow these simple steps:

Have a minimum of 1 FTM to stake; Go to the Fantom staking page and click Stake your FTM;

You can log in with a compatible wallet, like MetaMask. You can open the wallet from your computer or your mobile device. You can create a new wallet or access an existing one using a mnemonic or seed phrase. Deposit your FTM by transferring them from an exchange or another wallet to your Fantom Opera wallet address. Click on “Staking.” Add a delegation by choosing a validator and an amount. Select your lock-up period and confirm.

There are a few options when it comes to optimal Fantom wallets. The Fantom Opera network is a second-layer and EVM-compatible blockchain, meaning that you can use any wallet that works for Ethereum, such as MetaMask, the Coinbase Wallet or a cold wallet like Ledger.

After creating an account on Fantom, you can also download your Fantom wallet (fwallet) by clicking on the “Create Wallet” button:

Where to stake FTM?

Other than its native blockchain network, Fantom can be staked across many platforms, including decentralized exchanges (DEX) and custodial blockchains. Here we’ll look at the places to stake Fantom so you can decide which is the most suitable.

How to stake Fantom on Ledger

Staking through a hardware wallet like Ledger works through a smart contract interaction, like other transactions. It’s sufficient to stake from the Fantom fWallet by signing Fantom FTM Ledger Nano S application. Then, use the “Stake” menu item on your account.

How to stake Fantom on Coinbase

In September 2021, Fantom announced support for the Fantom network on the Coinbase Wallet. Coinbase Wallet users can access and use the Fantom network and engage with Fantom DApps. Users can connect their Coinbase Wallet account to their Fantom fWallet and conduct activities such as stake FTM and earn rewards.

How to stake Fantom on Binance

To stake FTM on Binance, you have to deposit a convenient amount on the exchange, then go to Binance Earn and pick the suitable product for you; usually, it’s a locked up period of 30, 60, or 120 days. You can choose a more extended staking period for higher returns up to 14%.

How to stake Fantom on Kucoin

Similarly to Binance, you must deposit your FTM token on Kucoin and go to Kucoin Earn. Then click “Subscribe” to pick the product that suits you better, based on rewards and the time you want to lock your assets.

Is it safe to stake FTM?

It is safe to stake FTM because the validator node cannot access your staked tokens; make sure not to lose your mnemonic phrase or private key. However, like in other proof-of-stake blockchains, you risk losing a fraction of your stake if the validator is not reputable and misbehaves. It’s safer to select reputable Fantom validators who always have active communities, websites and Twitter accounts.

How to stake other tokens on Fantom

Fantom provides a flexible and dynamic ecosystem enabling the staking of several DeFi tokens to earn passive income on your investment. To use any of the following systems to stake their native tokens, you need a MetaMask or any other wallet mentioned above connected to the Fantom Opera network. In this case, Fantom staking acts like a CEX, such as Binance, becoming a marketplace where non-native cryptocurrencies are traded.

Here are some of the most popular tokens that are based and can be staked on Fantom:

Spookyswap is the biggest DEX on Fantom, with $777 million TVL and BOO being its native token, which can be bonded with FTM for maximum liquidity and to yield farm. To stake BOO, buy the tokens in an exchange or swap them in Spookyswap; connect your wallet to Fantom Opera to view your positions and start earning.

BeethovenX is a community-driven DEX, an automated market maker (AMM) and a DeFi powerhouse. Governed by BEETS native token and living on the Fantom Opera and Optimism chain, it yields an APR of 31%. To stake Beets, after depositing some FTM, connect your wallet to Fantom Opera and follow the procedure to choose a validator and the locking time.

QiDao is an autonomous and community-governed protocol that sits on Fantom and allows you to borrow stablecoins with zero interest against your crypto assets used as collateral. Loans are paid and repaid in miTokens (stablecoin soft pegged to the USD).

Scream is another decentralized lending protocol powered by Fantom, similar to platforms like Compound (COMP) and Aave (AAVE). Users who stake SCREAM tokens can earn around 58% APR, while for liquidity providers, the rewards can be as high as 82% APR.

How to run a Fantom node

Validators run full nodes and are a crucial part of the Fantom network. By running a full node, validators participate in the consensus to boost security and generate new blocks. There are some technical requirements and skills to be considered to run a Fantom full node, and it might be more suitable for a techie operator.

Following are the requirements necessary to run a Fantom full node:

Minimum requirement: 500,000 FTM

Maximum validator size: 15x the self-stake amount

Minimum hardware requirements: AWS EC2 m5.xlarge with four vCPUs (3.1 GHz) and at least 4.5 TB of Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage (or equivalent).

Rewards: currently ~13% APY (Normal APY on self-stake + 15% of delegators' rewards). APY varies based on staked %. For up-to-date APY, check the Fantom Foundation website.

A step-by-step guide to running a full-node

Users can run a node on their hardware or use a cloud provider. One of the big cloud providers, e.g., Amazon AWS, is recommended. They can set up a non-root user. Install the required building tools; install Go and then Opera. Register their Fantom validator node on-chain. To do this, users need to create a validator wallet that becomes the validator’s identity in the network, required to authenticate, sign messages, etc. Run their own node. To do this, they need to restart their node in validator mode, then close the Opera window by typing “exit.” Then they need to head back to the window where they started their node with the following command:

(validator)$ nohup ./opera --genesis $NETWORK --nousb --validator.id ID --validator.pubkey 0xPubkey --validator.password /path/to/password &

Users can refer to Fantom’s instructions for full specifications and details on how to run a validator node.

How much money can you make staking Fantom?

You can earn 5.01% if you choose the minimum lock-up period (14 days) and the minimum amount. The maximum APY is currently 15.31% for the maximum lock-up period of 365 days.

The FTM staking rewards calculator will estimate how much can be earned by staking Fantom.

FTM and most crypto tokens have dropped by over 90% during the 2022 bear market; therefore, staking will grow the number of your tokens but not necessarily the overall value. It’s also worth considering that staking and locking your tokens up may make your funds illiquid and exiting a position difficult.

But the reality is that some 2.9 billion people still don’t have connectivity to the World Wide Web.

Data provided by UNICEF highlights that the majority of this internet-less mass of people reside in undeveloped countries, and children continue to be disadvantaged by the lack of internet connectivity at local schools.

A UNICEF-led initiative is tackling this dilemma in a novel way through a joint venture with the International Telecommunication Union, whi led to the creation of Giga in 2019.

Gerben Kijne, blockchain product manager at Giga, outlined the firm’s Project Connect initiative at the Blockchain Expo in Amsterdam. Giga has made strides in connecting schools to the internet in developing countries around the world.

Gerben Kijne speaks about Giga's Project Connect and its Patchwork Kingdoms NFT fundraising experiment at the Blockchain Expo in Amsterdam.

The first step in this process was mapping schools and their connectivity through Project Connect. Giga uses machine learning to scan satellite images to identify schools on an open-source map. To date, it has pinpointed over 1.1 million schools across 49 countries and connectivity data for a third of these schools.

Having identified a huge number of schools in need of internet accessibility, the next step in the process was creating a novel fundraising initiative that tapped into the world of blockchain, cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

Speaking to Cointelegraph after his keynote address at the RAI Convention Centre in Amsterdam, Kijne unpacked Giga’s Patchwork Kingdoms initiative. With NFTs surging in popularity over the past couple of years, Giga looked to make the most of the craze through its own NFT-led fundraising experiment in March 2022.

Giga teamed up with Dutch artist Nadieh Bremer to launch a collection of 1000 procedurally generated NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain. The NFTs were produced using Giga’s school data to represent those with and without internet connectivity.

The NFT public sale raised around 240 Ether (ETH) in totality, valued at $700,000, which went directly to connecting schools to the internet. Kijne conceded that the value raised was secondary to the exploration of a different kind of philanthropic fundraising.

“I think NFTs also provide a really interesting use case. One of the things that we're starting to look into is what does philanthropy look like for the next generation of people? Because if you go to UNICEF now and you donate, I don't even know what you get, probably like a ‘thank you email’ or something.”

Kijne believes that NFTs can provide a closer connection to donations, highlighting their use to track the impact of donations through the ownership of a specific school’s NFT and monitor when the funds raised are ""cashed in"" to pay for internet connectivity.

Many learnings were taken out of the NFT-based fundraising initiative. As Kijne reflected, building a community before the launch may well have helped boost support. As has been seen in the NFT space, community members play a role, but opportunistic NFT investors are always present and looking for a chance to profit from new launches.

“I think quite a few people that sort of joined us, they formed one of two camps. We have the people we were aiming for, Giga supporters. Many bought their first NFT ever. Then the other group is people who are thinking, ‘Oh, a UNICEF NFT! Let me get on that.'”

Despite that fact, the project has been deemed a success and provides an intriguing use case for blockchain-based NFTs as a means of transparent, community-building fundraising. The public sale in March 2022 sold out in three hours and raised $550,000. The additional 20% of funds raised came from secondary sales on OpenSea.",blockchain,cointelegraph

Now, a week after the Merge, crypto analysts are warning that miners’ sales of their hoards could become a source of near-term, downward pressure on the cryptocurrency's price, with the market already sinking by 19% in the past month.

“Miners dumping their ETH is an overhang that we’ll have to get through over the coming months in order to resume up-only mode, but it will happen,” Lucas Campbell, editor of the Bankless newsletter, wrote Monday.

On-chain data shows Ethereum miners dumped over 16,000 ETH from Sept. 12 to Sept. 19. (OKLink)

Blockchain data assembled by OKLink appears to show miners starting to sell down their stashes over the past week.

Ethereum miners dumped over 16,000 ETH from Sept. 12 to Sept. 19. (The Merge took effect on Sept. 15.) The decline reduced the miners’ combined balance to about 245,000 ETH, or about $319 million worth.

Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, attributed the decline in the balances to “miners moving onto other chains.”

They’re “taking profits from their ETH holdings,” he said.

It’s also possible that some miners may have sent some ether to exchanges to handle an “airdrop” of new tokens from a splinter blockchain that aimed to continue on with the Ethereum blockchain’s now-abandoned “proof-of-work” system, Outumuro said. That effort has since mostly fizzled.

Ether’s price had soared in the weeks before the Merge, as some traders also jockeyed for the airdrop, while others speculated that the shift might lead to a surge in institutional investment. But when the Merge actually took place, the cryptocurrency's price suddenly plunged – in what analysts termed a “buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact” market reaction.

The sell-off also coincided with the runup to this week’s Federal Reserve’s meeting, which included a pledge to aggressive monetary policy that has put downward pressure on risky asset prices, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.

“If miners had accumulated Ethereum at a profit, or they need to pay their electric bill, they would be incentivized to sell at a profit, especially with the expected and actual increased volatility,” said Alexandre Lores, director of blockchain market research at Quantum Economics.

”For the first time, these miners have no future business relationship with Ethereum,” Lores said

It's possible that miners' move may have contributed to the immediate weakness in prices post-Merge, according to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of digital-asset management firm Arca. The ether price was trading around $1,300 Thursday.

It’s not a sure thing that all miners will liquidate their holdings, Dorman said.

“Maybe some [miners] will turn into speculators and hold on for better price,” Dorman said. “Maybe some will turn into stakers and secure the new network, but that [mining] business is over."" The new network relies on ""stakers"" – investors who help to secure the blockchain by ""staking"" their ether – instead of the energy-intensive ""proof-of-work"" mining that Ethereum previously used.

To be sure, the miners’ remaining holdings represent a fraction of the total ETH supply of 119 million, based on CoinDesk data.

Ex-Ethereum miners who choose to continue proof-of-work mining can shift to a different chain. Related altcoins’ prices have seen a significant increase, with Ravencoin (RVN) up 64% and Ethereum Classic's ETC token gaining 75% in the past 90 days.

Chainalysis Economist Ethan McMahon said he sees the miner selling as “a temporary shift” in moving away from Ethereum, “if miners’ initial reason for holding Ethereum was for the store-of-value or investment purposes.”",blockchain,yahoo entertainment

In congressional testimony on Wednesday, Dimon referred to himself as “a major skeptic” on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

“They are decentralized Ponzi schemes, and the notion that’s good for anybody is unbelievable,” he told lawmakers, calling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “dangerous.”

Bitcoin, which was hovering just above $19,000 at 6:45 a.m. ET on Thursday, has lost more than half its value in 2022, as cryptocurrencies across the board have suffered a widespread selloff that’s become known as the “crypto winter.”

House meeting

The U.S. House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing on Wednesday in which representatives from major American banks including Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo gave evidence. The committee’s chairwoman, Maxine Waters, and ranking member Patrick McHenry are currently developing a bill on regulating stablecoins—a digital asset class that’s tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.

Under the most recent draft of the bill, seen by Bloomberg, it would be illegal to issue or create new “endogenously collateralized stablecoins” like TerraUSD, which collapsed earlier this year in one of the largest ever crypto bankruptcies ever.

Dimon said in his testimony to the House on Wednesday that billions of dollars had been lost every year to cryptocurrencies, noting their links to money laundering, ransomware, sex trafficking, and theft.

However, he argued that stablecoins would not be so problematic if they were properly regulated.

Bitcoin 'worthless'

The JPMorgan chief has long been a vocal critic of Bitcoin and other decentralized digital assets—and refuses to refer to them as currencies.

In October last year, as Bitcoin’s value was approaching an all-time high, Dimon said the cryptocurrency was “worthless.”

Story continues

Back in 2017, he referred to Bitcoin as a “fraud”—an assertion he later said he regretted. Last year, however, he doubled down on his aversion to the asset, saying he was “not a Bitcoin supporter” and had “no interest in it.”

JPMorgan itself hasn’t been quite so critical of Bitcoin, with the bank saying as recently as May that it saw “significant upside” for crypto investors. However, the lender’s payments boss said this week that while cryptocurrency had a “niche use case,” demand for the tokens as a payment method had drastically declined over the past six months.

The firm, and Dimon himself, have also been backers of Blockchain technology, which is the foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

In 2019, JPMorgan became the first American bank to create and successfully test a digital coin representing a fiat currency—in this case, the U.S. dollar. The JPM Coin, enabled by Blockchain, is used by the bank to carry out intraday repurchase agreements.

Dimon was asked what keeps him from being more active in the crypto space during an oversight hearing held by the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.

Dimon emphasized that he sees value in blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi), ledgers, smart contracts and “tokens that do something,” but then proceeded to lambast crypto tokens that identify as currencies.

Asked for his thoughts about the draft U.S. stablecoin bill, Dimon said he believes that there is nothing wrong with stablecoins that are properly regulated and that the regulation should be similar to what money market funds are subject to.

Dimon has once described Bitcoin (BTC) as a “fraud” and has reiterated in the past that he has no interest in backing the sector on a personal level. He has softened his stance on crypto on occasion, once highlighting that it can serve important use cases at times such as cross-border payments.

Despite Dimon’s views on the cryptocurrency space, JPMorgan has been pushing into the blockchain technology space. The financial giant launched its own in-house stablecoin — JPM Coin in October 2020 — the first cryptocurrency backed by a U.S bank, which was aimed at increasing settlement efficiency.

A week after rolling out the coin, the bank launched a new business division dedicated to blockchain technology called Onyx. Since then, the Onyx platform has been utilized by large institutional customers for round-the-clock global payments.

JPMorgan also became the first major bank in the Metaverse following the opening of its virtual lounge in the blockchain-based world Decentraland in February. The move followed a report that was released by the firm, which referred to the Metaverse as a $1 trillion opportunity.

JPMorgan has been hiring new staff to push into the blockchain and crypto space, most recently announcing on Sept. 9 that it has hired former Microsoft executive Tahreem Kamptom to be its senior payments executive. Kamptom is expected to help JPMorgan explore blockchain tech given his Linkedin bio shows he has worked on crypto-related payment methods.

During the hearing, the lawmakers also asked other top U.S bank CEOs whether they had plans to finance crypto mining.

According to a Wednesday Chainalysis post titled “Crypto Adoption Steadies in South Asia, Soars in the Southeast,” NFT-related actions accounted for 58% of all web traffic going to cryptocurrency services from this region in the second quarter of 2022.

Meanwhile another 21% of traffic in the quarter went to websites of play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain games, with major titles including Axie Infinity, STEPN and Battle Infinity.

Chainalysis noted that P2E blockchain games are “intimately related” to NFTs, as most P2E games feature in-game items in the form of NFTs that can be sold on marketplaces like MagicEden and OpenSea, thus meaning:

“NFTs are perhaps the biggest on-ramp to cryptocurrency in CSAO today.”

CSAO countries include India, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, Singapore, Philippines and Indonesia, among 25 others, and are home to seven of the top 20 countries in Chainalysis’ crypto adoption index.

According to a web traffic heatmap, NFT-related websites accounted for the majority of web traffic in almost every country in the CSAO region, though blockchain games and entertainment also saw a significant share of traffic.

Chainalysis noted this is “not necessarily surprising: CSAO is a hub for innovation in blockchain-based entertainment,” adding:

“Game-centric blockchain developers Polygon and Immutable X are headquartered in India and Australia, for example, and Axie Infinity and STEPN, the two largest play-to-earn games, are operated in Vietnam and Australia, respectively.”

Vietnam topped the Chainalysis cryptocurrency adoption index for the second year in a row, but the Philippines made a surprise appearance at second after ranking 15th in the last report.

“Both of these countries have similar growth drivers: play-to-earn (P2E) games and remittances,” explained the blockchain analysis firm.

On the other hand, traffic to websites related to other subjects, such as decentralized exchange contracts, has declined in recent quarters, according to Chainalysis — which it said is likely connected to the bear market and ongoing crypto winter.

The report also touched on crypto adoption in India and Pakistan, noting that while both ranked as second and third highest adopters of cryptocurrency worldwide in 2021, the two countries have fallen this year to fourth and sixth, respectively.

Recent regulatory developments are listed as possible reasons for the change.

In January, Pakistan’s central bank and government recommended a crypto ban, while the Indian government implemented a 30% tax on all crypto gains in April and an additional 1% fee on every crypto transaction in July.",blockchain,cointelegraph

I(t is expected to finalize in five days, on Sept. 27.)

The significance of Vasil’s rather technical set of changes, which improve the ledger’s programmability and its throughput potential, perhaps requires some zooming out to view a bigger picture.

Read more: What Cardano’s Highly Anticipated Vasil Hard Fork Will Bring

Cardano, sometimes touted as an “Ethereum killer,” is playing a long game. Critics of this process (split into “eras” named after Romantic poets, computer scientists and Enlightenment thinkers) often criticize the protocol for lagging behind other smart contract blockchains that already host thriving decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems and have amassed billions of dollars in total value locked.

But the early achievements of the foremost smart contract platform, Ethereum, are “brilliant but unstructured,” according to Aggelos Kiayias, chief scientist at Cardano builder Input Output Global (IOG). Smart contracts on Cardano are “different,” says Kiayias, who is also a professor in cryptography at the University of Edinburgh.

Smart contracts on Cardano

This is because Cardano is grounded in functional programming, a precise and mathematical way to write code that uses immutable data to tell the program exactly what to do, as opposed to achieving results through objects that alter a program’s state.

“I think many people had difficulties when smart contracts were launched in Cardano because they were hoping there would be a simple way to immediately port complex contracts from Ethereum to Cardano,” Kiayias said in an interview with CoinDesk. “But it requires a familiarity with functional programming and having to rethink, what would be the best way to program things in this new environment?”

Story continues

For Kiayias, not only is functional programming a simple and natural approach to take, but when it comes to critical infrastructure it makes perfect sense. That’s because the intent of a computer program then becomes very clear and easy to verify. This simplicity also invites the possible automation of that verification. And while some investment of time is required, Kiayias said the intricacies of Cardano’s functional-based Plutus script can be simplified using domain-specific languages such as Marlowe.

Cardano is not the only blockchain to prize formal verification of smart contracts; the Tezos blockchain was also designed with this in mind. These days, however, such concerns may have fallen out of fashion amid the breathless rush of DeFi.

Bitcoin in the blood

Another fundamental difference between Cardano and most other layer one smart contract chains is its choice to use a design borrowed from Bitcoin.

Unlike Ethereum, which uses an account-based model rather like a bank’s, Cardano is based on the “unspent transaction output” (UTXO) system, a way of calculating what’s held in bitcoin wallets by keeping tabs on the change left over when fractions of coins are spent. But Cardano extends this practice so it’s not constrained by the Bitcoin blockchain’s data limits, an approach known as “extended unspent transaction outputs” (EUTXO).

This design was a natural fit for a deterministic functional approach and comes with important advantages, explained Kiayias.

“Either a transaction fits the current extended UTXO set and spends some UTXOs and introduces others, or it doesn’t fit,” he said. “So I have this deterministic assurance with how my transaction is going to interact with the blockchain state and not be modified by any other transactions.”

This is not the case for an account-based model like Ethereum, Kiayias pointed out. “In this case, I cannot fully predict how my transaction is going to interact with the blockchain state because other transactions can be ‘sandwiched’ before my transaction, modifying it, and then my transaction is basically engaging with a state that did not exist when I issued it. This actually makes a huge difference for smart contracts.”

Security at scale

Tying this back to the changes being implemented by Vasil, Cardano’s UTXO model will be more easily referred to, keeping more load off the chain, which is better for scaling and is also preferable from a security perspective.

“The Vasil upgrade will make it feasible to refer to UTXOs, and there’s substantial space savings because of that,” Kiayias said. “So while in theory it’s a small bookkeeping consideration, it’s a huge advantage in practice.”

Kiayias said it’s nothing new in the world of technology to see people rushing forward, which has arguably turned DeFi into a kind of hacker’s playground.

“If I want to improve usability or speed, I can always do better than you by sacrificing security,” Kiayias said, defending Cardano’s methodical approach and painstaking process of academic peer review.

“But I think we always need a scientific way of assessing the security of systems,” he added.

Cardano's native cryptocurrency, ADA, is up around 4% over the past 24 hours, trading at 46 cents at time of publication.

The platform currently offers 2.5 million tickets, which are tokenized when purchased and converted into NFTs called NFTickets, TravelX Chief Blockchain Officer Facundo Martin Diaz told CoinDesk.

After acquiring an NFTicket, a customer can auction, sell, transfer, gift or exchange them through a peer-to-peer system on TravelX, Diaz said.

To purchase tickets on the platform, users can fund the TravelX wallet — which also serves to manage the NFTickets — or pay via BinancePay. Diaz added that the company is in talks to integrate other exchanges.

TravelX is built on the Algorand blockchain and made its infrastructure open so that other companies — such as exchanges or marketplaces — can use TravelX's APIs to create their own marketplaces.

Within six to 12 months, the platform hopes to incorporate the inventory of more than 60 airlines, with a special focus on Latin American and European operators. In 2023, Diaz said the company will focus more on the U.S. and Middle East.

In November, the company closed a $11 million seed round led by Borderless Capital, said Diaz, who added that it plans to raise a Series A funding round early 2023. The company has 85 employees.

TravelX was founded by Diaz and Juan Pablo Lafosse, who previously founded Almundo.com, a tourism marketplace sold to CVC Corporation for $75 million in 2019.

As of now, the platform allows transactions using the USDC stablecoin and has no plans to incorporate other stablecoins, although it could eventually integrate coins developed by airlines, Diaz added.

TravelX charges no fee when a user purchases a ticket on the platform, but it does receive 2% when a transaction is made on the platform's peer-to-peer secondary market, while airlines keep another 2%, Diaz said.",blockchain,yahoo entertainment

Your baby girl is fiddling with her laptop, and she’s yelling, “Wow!” and “Oh!” You wonder what’s going on. Is it a cartoon? Is it anime? Why’s she so excited?

As I, a twenty year old, write this in Singapore, about 15,000 active Bitcoin nodes are estimated to be running all over the world. These nodes store the Bitcoin database in part/in its entirety.

With 15,000 computers storing the same database all over the world, repeatedly transmitting new transactions and new blocks to one another, it’s practically impossible for any one player to pop by and change the record of what happened.

But when talking about Bitcoin’s future as a decentralized currency, Elon Musk said this:

“The reality is, the average person is not going to run a bitcoin node.” — Elon Musk, B World Conference 2021

I agree with Elon. But let me clarify.

Elon was referring to a validating node, which is quite simple to set up.

Mining nodes and validation nodes serve different functions. (TLDR: mining nodes consume electricity to create “blocks” of data, validating nodes check whether the info in those blocks is accurate. Nowadays, mining nodes are called miners, whereas validating nodes are simply called nodes.) Both contribute to decentralization.

Setting up a validation node will not burn your house down due to high electricity usage.

It’s actually easy and requires zero technical expertise.

In fact, it costs just ~10 cents per day from electricity.

At the moment, you need less than 7GB of storage space to set up a pruned validation node (in which you hold only part of the Bitcoin transaction database, but still contribute to decentralization).

Unfortunately, the average person is not aware of the above.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin remains the most decentralized cryptocurrency on the planet. 15,000 nodes in the context of a cryptocurrency is great, and proof of Bitcoin’s decentralization was demonstrated during the blocksize wars.

But let’s frame the context differently. Over 5,000,000,000 people have access to the internet today. Suddenly, 15,000 nodes look tiny. A lot more than 15,000 folks probably have computers with 7GB to spare. Many may even have an old laptop sitting in the garage!

For Bitcoin to gain wider and faster adoption moving forward, its decentralization must be continually emphasized. One way to do this is by encouraging regular folks to run Bitcoin validating nodes.

We aren’t talking enough about this today.

Achieving This Via Node UI And UX Improvements

Even in exchanges and payment apps, UI and UX are arguably being sidelined. When it comes to nodes, the UI and UX discussion is practically non-existent.

Remember: the biggest company in the world today got to where it is by relentlessly focusing on UI and UX. That company’s market cap is currently about six times bigger than Bitcoin’s.

Image from Apple, 1998; Sourced from CNET



Bitcoin might not be a company, but the same principle applies. It boils down to making things more intuitive.

When it comes to setting up a validating node, make things simpler. And simpler. And simpler. Installing Bitcoin Core should feel like installing a chrome extension. Or an app from Google Play. And suddenly, we’ll have people realizing: “Hey, this node thingy is actually super simple!”

Let me clarify: setting up a validating node is already simple. But simplicity and perceived simplicity are different things. Today, perceived simplicity requires effortlessness.

Next, let’s talk about how running a validating node should feel.

Take block explorer websites.

Technically, any of this info can be found on any full validating node. It’s just less intuitive and requires some technical knowledge. The average Joe won’t acquire that knowledge.

So, improve the UI and UX. Superimpose the block explorer websites’ interface on top of the node program. Take it a step further. Let users see how many nodes they’re transmitting data to, how many blocks they’ve helped validate thus far, any temporary chain splits. Simpler. More interactive. And yet effortless. I’m sure there’ll be plenty of ideas on creating a fun UI and UX based on the blockchain.

And UI and UX aren’t just important for increased decentralization. They can change the very manner in which people get into Bitcoin.

For illustration’s sake, here’s what I imagine the typical pathway of someone who gets into Bitcoin:

Hears about cryptocurrencies as a way to make fiat → gets into altcoins → gets into Bitcoin → interested in Bitcoin → goes down the rabbit hole → believes in Bitcoin → sets up a validating node.

This pathway is just one of many. But here’s my point: most of the time, setting up a node happens quite late.

Here’s what an improved and intuitive node UI and UX could change that pathway into:

Hears about cryptocurrencies as a way to make fiat → decides to install a Bitcoin validating node to get a taste of crypto’s value proposition → learns via interacting with the blockchain → maybe even has fun → interested in Bitcoin → believes in Bitcoin → tells more folks to install a validating node → spreads word; process loops.

A validating node is an open invitation from Bitcoin to new folks, that necessitates zero risk-taking. UI and UX improvements will market it as such. They’ll propagate learning via interacting with the Bitcoin network. Education will come straight from the blockchain. Videos and articles, after all, can only do so much!

Here are a couple more UI and UX benefits:

It attracts non-technical folks to Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin is the most decentralized cryptocurrency on the planet. But the folks running validating nodes are still a limited set largely drawn from tech and finance communities. Let’s bring over folks from other communities, too. An immediate thought is NFT designers transitioning to working on Bitcoin’s UI and UX.

They reduce the inherent risks from centralized block explorer websites.

This would publicize Bitcoin, the payments system. You can argue over Bitcoin the currency, but Bitcoin the payments system is incredibly hard to refute, even through the lens of mainstream economics.

At this juncture, it’s worth mentioning that increased decentralization could potentially bring about certain disadvantages, too. Typical democracy problems. Decentralization among technocrats has its pros, too. But that’s another discussion.

The bottom line is: we need to be talking more about this! Much of the world still deeply misunderstands Bitcoin. The fact that the “Bitcoin is bad for the climate” argument has gotten so much traction is painful evidence. And even we Bitcoiners, all at very different depths of the rabbit hole, can benefit from easier interactions with the blockchain.

So talk about this in your Telegrams, Discords and of course, on Twitter. Is it feasible? Does it make sense? Is it a waste of time? Is it being actively worked on?

Let’s return to the story from the start of this piece:

Your baby girl is fiddling with her laptop, and she yells “Wow!” and “Oh!” You walk over and see a new block being added to a chain of blocks preceding it, in real-time. You see one chain becoming two, until the chain on top becomes longer and longer and the chain below vanishes into flames. Your girl claps.

Now that, folks, is a vision worth chasing.

The funding round was led by the San Francisco-based venture firm Framework Ventures, with additional participation from Electric Capital, Polygon Ventures, Samsung Next, P2P Capital and others. Immunefi said the capital would be used to hire staff as it scales to meet the growing demand for blockchain security and bug bounty services.

Immunefi claims to have paid out $60 million in total bounties since its inception less than two years ago. The platform now supports over 300 projects across the crypto ecosystem, including Chainlink (LINK), MakerDAO and Compound (COMP). To incentivize white hat hackers, Immunefi offers bounties and rewards for uncovering the security vulnerabilities of leading blockchain protocols.

In demand!



The rise of crypto hacks over 2022 has skyrocketed demand for blockchain security experts, with some auditors making upwards of $430,000 per year. https://t.co/rafgW5TNBP — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) August 23, 2022

As reported by Cointelegraph, Immunefi raised $5.5 million in funding last October to further boost its security capabilities. At the time, the company had paid out $7.5 million in bounties.

For the most part, this transition from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism to the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake has been celebrated for its increased sustainability.

But while the story of the day is about energy conservation, the Merge skirts a looming problem for Ethereum. Network updates after the Merge are intended to finally begin improving Ethereum’s scalability – but these proposals threaten the viability and sustainability of a healthy Web3 ecosystem.

“Atomic composability,” which made decentralized finance (DeFi) on Ethereum possible to begin with, becomes compromised. And when you break atomic composability, you hinder the very thing that makes an ecosystem truly sustainable long-term.

See also: Evaluating Ethereum: 1 Week After the Merge

What is atomic composability and why does it matter?

Atomic composability is a technical term for saying that any application on a network can frictionlessly interact with any other application. Ethereum is going to consciously break composability by segregating parts of its network from each other in the implementation of sharding or layer 2 systems.

To make this concept more concrete, let’s consider the health of a rainforest or a desert.

Without pollinators, one-third of all our edible fruits and vegetables could not grow, according to experts.

You’ve most likely heard about the declining bee population, but the story repeats itself over and over and over again all over the world. The destruction of agave plants for tequila production jeopardizes the survival of the bats that pollinate the most important cactus in the desert, putting the entire ecosystem at risk. Whaling ultimately leads to the destruction of fish stocks.

Story continues

The fact is that biodiversity is essential for the survival and growth of natural ecosystems, and when this cycle is threatened the consequences are far-reaching and devastating.

As far back as 2009, the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity organization put out a report highlighting just how much economic value for humans is directly connected to ecosystem biodiversity, including up to 50% of the pharmaceutical industry and 100% of the agricultural industry, among many others.

So if biodiversity is so important and valuable for physical ecosystems, why wouldn’t application diversity be essential for the survival and growth of digital ecosystems?

The answer: It is.

The more application diversity within an ecosystem, the more its apps are able to “cross-pollinate” with each other, leading to a more robust, resilient ecosystem that can fuel all kinds of growth. This can also lead to new species of applications and new wealth creation for the humans who rely on them.

Protecting the 4 superpowers is the key to Web3 eco-diversity

Web3 has four superpowers: tokenization, decentralized applications, two-sided markets without intermediaries and composability.

Taking away one of these superpowers by walling off certain applications from each other through specific types of blockchain sharding or layer 2 implementations (as nearly every smart contract platform does) is like separating the bat from the plant it pollinates.

We’re witnessing the impact on our world as we destroy natural diversity, separating flora and fauna from the ecosystems in which they have thrived and are interdependent.

Now, at the dawn of Web3, as we look to birth the most dynamic, flourishing digital ecosystem for the future of global finance, we can’t afford to make that same mistake.

Decentralized networks that preserve all four superpowers, including atomic composability, will give emergent digital ecosystems the most room to flourish.",blockchain,yahoo entertainment

The agreement aims to facilitate the growth of the differentiated or Responsibly Sourced Gas (RSG) market by increasing stakeholders’ confidence around tracking, transferring, and retiring environmental attributes.

Key highlights of the collaboration include:

Project Canary and EarnDLT will collaborate to transform Project Canary Verified Climate Attributes into EarnDLT’s Quantified Emissions Tokens™ and store them on EarnDLT’s enterprise-grade, blockchain-based Emissions Accounting System.

Project Canary’s rigorous and trusted attribute verification approach, which utilizes independent measurement and assessments, will be combined with the numerous benefits of EarnDLT’s blockchain solution, including data immutability and integrity, efficient ownership transfer, and retirement of emissions attributes.

Both companies will collaborate to improve the interoperability of the Project Canary Verified Climate Attributes with other electronic registries to create a complete universe of non-fungible tokens.

Increasingly sellers and buyers of RSG are demanding to understand the precise environmental footprint of the gas they produce, transport, and buy. By separating the physical gas molecules from their verifiable environmental attributes and registering those attributes on the blockchain, the buying and selling of differentiated gas becomes backed by more reliable data, the chain of ownership is wholly accurate, and attribute transfer and retirement are far more efficient. As the broader market for environmental attributes expands beyond verified low methane intensity gas, these expectations will extend to other attributes like water usage and land, safety and community attributes.

“Our Quantified Emissions Token and Emissions Accounting System bring needed transparency and accountability to the quickly rising environmental attributes market,” said Aaron Lohmann, Earn DLT Chief Executive Officer. “A blockchain-based platform provides accountability and prevents double counting of attributes, increasing the transactability of responsibly sourced gas and Project Canary’s other verifiable environmental attributes.”

The companies will work together to make it easier for mutual customers to join the registry. As the market expands, the companies will work with customers to seamlessly onboard more environmental attributes onto EarnDLT’s platform while ensuring these tokens are transferable among different registry platforms to support seller and buyer choice and grow the overall market.

“Buyers want differentiated commodities, and the only way to support the buy-side is to achieve verifiable attributes on the sell-side using reliably accurate independent third-party data. Blockchain registries bring radical transparency to the markets, adding another layer of trust and accountability for Project Canary’s emissions data and insights,” said Chris Romer, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Project Canary. “EarnDLT’s registry is one of the missing puzzle pieces in creating a transactable, trusted climate attribute trading market. Just as we offer a portfolio of emission sensing technology choices for customers, they also have multiple registry choices, which is good for the differentiated gas market.”

About EarnDLT:

EarnDLT (“distributed ledger technology”) is an enterprise-grade blockchain platform that radically improves transaction efficiency and integrity for a variety of industrial and commercial sectors. Earn’s Quantified Emissions Token™ and Emissions Accounting System make the buying and selling of environmental attributes significantly easier and more trustworthy. The company’s credit and lending solution dramatically scales the settlement process for over-the-counter financial instruments. By redesigning today’s manual and analog processes using the power of blockchain technology, Earn is committed to unlocking new forms of value for businesses and our planet.

“I'm a major skeptic on crypto tokens, which you call currency like Bitcoin. They are decentralized Ponzi schemes,” he said, pointing to the billions of dollars lost each year through crypto-related hacks and how cryptocurrencies are used in crimes such as ransomware payments, money laundering, and sex-trafficking.

“And the notion that it is good for anybody is unbelievable,” Dimon added.

However, Dimon said he is not a skeptic of blockchain technology itself or other innovations such as Decentralized finance (DeFi) and “tokens that do something” such as those used to transact money or other information when asked what were the biggest obstacles preventing JPMorgan from being more active in the crypto space.

Speaking to the incoming legislation for regulating stablecoins or crypto assets that are intended to not fluctuate by holding their value to another asset such as the U.S. dollar, Dimon said: “There’d be nothing wrong with a stablecoin, which is like a money market fund, properly regulated.”

Most days stablecoins make up 75% to 95% of total trading volume in the crypto markets. Traders use the assets to protect their crypto gains during periods of heightened volatility. According to DeFi Llama, stablecoins alone are a $152 billion market, with the largest by circulating supply, Tether (USDT), holding a 44.5% share of the market followed by Circle's USDC, which accounts for 32.4%.

Though its use isn’t known outside of the banks own interbank transfers, JPMorgan has its own stablecoin-like asset, Dimon pointed out.

Launched in 2019, JPM Coin is used for cross-border payments, liquidity funding, and corporate treasury services between the bank and its clients in a closed system.

“JPMorgan, we are a big user of blockchain,” Dimon said.

During a demo of Chainalysis’ recently launched blockchain analysis platform Storyline, Cointelegraph asked Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum and country manager for Australia and New Zealand Todd Lenfield about the impact of the Tornado Cash ban.

Illum said whilst there is still some usage of the mixer, more time was needed to “see what’s happening” and how the ”world responds to that designation,” adding that people are trying to figure out what to do now the crypto mixer is effectively gone:

“People are getting more cautious in the space and are not sure how to interact with Tornado Cash, we’ve seen deposits into services providing similar activity go down at least temporarily, because people are measuring like ‘what does this mean for me?’”

But, where others see obstacles, some are clearly seeing an opportunity, Illum noted a crop of what he calls “junior mixers” have popped up looking to cash in on the void that Tornado Cash left.

An August report by blockchain security firm SlowMist stated that 74.6% of stolen funds on the Ethereum network were transferred to Tornado Cash in the first half of 2022, a sum of over 300,000 Ether (ETH), around $380 million.

Data from Chainalysis showed the 30-day moving average of the total daily value received by crypto mixers reached a new all-time high of $51.8 million in April.

“If the liquidity isn’t there, you effectively dry up a lot of [a mixers] capability,” Lenfield added:

“The hunting for places where there is liquidity, when it’s highly visible after things like the OFAC sanctioning of Tornado Cash, I think makes a very interesting space to keep an eye on.”

Tornado cash was sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department on Aug. 8, meaning criminal or civil penalties could be brought against U.S. citizens or entities who interact with the mixer. Over 40 cryptocurrency addresses purportedly connected to Tornado Cash were added to the Specially Designated Nationals list of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).

Related: Tornado Cash is the latest chapter in the war against encryption

Asked about the level of sophistication that law enforcement agencies had in dealing with crypto-related crime, Illum mentioned one of the biggest gaps in law enforcement at the moment is blockchain-related training:

“As [blockchain] gains adoption, there’s more people that are getting exposure to crypto, which also means that there are more agents or law enforcement personnel that need to have exposure to crypto as well.”

Lenfield noted that authorities are starting to build capabilities around cryptocurrencies, citing the Australian Federal Police’s (AFP) recent establishment of a cryptocurrency unit focused on monitoring crypto transactions:

“It is active in their minds, they are setting goals, and they’re working through that. But, as in any aspect, there’s that learning curve to get them there, but there is 100% visibility and development in this space by those agencies.”

Earlier in September, Chainalysis Crypto Incident Response team helped law enforcement recover $30 million in crypto stolen in the Ronin Bridge hack by the North Korean linked Lazarus Group who used Tornado Cash to launder stolen assets.",blockchain,cointelegraph

276,3 Ways Traditional Investors Can Gain Crypto Exposure,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5AjXCfWbhRrt5vMjyCGehQ--~B/aD02MDA7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/167c3e9f9fa5a1f0860929d45351715c,22/09/2022,Direct investment into cryptocurrency is just one way clients of financial advisors can participate in the new asset class.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-ways-traditional-investors-gain-125000802.html,"A growing number of people are interested in crypto investment, which means financial advisors need to understand the various ways to invest into cryptocurrency and crypto related strategies.

While the asset class is still new, especially when compared to the rest of traditional finance, there are a few different ways to invest into crypto and crypto companies.

Some of these investment strategies involve direct investment in cryptocurrency and require advisors and clients to undertake a series of new steps.

Other strategies are available at traditional financial custodians and are more similar to ordinary investments.

1. Cryptocurrencies and tokens

Clients may express a desire to own cryptocurrency directly.

Building a portfolio of cryptocurrencies and tokens is relatively straightforward but must be done through a cryptocurrency platform or exchange. Companies such as Coinbase, Gemini and FTX are crypto exchange platforms that anyone is able to use to purchase and trade crypto assets.

Much like creating a self-directed investment portfolio on a traditional custodian, any investor can open their own account on a crypto platform and begin investing in whatever crypto asset they wish. From there, investors may choose to move their currency off the crypto exchange into self-custody with a hardware wallet. However, they are still owners of the cryptocurrency or token if they hold it on the exchange and they may decide to do so.

After creating an account on an exchange and purchasing any number of cryptocurrencies available there, advisors will need to set up a process that allows them to routinely view the accounts their clients have on these crypto platforms. This will allow them to help the client best navigate financial decisions.

Some clients may prefer this method of direct investment into cryptocurrencies but want their advisor to do it for them. The advisor may hire an SMA manager to accomplish this. SMA crypto strategies are still a growing part of the market although some firms have built these strategies and are offering it to other RIAs/Advisors.

2. Hedge funds

Cryptocurrency hedge funds are growing in popularity and there are quite a few of them available.

These hedge funds allow affluent investors to allocate to crypto in an outsourced method. These clients allow the hedge fund to be the asset manager rather than buying cryptocurrencies directly and managing a crypto portfolio themselves.

Crypto hedge funds may invest in a specific part of the crypto industry, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, crypto mining and crypto trading firms.

However, hedge funds are for accredited investors and carry a high amount of risk for investors. Hedge funds also typically have less liquidity than other strategies and usually have higher fees, which both are things advisors must ensure their clients understand before making an allocation.

3. Publicly traded vehicles

Clients who wish to invest in the crypto asset class but do not wish to buy cryptocurrencies directly or use a new custodian or fund can consider publicly traded vehicles.

There are a few different publicly traded vehicles that advisors may consider in order to accomplish this goal.

Bitcoin futures ETFs: There are a few different bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange-traded funds available on the market. These allow investors to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin, without owning bitcoin directly. An advisor may decide that this is appropriate because the client wants price exposure but does not want to open an account on a crypto exchange. However, there are certain things that the advisor must be aware of – and disclose to their client – when using a futures-based product, including expense ratios, contango and backwardation, among others.

Bitcoin trusts: The most popular crypto trust is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has over $12B assets under management and is a convenient way for advisors and investors to gain access to bitcoin through a traditional custodian. Shareholders of GBTC own equity in a trust and that trust owns bitcoin, but shareholders of GBTC do not own bitcoin directly. There are fees to own the various products offered by Grayscale and advisors must understand what these fees are. It’s important to note that GBTC currently trades at a -33% discount to net asset value. Grayscale has filed with the SEC to convert GBTC to an ETF, yet the conversion has been denied multiple times. There is currently no spot Bitcoin ETF available in the U.S. public markets. [Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.]

Crypto and blockchain companies: There are quite a few publicly traded companies that specialize in cryptocurrency or blockchain related services. A) Square, PayPal and Coinbase are all publicly traded companies that are integrated with the crypto industry. B) Several crypto mining companies are also available for trading on traditional exchanges. Investors can buy shares of publicly traded crypto mining companies such as Riot or Marathon Digital. C) Technology companies such as MicroStrategy also fall into the broad crypto category. MicroStrategy is a software company that also owns a tremendous amount of bitcoin. Because of its bitcoin ownership, its stock price is closely correlated with the price movement of BTC.

Crypto and blockchain company funds: Investors may wish to buy a diversified basket of these crypto-related companies instead of owning individual equities. There are quite a few exchange traded funds available that focus on crypto-related companies. The largest ETF (by AUM) is the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (symbol: BLOX), which has over $600,000,000 in assets. These ETFs are considered “thematic” strategies. They are designed to invest into a specific theme – in this case blockchain and cryptocurrency. Advisors may use these funds as a part of their strategy for clients.

Weigh the pros and cons

While the crypto asset class is still developing, there are quite a few strategies currently available to investors.

Advisors must understand the pros and cons of each method, the potential benefits and risks associated with the different strategies, and must be able to communicate them to their clients.

Advisors must understand how cryptocurrency exposure could help their clients and then help their client decide on the best method to invest in the asset class.",blockchain,yahoo entertainment

The platform has saved over $25 billion in users’ funds and has paid out $60 million in total bounties in under 2 years

Singapore, Singapore, Sept. 22, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immunefi, the leading bug bounty and security services platform for web3, protecting over $60 billion in users’ funds, has announced it has raised a $24 million Series A funding round led by Framework Ventures, a venture capital firm known for its early entry into decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain gaming (GameFi). Other participants in the round include Electric Capital, Polygon Ventures, Samsung Next, P2P Capital, North Island Ventures, Third Prime Ventures, Lattice Capital, and Stratos DeFi.

Immunefi is the largest and most widely adopted bug bounty platform in web3. Trusted by established, multi-billion dollar projects like Chainlink, Wormhole, MakerDAO, Compound, Synthetix, and more, Immunefi boasts a massive community of whitehat hackers who review projects’ blockchain and smart contract code, find and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities, and get paid for making crypto safer. With Immunefi, whitehat hackers are rewarded based on the severity of the vulnerability that they discover, creating incentives for as many experts as possible to examine the code of particular projects for vulnerabilities.

“Open code and directly monetizable exploits have made web3 the most adversarial software development space in the world”, says Mitchell Amador, Founder and CEO of Immunefi. “By shifting incentives towards whitehats, Immunefi has already saved billions of dollars of users’ funds. Projects across crypto are rapidly realizing that it's better to use Immunefi than end up publicly begging hackers to return funds or pay ransom. We’re using this raise to scale our team to meet this massive demand”.

Since its inception in December 2020, Immunefi has saved over $25 billion in users’ funds and has paid out $60 million in total bounties. The platform now supports 300 projects across multiple crypto sectors, and collectively offers $135 million in bounties to whitehat hackers. Immunefi has also facilitated the largest bug bounty payments in the history of software, including $10 million for a vulnerability discovered in Wormhole, a generic cross-chain messaging protocol, and $6 million for a vulnerability discovered in Aurora, a bridge and a scaling solution for Ethereum. For comparison, the largest conventional bug bounty offered is by Apple for $2 million.

Story continues

“Our participation in Immunefi’s Series A represents the single largest check our firm has ever publicly written”, says Roy Learner, Principal at Framework Ventures. “As it stands, Immunefi is by far and away the most widely adopted solution in the crypto security and bug bounties space. We’re excited to see the company scale and amass talent as more and more key projects onboard into their ecosystem”.

About Immunefi

Immunefi is the leading bug bounty and security services platform for web3, which features the world’s largest bounties. Immunefi guards over $60 billion in users’ funds across projects like Synthetix, Chainlink, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Bancor, MakerDAO, Compound, Alchemix, Nexus Mutual, and others. The company has paid out the most significant bug bounties in the software industry, amounting to over $60 million, and has pioneered the scaling web3 bug bounties standard.

The round was led by Bain Capital Crypto, with participation from investors including Jump Crypto, Galaxy, Robot Ventures, Lightspeed Faction, IEX Group, Informal Systems, Sommelier Cofounder Zaki Manian, Celestia Chief Operating Officer Nick White, and JUNO Cofounder Jake Hartnell, among others.

Founded in 2022 by veteran software developers Barry Plunkett and Maghnus Mareneck, Skip’s platform allows users and traders to pay for transaction prioritization and privacy in a sealed-bid auction with the goal of democratizing access to MEV opportunities and profits. Skip’s infrastructure is designed to share MEV profits to validators, stakers, and protocols, while making it easier for traders to execute their strategies. It also protects users from gas wars, transaction spam, frontrunning and sandwich attacks, and other downsides of toxic MEV extraction.

“ Interoperable and sovereign blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem are driving some of the most exciting innovation in DeFi. But the presence of toxic forms of MEV, including spam and latency wars, have capped the financial upside and harmed the user experience of those who build on and invest in them,” said Barry Plunkett, Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Skip. “ Skip’s goal is to give chains and their communities a toolkit that allows them to decide how MEV is extracted and where profits accrue. We’re excited to leverage our infrastructure to help users, validators, stakers, relayers, and others capture the value that they help create and achieve financial sustainability.”

“ The long-term growth of app chains and L1s in the Cosmos ecosystem is dependent on the rewards the chains can sustainably provide to participants, and Skip’s chain-specific, user-centric approach and infrastructure will help them deliver significant monetary value and optimized efficiency to the network,” said Maghnus Mareneck, Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Skip. “ We are thrilled to drive the growth of such an important ecosystem like Cosmos and thank our dedicated investors, enthusiastic validator partners, and welcoming ecosystem partners for their support.”

“ In order to reduce exploits, protect users, and expedite critical actions, every decentralized network will need to thoughtfully craft how it prioritizes transactions. Skip is building essential infrastructure to implement these capabilities,” said Kevin Zhang, venture partner with Bain Capital Crypto. “ Barry and Mag are building Skip with the benefit of years of technical experience at D.E. Shaw and Atlassian developing software, financial markets, and web3-native products. In working closely with them from inception, we could not be more impressed with and confident in their technical execution, user-centric values, and clear-eyed vision for how networks will develop in the decades to come – a view clearly shared by the compelling community of protocols, validators, stakers, traders, and others coming together in this financing to support Skip’s development.”

“ The Cosmos ecosystem is currently exploring a new portion of the design space of decentralized protocols via application-specific blockchains — and Skip is greatly expanding the value and type of MEV in the marketplace,” said Tarun Chitra, Managing Partner at Robot Ventures. “ The Skip team has a very unique background that combines academic mechanism design research and practical software engineering that allows them to improve the efficiency of the Cosmos ecosystem in the same way that MEV auctions improved Ethereum.”

Skip’s launch follows the company’s first place finish at the Jump Crypto Hackerhouse in Chicago in May, 2022, an achievement that helped position the company as a leading MEV product builder. Software engineers, investors, validators, and others who are interested in driving Skip’s continued growth and momentum and building a stronger Cosmos ecosystem can learn more by visiting skip.money.

About Skip

Skip is dedicated to building infrastructure that enables blockchains to achieve long-term financial sustainability by harnessing Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Skip is the first MEV infrastructure provider dedicated to giving blockchain communities control over how MEV revenues are captured and distributed. Skip’s products help stakers, validators, and protocols access profits from MEV; improve chain user experiences; and enable traders to execute more sophisticated and profitable strategies.",blockchain,business wire

Prior to the outbreak of the global pandemic, the World Travel and Tourism Council said that tourism generated over one-fifth of Greece’s total GDP.

This year, the country faced a record number of travelers during its summer tourism season. In the month of August alone, the country received nearly 1 million travel arrivals per week, according to the Greek Minister of Tourism Vassilis Kikilias.

A report from ForwardKeys on this year’s summer tourism revealed that, of the top ten “sun and beach” locations in Europe, Greece held six spaces. These included the island destinations of Mykonos, Thira (Santorini) and Heraklion (Crete), as well as Thessaloniki. Athens, the country’s capital, took third place for “urban” destinations in Europe.

Of the 27 European Union member states, Greece takes the sixth spot in terms of cryptocurrency ATMs, with 64 active for usage. Over half of Greece’s crypto ATMs are shared between Athens and Thessaloniki.

However, the Bitcoin ATM operator BCash strategically placed some of its ATMs in the country’s trendy island destinations of Mykonos, Santorini and Crete. Cointelegraph spoke with the managing director and co-founder of BCash, Dimitrios Tsangalidis, on how crypto is impacted by or itself impacts the tourism season in Greece.

Although Mykonos and Santorini are the most visited tourist destinations, the mainland ATMs have the majority of traffic, according to Tsangalidis — especially central Athens, where the first ATM was installed, and Thessaloniki.

However, the co-founder noted that in Crete, the country’s most populated island and a popular tourist destination, there is a ""very loyal cryptocurrency crowd.""

“There is a strong crypto community in Heraklion of Crete [which is] the location of one of our ATMs.""

In Heraklion, the capital of Crete, the local start-up accelerator H2B Hub collaborated with the Greek-speaking University of Nicosia to create and support a local blockchain community.

Both Athens and Thessaloniki have active, regular meetups for the crypto and blockchain community.

While tourism bolsters parts of the Greek economy, according to Tsangalidis, it doesn’t translate to the crypto scene. “Unfortunately, the absolute opposite happens,” says Tsangalidis.

“In summer months and high tourist seasons, the demand drops. But we are in the middle of crypto winter that came earlier this year, so it is really hard to tell.""

Especially in terms of regular traffic, the decrease can also be equated to locals leaving for vacation.

In general, Greece needs more awareness of cryptocurrencies and their utility in everyday life, Tsangalidis sums up.

“Influence on local tourism can be noticeable only if there is a general adoption of cryptocurrency within society.”

He adds that for now, there is little to no infrastructure or adoption from the level of Greek businesses and local governments. “If our government will become crypto friendly and if a green light will be given to businesses, then adoption will follow.”

In May of this year, the president of the Greek National Tourism Organization, Angela Gerekou, said the country is currently exploring how blockchain technology can bring about safety and transparency in tourism.",blockchain,cointelegraph

Sorare, whose online fantasy sports game involves the sale of licensed digital sports cards which players can use to build teams which compete against each other, said it had an exclusive multi-year partnership with Liverpool to create content and experiences for fans.

The cards for the game are bought and traded in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a kind of crypto asset which records the ownership status of digital goods on the blockchain.

A 2021 deal saw Liverpool cards introduced on the platform and the new deal will see perks such as Liverpool stadium visits, match day experiences, merchandise and video content being offered as prizes for winners of the online game, Sorare said.

Sports-related collectibles proved a popular type of NFT as the digital assets market exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry last year, although the frenzy has cooled in recent months.

The average sale price of a Sorare NFT in August was US$86.14, down from a peak of around US$280 in March last year, according to market tracker CryptoSlam.

Britain's gambling watchdog is investigating Sorare to assess whether its game amounts to gambling. A spokesperson for Sorare said that this was ""not relevant"" to the partnership with Liverpool.

""Sorare remains very confident it does not offer any forms of gambling, and this has been confirmed by expert legal opinions at every stage since the company was founded, including when signing new partnerships"", the spokesperson said.

EazyPay, an online payment platform regulated by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), has partnered with Binance Pay to enable crypto payments in the country, EazyPay CEO and founder Nayef Tawfiq Al Alawi announced on Wednesday.

The newly launched crypto payment option will be available in more than 5,000 point-of-sale (PoS) terminals and online payment gateways across Bahrain, the CEO said.

Major local merchants and firms, including Lulu Hypermarket, Sharaf DG, Al Zain Jewelry and Jasmi’s, will be able to accept more than 70 cryptocurrencies as payment by scanning the QR code from Eazy’s PoS using Binance App.

Al Alawi emphasized that ‎‏Eazy Financial Services is licensed and regulated by Bahrain’s central bank as the fifth PoS and online payment gateway acquirer and payment services provider.

“Special thanks go to the Central Bank of Bahrain, Binance and Eazy Financial Services,” he noted. Khalid Hamad Al Hamad, executive director of the banking supervision at the CBB, also congratulated Eazy on rolling out the new crypto payment service.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao noted that EazyPay’s crypto payment feature would be the “first regulated and approved crypto payments service offering” in the Middle East and North Africa region. As previously reported, Binance received several regulatory approvals in Bahrain, including a crypto service provider license and the Category 4 license.

The third-smallest country in Asia, Bahrain, has been actively adopting cryptocurrency over the past few years. In 2019, the CBB issued a framework for a range of crypto-related activities, officially establishing rules for licensing, governance, risk management, Anti-Money Laundering standards, reporting, security and other rules for crypto-asset services.

Therefore, Telos will host the first crypto hackathon ever on an Ivy League Campus. None other than the renowned Harvard University will be home to this three-day event.

A Crypto Hackathon At Harvard University

Given the growing interest in blockchain technology, it is plausible to assume there will be more hackathons and similar events. These efforts bring together people looking to turn their bright and innovative ideas into working products and services. Those efforts will build even stronger momentum with the support from renowned Ivy League campuses. Hack Boston, to be organized at Harvard University, is the first such event on an Ivy League campus.

From September 23-25, over 300 students will participate in the workshops and mentoring sessions. These students come from Harvard and MIT – two of the most prominent universities worldwide – and other Ivy League colleges. As a result, attendees will gain a better insight into blockchain technology and its possibilities.

Moreover, the workshops at Hck Boston are set up to introduce more people to Web3 technology. That is made possible with the help of Telos, one of the leading blockchain ecosystems. Telos has built its presence by supporting hackathons, dApp developers, supply chain management solutions, etc. With its powerful and robust infrastructure, Telos aims to play a growing role in decentralized solutions with mainstream appeal.

Telos will be represented at Hack Boston by Justin Giudici and Jesse Schulman. Together, they will host the “Get Started: Build Faster, Fairer DeFi on Telos” workshop and offer a comprehensive understanding of this ecosystem. Unlike other networks, Telos prides itself on ESG compliance, fixed gas prices, and top-tier scaling. Justin and Jesse will also provide mentorship to participating hacker teams to help them achieve their goals.

Reaching A New Era For Blockchain Technology

Getting a foot in the door at Ivy League campuses has been a lengthy process for the broader blockchain industry. However, Telos has successfully cracked the code – with the help of the Harvard and MIT blockchain clubs and Web3 learning app EasyA. Moreover, the future impact of Web3 technology has become more tangible. The Hack Boston hackathon will continue to build on that momentum and propel the industry forward.

There are also two big prices – $4,000 and $6,000, respectively – for the winning teams. In addition, Telos will award prizes to blockchain projects focused on real-world impact and decentralized finance. Winners will need to pay attention to using or implementing Web3 technology in these proceedings. Blockchain technology can change the lives of millions of people, especially when real-world use cases come to fruition.",blockchain,bitcoinist
293,Toss in your job and make $300K working for a DAO? Here’s how,https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/magazine-Work-for-a-DAO.jpg,22/09/2022,"Increasing numbers of employees are quitting 9-5 corporate jobs to work for DAOs. While the money’s great, DAOs fall into a legal grey area and it can be tricky to get your foot in the door. Here’s how to get started.",https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2022/09/22/toss-in-your-job-and-make-300k-working-for-a-dao-heres-how,"Increasing numbers of employees are quitting 9–5 corporate jobs to work for DAOs. While the money’s great, DAOs fall into a legal gray area, and it can be tricky to get your foot in the door.

Researchers Nataliya Ilyushina and Trent MacDonald from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Blockchain Innovation Hub take you through how to get started.

This year could see two emerging workforce dynamics come to a head. Twenty-one million Americans quit their jobs in 2021 — heralding the “Great Resignation” era — after an extended experience working remotely during COVID-19 lockdowns and dissatisfaction with conditions upon reentering their workplaces.

One in 5 workers reported an intent to quit their jobs in 2022. At the same time, the peak number of members of decentralized autonomous organizations at the start of August 2022 was 3.4 million, with over 140,000 new members joining in July 2022 alone.

Although the “Little Migration” to DAOs pales in comparison to the Great Resignation, we might still wonder if these two trends are connected in some small way.

For one, the demographics of both groups are strikingly similar: workers typically between 30 and 45 years old and with the tech industry most affected. Secondly, DAOs are digitally native organizations and a natural fit for many of the disaffected workers seeking new remote employment opportunities.

So, why are people migrating from working in traditional corporations to become digital nomads working in new settings such as DAOs? Could this be your next career move?

Decentralized alternative

DAOs are a new form of organizational structure offering an alternative to corporations. For workers, the critical difference is the horizontal structure, where there is little formal hierarchy and no bosses.

DAOs offer a revolutionary new type of employment: a hybrid of ownership, traditional employment, freelancing and volunteering. Every member is a boss and a worker (both paid and unpaid) and is free to contribute when and where they see fit. Each member is free to choose how much time they want to spend working, voting and participating in discussions. Moreover, one can be a member of multiple DAOs and choose how much time and effort they devote to each.

According to DeepDAO, numerous top DAO contributors are members of dozens of DAOs at once, with the most prolific contributor currently part of more than 80 DAOs. In other words, employment in a DAO is flexible, discretionary, overlapping and deregulated.

DAO employment offers considerable worker flexibility — in terms of their overall supply of labor, working hours and variety of tasks — due to the digital, remote and asynchronous nature of DAO operations.

Today, it is possible to earn a living working for a DAO or across multiple DAOs, with some earning as much as $300,000 a year in 2021. A survey of 422 DAO members conducted by Gitcoin and Bankless showed that half of the respondents were able to earn a living from working in one or more DAOs.



A long road to be paid

However, the remuneration rarely comes as a traditional salary and is commonly paid in tokens. Furthermore, the moment one starts working for a DAO and the moment they get paid can be two entirely different points in time.

Here is how the evolution of working for a DAO typically looks. The moment one joins a DAO (usually by purchasing a token), they can start contributing by participating in a community forum (often on Discord) and voting (using Snapshot or something similar). At this point, however, there is a slim chance of getting paid. As one’s reputation grows, the DAO community may reward them based on discussion and participation KPIs (usually via airdrops).

Once a member has familiarised themself with the DAO and proved their reputation, they might start contributing to the core DAO project. At this stage, this usually happens in the form of completing a bounty: a small, disconnected task. Bounties are paid and lead to further accumulation of reputation and DAO-specific skills.

Not everyone is skilled to work for a #DAO… ? right now. A DAO in its current form requires skills not everyone possesses, and that’s ok. ? A lot of ideas are still getting tested, and there won’t be one single way to work in a DAO there will be many. — ivanlozada.eth ? _⚙️ (@ivan7538) September 6, 2022

The next step is to secure a part-time or full-time position within a DAO. While relatively rare and hard to get, these jobs are very well-paid. Longer-term or ongoing positions such as these are usually associated with the core operations of the DAO project: for example, a software developer role in a protocol DAO or a graphic designer role in an NFT art production DAO. If one does not want to have a fixed arrangement, they can continue contributing when convenient, and the peer review process will decide how to remunerate the value they add to the DAO.

Everyone’s story transitioning to work for a DAO is different — for example, an anon dev called Squelch tells Cointelegraph he went through this entire typical lifecycle of DAO employment in merely a week.

Before joining DAOs, they built carbon market trading exchanges and natural disaster insurance, worked in investment banking, and “helped to create an alternative interest rate benchmark to Libor called Ameribor and ran an insurtech company.”

They’ve been interested in blockchain since first hearing about Bitcoin in 2009, but it wasn’t until the DeFi summer in 2020 that they began to spend every waking moment learning about protocols and smart contracts.





It was still a big leap to ditch their eclectic financial services job but took the plunge when they saw a job ad for Tracer DAO (now Mycelium) looking for someone to build a decentralized derivative. After chatting with the Tracer people, it turned out they idolized Richard Sandor, who was Squelch’s mentor.

I jumped on a call with and told them about my experience, and they asked me to be a pro-bono type advisor to the project. Within a week, they asked me to join as a full-time paid contributor and, a week later, asked me to run a core team providing services to the DAO.

Despite earning big bucks in their prior role, money didn’t come up in the Tracer DAO chat, and it rarely comes up as the main motivation for joining a DAO. Most say the appeal is in no longer working for a boss. The absence of a hierarchical structure promotes teamwork and the feeling of being part of a community. DAO contributors often mention the fairness and transparency of the organization. They operate like worker collectives operating via blockchain in which each member has a say about how to reward the work of others. The community makes all the decisions.

“The collaboration-maxi nature was a welcome breath of fresh air,” Squelch says.

“It is interesting in that you are connecting and collaborating with people that are also passionate about similar ideas and ideals. However, the challenge is creating coordination mechanisms and incentives so that everyone is working together in tandem to help solve these goals.”

They go on to add, “Even with the struggle of working in a DAO structure, I see them as being incredible tools to bring people together full-time, part-time and every so often to help bring things together.”

Irregular hours and no job security

The benefits of decentralization and deregulation also come with risks.

The flexibility of the work comes with a lack of job security and employment entitlements. Like rideshare drivers and other gig economy workers, who work when they want but often do not receive the same entitlements as standard full-time employees, DAO workers are not guaranteed sick, maternity and annual leave provisions.

Blockchain law expert Aaron Lane from the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub says that working for a DAO is in a “regulatory gray zone” at present. “There are established legal tests in most jurisdictions about whether someone is treated as an employee or an independent contractor,” he says, adding, “Organizations structured as a DAO cannot limit its liability just by virtue of that structure.”

DAOs are not immune from other issues, such as workplace discrimination and harassment, but their deregulated nature does not easily allow the prosecution of those practices. After all, which jurisdictional authority does a global DAO fall under?

The Hustlers Guide to making $1M+ working for DAO’s or Web 3 projects. ? The 10 DAO Commandments ? — The 7 Figure Crypto Consultant (@BowTiedDAO) September 3, 2022

The lack of job security and a legal framework might discourage women from joining if they are worried about the lack of provisions for careers or maternity leave as well as the overall perceived high-risk nature of the industry. There is no data on those issues yet, but it may be one factor in the lack of gender balance in the sector. A Bankless survey of DAO members found seven times more males than females.

But Lane remains optimistic: “While critics may say that there is potential for workplace rights to be eroded under a Work-for-the-DAO model, workers have a lot of power, as blockchain and crypto skills are in high demand, and this new technology could actually allow new forms of collectivized employment terms to emerge.”

While DAO employment still needs to be more clearly defined, there are significant benefits, and it’s only set to rise throughout 2022. The new employment relationship is attracting talent by offering flexibility, transparency and ownership along with the prospect of generous remuneration.

And the few risks posed by the deregulated nature of DAO employment do not seem to have hampered the growth in DAO membership yet. How all this plays out with respect to the Great Resignation is still unknown, but DAOs have been picking up at least some of the slack in terms of employees moving away from traditional corporations during the pandemic.

Gastrow has been a YouTuber for over a decade, with his channel currently garnering seven million subscribers and billions of views. In the video announcing Bigmode, he explained that his experience as a YouTuber is what gives him a good understanding of the type of games players want, with the publishing label aiming to be as developer-friendly as possible.

""I've been on YouTube for 11 years now and one of the core themes of my channel has always been to slam dunk soulless cash grabs into the garbage can and lift up and praise the truly inspired works of art in this medium,"" Gastrow said. ""For years and years, I have always sought out the very best indie games out there and have tried to do them justice, putting millions of eyes on the games that actually deserve attention.""

He added that Bigmode, which he is co-founding with his wife, YouTuber Leah 'Leahbee' Gastrow, will be a ""harmonious continuation"" of his own channel.

""Me and Leah aren't just the face of this company; we are the company,"" he continued. ""This is our vision and our No.1 priority is to publish some of the very best games out there. In today's indie landscape, buying a game can be like buying a loot crate in Counter-Strike: you don't know what you're going to get but you're probably going to be sad.

""A lot of games out there understand how to emulate the look of your favourite games but don't deliver where it actually counts. Many of the true games out there are being drowned out in a sea of mediocrity. You need someone who can help you be seen.""

Gastrow added that he's not looking for creative control via Bigmode, but does want to be involved in development.

""I understand what kind of ideas always work, what ideas never work, what kind of ideas are fresh or need to come back, and what is extremely played out,"" he added. ""I'm hyping myself up a lot in this video but Bigmode will be all about building up the games and the developers. We've put a lot of effort into making the most developer-friendly contracts possible. I think we're going to bring insane value to the table and the bottom line is: help good games succeed and help them continue to succeed into the future.""

Developers can already get in touch to submit their games, with Bigmode clarifying that it does not accept ""games that use NFTs, crypto, or blockchain.""",blockchain,gamesindustry.biz

Price Point

Bitcoin (BTC) was up 3.3% Thursday at around $19,100 – roughly back to where it was early Wednesday before a wild 24 hours of price swings that spanned the Federal Reserve’s latest announcement that it will continue its campaign of aggressive interest rate hikes.

The Fed’s rate moves have been pushing up the dollar’s value in foreign-exchange markets, and now cracks are starting to appear: Japan announced its first currency intervention in more than two decades to shore up the yen. Meanwhile, Switzerland, Norway and the U.K. all raised borrowing costs in the wake of the Fed’s decision.

Tighter monetary policy, in general, is seen as weighing on prices of risky assets like bitcoin. But it’s possible that the dire scenario is already priced into the market.

""Even if central banks tighten monetary policy further, the situation will not worsen more, for the current performance of crypto assets is terrible enough,” Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management-firm Blofin, told CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was gaining along with bitcoin, up 4.5% on the day to about $1,300. The broad CoinDesk Market Index was higher, led by Algorand’s ALGO with a 12% gain over the past 24 hours.

In the news, community members of the crypto-powered wireless project Helium voted to ditch their own blockchain and instead move operations onto the Solana blockchain under a plan to save resources.

The crypto exchange FTX, which is led by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, is reportedly in discussions to raise up to $1 billion in capital at a $32 billion valuation.

As XRP Rallies, Some Traders Buy Year-End Bullish Bets in the Options Market

By Omkar Godbole

Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP has rallied sharply this month, outshining larger cryptocurrencies. Some traders are snapping up bullish bets in the options market in hopes of continued gains into the year end.

The cryptocurrency, ranked fifth by market value, traded at 42.6 cents at press time, a 28% gain for the month, according to CoinDesk data. Market leaders bitcoin and ether were down 4.5% and 17%, respectively.

""We have seen interest in buying XRP year-end upside call options in anticipation of a resolution in the ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,"" Dick Lo, founder and CEO of Hong Kong-based quant trading firm and liquidity provider TDX Strategies, said.

A call is a derivative contract giving the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset – in this case, XRP – at a predetermined price on or before specific expiry date. A call, therefore, is preferred by bullish speculation, while a put option represents a bearish bet.

U.S. Yield Curve is Collapsing

By Omkar Godbole

This chart shows a relentless inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve. (Source: TradingView)

The U.S. Treasury yield curve is now at its most inverted point in four decades, with the spread between yields on the 10 and two-year Treasury notes sliding to -0.52%.

""The yield curve screams economic slowdown but also validates Powell's hawkish credentials,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at Tagus Capital, wrote in the daily market update, referring to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.

The relentless curve inversion could only add to the dollar's ongoing bullish momentum and make matters difficult for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

The 90-day correlation coefficient between the dollar index and the yield curve was -0.8 at press time, indicating a strong inverse relationship between the two.

Other backers in the round were Electric Capital, Polygon Ventures, Samsung Next, P2P Capital, North Island Ventures, Third Prime Ventures, Lattice Capital, and Stratos DeFi.

Immunefi focuses on bug bounty and security services for Web3 projects. Since its inception in December 2020, the firm has saved over $25 billion in users’ funds, according to a statement on Thursday. Immunefi said it has paid out $60 million in total bounties, and supports over 300 projects including Chainlink, Wormhole, and MakerDAO.

The next big thing

Bug bounties are increasingly becoming an attractive revenue stream for security researchers and an efficient way for tech firms to identify weaknesses in their products. In 2020, Google announced it had paid over $21 million in bug bounties under its vulnerability reward program since 2010, spending $6.5 million in 2019 alone. In 2020, hackers from dozens of countries earned up to $40 million just by identifying system vulnerabilities for various organizations.

Bug bounty rewards have slowly been increasing across crypto as well. In 2019, crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) forked out $30,000 bounty for identifying a critical bug in its systems.

The popularity of bug bounties is also due to the fact that decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, such as Balancer Labs, are increasingly vulnerable to hacks and theft. DeFi refers to financial activities carried out directly on the blockchain without any third party involvement.

According to a report by crypto sleuth CipherTrace, in the second half of 2020 half of all targeted entities for crypto-related hacks were DeFi platforms, making up 14% of total hacked volume (amounting to $47.7 million).

To this effect, in 2021 DeFi insurance brokerage ArmorFi paid a bounty of $1.5 million to a white-hat hacker who found a ""critical bug"" that could have seen all the firm’s underwriting funds drained.

“Open code and directly monetizable exploits have made web3 the most adversarial software development space in the world,"" Mitchell Amador, CEO of Immunefi, said in the statement.

“By shifting incentives towards white hats, Immunefi has already saved billions of dollars of users’ funds,"" Amador said. ""We’re using this raise to scale our team to meet this massive demand,"" he added.

And while it is one of the most popular options out there, it’s worth mentioning that Ethereum isn’t a simple currency but rather a blockchain system.

This network allows for the performance of a variety of actions, and while investing in crypto is often the most popular choice, it’s not the only thing that the blockchain provides, so when you get into Ethereum you might deal with a steeper learning curve than in the case of other currencies.

Ethereum acts as both currency, but it’s also a store of value and a place for decentralized processes, namely in the world of finance and in apps. In this sense, you can buy and sell Ether, purchase it and then store it to benefit from its potential for increased worth over time, or use it to interact with the platform.

However, before you get into the world of Ethereum you need to make sure you understand all the intricacies of Ethereum in order to make the most of your investing experience.

What is it?

The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, had a vision of creating a crypto, but taking it a bit further. As such, he created a blockchain network with the added digital coin known as Ether. This network has the potential to do much more than provide a place for traders to start their ventures.

Indeed experts estimate that the innovation is going to change the world sooner rather than later and create an internet space that can connect everyone from all over the world. What’s more, given the decentralized nature of the blockchain, no third-party entities are in control of your sensitive information.

This is excellent news given the increased incidence of data breach events, which are incredibly destructive for both individuals as well as companies.

The crypto associated with the blockchain is one of the more stable alternatives. While e-currency gets a rather negative rep for volatility, leaving a great many investors feeling like they’re trying to build on quicksand, Ethereum is steadier given its popularity and the continuous interest it records.

However, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be aware of the fluctuations. Being aware of the changes in ETH price helps you make informed decisions during your next trades. This ensures that you’re more likely to derive revenue rather than experience losses.

While variations in Ethereum are generally rarer and less extreme, you must still be actively engaged in the changes if you want to increase your chances of success, much like for other trades.

Smart Contracts

The tech of smart contracts is the driving force behind the blockchain. This program powers the network and allows users to perform all the actions without the help of an intermediary. So, for example, you can borrow, lend, buy or save money without the need for a brokerage or bank. Ethereum is one of the first platforms to make peer-to-peer lending popular in the world of digital finance.

This technology is basically a software that is able to work without a human being running it. So, in the case of a loan, the program lends the money when the collateral is distributed to the wallet. The main advantages are the lack of human error, lower fees and the speed of the transaction.

And while finances are one of the main usages for smart contracts, it’s not the only one. Decentralized apps are becoming increasingly popular on the Ethereum network and are one of the key reasons while an ever-expanding number of people are thinking to give the blockchain a chance.

There are many types of Dapps. Some are used for swapping and trading tokens, while others allow users to lend, stake and earn interest on deposits. There are also marketplaces for NFTs, as well as games combining the metaverse with the real world.

Ethereum vs Ether

Although the two are often used interchangeably, the names designate different, albeit complementary. Ether is the cryptocurrency used on the blockchain, while the system itself is referred to as Ethereum.

In order to create new tokens or applications on Ethereum, you need to pay a fee in their native currency, Ether. This sum is also sometimes referred to as “gas”. This nomenclature designates the amount of computational power necessary to execute operations on the network.

Different actions are worth different amounts of Ethereum, and the more people are present on the network the higher the fees get.

The gas prices are a good explanation for the increase in Ethereum’s value over the years. As crypto is used with higher frequency by developers when creating apps, ETH has become the favorite of many, meaning that there’s a larger number of people purchasing ether to pay gas fees.

The prospect for Ether to stay at the top of its game is high, meaning that its prospects for an even higher number of practical applications is high in the future.

Given the stellar expectations and how the future looks bright for Ethereum, you’ll definitely want to join the bandwagon and experience some of the victories of trading for yourself.

Other uses

We’ve already established that Ethereum can be used in many ways. Perhaps the most popular is in NFTs or non-fungible tokens, one of the blockchain’s creations. These digital tokens are used to represent ownership in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Their popularity has skyrocketed recently, with the prices rising up to $52.7 million, or 16953 ETH. In 2021, this record was overcome by Mike Winkelmann, known professionally as Beeple, when his artwork sold for no less than $69 million.

300,A Recession Creates Opportunity for Creatives,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1663597644-GettyImages-538475577.jpg,22/09/2022,"One of the few things that accelerates during an economic downturn is content, which means that for creative professionals, this is not a negative, but an invitation.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-recession-creates-opportunity-for-creatives/435170,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

The gig economy as we know it — and many of its associated growth strategies — were born of a recession. After the 2008 financial crisis, companies such as Uber, Lyft and Airbnb enabled laid-off workers (or those whose hours were slashed) to recoup losses while ideally adopting a mindset of independence, entrepreneurialism and side-hustle dynamism. As the old saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention. While the gig economy has since transformed into something more legally and ethically complex, it nonetheless still creates opportunities for millions who need them.

A lot has changed between 2008 and 2020, when Covid-19 shut down economies worldwide, in time causing inflation, then a recession that only now we're beginning to feel. In that sea of change, few industries have been revolutionized as dramatically as the creative field. Netflix, Amazon, HBO, Disney and Apple now compete aggressively for exponentially growing audiences, whose content consumption habits skyrocketed to eight hours daily during the onset of the first wave of lockdowns in April of 2020, and haven't fallen much since.

The race to produce more content — and make it fresh, innovative, engaging and insightful — is more intense than ever. And, just as in 2008, this creates opportunity.

Related: How to Manage the Supply and Demand of New Content

Leveling the Creative Playing Field

Another revolution we've witnessed since 2008 is a quantum technology leap. Gigabit internet is now widely available in many cities — unlocking absurdly fast speeds, direct to homes, for less than $100 a month — which means faster uploads and downloads and more streaming power. Cameras, meanwhile, barely resemble their decade-old predecessors: Blackmagic, for example, has a new under-$3,000 model that can shoot 6K video, while Apple recently unveiled an iPhone equipped with a 48mp camera capable of shooting 8K. Those are comparatively affordable alternatives for equipment that would easily have topped $10,000 just a few years ago.

Perhaps the greatest shift, however, has been in data storage. Professional creatives are moving away from expensive physical servers and toward cloud-based solutions, rightly seeing remote work, A.I. integration and cloud computing as the future of the industry. In 2013, Adobe transformed its one-time-purchase software to a cloud-based SaaS solution, recognizing the desire for flexible and multi-platform creative collaboration.

Working in this way throws off the shackles that once bound content creators. Modern cloud technology makes it so that any device with an internet connection can view and process large video resolutions, since the majority of the heavy lifting isn't being done by the device itself.

The payoff is a more affordable solution for independent creators who don't have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on a server, or who simply prefer the flexibility of SaaS solutions that scale up and down. Find the right cloud-based content management system and you can even consolidate several of those SaaS subscriptions into one.

We are in the midst of the greatest democratization of creative expression the world has ever seen — an evolution that completely changes the game for creative professionals, particularly the small businesses and freelancers who do the lion's share of work in productions. This is additionally critical because most movies and TV shows are not created by monolithic studios paying their staff salaries, but rather by smaller production companies that use freelancers.

These revolutionary shifts in camera hardware, cloud computing and internet speed have unlocked a new era of opportunity for independent content creators to find new jobs and create their own work, without needing the resources once only supplied by larger enterprises.

The Time for Disruption Is Now

Creatives could be forgiven for fretting over the current recession. After all, during almost any economic downturn, the first thing decision-makers do is cut costs, and if they can't find other solutions, start looking at personnel. Creatives in those ranks are often perceived as expendable, and therefore vulnerable.

But over the last three years, we've seen the inverse proven true: there is a huge demand for arts, entertainment and culture. Ask almost anyone stuck at home what helped them get through the pandemic: Aside from hobbies, most will report that it was movies and television that made the difference.

Related: Bill Gates Said ""Content Is King"" in 1996. But Is That Still True?

My message to creatives is therefore simple: This recession is an opportunity. Streaming platforms are hungrier than ever for new stories, and the potential audience is the widest it's ever been. Unprecedented technology exists to help you to create whatever you want and share it with the world.",cloud computing,entrepreneur
301,What the growth of AIops solutions means for the enterprise,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1313178434.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,22/09/2022,A combination of composable analytics and AIops can give enterprises the opportunity to organize their IT infrastructure and improve it.,https://venturebeat.com/ai/what-the-growth-of-aiops-solutions-means-for-the-enterprise/,"Did you miss a session from MetaBeat 2022? Head over to the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions here.

Without exaggeration, digital transformation is moving at breakneck speed, and the verdict is that it will only move faster. More organizations will migrate to the cloud, adopt edge computing and leverage artificial intelligence (AI) for business processes, according to Gartner.

Fueling this fast, wild ride is data, and this is why for many enterprises, data — in its various forms — is one of its most valuable assets. As businesses now have more data than ever before, managing and leveraging it for efficiency has become a top concern. Primary among those concerns is the inadequacy of traditional data management frameworks to handle the increasing complexities of a digital-forward business climate.

The priorities have changed: Customers are no longer satisfied with immobile traditional data centers and are now migrating to high-powered, on-demand and multicloud ones. According to Forrester’s survey of 1,039 international application development and delivery professionals, 60% of technology practitioners and decision-makers are using multicloud — a number expected to rise to 81% in the next 12 months. But perhaps most important from the survey is that “90% of responding multicloud users say that it’s helping them achieve their business goals.”

Managing the complexities of multicloud data centers

Gartner also reports that enterprise multicloud deployment has become so pervasive that until at least 2023, “the 10 biggest public cloud providers will command more than half of the total public cloud market.”

But that’s not where it ends — customers are also on the hunt for edge, private or hybrid multicloud data centers that offer full visibility of enterprise-wide technology stack and cross-domain correlation of IT infrastructure components. While justified, these functionalities come with great complexities.

Typically, layers upon layers of cross-domain configurations characterize the multicloud environment. However, as newer cloud computing functionalities enter into the mainstream, new layers are required — thus complicating an already-complex system.

This is made even more intricate with the rollout of the 5G network and edge data centers to support the increasing cloud-based demands of a global post-pandemic climate. Ushering in what many have called “a new wave of data centers,” this reconstruction creates even greater complexities that place enormous pressure on traditional operational models.

Change is necessary, but considering that the slightest change in one of the infrastructure, security, networking or application layers could result in large-scale butterfly effects, enterprise IT teams must come to terms with the fact that they cannot do it alone.

AIops as a solution to multicloud complexity

Andy Thurai, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research Inc., also confirmed this. For him, the siloed nature of multicloud operations management has resulted in the increasing complexity of IT operations. His solution? AI for IT operations (AIops), an AI industry category coined by tech research firm Gartner in 2016.

Officially defined by Gartner as “the combination of big data and ML [machine learning] in the automation and improvement of IT operation processes,” the detection, monitoring and analytic capabilities of AIops allow it to intelligently comb through countless disparate components of data centers to provide a holistic transformation of its operations.

By 2030, the rise in data volumes and its resulting increase in cloud adoption will have contributed to a projected $644.96 billion global AIops market size. What this means is that enterprises that expect to meet the speed and scale requirements of growing customer expectations must resort to AIops. Else, they run the risk of poor data management and a consequent fall in business performance.

This need creates a demand for comprehensive and holistic operating models for the deployment of AIops — and that is where Cloudfabrix comes in.

AIops as a composable analytics solution

Inspired to help enterprises ease their adoption of a data-first, AI-first and automate-everywhere strategy, Cloudfabrix today announced the availability of its new AIops operating model. It is equipped with persona-based composable analytics, data and AI/ML observability pipelines and incident-remediation workflow capabilities. The announcement comes on the heels of its recent release of what it describes as “the world-first robotic data automation fabric (RDAF) technology that unifies AIops, automation and observability.”

Identified as key to scaling AI, composable analytics give enterprises the opportunity to organize their IT infrastructure by creating subcomponents that can be accessed and delivered to remote machines at will. Featured in Cloudfabrix’s new AIops operating model is a composable analytics integration with composable dashboards and pipelines.

Offering a 360-degree visualization of disparate data sources and types, Cloudfabrix’s composable dashboards feature field-configurable persona-based dashboards, centralized visibility for platform teams and KPI dashboards for business-development operations.

Shailesh Manjrekar, VP of AI and marketing at Cloudfabrix, noted in an article published on Forbes that the only way AIops could process all data types to improve their quality and glean unique insights is through real-time observability pipelines. This stance is reiterated in Cloudfabrix’s adoption of not just composable pipelines, but also observability pipeline synthetics in its incident-remediation workflows.

In this synthesis, likely malfunctions are simulated to monitor the behavior of the pipeline and understand the probable causes and their solutions. Also included in the incident-remediation workflow of the model is the recommendation engine, which leverages learned behavior from the operational metastore and NLP analysis to recommend clear remediation actions for prioritized alerts.

To give a sense of the scope, Cloudfabrix’s CEO, Raju Datla, said the launch of its composable analytics is “solely focused on the BizDevOps personas in mind and transforming their user experience and trust in AI operations.”

He added that the launch also “focuses on automation, by seamlessly integrating AIops workflows in your operating model and building trust in data automation and observability pipelines through simulating synthetic errors before launching in production.” Some of those operational personas for whom this model has been designed include cloudops, bizops, GitOps, finops, devops, DevSecOps, Exec, ITops and serviceops.

Founded in 2015, Cloudfabrix specializes in enabling businesses to build autonomous enterprises with AI-powered IT solutions. Although the California-based software company markets itself as a foremost data-centric AIops platform vendor, it’s not without competition — especially with contenders like IBM’s Watson AIops, Moogsoft, Splunk and others.",cloud computing,venturebeat

According to a procurement note, the Bank of England is looking for an IT services company to ""support the implementation of technical and change management aspects of the Oracle Cloud implementation and business change programme.""

The chosen supplier will be expected to support a program that provides a ""step change in the capabilities and value delivered by the finance, procurement and recruitment functions in the Bank, leveraging the existing Oracle Cloud toolset to drive sustainable business change.""

The contract is expected to last 55 months, with the potential to extend for a further 24 months, and will be worth up to £7 million (c $7.9 million).

The move follows the implementation at the Bank of Oracle Fusion, Big Red's cloud application platform for HR, in late 2021.

The new partner will be expected to ""review and rebuild"" the ""way all tasks, processes and outputs are achieved and will leverage the Oracle Cloud toolset to help drive business change.""

The Bank of England, also known as the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, first advertised its mission to move its applications and infrastructure to the public cloud in 2020. In a procurement document published at the time, the institution said it was working on a ""strategic plan, 'One Bank, One Mission' which provides an ambitious agenda to transform."" The goal was to ""create a single, unified institution"" and understand in ""more detail how the benefits of cloud services (public) could be secured.""

LinkedIn profiles suggest the Bank of England was already using Oracle for HR. It also deployed Oracle databases but used SAP for supply chain management.

In 2009, it contracted outsourcing company Logica to develop HR services for benefits, talent management, and payroll administration software based on Oracle HCM under a five-year deal.

The Bank of England was founded in 1694, beginning life as a banker to the government. It issued its first banknotes in 1725, the highest denomination being £90. In 2021, the bank introduced a new £50 note, the first to feature Alan Turing, the Second World War code-breaker and one of the founders of modern computing. ®",cloud computing,theregister.com

The cloud services investigation, which will take priority out of the three issues, will look at Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

Between them, these “hyperscalers” control more than four-fifths of the UK’s cloud computing market, about half of which is made up by Amazon.

Over the coming year, the regulator will begin investigating a wider range of digital services. WhatsApp, FaceTime and Zoom will come under the lens, with Ofcom looking at how their market power is affecting traditional calling and messaging, and whether the lack of interoperability “raises potential concerns”.

Smart speakers such as Amazon’s Echo, Google’s Nest and Apple’s HomePods will be checked, alongside smart TVs and digital personal assistants, to ensure their effects on consumer behaviour do not distort the market for TV, radio and online content.

Selina Chadha, Ofcom’s director of connectivity, said: “The way we live, work, play and do business has been transformed by digital services.

“But as the number of platforms, devices and networks that serve up content continues to grow, so do the technological and economic issues confronting regulators.

“That’s why we’re kickstarting a programme of work to scrutinise these digital markets, identify any competition concerns, and make sure they’re working well for people and businesses who rely on them.”

The cloud study, which begins in the coming weeks, “will examine the strength of competition in cloud services generally and the position the three hyperscalers hold in the market”, the regulator said in a statement.

“We will also consider any market features that might limit innovation and growth in this sector, by making it difficult for other companies to enter the market and expand their share.

“How well digital markets function will be increasingly important to the outcomes consumers experience across the sectors we regulate. We need to be looking as much at how companies are using digital infrastructure and services as we do the cables, masts and satellites that we have focused on in the past.”

The investigations will take place under the Enterprise Act 2002, which gives Ofcom the power to issue market studies in digital communications markets, and to examine potentially unfair commercial practices and contract terms.

Ofcom is expected to receive further powers to regulate internet content providers in the online safety bill. Initially planned to be passed before the summer recess, the bill was dropped for timing reasons, but the new culture secretary, Michelle Donelan, has promised to continue with the legislation with some changes.",cloud computing,the guardian
305,My 3 Favorite Stocks Right Now,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/701135/buy-gettyimages-986757634.jpg,22/09/2022,These high-quality businesses could help you build lasting wealth.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/my-3-favorite-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,"Investing more capital into your best ideas can lead to outsize rewards. The challenge, of course, is choosing the right stocks. To help you identify investments that are most worthy of your hard-earned money, I offer my three highest-conviction ideas right now. All are outstanding businesses that are well-positioned to generate handsome returns for their shareowners in the coming years.

1. The cloud data leader

Snowflake (SNOW -2.48%) helps businesses make better use of their data at a time when harvesting valuable insights from the cloud is becoming more important every day. It's a massive market, one that could grow to a staggering $248 billion by 2026, according to the company's estimates.

Snowflake is expanding at a blistering pace within this fast-growing market. Its revenue soared 83% year over year to $497 million in its fiscal 2023 second quarter, which ended on July 31.

The company's new, consumption-based model is proving popular, as it allows businesses to pay only for the computing resources they use. By enabling its customers to better align their costs with their usage of data transfer, storage, and computing services, Snowflake is helping them save significant amounts of money.

Companies, in turn, are flocking to Snowflake's cloud platform. It ended the second quarter with 6,808 customers, up 36% from the prior-year period. Snowflake also excels at deepening its relationships with its existing clients, as evidenced by its exceptional net revenue retention rate of 171%.

Although Snowflake is not yet profitable (it generated an operating loss of $208 million in its most recent quarter), it did produce $54 million of free cash flow. Management also expects the company to reach impressive profitability by the end of the decade, with an adjusted operating margin of roughly 20%.

With its data warehousing tools in high demand, investors can safely expect Snowflake's sales and cash flow production to grow even more impressive in the years ahead. Consider buying this cloud data leader's shares today so you, too, could cash in on its good growth prospects.

2. The e-commerce and cloud computing colossus

Few businesses stand to benefit more from the global shift to the cloud than Amazon (AMZN -5.00%). Sure, Amazon is famous for its e-commerce platform. But the shining star these days is its Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leading provider of cloud infrastructure services. It's an incredibly valuable position to be in because an enormous amount of capital is expected to be invested in cloud computing services in the coming decade.

AWS is already a $70 billion business. Yet only about 5% of worldwide information-technology spending is currently allocated toward cloud solutions, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. Analysts expect this figure to march steadily higher, due to the security, cost, and scalability benefits that cloud computing provides compared to on-premise networks.

Grand View Research, for one, projects that the global cloud computing market will grow by more than 19% annually to over $1.2 trillion by 2028. That leaves plenty of room for AWS' sales and profits (operating income in the second quarter alone exceeded $5.7 billion) to continue to grow at a rapid pace for many years to come.

It's true that Amazon's e-commerce operations have struggled in recent quarters. Supply chain disruptions and cost inflation have taken a heavy toll. Yet Jassy and his team are acting aggressively to right the ship.

Amazon is scaling back its warehouse expansion plans and investing in automation technology, such as its recent acquisition of robotics specialist Cloostermans. These actions should help to boost the efficiency of Amazon's massive fulfillment network and drive a rebound in the segment's profitability over time.

To profit alongside the mighty Amazon, consider purchasing some shares of this cloud and e-commerce leader today.

3. The technology giant

Apple's (AAPL -3.22%) new iPhones are reportedly selling like hotcakes. Better still, many consumers appear to be choosing the tech titan's priciest phone, the iPhone Pro. That should help to boost Apple's already sky-high profit margins.

Strong iPhone orders also bode well for sales of the company's high-margin services. This segment -- which includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and iCloud+, among other offerings -- is quickly approaching $100 billion in annual revenue. It's a staggering sum, one that would make Apple's services business one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world in its own right.

In all, Apple generated a stunning $98 billion in operating cash flow and over $90 billion in free cash flow during the first nine months of its fiscal 2022. Investors can expect Apple's growing installed base of iPhone users and steadily expanding service subscriptions to drive these figures even higher in the coming years. That, in turn, should result in larger dividends and further share price appreciation for its long-term investors.",cloud computing,motley fool

308,2 Beaten-Down Warren Buffett Stocks Poised for Epic Comebacks,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/701842/u-turn-concept.jpg,22/09/2022,Berkshire Hathaway holdings RH and Snowflake have been crushed under the weight of the 2022 bear market.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/2-beaten-down-warren-buffett-stocks-poised-for-epi/,"The 2022 bear market hasn't been kind to Warren Buffett's diversified holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.59%) (BRK.B -1.13%). Despite Buffett and his team being world-class stock pickers, 84% of the conglomerate's equity holdings are presently in the red for the year. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway's various stock holdings have yielded an average return on capital of negative 14% nearly 10 months into 2022. That's a testament to the widespread impact of this bear market.

Berkshire Hathaway rarely misses on stock picks over the long-term, however. Between 1964 and 2021, it delivered a jaw-dropping total return on capital of 3,641,613%, and one of the key reasons it was able to do that was that Buffett has maintained a laser-like focus on owning high-quality companies with outstanding management teams. So even though this sour market may not be rewarding deep value now, this key aspect of most Buffett stock picks almost always shines through over multiyear holding periods.

How can investors put this insight to use? Well, Berkshire Hathaway's two worst-performing stocks this year are the luxury furniture retailer RH (RH -3.95%) and the cloud-based data platform developer Snowflake (SNOW -2.48%). The common theme across Berkshire Hathaway's holdings is that they tend to be chock-full of deep value, and these Buffett stocks are no exceptions. Here's why they could be poised for epic turnarounds in the not-so-distant future.

RH: A ""Tale of Two Cities"" stock

RH has been Berkshire Hathaway's worst-performing stock holding in 2022, down by a whopping 52.2% year to date. After that dramatic sell-off, though, the stock stands out as a table-pounding buying opportunity for bargain hunters.

The core reason RH would make a great contrarian buy now is that its value proposition is being misunderstood at the moment by the broader market. While it is true that RH's core business in luxury home furnishings is somewhat sensitive to conditions in the real estate market, the company primarily targets high-net-worth customers who are capable of either paying cash for homes or using collateral to take out low-interest rate loans.

So, even though RH's top line is forecast to dip by a noteworthy 16% over the course of 2022 to 2023, the market's hasty decision to slash the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio by 62% -- relative to its 52-week high -- is quite frankly nonsensical. RH's wealthy customers aren't the ones feeling the biggest pinches from inflation or rising interest rates, after all.

The bottom line is that RH ought to continue generating healthy levels of free cash flow even as the broader economy gradually slows down over the next few quarters. What's more, the company's plans to expand into high-growth areas such as hotels, hospitality, and international markets bode well for its long-term outlook.

Lastly, Wall Street analysts' current fair value estimates for RH imply a noteworthy upside potential of 49%. Now, analysts' valuation scenarios should always be taken with a grain of salt. But in this case, there is a compelling argument to be made that this luxury home furnishing stock has indeed fallen too far. A turnaround, therefore, appears to be imminent.

Snowflake: A powerful growth trend

Big tech companies are steadily moving to cloud services as a way to house and subsequently recall large datasets. Montana-based cloud computing company Snowflake has been riding this emerging trend over the last 10 years. And while it has yet to establish a bona fide competitive moat in this jam-packed field, its user-friendly platform has started to land with a core set of clients, resulting in an enormous uptick in sales of late.

In its most recent quarter, for instance, Snowflake reported an 83% year-over-year rise in sales to $497 million. It's on track to become cash flow positive on a consistent basis within the next few quarters. What's more, Wall Street expects the cloud-computing player's top line to rise at a blistering compound annual rate of 36.75% over the next three years. Yet this Buffett stock has lost a staggering 47% of its value over the course of 2022.

Bears have hammered Snowflake this year for two reasons. First, its shares were trading at over 90 times sales early this year. Tech stocks with premium valuations have been prime targets for short-sellers and profit-takers all year long. Snowflake's premium valuation, in particular, has been called into question over concerns that larger cloud-based computing operations could squeeze its profit margins and steal its customers.

Second, Snowflake still isn't consistently profitable, and this moody market has had zero patience for money-losing operations.

All things considered, though, Snowflake's shares appear to have been unfairly punished by this risk-averse market. The company's lightning-fast sales growth ought to put it in the running to become a dominant player in the massive cloud-based computing realm by the end of the decade. And that ultra-fast growth profile is a key reason why Wall Street analysts think Snowflake's shares might be undervalued by an eye-catching 65% right now. So once investors' recessionary fears ease, this top cloud-computing stock could come roaring back.",cloud computing,motley fool
309,"2 Cheap Dow Jones Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist, and 1 to Avoid",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/701696/aapl3.jpg,22/09/2022,This year's market slump created several growth stock bargains. But not every apparent bargain is what it seems.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/2-cheap-dow-jones-stocks-to-buy-hand-over-fist-and/,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average has tumbled nearly 16% this year in reaction to recession fears and rising interest rates. Some stocks in the 30-company index have fallen by even more. For long-term investors, that presents an opportunity as the stocks that make up the DJIA are often described as blue chip stocks and offer great opportunities to also be described as long-term winners. Unfortunately, there are also a few that deserve hard passes.

Let's take a closer look at two Dow Jones stocks that are worth a closer look and one that is probably better avoided right now.

One to buy: Apple keeps getting more profitable

The release of the iPhone 14 could make Apple (AAPL -3.22%) more profitable than it already is. Apple enthusiasts may have noticed a subtle change to the iPhone 14 mix from previous models. This year's versions include two Pro versions (Pro and Pro Max) and no iPhone Mini. The main benefits of the Pro versions are the robust cameras and faster processors, and those features require more memory to operate. The additional memory in the Pro versions is cheap. Since the upgraded versions carry a much higher price tag, they're much more profitable smartphones than versions with less memory. Apple captures a 90% gross margin on the price difference between the Pro versions and versions with less memory.

After Apple introduced the Pro models in 2019, the gross margin that Apple reaped from its product segment reached 37%, its highest mark since Apple disclosed such data in 2018. Since the iPhone makes up the bulk of Apple's revenue, every percentage point of margin increase impacts its bottom line significantly.

This could be one of the reasons why Warren Buffett said Apple is probably the best company in the world that he knows. The legendary investor is known for buying stocks of great companies when they get cheap. He bought chunks of the stock in the first two quarters of the year for his company, Berkshire Hathaway. Investors looking to buy in now might be pleased to know that the stock has fallen over the last month to around the same price Buffett bought it at earlier this year. If the stock is cheap enough for the Oracle of Omaha to buy, investors should take note. They would also be wise to make Apple a core holding in their portfolios.

Another to buy: Salesforce can grow faster than the cloud industry

Outside of energy, cloud computing seems to be one of the remaining sectors seeing widespread growth this year. Unlike energy companies, though, cloud companies' stock prices cratered in 2022. This price dip could be a huge opportunity for savvy long-term investors, especially when you consider industry forecasts call for the cloud computing market to grow at a 17.4% annual clip through 2030.

Cloud giant Salesforce (CRM -2.21%) is best known for its wildly popular Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which gives its customer's sales teams cloud-based collaboration and marketing tools to strengthen customer relationships and expand sales opportunities. Perhaps more compelling to investors is Salesforce's acquisition strategy, which includes acquiring up-and-coming cloud-based collaboration companies, integrating them into the company, and quickly scaling them up.

For instance, Salesforce bought MuleSoft in May of 2018. MuleSoft generated $227 million of revenue at the time of acquisition, and Salesforce rapidly grew its annual revenue by 499% to $1.7 billion. More impressively, the company rolled up ExactTarget in July of 2013 and increased its revenue by 949%, from $286 million to $3 billion. Salesforce plans to do the same with its 2019 acquisition of Tableau and 2021 buyout of Slack. Its acquisition strategy combined with its unique CRM platform should put it in a great position to grow its business faster than the cloud industry forecast.

There are growing concerns that the slowing economy will also slow the growth in cloud computing, which may be why the stock is down this year. But Salesforce still managed to grow its fiscal 2023 second-quarter (ended July 31) revenue to $7.72 billion on a constant currency basis (after adjusting for currency fluctuations), a 26% year-over-year jump. That comes on the heels of 26% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter.

Though Salesforce's stock price is off over 40% this year, its long-term growth story remains intact. Wall Street analysts forecast the company will grow its earnings per share by 220% to $4.74 in fiscal 2023 (ending Jan. 31, 2023). That implies a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 31, which is significantly cheaper than it's been in over a year. Growth investors excited by the cloud computing should be adding Salesforce stock to their portfolios.

One to avoid: 3M faces multiple monster legal liabilities

3M (MMM -0.55%) has long been an industrial juggernaut. The company has a storied history and is known for Scotch tape, Post-It notes, and produces hundreds of other industrial, electronics, and healthcare products. But a couple of those products have gotten 3M in hot water recently.

The company is embroiled in a legal battle with plaintiffs in New York who are accusing 3M and other companies of contaminating drinking water with toxic chemicals. The defendants recently settled one suit with a small New York town that manages the water, but additional civil claims are expected. One environmental lawyer said the settlement was the tip of the iceberg, and settlements from other claims will likely cost 3M billions of dollars.

3M is also facing legal settlements from veterans who claim they suffered hearing loss from earplugs the company sold to the U.S. military. The company has already settled with some individual veterans who were awarded damages that averaged $26 million each. The 3M subsidiary responsible for the earplugs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but a judge denied a motion to move the case to bankruptcy court. With over 230,000 more veterans who have filed similar claims, 3M is likely to be hit with additional mammoth liability.

3M's courtroom troubles may already be reflected in the stock's 35% tumble this year, but both of these issues still have considerable uncertainty and could worsen. 3M has set aside $1 billion to a trust for potential earplug settlements, but total settlements could far exceed the trust deposit. That's before accounting for the contaminated drinking water suit. Until investors have a clearer view of the end result of these cases, they'll want to avoid 3M stock.",cloud computing,motley fool
310,3 Top Cloud Stocks to Buy in September,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/701073/cloud-stuff.jpg,22/09/2022,These stocks are inexpensive and the companies should grow for many years to come.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/3-top-cloud-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,"Given the huge drawdown so far this year in technology stocks -- the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF is down 35% so far this year -- now could be a great time to reorganize your portfolio while some quality cloud companies are trading on the cheap.

Here are three top cloud stocks with great long-term potential that look like great buys this month.

1. Autodesk is transitioning

Autodesk (ADSK -2.08%) is a software provider for the architecture, engineering, construction, and media industries. Founded in 1982, the company has been making the transition over the last decade to a cloud-based subscription model.

For example, Fusion 360 is Autodesk's new manufacturing and mechanical engineering cloud platform that is disrupting the traditional computer-aided design and manufacturing market. The service has 205,000 paying subscribers, up from less than 100,000 two years ago. Management has said it is looking to reorganize all of its software programs to the Fusion 360 model -- cloud-based annual subscriptions.

With a long runway ahead in the transition to cloud-based subscription products, Autodesk looks set to grow its revenue at a high rate for years to come. At a market cap of $43.9 billion, the stock trades at a forward price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio of 21.5 based on the midpoint of its guidance. P/FCF is the best metric to use to evaluate Autodesk stock because of all the deferred revenue that gets lost when looking at its GAAP (unadjusted) earnings numbers. Deferred revenue is revenue received for products or services to be delivered in the future.

The current P/FCF multiple is a reasonable price to pay for a company with as much growth potential as Autodesk and is right around the market's long-term average.

2. Amazon is dominating

Second on my list is cloud pioneer and leader Amazon (AMZN -5.00%). Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division is massive and has created a ton of value for Amazon shareholders over the past decade.

In the most recent quarter, AWS did $19.7 billion in sales, which equates to an annual run rate of $78.8 billion. With operating margin close to 30% (depending on the quarter), the division looks to be on pace to generate close to $24 billion in operating income for Amazon this year. And the party looks to be just getting started as estimates expect the cloud infrastructure market to grow at a 15% to 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028.

With high profit margins, AWS growth could be extremely lucrative for Amazon shareholders, making it worth buying even with the stock trading at a trailing P/FCF of 240.

If you want to own the leading infrastructure provider for the cloud software market, keep things simple and buy shares of Amazon.

3. Zoom Video Communications is expanding what it offers

Last on my list is a stock that soared during the early days of the pandemic: Zoom Video Communications (ZM -3.26%). Shares of the company jumped in 2020 with the work-from-home boom, but are down 71% in the past year. However, the video conferencing business still looks to be in a healthy place.

Last quarter, revenue grew 8% year over year to $1.1 billion. Under the hood, some of its other segments are growing even faster. Revenue from its ""enterprise"" customers -- the ones that have ""been engaged by either Zoom’s direct sales team, channel partners or independent software vendor partners"" -- was up 27% year over year to $599 million, which was 54% of total revenue.

This highly reliable revenue will be important for Zoom's growth going forward as it tries to land larger companies and get them to switch away from Microsoft or Cisco products.

Zoom is succeeding by expanding outside of just video conferencing software. Zoom Phone has grown the number of accounts with more than 10,000 users by over 100% in the past year and it now has 4 million seats. While still a small part of Zoom's business, this enterprise phone product should be an easy upsell to existing customers as it tries to disrupt legacy communication systems within the business world.

This fiscal year, Zoom is guiding for $4.39 billion in revenue and $1.45 billion in adjusted operating income at the midpoint of its guidance. Adjusted operating income is the best metric for evaluating the true earnings power of Zoom's business because it excludes one-time and non-cash expenses. With a market cap of $24 billion, that gives the stock a forward price-to-operating income (P/OI) ratio of 16.6, which is below the market average. If you believe Zoom can continue growing its enterprise customer base and expand its phone offering, now could be a great time to buy the cloud communications stock on the cheap.",cloud computing,motley fool
311,2 Stock-Split Growth Stocks Down 32% and 81% That Billionaires Are Buying,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/701644/investor-10.jpg,22/09/2022,Hedge fund managers were piling into these beaten-down stocks in the second quarter.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/2-stock-split-stocks-down-billionaires-buying/,"Despite macroeconomic headwinds that dragged the broader markets down into bear market territory in 2022 (and many individual stocks down even further), some investors still found reasons to be optimistic. For instance, shareholders in several popular companies saw their shares grow exponentially through stock splits this year. While stock splits have no actual impact on the intrinsic value of a business, they can give share prices a boost by making a stock affordable to a wider range of potential investors.

Another reason for optimism is that some great companies saw stock price drops that made those stocks bargains. That attracted long-term investors with available cash to begin buying up stock selectively. Select hedge fund managers got in on this act in the second quarter.

Chris Hohn of TCI Fund Management added to his firm's position in Alphabet (GOOG -2.54%) (GOOGL -2.52%), a company that completed a 20-for-1 stock split in July. And Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies started a position for his firm in Shopify (SHOP -0.69%), a company that completed a 10-for-1 split in June. Both Hohn and Simons have a place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, so they know a thing or two about building wealth.

Alphabet and Shopify stocks currently trade 32% and 81% off their highs, respectively. Is it time to follow the leads of these hedge fund managers and buy these two stock-split stocks?

1. Alphabet: The parent of Google

Alphabet's Google is the third most-valuable brand in the world, according to Brand Finance. That advantage stems primarily from expertise in search algorithms -- Google holds 92% market share among search engines -- but it also comes from the popularity of its streaming video platform YouTube and cloud productivity suite Google Workspace.

Google has parlayed the popularity of those platforms into a dominant position in the digital advertising market. It captured nearly 29% of digital ad spend last year, and despite mounting competition from the likes of Amazon, Google will still hold more than 27% market share by 2023, according to eMarketer. For context, digital ad spend is expected to grow at 11% per year to reach $876 billion by 2026.

Alphabet is also gaining momentum in cloud computing, due in large part to its leadership in the data cloud market. Google Cloud revenue climbed 36% in the second quarter, and it captured 10% of cloud infrastructure spend worldwide, up from 8% market share in the first quarter. That's particularly exciting because Grand View Research estimates that cloud computing spend will grow at 15.7% annually to surpass $1.5 trillion by 2030.

Fueled by its strong position in two large markets, Alphabet has consistently delivered solid financial results. Over the past year, revenue soared 26% to $278.1 billion, and free cash flow (FCF) climbed 11% to $65.2 billion.

Alphabet has several innovations in the works, many of which could reinforce its dominance in the search market. For instance, the company recently debuted Multisearch, a feature that allows search with both text and images at the same time.

And Google is leaning into its ability to facilitate commerce through a recent partnership with Shopify, which allows creators to connect digital storefronts to YouTube. Google will also allow merchants to submit 3D product images in the near future, making it easier for consumers to visualize those products directly from Google Search.

Currently, shares trade at 5.1 times sales, a discount compared to the three-year average of 6.8. Given Alphabet's solid execution and enormous market opportunity, now is indeed a good time to buy this stock-split company.

2. Shopify: The retail operating system for over 2 million businesses

Shopify makes it easy for merchants to run an omnichannel business. Its software connects physical and digital storefronts -- including online marketplaces, social media networks, and direct-to-consumer (D2C) websites -- allowing merchants to manage sales from a single platform. Shopify also provides services like payment processing and financing, and it's building a fulfillment network across the U.S. that will simplify logistics for merchants and enable two-day delivery for consumers.

The company is a comprehensive tool kit for commerce, and that value proposition has brought more than 2 million merchants to its platform. Shopify is the most popular e-commerce software vendor as measured by market presence, according to G2 Grid, and its platform powered 10.3% of retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. last year, second only to Amazon.

That bodes well. According to eMarketer, retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. will grow at 15% per year to reach $1.6 trillion by 2025, and retail e-commerce sales worldwide will grow at nearly 11% per year to $7.4 trillion by 2025.

As a caveat, Shopify struggled with high inflation and a deceleration in online shopping in the wake of the pandemic. But it continued to gain market share in both physical and digital retail in the U.S. in the first half of 2022, and it still posted decent financial results over the past year. Revenue climbed 30% to $5 billion and FCF clocked in at $59 million. To be clear, FCF declined 88% over the past year as Shopify continued to invest in growth in spite of headwinds, but a positive figure means the business still generates enough cash to sustain those aggressive investments.

Currently, shares trade at 8.4 times sales, a serious bargain compared to the three-year average of 37.1. More broadly, Shopify is a $42 billion company with a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity, meaning this split stock could soar in the coming years. With that in mind, investors should consider buying a few shares today.",cloud computing,motley fool

Most Read from Bloomberg

Ofcom, which also oversees broadcasting, telecommunications and the postal service, said it will first look at whether the so-called hyperscale cloud providers, Amazon.com Inc’s AWS, Microsoft Corp’s Azure, Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud, might limit innovation and growth. They receive about 81% of the revenues in the UK public cloud infrastructure market, which Ofcom said is worth £15 billion ($16.85 billion).

The investigations continue a crescendo of global scrutiny into the possible dominance Silicon Valley firms have gained over a range of markets. In June the Competition and Markets Authority, Britain’s antitrust regulator, launched a separate investigation into the Google Play store over suspected anticompetitive conduct.

Ofcom said if it finds a market isn’t working as it should, it can take the matter to government, refer antitrust matters to the CMA, take enforcement action itself or accept remedies from a business. The independent regulator said it will public a final report within a year.

The calling and messaging study will look at services like Meta Platforms Inc’s WhatsApp, Apple Inc.’s FaceTime, and Zoom Video Communications Inc., and issues like whether they should be able to interact with each other more.

The smart devices investigation is to examine connected televisions and speakers and their bargaining power with those who produce content like entertainment and news.

Britain's £15bn cloud computing market is being investigated by the regulator over concerns that just three US companies dominate more than 80pc of the sector.

Ofcom is examining the dominance of US technology titans Amazon, Microsoft and Google as part of a wider study into digital communication markets.

The regulator, which is gearing up to regulate the wider internet as part of plans under the Online Safety Bill, is set to launch a market study in ""coming weeks"" that will examine the strength of competition in cloud services and barriers to new entrants into the sector.



The three big providers - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google - collectively earn around 81pc of revenues in the UK public cloud infrastructure services market, according to Ofcom.



The regulator is launching a “market study” under the Enterprise Act 2002 together with the Competition and Markets Authority.



Ofcom said: “We have engaged closely with the CMA in planning the market study, and will continue to do so during the course of the project.

“Ofcom will lead the market study, drawing on our strong expertise in communications markets and reflecting that cloud is increasingly becoming an important element of the infrastructure of the internet.""



Selina Chadha, Ofcom's director of connectivity, added: ""The way we live, work, play and do business has been transformed by digital services.



""That's why we're kick-starting a programme of work to scrutinise these digital markets, identify any competition concerns and make sure they're working well for people and businesses who rely on them.""



Ofcom is also set to launch a broader investigation over the year ahead into other digital markets that will cover services such as WhatsApp, FaceTime and Zoom, as well as scrutiny into smart speakers and connected televisions.



Professor Diane Coyle, of the University of Cambridge, suggested in May that British regulators “need to pay greater attention to how companies have used the internet and cloud computing to radically cut the cost of providing products and services to each user – potentially to the point of shutting newcomers out of the market.”



The former Competition Commission member said that economies of scale enjoyed by the largest digital services companies could make it difficult for new entrants to “overthrow the incumbents”, potentially reducing market competition and therefore driving up prices.",cloud computing,yahoo entertainment

In these settings, even a single dataset may require terabytes or petabytes of data storage. Such datasets are also challenging to work with as users may read and write data at irregular intervals and varying scales, and are often interested in performing analyses using numerous machines working in parallel.

Today we are introducing TensorStore, an open-source C++ and Python software library designed for storage and manipulation of n-dimensional data that:

TensorStore has already been used to solve key engineering challenges in scientific computing (e.g., management and processing of large datasets in neuroscience, such as peta-scale 3d electron microscopy data and “4d” videos of neuronal activity). TensorStore has also been used in the creation of large-scale machine learning models such as PaLM by addressing the problem of managing model parameters (checkpoints) during distributed training.

Familiar API for Data Access and Manipulation

TensorStore provides a simple Python API for loading and manipulating large array data. In the following example, we create a TensorStore object that represents a 56 trillion voxel 3d image of a fly brain and access a small 100x100 patch of the data as a NumPy array:

>>> import tensorstore as ts >>> import numpy as np # Create a TensorStore object to work with fly brain data. >>> dataset = ts.open({ ... 'driver': ... 'neuroglancer_precomputed', ... 'kvstore': ... 'gs://neuroglancer-janelia-flyem-hemibrain/' + ... 'v1.1/segmentation/', ... }).result() # Create a 3-d view (remove singleton 'channel' dimension): >>> dataset_3d = dataset[ts.d['channel'][0]] >>> dataset_3d.domain { ""x"": [0, 34432), ""y"": [0, 39552), ""z"": [0, 41408) } # Convert a 100x100x1 slice of the data to a numpy ndarray >>> slice = np.array(dataset_3d[15000:15100, 15000:15100, 20000])

Crucially, no actual data is accessed or stored in memory until the specific 100x100 slice is requested; hence arbitrarily large underlying datasets can be loaded and manipulated without having to store the entire dataset in memory, using indexing and manipulation syntax largely identical to standard NumPy operations. TensorStore also provides extensive support for advanced indexing features, including transforms, alignment, broadcasting, and virtual views (data type conversion, downsampling, lazily on-the-fly generated arrays).

The following example demonstrates how TensorStore can be used to create a zarr array, and how its asynchronous API enables higher throughput:

>>> import tensorstore as ts >>> import numpy as np >>> # Create a zarr array on the local filesystem >>> dataset = ts.open({ ... 'driver': 'zarr', ... 'kvstore': 'file:///tmp/my_dataset/', ... }, ... dtype=ts.uint32, ... chunk_layout=ts.ChunkLayout(chunk_shape=[256, 256, 1]), ... create=True, ... shape=[5000, 6000, 7000]).result() >>> # Create two numpy arrays with example data to write. >>> a = np.arange(100*200*300, dtype=np.uint32).reshape((100, 200, 300)) >>> b = np.arange(200*300*400, dtype=np.uint32).reshape((200, 300, 400)) >>> # Initiate two asynchronous writes, to be performed concurrently. >>> future_a = dataset[1000:1100, 2000:2200, 3000:3300].write(a) >>> future_b = dataset[3000:3200, 4000:4300, 5000:5400].write(b) >>> # Wait for the asynchronous writes to complete >>> future_a.result() >>> future_b.result()

Safe and Performant Scaling

Processing and analyzing large numerical datasets requires significant computational resources. This is typically achieved through parallelization across numerous CPU or accelerator cores spread across many machines. Therefore a fundamental goal of TensorStore has been to enable parallel processing of individual datasets that is both safe (i.e., avoids corruption or inconsistencies arising from parallel access patterns) and high performance (i.e., reading and writing to TensorStore is not a bottleneck during computation). In fact, in a test within Google’s datacenters, we found nearly linear scaling of read and write performance as the number of CPUs was increased:

Read and write performance for a TensorStore dataset in zarr format residing on Google Cloud Storage (GCS) accessed concurrently using a variable number of single-core compute tasks in Google data centers. Both read and write performance scales nearly linearly with the number of compute tasks.

Performance is achieved by implementing core operations in C++, extensive use of multithreading for operations such as encoding/decoding and network I/O, and partitioning large datasets into much smaller units through chunking to enable efficiently reading and writing subsets of the entire dataset. TensorStore also provides configurable in-memory caching (which reduces slower storage system interactions for frequently accessed data) and an asynchronous API that enables a read or write operation to continue in the background while a program completes other work.

Safety of parallel operations when many machines are accessing the same dataset is achieved through the use of optimistic concurrency, which maintains compatibility with diverse underlying storage layers (including Cloud storage platforms, such as GCS, as well as local filesystems) without significantly impacting performance. TensorStore also provides strong ACID guarantees for all individual operations executing within a single runtime.

To make distributed computing with TensorStore compatible with many existing data processing workflows, we have also integrated TensorStore with parallel computing libraries such as Apache Beam (example code) and Dask (example code).

Use Case: Language Models

An exciting recent development in ML is the emergence of more advanced language models such as PaLM. These neural networks contain hundreds of billions of parameters and exhibit some surprising capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. These models also push the limits of computational infrastructure; in particular, training a language model such as PaLM requires thousands of TPUs working in parallel.

One challenge that arises during this training process is efficiently reading and writing the model parameters. Training is distributed across many separate machines, but parameters must be regularly saved to a single object (“checkpoint”) on a permanent storage system without slowing down the overall training process. Individual training jobs must also be able to read just the specific set of parameters they are concerned with in order to avoid the overhead that would be required to load the entire set of model parameters (which could be hundreds of gigabytes).

TensorStore has already been used to address these challenges. It has been applied to manage checkpoints associated with large-scale (“multipod”) models trained with JAX (code example) and has been integrated with frameworks such as T5X (code example) and Pathways. Model parallelism is used to partition the full set of parameters, which can occupy more than a terabyte of memory, over hundreds of TPUs. Checkpoints are stored in zarr format using TensorStore, with a chunk structure chosen to allow the partition for each TPU to be read and written independently in parallel.

When saving a checkpoint, each model parameter is written using TensorStore in zarr format using a chunk grid that further subdivides the grid used to partition the parameter over TPUs. The host machines write in parallel the zarr chunks for each of the partitions assigned to TPUs attached to that host. Using TensorStore's asynchronous API, training proceeds even while the data is still being written to persistent storage. When resuming from a checkpoint, each host reads only the chunks that make up the partitions assigned to that host.

Use Case: 3D Brain Mapping

The field of synapse-resolution connectomics aims to map the wiring of animal and human brains at the detailed level of individual synaptic connections. This requires imaging the brain at extremely high resolution (nanometers) over fields of view of up to millimeters or more, which yields datasets that can span petabytes in size. In the future these datasets may extend to exabytes as scientists contemplate mapping entire mouse or primate brains. However, even current datasets pose significant challenges related to storage, manipulation, and processing; in particular, even a single brain sample may require millions of gigabytes with a coordinate system (pixel space) of hundreds of thousands pixels in each dimension.

We have used TensorStore to solve computational challenges associated with large-scale connectomic datasets. Specifically, TensorStore has managed some of the largest and most widely accessed connectomic datasets, with Google Cloud Storage as the underlying object storage system. For example, it has been applied to the human cortex “h01” dataset, which is a 3d nanometer-resolution image of human brain tissue. The raw imaging data is 1.4 petabytes (roughly 500,000 * 350,000 * 5,000 pixels large, and is further associated with additional content such as 3d segmentations and annotations that reside in the same coordinate system. The raw data is subdivided into individual chunks 128x128x16 pixels large and stored in the “Neuroglancer precomputed” format, which is optimized for web-based interactive viewing and can be easily manipulated from TensorStore.

A fly brain reconstruction for which the underlying data can be easily accessed and manipulated using TensorStore.

HANGZHOU, China, Sept. 21, 2022 /CNW/ -- Alibaba Cloud, the digital technology and intelligence backbone of Alibaba Group, has announced its latest international strategic roadmap at the 2022 Alibaba Cloud Summit. During the three-day summit, the trusted cloud provider has revealed new products to support technology innovation among enterprises, an investment of USD1 billion for a global partner ecosystem upgrade, and enhanced customer services to provide comprehensive support throughout a customer's digitalization journey.

Technology innovation to power rapidly increasing cloud consumption

With more enterprises moving to the cloud and an increase in demand for cloud services in a hybrid environment, Alibaba Cloud has made available globally a series of its proven infrastructure products, a multi-model cloud-native database and distributed cloud services. This range of new products aims to provide enterprise customers with a wider scope of cloud services covering network, storage and compute.

Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN) 2.0, the newly available network services, provides global intelligent networking to support enterprises' global expansion. CEN 2.0 supports ultra-large-scale networking capabilities with higher availability, lower latency, enhanced security capability and greater flexibility in pricing options for enterprises, compared to the previous version.

Alibaba Cloud has also unveiled a storage product called ESSD Auto PL, which provides block storage services and supports automatic scaling within seconds to allow businesses to handle sudden traffic surges. As the world's leading elastic block storage product with auto-scaling function, it offers up to one million IOPS (input/output operations per second), significantly higher than the industry average.

Story continues

Lindorm, the cloud-native multi-model database developed by Alibaba Cloud, successfully supported Alibaba Group's 11.11, the world's largest shopping festival, last year. Designed for fusion-processing requirements for wide tables, time series, space-time and various unstructured data, Lindorm has also been supporting customers in various industries in China – including automotive, finance and manufacturing – thanks to its high availability and low storage cost.

Alibaba Cloud also introduced ACK One (Alibaba Cloud Distributed Cloud Container Platform), a multi-region and multi-cluster container management platform to provide a consistent management, delivery and operation experience for enterprises. It allows users to implement container cluster management, resource scheduling, data disaster recovery and application delivery through a unified platform, whether in a public cloud, private cloud or on-premise environment. ACK One is the latest addition to ACK Anywhere, Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes. Earlier this year, among the eight significant industry players evaluated, Alibaba Cloud was named a ""Leader"" in The Forrester Wave™ Public Cloud Container Platforms Q1 2022 for the first time.

Lastly, to support enterprises' need for hybrid cloud, CloudBox integrates Alibaba Cloud's public cloud infrastructure technologies such as compute, storage and network to provide enterprises with fully managed cloud services for deployment close to customers' business premises. CloudBox delivers a consistent experience as Alibaba Cloud's public cloud, while meeting enterprises' demand for on-premise data processing and low latency compute. CloudBox is designed for multinational companies with business operations in China.

Alibaba Cloud has been strengthening its capabilities in computing, storage, network and security. For example, its recently unveiled Cloud Infrastructure Processing Unit (CIPU), a dedicated processing unit designed for its Apsara Cloud operating system, can reduce network latency to as low as five microseconds and improve computing power performance in data-intensive AI and data analytics scenarios by as much as 30%.

Prioritizing partner benefits to build inclusive technology ecosystem

With its revamped ecosystem strategy, Alibaba Cloud has announced that it is committed to investing USD1 billion to support partners' technology innovation and their market expansion with Alibaba Cloud in the coming three fiscal years. This investment consists of both financial and non-financial incentives, such as funding, rebates and go-to-market initiatives.

To accelerate partners' growth, Alibaba Cloud also launched a ""Regional Accelerator"" program to provide partners operating in different markets with a localized business collaboration model. The model is designed around factors such as a market's level of technical maturity, vertical focus, digitalization needs and business demands, with an aim to boost partners' income and strengthen their technical expertise. Alibaba Cloud ecosystem partners including resellers, technology partners (ISV, SaaS and SI), service and consulting partners can benefit from the program.

""Partners have always been a key focus for Alibaba Cloud, and we are committed to providing them with strong support for our ongoing co-creation and value-add – both technologically and commercially – to further empower our joined customers,"" said Selina Yuan, Alibaba Cloud Intelligence International President. ""Our revamped partner strategy prioritizes our partners' growth. By continuing to support our partners' business expansion, we can build an inclusive ecosystem benefiting partners and customers.""

To address complications with partners' international business operations, Alibaba Cloud has also upgraded its collaboration model with its ISV partners, with a focus on enhancing industry collaboration, standardizing go-to-market process, and accelerating technical solution integration to increase efficiency. Looking ahead, Alibaba Cloud hopes to recruit more financial services, retail, internet and manufacturing ISVs to co-develop products and support customer innovation.

Alibaba Cloud currently works with about 11,000 partners worldwide, including Salesforce, VMware, Fortinet, IBM and Neo4j.

Empowering customers with comprehensive support

In order to provide all-round cloud-based solutions and services to all customers, Alibaba Cloud also launched a ""Global Delivery and Service Program"" to enhance the cloud adoption process for customers. Under the program, it has unveiled three Customer Service Centers in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Porto (Portugal), and Mexico City (Mexico), to support customers in their cloud adoption journey, providing timely and regionalized cloud migration and consulting services.

In addition to the Customer Service Centers, Alibaba Cloud has set up three Service Delivery Centers in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Dubai (United Arab Emirates) and Hong Kong (Greater China), to provide extra technology support to its regional offices and customer project delivery in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

Fueling new innovations with reliable infrastructure

During the summit, Alibaba Cloud has inked nearly 30 agreements to help customers and partners accelerate their digital innovation capabilities with leading cloud computing technologies.

In collaboration with JP Games, Japan's leading game development studio, Alibaba Cloud has unveiled a set of new services to create virtual spaces and realistic avatars for global customers venturing into the metaverse.

Together with MetaverseXR, Thailand's leading metaverse company, Alibaba Cloud rolled out a comprehensive suite of metaverse solutions for the Thai market in order to fulfill growing local demand for embarking on a Web 3.0 journey.

Alibaba Cloud also teamed up with UMG Group in Myanmar, to power the country's digital transformation – especially in traditional industries.

With BeLive and VisionTech from Singapore, Alibaba Cloud is expanding its regional outreach in the media and Fintech verticals.

Alibaba Cloud is collaborating with OnFinality, a leading New Zealand-based blockchain infrastructure provider, to offer robust cloud-computing capability and a strong global network for Web 3.0 developers looking to scale globally.

It's completely free and we guarantee you'll learn something new every day.

Earlier this summer, Mark Zuckerberg warned staff at Meta that the company would be ""turning up the heat"" on underperforming employees as it faced ""one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history.""

What he didn't reveal was the stealth-like ruthlessness of the hot new temperature. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the Facebook owner has been quietly pushing out staff through reorganizations, and even some unimpeachable talent is being let go.

A Hard Thirty Days Night

Meta staffed up big time last year as the economy, and tech stocks, boomed. The company reported 83,553 employees at the end of the second quarter, or 32% more than a year before. Google-owner Alphabet reported 174,014 employees, up over 20%.

But this year, Zuckerberg's metaverse dreams got a dose of cold, hard reality. His firm reported its first-ever drop in revenue in the second quarter, and profits fell 36%. Meta's stock price is down a staggering 51% in 2022 and the company slashed its guidance for operating expenses multiple times. It has never explicitly stated the dreaded L word -- layoffs -- but according to the WSJ's sources, fewer people are turning up to work. Meta has reportedly been mandating employees subject to reorganizations to reapply for jobs within a month. Those who can't find another internal job are terminated -- traditionally, this practice was used to weed out underperformers, but that's changed:

Employees who spoke to the WSJ said employees with stellar performance reviews have been let go, and that the moves could be a sign of more significant cuts to come. Meta reportedly wants to reduce costs by 10% within a few months, with much of that from employee cuts.

Meta isn't alone: last week, Google told half of the 100 staff at its start-up incubator Area 120 that they had 90 days to find a new job within the company. In the spring, over 1,000 Google staff petitioned management to lengthen a 60-day internal job hunting period for 100 people in the company's cloud computing division.

Pyrrhic Victory: Meta's business troubles have been a tonic for its legal team. At a hearing this week for a forthcoming US antitrust lawsuit, Meta's lawyers said its declining stock value, struggles to compete with emerging rival TikTok, and revenue losses due to privacy changes by Apple are all signs that it's not so monopolistic after all. ""Sometimes facts that are good for an antitrust defense are bad for business,"" Aaron Panner, Facebook's lawyer, told Reuters. Good look explaining that to Zuck.",cloud computing,motley fool

British media regulator Ofcom is investigating Amazon , Microsoft and Google's tight grip on the cloud computing industry. In the coming weeks, the watchdog will launch a study to examine the position of firms offering public cloud infrastructure and whether they pose any barriers to competition. Its probe, announced Thursday, will focus on so-called ""hyperscalers"" like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, which let businesses access computing power and data storage from remote servers, rather than host it on their own private infrastructure. Further action could be taken by the regulator if it finds the companies are harming competition. Selina Chadha, Ofcom's director of connectivity, said the regulator hadn't yet reached a view on whether the cloud giants are engaged in anticompetitive behavior. Ofcom said it will conclude its review and publish a final report including any concerns and proposed recommendations within the 12 months. Amazon, Microsoft and Google were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. The review will form part of a broader digital strategy push by Ofcom, which regulates the broadcasting and telecommunications industries in the U.K.

It also plans to investigate other digital markets, including personal messaging and virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa, over the next year. Ofcom said it is interested in how services including Meta's WhatsApp, Apple's Facetime and Zoom have impacted traditional calling and messaging, as well as the competitive landscape among digital assistants, connected TVs and smart speakers. ""The way we live, work, play and do business has been transformed by digital services,"" Ofcom's Chadha said in a statement Thursday. ""But as the number of platforms, devices and networks that serve up content continues to grow, so do the technological and economic issues confronting regulators."" ""That's why we're kick-starting a programme of work to scrutinise these digital markets, identify any competition concerns and make sure they're working well for people and businesses who rely on them,"" she added. Ofcom has been selected as the enforcer of strict new rules policing harmful content on the internet. But the legislation, known as the Online Safety Bill, is unlikely to come into force anytime soon after Liz Truss replaced Boris Johnson as prime minister. With Truss' government grappling with a plethora of problems in the U.K. — not least the cost-of-living crisis — it's expected that online safety regulation will move to the back of the queue of policy priorities for the government. The move adds to efforts from other regulators to rein in large tech companies over the perceived stranglehold they have on various parts of the digital economy. The Competition and Markets Authority has several active probes into Big Tech companies and wants additional powers to ensure a level playing field across digital markets. The European Commission, meanwhile, has fined Google billions of dollars over alleged antitrust offences, is investigating Apple and Amazon in separate cases, and has passed landmark digital laws that may reshape internet giants' business models.

Cloud competition

Amazon holds a comfortable lead in the cloud infrastructure services market, with its Amazon Web Services division making billions of dollars in profits every year. In 2021, AWS raked in $62.2 billion of revenue and over $18.5 billion in operating income. Microsoft's Azure is the first runner up, while Google is the third-largest player. Other firms, including IBM and China's Alibaba, also operate their own cloud arms.

The S&P 500, which is viewed as the most encompassing of the major U.S. indexes, produced its worst first-half return since 1970. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has shed as much as a third of its value, which easily pushed it into bear market territory.

But it's not all bad news. Even though things appear dire for the stock market right now, history has shown that every bear market decline and correction throughout history is a buying opportunity. When given enough time, every notable decline has eventually been cleared away by a bull market.

Of course, owning great companies helps build wealth, too. Just ask shareholders of e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN -5.00%).

$10,000 invested in Amazon on its debut day is worth a staggering amount of money today

When Amazon went public on May 15, 1997, the benchmark S&P 500 closed at 841.88. Not counting dividends, the index has since gained 360%. Inclusive of dividends, the total return of the widely followed S&P 500 jumped to 636%, as of this past weekend.

That's an average annual total return of better than 8% for the past quarter of a century. But to Amazon shareholders, it's peanuts.

Since Amazon's initial public offering (IPO) at $18 per share on May 15, 1997, the company that Jeff Bezos founded has undergone four stock splits:

A 2-for-1 split on June 2, 1998

A 3-for-1 split on Jan. 5, 1999

A 2-for-1 split on Sept. 1, 1999

A 20-for-1 split on June 3, 2022

This means the original IPO cost basis, if held for the past 25-plus years, would be just $0.075 today. It also means that patience would have paid off immensely for Amazon's original stakeholders.

If you had invested $10,000 in Amazon at its IPO price in 1997, you would have purchased 555 shares, not including commission expenses or fractional shares. Taking into account Amazon's four stock splits, these 555 shares would have multiplied into 133,200 shares, as of today.

With Amazon ending the previous week at $123.53, it means a $10,000 investment a little over 25 years ago would now be worth (get this...) $16,454,196. For those of you keeping score at home, we're talking about an aggregate return of 164,607%, or an average annual return of around 34% for a quarter of a century.

Here's why Amazon has been so dominant for so long

How, exactly, does a company rise from relative obscurity to become one of the largest stocks in the world by market cap? The answer is Amazon's leading online marketplace.

The evolution of Amazon's platform beyond just selling books in 1998 really set the stage for its popularity today. According to a March report from eMarketer, Amazon is on pace to bring in about $0.40 of every $1 in U.S. online retail sales this year.

For some context, that's many multiples higher than the next-closest competitor and 8 percentage points of market share more than No. 2 through No. 15 in the U.S. online retail space, combined! Amazon has effectively established itself as the go-to platform for online purchases.

Of course, Amazon's marketplace has fueled numerous other avenues of growth. As of April 2021, the popularity of the company's marketplace had helped it sign up more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. Prime members are paying $139 annually or $14.99 monthly for a variety of perks that include free/faster shipping and access to exclusive streaming content. It's worth mentioning that Amazon is the exclusive content provider of Thursday Night Football beginning this season, which could be an impetus to signing up even more Prime members.

Another factor that's made Amazon unstoppable is its willingness to reinvest in its business. While most Wall Street analysts preach the importance of profitability when analyzing publicly traded companies, Amazon has made a habit of shunning near-term profits in favor of reinvesting its operating cash flow. The company's robust cash flow has allowed it to expand its logistics network, grow its content library, and invest in high-growth initiatives.

Lastly, cloud infrastructure-service segment Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been pivotal to the company's success in recent years. AWS accounted for an estimated 31% of worldwide cloud-service spending in the second quarter, according to a recent report by Canalys. More importantly, cloud growth is still in the very early stages. If AWS was a separate entity, it would likely be the most valuable cloud-computing company in the world.

With economic headwinds mounting, is Amazon still worth buying?

Taking a trip down memory lane and wondering ""what if?"" can be fun. What hasn't been fun is Amazon's year-to-date performance -- a 26% decline.

The most obvious issue for Amazon is the weakening U.S. economy, which started 2022 with back-to-back quarterly declines in gross domestic product. Although retail sales data has remained resilient, largely due to historically high inflation, history would suggest that Amazon's leading online marketplace is poised to struggle in the coming quarters.

To add to the above, high inflation tends to have its biggest negative impact on the lowest-earning decile of consumers. This probably means reduced buying activity on Amazon's online marketplace. We're already seeing evidence of these struggles, with Amazon's non-AWS operations producing an unsightly $5.2 billion operating loss through the first six months of the year.

But even though Amazon generates the bulk of its sales from its online marketplace, weakness in this segment will have a relatively small impact on the company's cash flow generation. That's because online retail sales often produce razor-thin margins. What really matters for Amazon is that the needle is moving higher for its three ancillary segments with higher margins: subscription services, advertising, and AWS.

Subscription services and advertising services are each generating approximately $35 billion in annual run-rate revenue, and the margins associated with both segments are considerably higher than online retail sales. As for AWS, it accounts for roughly a sixth of Amazon's net sales yet has consistently brought in over half of the company's operating income. With these three operating segments chugging along, Amazon could potentially triple its operating cash flow by the end of 2025, even if its online marketplace stagnates.

Historically, operating cash flow has been the best measure of ""value"" when analyzing Amazon. Throughout the 2010s, investors comfortably paid a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow.

But if Amazon is successful in tripling its operating cash flow by mid-decade, then investors have the opportunity to buy it at just below nine times Wall Street's estimated future (2025) cash flow. In other words, even with economic headwinds mounting, Amazon remains as compelling as ever from an investment perspective.",cloud computing,motley fool

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Wiliot, the Internet of Things pioneer whose IoT platform is enabling trillions of ""things"" to gain intelligence, will premier its breakthrough ambient computing technology – the Wiliot IoT Pixel – to the telecommunications industry at MWC 2022 from September 28 through September 30 at Wiliot Booth #W2.1138.

Wiliot, along with other IoT and telecommunications leaders, are creating a new, fully scaled Massive IoT, or internet of trillions of things, that will leverage ambient computing to connect nearly everything to the internet. Doing so will address some of the world's biggest problems across supply chain efficiency, food & drug safety, and planetary sustainability.

At MWC 2022 Wiliot will forecast the future of an ambient-powered, 6G-enabled Massive IoT in a presentation titled ""6G Ambient Computing Intro: Antidote to Supply Chain & Climate Crises?"", which will be delivered with ABI Research and other key 6G and IoT leaders.

""While 5G tracked cars, appliances, and shipping containers, 6G will track everything in those cars, appliances, and shipping containers – evolving from an Internet of Expensive Things to an Internet of Trillions of Things, or Massive IoT,"" stated Steve Statler, SVP at Wiliot. ""The arrival of 6G represents a seminal moment for both the IoT and telecommunications industry, as the latest technologies, standards, and use cases converge to create a new economic order, rising to meet the challenges of supply chain disruption, omnichannel retail, and the threat to the planet.""

The inclusion of ambient computing within 6G opens the opportunity for wireless carriers to expand beyond services for a few billion mobile devices to include the trillions of things that mobile devices can connect to, creating a Massive IoT. 6G can provide the standards that will open up more competition, more interoperability, and remove the last elements of friction that will allow billions of wireless-enabled devices to talk directly to trillions of packages, clothes, tools, food, and medicine containers.

Story continues

Wiliot is helping create this 6G Massive IoT through a fundamental breakthrough in ambient computing technology featured in its IoT Pixels, which are stamp-sized computer stickers that cost pennies, attach to any product or packaging, and power themselves using recycled ambient energy waves. Wiliot has designed and manufactured its new IoT Pixel stickers with computing power, long range communication, and out-of-air energy that deliver pre-standard service to customers.

Once attached, and connected to the Wiliot Cloud, companies are equipped with real-time, item-level visibility into every product within their supply chains, which has a profound impact on both profits and the planet.

Vaccines are more effective because they maintain their proper temperature throughout the cold chain; produce stays fresher longer, reducing the amount wasted due to rot and spoil; delivery routes are more efficient, requiring less fuel and emitting lower greenhouse gas; stock-checks transition from daily to real-time, resulting in supply chains with lower carbon footprints; and so much more.

""It's going to take trillions of connections to solve the world's biggest challenges,"" continued Statler. ""Every single thing in our global supply chain – veggies and vaccines, crates and skates, airplane parts and toy airplanes – all connected to the internet and transmitting real-time, item-level information about their location, temperate, fill rate, carbon footprint, and more. This is the IoT we've long been promised and now, thanks to breakthroughs in ambient computing, we're finally positioned to unlock its full potential.""

Wiliot is backed by many of the telecommunications industry's leading players, including Verizon, NTT Docomo, Samsung, and Qualcomm. At MWC 2022, Wiliot will be presenting alongside ABI Research, who will be previewing their market-sizing for the future of 6G Massive IoT and forecasting specific use cases across industries.

""ABI Research has for years been a leader in its focus on IoT and the wireless standards that enable,"" said Dominique Bonte, Vice President, Verticals/End Markets ABI Research. ""We are excited to offer one of the first insights into 6G Ambient IoT and the opportunity it offers to bring together the telecommunications industry, with the CPG, food and pharma industries, to unlock the full power of the internet as it connects whole new categories of products to the cloud. This represents an expansion of the addressable market for telecommunications that dwarfs what we see today.""

These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering the requirement for computer storage products. This is favoring the prospects of prominent industry players like Pure Storage PSTG, Teradata TDC and Super Micro Computer SMCI. Democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G is likely to act as a tailwind for the industry participants. Rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices. However, negative impacts stemming from the pandemic-triggered supply chain disruptions and component shortages are a concern in the near term.

Industry Description

The Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry comprises companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). These drives are utilized in PCs, laptops, mobiles, servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, video game consoles, digital video recorders and other consumer electronic devices. A few industry participants, including Pure Storage, provide software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers. Many industry players offer high-performance modular memory subsystems, mount and blade server systems, enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services. Some industry participants also provide purpose-built servers for storing and accessing data over a shared network or the Internet.

4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Computer - Storage Industry

New Normal Trends & Rapid Implementation of 5G Opening New Business Avenues: Coronavirus-induced work-from-home and hybrid work models have triggered demand for data-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. Effective storage is essential for harnessing data and is expected to raise demand for high-storage capable SSDs and internal memory in advanced smartphones. Accelerated deployment of 5G and rebound in the smartphone market are likely to propel the industry to newer heights. Extensive implementation of cloud computing solutions, increased Internet usage and rapidly-growing media and regulatory compliance, driven by coronavirus-led work-from-home setup, have led to data explosion for enterprises, which bodes well for the industry participants.



Innovation in Cloud Storage Technologies to Drive Adoption: Extensive storage options from collocated hardware (such as hard disks and tape drives) to many cloud storage solutions has put the industry on a growth trajectory. The industry players are well poised for growth on the back of a rapid increase in the amount of data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals. The companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions. To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is amassed from IoT, the companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is a positive for industry players.



Relative Slowdown in IT Spending A Concern: Per a Gartner report, worldwide IT spending is expected to increase 3% in 2022 compared with 2021 levels and reach $4.5 trillion. Higher technology spending will drive the upside as enterprises continue to build sound technological infrastructure. However, the geopolitical disruptions, inflationary pressures and protracted pandemic-induced supply chain troubles remain major concerns. Also, consumer spending cuts on the purchase of PCs, tablets and printers are likely to bring down the IT spending growth to much less than the 10.2% spurt witnessed in 2021, added Gartner.



Slowing Momentum in PC Shipments Might Hinder Growth Prospects: Worldwide PC shipments dropped 12.6% to 72 million units in the second quarter of 2022, according to the data compiled by Gartner. The latest Gartner report depicts the end of the massive spike in PC demand due to the pandemic-led work-from-home and online learning wave. In the second quarter, sales were affected by the Ukraine war, inflationary pressure and a decline in the sale of Chromebooks, added Gartner. A slowing PC market does not augur well for the industry participants.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects

The Zacks Computer Storage is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #22, which places it in the top 9% of more than 251 Zacks industries.



The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.



The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 22, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Jamf (NASDAQ: JAMF) announced that it is working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create a streamlined and powerful workflow to manage and provide an added layer of security to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Mac instances at scale. This workflow allows organizations to provide managed, trusted access to their macOS workloads on AWS. Software engineering, security, and creative teams can all use ephemeral macOS environments on AWS, managed and secured by Jamf. This can provide unprecedented ease for organizations to scale macOS resources far and wide.



“The relationship between AWS and Jamf brings the power of AWS to the leading Apple Enterprise Management framework, providing real value at scale to organizations across many internal workgroups,” said Dean Hager, CEO, Jamf. “We’re excited to continue to push the envelope on what’s possible with cloud-first technologies centered around the Apple platform.”

Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity

Amazon EC2 Mac instances allow customers to run on-demand macOS workloads on the cloud, extending the flexibility, scalability, and cost benefits of AWS to all Apple developers. With Amazon EC2 Mac instances, developers creating apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Safari can provision and access macOS environments within seconds, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from pay-as-you-go pricing. Customers can seamlessly provision and access macOS compute environments to enjoy convenient, distributed testing and fast app builds, bringing additional choice to developers so they can use Mac as their trusted platform, on-premises or on the cloud. Customers can also consolidate development of cross-platform Apple, Windows, and Android apps on AWS, leading to increased developer productivity and accelerated time to market.



AWS offers organizations the flexibility of choosing Intel or Apple-design M1 system on a chip (SoC) with its Amazon EC2 virtualized machines. Mac developers re-architecting apps to natively support Macs with Apple silicon may now build and test apps and take advantage of all the benefits of AWS. Developers building for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV will also benefit from faster builds, and be able to launch and connect to as many or as few virtual Macs as needed to scale up or down to handle changes in business or build requirements.



""As a service provider managing tens of thousands of Macs across our enterprise customers, we understand the value that Jamf provides. It enables us to ensure the security, management, and seamless onboarding of Apple devices into our platform of services,” said James Ridsdale, founder of dataJAR. “Our employees love using Mac and we are seeing a significant increase in Apple device adoption across our customer base. Jamf allows us to manage this scale efficiently. We are excited to see Jamf’s work with AWS to continue to provide more options for organizations who are looking to adopt a range of computing options for their employees, contractors, and engineering workflows through the management of Amazon EC2 Mac virtualized instances. We think this will be a compelling solution for many types of customers.”

Jamf helps IT and security teams manage and secure these new machines

An organization needs to ensure that its virtual machines are as secure as their physical machines. Leveraging the power of Apple and AWS, Jamf has taken the concept of zero-touch-deployment further than before. Amazon EC2 infrastructure is built on Mac Mini’s in secure data centers. Now through Jamf’s leading management and security solutions, organizations can now provide trusted access to virtual Macs in the same manner they do physical Macs, which provides flexible resource allocation to organizations that rely on Mac for critical components of their business.

“We are proud to work with Jamf to help organizations succeed with Apple,” said David Brown, vice president of Amazon EC2 at AWS. “Now AWS, in conjunction with Jamf, is able to power a holistic, cloud-first Apple Enterprise Management experience, ensuring a high level of product availability, quick and convenient software distribution to all endpoints, and the perfect environment to spin up and manage dynamic native Amazon EC2 resources on Apple for a multitude of organizational needs.”



This custom workflow is available for AWS and Jamf customers today.

Enterprises are combining cloud-to-edge solutions to connect complex environments and deliver results never before imagined. In the past eight years, Azure IoT has seen significant growth across many industry sectors, including manufacturing, energy, consumer goods, transportation, healthcare, and retail. It has played a leading role in helping customers achieve better efficiency, agility, and sustainability outcomes. In 2021, Gartner positioned Microsoft as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Industrial IoT Platforms for the second year in a row. And Frost and Sullivan named the platform the Global IoT platform of the year. As computing becomes more distributed and embedded, this is a huge opportunity to unite IoT, Edge, and Hybrid, continuing our forward momentum while doubling down on our investments to date.

Companies commit to IoT to be future-ready

With the pandemic, economic changes, and rise of remote work, C-suite and IT leaders have had to rethink what it means for their organization to be “future-ready.” Here are a few Azure IoT customer stories and the solutions they have deployed to solve critical business challenges.

Manufacturing companies like Inventec, a Taiwan-based electronics company, combined 5G, AI, and IoT to create scalable smart factories which were so successful that the company began selling the solution to other manufacturing companies.

338,NVIDIA partners with Broad Institute to make cloud platform available for life science research,https://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/hitn/files/Broad%20Institute-HITN_1.png,22/09/2022,"Working with Harvard and MIT, the company will help academic medical and pharma researchers build machine learning models for troves of healthcare data on the Terra cloud platform, advancing precision medicine.",https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/nvidia-partners-broad-institute-make-cloud-platform-available-life-science-research,"NVIDIA announced this week a new partnership with Harvard and MIT's Broad Institute, bringing advanced analytics tools to the institute's Terra cloud platform and the more than 25,000 life science researchers who use it.

WHY IT MATTERS

By connecting NVIDIA's computing and artificial intelligence tools with Broad Institute scientists, the open platform can help advance biomedical research, genomics and other precision medicine innovations. The aim is to help academic researchers – as well as startups and large pharma companies – gain the AI-enabled computing power to mine large amounts of healthcare data.

The initial focus will be on several key areas, according to the company, starting with Parabricks, a GPU-accelerated software suite for secondary analysis of sequencing data. NVIDIA says it's making it available in six new Terra workflows, enabling researchers to analyze a whole genome in a bit more than an hour, compared to 24 hours in a CPU-based environment. This, in turn, can reduce computing costs significantly.

Another focus will be building large language models, helping researchers develop foundational models for DNA and RNA to better understand human biology. They can use NVIDIA's BioNeMo technology, a just-unveiled AI application framework designed for LLMs.

NVIDIA is also working on a new deep learning model for the Broad Institute's Genome Analysis Toolkit, which is used by more than 100,000 researchers. It can help spot and identify genetic variants associated with disease, advancing drug discovery research and development of new treatments.

Broad Institute researchers will also gain access to MONAI, a medical imaging-focused deep learning framework, and NVIDIA RAPIDS, a toolkit that can enable faster data preparation for genomic single-cell analysis.

THE LARGER TREND

The Broad Institute is working to innovate biomedical and precision medicine, building out its open cloud platform to connect researchers with each other and give them datasets and powerful AI tools to analyze genomic and other life sciences data for scientific breakthroughs.

It's doing this with several technology partnerships like the one with NVIDIA. In 2021, for instance, it launched a new collaboration with Microsoft and Verily to accelerate new advancements in biomedicine through the Terra platform.

But the MIT-Harvard joint research venture has been generous with its own technology innovations as well. In 2017, the Broad Institute made its GATK genomic analytics software open source in order to make it available to more science researchers.

ON THE RECORD

""There's a need across the healthcare ecosystem for better computational tools to enable breakthroughs in the way we understand disease, develop diagnostics and deliver treatments,"" said Kimberly Powell, NVIDIA's vice president of healthcare, in a statement.

""By expanding our collaboration with the Broad Institute, we can bring the power of large language models to ultimately deliver joint solutions and narrow the divide between insights from researchers and real benefits for patients.""

""Life sciences are in the midst of a data revolution, and researchers are in critical need of a new approach to bring machine learning into biomedicine,"" added Broad Institute Chief Data Scientist Anthony Philippakis. ""In this collaboration, we aim to expand our mission of data sharing and collaborative processes to scale genomics research.""

345,Python⇒Speed: Find slow data processing tasks (before your customers do),https://pythonspeed.com/assets/titles/slow-data-analysis-tasks.png,23/09/2022,"Your data processing jobs are fast… most of the time. Next, find the slow runs so you can speed them up.",https://pythonspeed.com/articles/slow-data-analysis-tasks/,"Here are some of the ways you can discover your data processing jobs are too slow:

Jobs start getting killed when they hit timeouts. Customers start complaining about slow or failed jobs. Your cloud computing bill is twice what it was last month.

While these notification mechanisms do work, it’s probably best not to rely on them. Life is easier when jobs finish successfully, customers are happy, and you have plenty of money left over in your budget.

That means you want to identify unexpected slowness or high memory usage before the situation get that bad. The sooner you can identify performance problems, the sooner you can fix them.

So how can you identify inefficient tasks in your data pipeline or workflow? Let’s find out!

From “always slow” to “sometimes slow”

We’ll be focusing on data processing tasks, often running as part of a larger workflow or pipeline; this includes data science, scientific computing, and data analysis. Each job’s runtime has a particular structure:

Load some data as the input. Process or analyze the input in some way, creating an output. Store the resulting output, after which the job or task is finished.

When you first start implementing these sort of long-running tasks, you can reasonably assume that your code is inefficient. So to begin with, you can profile jobs at random, ideally in production, and use the profiling results to identify places where your code is too slow, or using too much memory. You fix the bottlenecks, measure again, and iterate until eventually you’ve created a sufficiently efficient baseline.

This is where the situation get more complex.

At this point most jobs are fast, but occasionally they’re slow. Perhaps because of environmental reasons, perhaps because different inputs give different behavior. Whatever the cause, the first step to fixing the underlying problem is identifying the specific jobs that are outliers: the jobs that are running more slowly than expected.

How do you identify these slow outliers? One approach is to use logging, something you probably want to do anyway to help with debugging and diagnostics.

Modeling performance and identifying outliers with logging

We can use logging to fix performance problems using a four step process:

Add logging to your program, ideally tracing-based logging. Use logged information to build a model of your jobs’ speed. The model can then help you identify outliers. Inspect the outliers to identify and fix the problem.

Step 1. Add logging, which is necessary but not sufficient

To see how logging can be useful in identifying excessively slow tasks, I’m going to use trace-based logging, tracing for short, a superior form of logging. Specifically I’ll be using the OpenTelemetry standard, supported by many services and tools, and I’ll use the Honeycomb observability platform to visualize the data where possible. In practice you can use other services and/or normal logging and still get similar results, with differing degrees of difficulty.

Note: Honeycomb is pretty nice, but this use case is not its main focus. If you have suggestions for tracing observability services that are better designed for data processing jobs, let me know!

Let’s start with an example, a program that loads in a text file, filters out some words we don’t care about, and then writes out the words to a JSON file:

import sys import json def to_words ( text ): return [ word . lower () for word in text . strip (). split ()] def load_filter_words ( filterwords_path ): with open ( filterwords_path ) as f : return to_words ( f . read ()) def remove_filter_words ( filter_words , countwords_path ): result = [] with open ( countwords_path ) as f : for line in f : for word in to_words ( line ): if word not in filter_words : result . append ( word ) return result def main ( filterwords_path , countwords_path , output_path ): filter_words = load_filter_words ( filterwords_path ) result = remove_filter_words ( filter_words , countwords_path ) with open ( output_path , ""w"" ) as f : json . dump ( result , f ) if __name__ == ""__main__"" : main ( sys . argv [ 1 ], sys . argv [ 2 ], sys . argv [ 3 ])

Next, let’s add some tracing with OpenTelemetry. Unlike normal logging which is a series of isolated events, OpenTelemetry traces execution using spans which have a beginning and end. Spans can have child spans, forming a tree of spans, and spans can have attached attributes. In the OpenTelemetry API, spans can be added using decorators, or with context managers:

@ tracer . start_as_current_span ( ""myspan"" ) def f (): # ... def g (): with tracer . start_as_current_span ( ""myspan2"" ): # ...

Each span is automatically nested within a parent span if it’s called inside its context.

In the following example, notice how the different steps of the task—loading, processing, and outputting data—each get their own span. We also make sure to record the input file size and the number of filter words as attributes.

# ... from opentelemetry import trace from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import ( OTLPSpanExporter , ) from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor TRACER = trace . get_tracer ( ""example"" ) # ... @ TRACER . start_as_current_span ( ""load_data"" ) def load_filter_words ( filterwords_path ): # ... @ TRACER . start_as_current_span ( ""process_data"" ) def remove_filter_words ( filter_words , countwords_path ): # ... def main ( filterwords_path , countwords_path , output_path ): # Initialize tracing: provider = TracerProvider () processor = BatchSpanProcessor ( OTLPSpanExporter ()) provider . add_span_processor ( processor ) trace . set_tracer_provider ( provider ) with TRACER . start_as_current_span ( ""main"" ) as span : span . set_attribute ( ""input_size"" , os . path . getsize ( countwords_path ) ) filter_words = load_filter_words ( filterwords_path ) span . set_attribute ( ""filter_words_count"" , len ( filter_words ) ) result = remove_filter_words ( filter_words , countwords_path ) with TRACER . start_as_current_span ( ""output_data"" ): with open ( output_path , ""w"" ) as f : json . dump ( result , f ) # ...

Now we can set a few environment variables, and when we run the task the trace info will get sent to Honeycomb:

$ python v2-with-tracing.py short-filter.txt middlemarch.txt output.json

Here’s an example of the resulting tree of spans for a single run, shown in the Honeycomb UI; we can see that in this example processing the data took the bulk of the time, followed by loading the data:

For each span, we have a number of attributes; those we explicitly recorded, but also some standard ones, including how long the span took to run: duration_ms . By doing a query on HEATMAP(duration_ms) for spans whose name is ""main"" (i.e. the top-level span), we can see that different tasks took different amounts of time (the Y axis). The X axis is when the task started.

Since we want to find slow outliers, we want to focus on those tasks that are higher on the Y axis. For example, there’s a task took 700ms, compared to the much faster tasks below which only took up to 150ms. But is this 700ms task really an outlier?

The difficulty is that the run time is partially determined by input size. In our example, as is often the case, the larger input size, the longer the run time. If you have a smaller input, the task will run faster.

Here’s AVG(duration_ms) for ""main"" spans, grouped by input size; you can see that the larger the input size, the longer the span’s duration:

Sometimes you might consider that these slower tasks still count as outliers, in which case you can move on to step 4, fixing the problem. But running more slowly on larger output is often expected, normal behavior. That means you want a way to find outliers that takes the input size into account.

Step 2. Modeling expected run time based on input size

Since we’re logging input size, we can come up with a simplistic model:

The more words in our text document, the longer we expect it to run. We’re logging file size, which isn’t quite the same as number of words, but is highly correlated. It seems likely, both from our understanding of the code and from eyeballing the table above, that run time will be linear with number of words or file size. Therefore, we expect duration_ms / input_size to be fairly constant; anything with a much higher ratio is an outlier.

Honeycomb allows you add “Derived Columns”, basically calculating a new attribute from existing attributes. In this case, we can add a column called duration_to_input , defined as DIV($duration_ms, $input_size) .

Now if we build a table comparing AVG(duration_to_input) against input_size :

At this point input size is not the reason duration_to_input varies, and the range of values is much smaller: the biggest value is only 1.5× the smallest value, whereas previously we were seeing two orders of magnitude of range. So this seems like a reasonable model of performance; not perfect, but that’s OK.

Since tiny numbers are harder to read, we can try to normalize them a bit, by dividing by the average value of 0.000075 . We’ll change the formula to duration_ms / (input_size * 0.000075) , or DIV($duration_ms, MUL($INPUT_SIZE, 0.000075)) in Honeycomb’s system.

Note: If you want to do this a bit more systemically, you can use SciPy to build a more mathematically accurate model. To get the raw data, Honeycomb lets you download query results as CSV.

Step 3. Identifying outliers

At this point we can say that if duration_to_input is around 0.7-1.3, we’re dealing with a normal result. If the values gets significantly higher, let’s say 1.5 or higher, we can consider than an outlier.

Let’s look at an example.

$ python v2-with-tracing.py long-filter.txt romanempire.txt output.json

If we look at Honeycomb, specifically at AVG(duration_to_input) grouped by trace.trace_id , so we can see individual runs, we see that this run is much slower. And critically, it’s much slower even after adjusting for input size:

The new run had a ratio of 1.77, far above any other job. We’ve found an outlier!

Of course, manual queries aren’t the best way to find outliers. Once you’re comfortable with the model and have a sense of what a normal range is, you probably want to be automatically notified whenever outliers occur. Honeycomb has a feature called “Triggers” that will notify you when certain criteria are met; other tools should have similar functionality.

Step 4. Fixing bugs found via outliers and/or adjusting the model

A bit more investigation using Honeycomb’s UI (using the BubbleUp tool to compare outliers to baseline, or just reading the trace attributes) shows that this outlier has a different number of words to filter out. Previously we were using 30 words ( short-filter.txt ), this time we used 174 words ( long-filter.txt ).

It seems that performance is tied not just to number of words in the text document being filtered, as we first assumed, but also to the number of filter words.

Is this a performance bug, or should we just adjust our model to take into account the number of filter words? In this case, it’s probably a bug. Checking whether a string is contained in a set of other strings should be a fast, fairly constant O(1) operation if we were using a dictionary or set.

And that suggests the cause of the bug: we’re using a list for filter_words , so every word lookup is O(N) instead of O(1) . That’s easy to fix, and while I won’t show that here, the result is that everything starts running faster.

Once we implement the fix, all the jobs will run faster, so we will need to tweak the duration_to_input model. But rather than making the model more complex, we just need to tweak it with a different constant, to take into account the faster baseline performance.

In other cases the fix may be less systemic, and the same performance model can continue unchanged.

Diagnosing performance problems with profiling

In this case, the code is short enough that the source code plus tracing info is sufficient to identify the problem. In real world code, it’s often far more difficult. This is where profiling comes in handy, as a complement to the information you get from logging: you really want to have profiling on by default in production.

Given continuous profiling in production, whenever you identify a slow identifier you will have immediate access to profiling information. For example, the Sciagraph performance observability SaaS is designed specifically for Python data processing tasks. Here’s what it shows for this run:

It points you directly at if word not in filter_words: as the line where most of the time is spent.

Identifying memory usage outliers

So far we’ve been modeling performance runtime. But you might also want to identify jobs that are using too much memory, which can result in swapping, or being killed by the Linux out-of-memory killer. And that means customer complaints, failed jobs, and potentially high cloud costs.

To support finding outliers with high memory usage, we basically follow the exact same process, except that instead of using duration_ms or some other measure of elapsed time, we need to use a measure of memory usage. There are two basic ways you can measure memory, but either way we want peak memory, since that is the bottleneck in terms of hardware resources.

Option 1: Peak resident memory (RSS)

Peak resident memory is obtainable use the Python resource module; you can then add it as an attribute to the top-level span:

from resource import getrusage , RUSAGE_SELF with TRACER . start_as_current_span ( ""main"" ): # ... max_rss = getrusage ( RUSAGE_SELF ). ru_maxrss span . add_attribute ( ""max_rss"" , max_rss )

However, as explained in more detail elsewhere, this measure is limited by available RAM, and can’t get higher. If you only have 8GB of RAM on your machine, you will never see more than 8GB; a program trying to allocate 8GB, 16GB or 32GB will report the same max resident memory, which can be misleading.

Option 2: Peak allocated memory

Alternatively, you can measure the peak amount of memory requested by the program. This also has issues, for example mmap() is only allocated lazily and so it’s unclear whether it should be counted or not until its dirty. On the other hand, this will tell you how much the program actually asked for, regardless of available RAM.

In addition to performance profiling, Sciagraph will also profile your job’s allocated memory usage, in production. And it comes with an OpenTelemetry integration that ensures the the peak allocated memory size also gets recorded in your logging/tracing system.

Alternatively, if you’re doing offline profiling you can use Fil or Memray for allocated memory profiling, but they’re not designed to be on-by-default in production.

You need logging!

As we said at the start of the article, you want happy customers, and plenty of money left in your bank account. This requires you to have sufficiently fast jobs. When you’re just starting out with some new code, you can simply:

Profile the code, ideally in production. No need to find outliers, just pick a job at random. Identify the bottlenecks. Fix the slowness.

Eventually, however, the normal case will be fast enough, and you will want to identify slow identifiers. This is where logging become useful; you probably already have some sort of logging already, for debugging purposes. You can also use logging to record the run time performance of you jobs, and build on that to identify slow outliers.

You don’t need to use Honeycomb to do so, nor do you need to use OpenTelemetry. I do hope someday there will be logging services designed specifically for larger scale batch jobs and data pipelines (and if they do exist, please tell me!). But even with Python’s built-in logging , logging a message at the end of the run with the elapsed time and input size is really very easy.

The important thing is that is to have some way to query the resulting logs and extract appropriate records. You’ll also want some way to get automatic notification of outliers. Then, whenever you identify outliers, you can look at your logs, look at your profiling, and immediately start fixing performance and memory problems—with any luck, before your customers notice.",cloud computing,pythonspeed.com

Containers have many benefits that can give you a competitive advantage compared with more traditional software delivery methods.

In this post, I explain what containers are, share the key benefits of containers for software development, and discuss why you might consider adding them to your DevOps processes.

What is containerization?

A container is a lightweight, portable computing environment that includes all the necessary files to run independently.

Containerization is the process of making an application runnable as a container. Once the application can run as a container, it runs the same regardless of the infrastructure used to execute the container. Containers are loaded with container images that run a specific application inside the container. If you want to build a modern application, from setting up a database, to loading different operating systems, to accessing a deep learning platform, you're going to need containerization.

Containerization has been widely adopted in recent years, partly due to the availability of cloud technologies. Cloud technologies let you scale and replicate containers, and they lower the barrier to entry.

If you work in DevOps, you've probably worked with containers before. If you're trying to get started, check out the DockerHub library of images to see what images you can use or our post on getting started with containers.

What are the benefits of containerization?

Containerization can be a useful tool for you to enhance the software development lifecycle.

The benefits include:

Containers complement your DevOps process

Containers are scalable and allocate resources efficiently

Containers are portable so you can build once, run anywhere

Containers complement your DevOps process

In our introduction to DevOps post, we discussed how DevOps as a concept is about removing barriers that get in the way of software delivery.

DevOps refines every process between the developer and the customer, and encourages faster feedback loops, experimentation, and learning. DevOps is a practice that focuses on agility and automation.

Containerization complements DevOps because software can be deployed and tested faster, improving feedback loops. Containerization is also a major factor in the popularity of microservices, a software architecture that improves flexibility and agility. You can use containerization to speed up the time it takes to develop new features and get feedback. Improving the feedback loop for your product leads to a better product and happier customers.

Containers are scalable and allocate resources efficiently

Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes let developers operate containers at scale. Container orchestrators can scale individual components in software applications up and down depending on demand and load. This leads to cost savings as components only run for as long as they’re needed. Scaling also improves reliability as container orchestrators can allocate sufficient resources to high-demand parts of the application.

Scaling and cost savings are important factors when deciding to migrate to containerization. Many cloud providers have a cost calculator for cloud resources that you can use if you want your department to make the switch to containers.

Containers are portable: build once, run anywhere

Because containers are portable, they can run anywhere on any infrastructure, such as in the cloud, on a VM, or bare metal.

The Open Container Initiative (OCI) designs open standards for containers, ensuring any OCI compliant containers run the same way on any infrastructure.

To run applications, containers are loaded with container images. A container image is a static file that contains executable code to run a process on IT infrastructure. There are container images for different use cases such as databases, web servers, operating systems, and more. Container image repositories are public access points for container images, which makes them available to developers who can load a container with these images.

If you want to use a container for your application, you can be sure that any OCI image you use will work on your infrastructure, even if your infrastructure changes.

What are the top container images?

Docker Hub provides a list of popular container images. Some of the top container images are:

Ubuntu: a Debian-based Linux operating system.

NGINX: an open-source web server, load balancer, and reverse proxy used in several applications.

Postgres: an open-source relational database system that uses the SQL language.

Redis: an open-source in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.

Alpine: a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox.

Popular container images are often open-source and address a fundamental need in software applications, such as databases, web servers, or caches. These use cases are common to most software projects and tools have already been built to address them.

If you're starting a software project, you don't want to reinvent the wheel and figure out how to build a relational database or webserver by yourself - and containerization means you don't have to! The power of containerization helps developers build on existing solutions to solve new problems.

Cloud PaaS solutions like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform provide the infrastructure to run technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. The open-source Docker container technology was launched in 2013. Since then, it's gained widespread adoption as the leading container technology. Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration technology used alongside Docker to manage and scale container solutions. Kubernetes is a management layer that organises and provisions infrastructure to host containers and execute workloads.

The containerization landscape is fluid and ever changing, so you should monitor major updates to check whether your software stack is affected by any changes. For instance, while Docker has been the most common container technology run on Kubernetes, the v1.24 Kubernetes update deprecated Dockershim - an underlying module that provided compatibility between Docker and Kubernetes. The update was mainly due to Docker’s compatibility with the Container Runtime Interface. Docker has developed a replacement for Dockershim called cri-dockerd that addresses compatibility issues for users that still want to use Docker Engine to run containers in Kubernetes. The cri-dockerd adapter lets you use Docker Engine through the Container Runtime Interface.

A report by Datadog in 2021 indicated a 6% increase in container adoption with a correlated dip in Docker usage. The increase in container adoption rate may continue as Kubernetes moves away from full Docker support. The containerization and container orchestration landscape is rapidly evolving. The technological tools and popularity may change, but the containerization and container orchestration concepts are here to stay.

Containerization support in Octopus Deploy

A deployment process can use some form of containers or container orchestration to deploy an application. Octopus is a deployment management tool that supports containerization. Octopus Deploy works with container registries, PaaS providers, Docker, and Kubernetes to provide a best-in-class deployment management tool. Regardless of which container technologies are most popular moving forward, Octopus Deploy can work with all of them to provide happier deployments.

Conclusion

Containers are standalone computing environments, and containerization converts an application into a runnable container. Containerization gives the development process flexibility and agility, which helps DevOps processes. Containers are highly portable, and OCI compliant containers can be built once and run anywhere. With PaaS solutions and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, containers are scalable to allocate resources efficiently.

Containerization is an ever-changing field of research. The popularity of specific tools may shift and change, but Octopus Deploy is container and cloud-agnostic. It works with a range of container registries, PaaS providers, Docker, and Kubernetes to help make your complex deployments easier.

347,Key Strategies for CIOs to safely and smartly move to the cloud and speed digital transformation,https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt20f3a66dbe3c205a/632e0ed93df1404a8501e1a2/cloud-objections.jpg,23/09/2022,"Cloud adoption in the financial, insurance, manufacturing, and public sectors need not be slowed down by outmoded thinking.",https://www.elastic.co/blog/key-strategies-for-cios-to-safely-and-smartly-move-to-the-cloud-and-speed-digital-transformation,"While many IT leaders in highly-regulated sectors have opted for a slow pace of public cloud adoption, organizations that are more advanced on their journey are reaping the rewards.

McKinsey found through a series of surveys that large companies put up to 15% of their applications in the cloud, but continue to host the core of their technology environment in traditional data centers. The data shows that a lift-and-shift model of select applications offers limited payback. But, payback increases as organizations shift to a broader PaaS model. And, another study from Wipro showed that the speedy adoption of cloud by retail and CPG sectors have actually driven revenue gains.

What can, for example, financial or manufacturing sectors learn from retail, then?

Today, “data storage is growing in an unbounded way,” says one Silicon Valley data management executive, “so you want to grow your practices elastically. Elasticity is what the cloud is canonically good at.”

Here are some strategies to drive cloud adoption to realize better outcomes from your digital transformation.

Operations: Keep it smooth

Opportunity: Make operations run smoothly. Your in-house servers, backup systems, and application software and hardware depend on tightly controlled on-site protocols. Moving these operations to a public cloud means enacting new procedures.

Strategy: Hardware and software have their own breaking points, including the potential for outages and downtime. Public cloud options, on the other hand, offer immediate and flexible deployment, adaptive scaling, and inherent elasticity. By distributing your data and operations across wider, public cloud stores, your developers and security teams can quickly spin up new deployments through a central dashboard, unifying operations as your business scales. Cloud computing, containerization, and global data access have the potential to empower all the stakeholders (internal and external alike) with accurate data, insights, and recommendations for proper decision-making.

Security: Keep it safe

Opportunity: In regulated industries, loss of customer data through leaks or hacks is unacceptable. For major international companies, regulations such as data residency requirements (e.g., GDPR) mean that data that is transported even momentarily to other countries may be grounds for non-compliance. Minimize risk and play it safe.

Strategy: Advances in public cloud service providers’ cloud-native procedures obviate the need to choose between agility and compliance. GDPR, for one, “is proving to be the template by which many countries are determining how they want to handle data sovereignty,” says one cloud expert.

Cloud services allow for frequent, automatic third-party audits for compliance in many industries. Banks, for example, can meet regulatory requirements by using cloud platforms that are compliant with financial industry regulations. Compliance certifications are built into the procedures. AWS and other providers have native encryption capabilities, both for data in transit and passively stored on public cloud servers. Thousands of security controls and automatic updates are available. And cloud service provider personnel are well versed in compliance protocols and can offer a host of automated solutions.



Read this: Cybersecurity is a data challenge, and better search technology is key to improving visibility and action

Control: Keep it usable

Opportunity: Data is your most important asset. Housing it in a local data center under the watchful eyes of your data security staff was once a proven strategy of safety and success.

Strategy: It’s time to break the paradigm of assuming that local server means safer data, or better compliance. Cloud APIs enable anyone with clearance to monitor your company’s entire data estate. Multi-cloud architecture provides flexibility and freedom of choice to host your applications and data anywhere, on any device and on any cloud at global scale. No company wants to limit their audience or market to avoid regulations that are easily met automatically. Nor do they want to lock down data in such a way that it becomes difficult or impossible to garner insights that will drive digital transformation forward.

Cost: Keep it down

Opportunity: You’ve already invested considerable resources in your private cloud, including the procedures and personnel dedicated to maintaining it. But moving to a public cloud could mean massive savings that accrue quickly.

Strategy: Hardware-oriented, highly manual legacy environments are extremely inefficient and costly. Swapping out equipment through an approval and procurement process could potentially span weeks. There may be an up-front cost to moving your data, but the advantages of the dynamic, software-defined environment mean you can deploy and configure a new firewall with a few clicks.

Embracing the well-architected frameworks and shared server models offered by public cloud providers leads to faster performance. Though making the transition can be a time-consuming process, the cloud can provide extensive financial benefits, from budget savings to increased workplace productivity, to exponential gains in customer analytics and targeted sales.

What’s more, taking advantage of built-in compliance checks can actually mitigate against a breach. After all, non-compliance can be considerably more costly than the cost of maintaining compliance requirements (an FFIEC infraction, for example, could set your institution back $1 million per day).

Ultimately, security issues for cloud storage and operations are your responsibility, including compliance. Most breaches are due to misconfigurations, mismanagement, and human error. Make sure everyone in your organization is trained on data safety protocols and include cloud infrastructure penetration testing in your safety checks. Then, with security and compliance reassurances on hand, you can safely and efficiently move toward reaping the benefits of cloud.",cloud computing,elastic.co

A company's valuation should be determined by its business fundamentals -- its profits, growth rate, and similar factors. In a bubble, speculation and euphoria take over.

Image source: The Motley Fool

The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s may be the most recent famous example of a stock market bubble. Tech stocks surged, fueled by high expectations for a new internet economy. When those expectations were not realized, almost all of the tech stocks that had gained value during the boom years plunged or the underlying companies went out of business entirely. Arguably, the collapse in high-growth tech stocks from 2021 to early 2022 was also evidence of a bubble. Not every surge in stock prices is a sign of a bubble, however. Sometimes, large stock gains are justified by the companies' performances. For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has jumped in price by 1,760% in the past decade, but the company's earnings have increased even more during that time, and its competitive advantages have strengthened.

5 stages of a stock market bubble All stock market bubbles eventually burst, meaning that stock prices suddenly and sharply decline. While any number of events can lead to a bubble bursting, stock market crashes often occur after a key source of credit dries up. A credit contraction was the main reason for the 2008 housing bubble bust, which triggered a global financial crisis. Economists generally agree that there are five stages of an economic bubble: Displacement: This is a paradigm-shifting event. In the case of the housing bubble, this meant lower interest rates (thanks to looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve Board), easier access to subprime mortgages, new mortgage derivatives from Wall Street, and the fact that U.S. real estate prices had not suffered a sustained, national decline in generations. Boom: This is the phase when asset prices begin increasing rapidly. Rising prices attract new investors (or homebuyers, in the case of a housing bubble), but it isn't yet clear that the rise in prices is unwarranted. Euphoria: This is the phase were investors tend to make irrational decisions under the assumption that the bubble will continue to inflate. Some people refer to this as the greater fool theory, which is the belief that there will always be someone willing to pay a higher price for an asset than you did. In the case of the housing market, unqualified homeowners were buying homes with the intention of flipping them and making easy money. Peak: Prices eventually top out, and the smart money begins to sell. Market sentiment starts to shift. In the housing bubble, this phase was harder to detect since housing prices aren't readily listed like stock prices. But there were signs that defaults were starting to rise and easy credit was going away. Collapse: Bubbles tend to leave many retail investors financially ruined, and the housing bubble bust was no different. Home prices fell nationally between 2006 and 2012, leaving homeowners underwater, bankrupt, and with their credit destroyed. Just as prices are overinflated at the peak of the bubble, they tend to be undervalued during the bust. The reasons for the dot-com bubble burst are slightly more complicated. In this instance, the tech companies' performances didn't match investors' expectations. Many of the dot-com names that went bankrupt had flawed business models that made them incapable of turning a profit. In this bubble, the credit came from venture capitalists and other investors eager to pour money into any business with "".com"" in its name. The dot-com companies' growth eventually slowed, profits didn't materialize, and tech stock prices plunged. Again, Amazon offers a useful example here. In 2000, the Nasdaq Composite Index (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) peaked, seemingly because all the new internet companies, Amazon included, had exhausted the initial wave of investor demand. Tech stock prices tumbled as a result. The e-commerce company's revenue growth slowed from 169% in 1999 to just 13% in 2001, tracking with the market's boom and bust. Amazon's stock price declined by more than 90% from peak to trough in just two years.

Are we in a bubble right now? It's rarely clear in real time if we're in a stock market bubble. Looking at the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) as a whole, there isn't much evidence of a bubble. A broad-market index, the S&P 500 entered correction territory in late February 2022, meaning a decline of more than 10% from a recent peak in a bull market. A bubble, however, generally implies a much greater decline. Still, there is evidence of a bubble in a subsector of stocks, especially for pandemic winners and other tech stocks. Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) fell more than 75% from its pandemic-era peak, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) was down nearly 90% at one point, and Wayfair (NYSE:W) dropped by two-thirds. In other words, the bubble in pandemic stocks and others, such as cloud computing stocks, seems to have burst. There's reason to believe there's still a bubble in other subsectors such as electric vehicle (EV) stocks, many of which have perfect scenarios priced in. There's no obvious credit source fueling stock price increases in the current market environment, although there is evidence of a spike in retail stock trading since millions of Americans have recently opened accounts with Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) and other retail trading platforms. Additionally, pandemic stimulus payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, and other government relief measures have helped to fuel a bubble. Speculation is a key driver of any stock market bubble and a clear warning sign. Investors buy stocks not just because they believe their underlying values will rise but also because they believe the stock market will remain liquid, enabling them to easily sell their stocks at any time. During stock market bubbles, stock prices becomes divorced from the underlying business fundamentals yet continue to rise based on the assumption that speculators will continue to buy. A similar phenomenon seems to have occurred with Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) and other cryptocurrencies since mid-2020 as their prices have also surged. When valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings ratios and price-to-sales ratios are well out of the historical range, that's evidence of a bubble. Often the clearest sign of a stock market bubble is market sentiment, or how investors feel about the stock market. J.P. Morgan famously sold his stock holdings ahead of the Great Depression after a shoeshine boy asked him how he could buy stocks. Similarly, there were signs on social media platforms during much of the pandemic boom of euphoric sentiment in the market.

How to protect your portfolio during a stock market bubble The easiest way to preserve your portfolio's value during the bursting of a stock market bubble is to only hold stocks with strong business fundamentals. In the current environment, Target (NYSE:TGT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offer good examples. Easy come, easy go is the way of portfolio gains during market bubbles. Stock prices that have jumped for little ""fundamental"" reason can easily lose value if (and when) investor sentiment changes like it did for tech stocks in the late 1990s and pandemic stocks over the past year. Another way to protect your portfolio during a stock market bubble is to buy put options, which enable you to sell stock at a pre-determined price within a certain time period. You may also use stop-loss orders, which instruct your broker to sell a stock once its price declines to a certain value. The disadvantages of these alternatives are that buying put options can be expensive, and stop-loss orders might be executed during only a modest market pullback rather than a bubble popping entirely. Timing the market, after all, is almost impossible. The past two years have shown how unpredictable the stock market can be. There's no perfect way to insulate yourself from volatility in the stock market, and bubbles do occur from time to time. The best approach, and one of the easiest, is to buy shares in high-quality companies and hold them for the long term.",cloud computing,motley fool

The finance industry is a bit of a paradox. On one side, you have high-frequency trading, where machines talk to machines and trading happens nearly instantaneously. On the other side, you have relationship-driven work: mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, and debt issuance.

Consider debt. Bankers build relationships with CFOs and executives over time. When a company like Apple, Google, or 3M wants to borrow money from the capital markets (a process known as new issuance), they tap those bankers, who work the phones, email, and chat messages to organize investors and get the deal done.

At least that’s how it’s been done for decades. But a company called DirectBooks is changing that, replacing the flurry of chats, calls, and emails with a technology platform that streamlines communication between banks and institutional investors.

Managing a coalition of banks and institutional investors, all of which have different needs, wants, and levels of technological sophistication, is a well-met challenge for the DirectBooks leadership team, who have collective decades of experience in fintech investing.

I spoke recently with DirectBooks CEO Rich Kerschner and chief operating officer Yvonne Wang about the company’s approach to innovation.

MIT Sloan Management Review : The DirectBooks platform launched in 2020. Can you talk a little bit about how things got started?

Rich Kerschner: A group of nine banks got together to build a technology platform that would centralize the process of how underwriters communicate with institutional investors. I came onboard in 2019 to form that centralized company, which launched as DirectBooks.

A common reaction at the time was, “Why now?” This is a very common refrain with innovation — the idea that “this is fantastic, but why didn’t you do it earlier?” There are plenty of reasons why it didn’t get done earlier; some of them have to do with market forces being aligned to drive change. But there also were many technological innovations coming to bear that served as enablers that we didn’t have before, such as cloud computing.

With DirectBooks, we’re taking a process that was working well enough but was often fairly manual, given that every bank had its own technology, and we’re streamlining these connections using a common set of structured data.

How is this use of technology different from what was done in the past?

Yvonne Wang: Previously, new debt issuance was largely a voice business — email, chat, unstructured data, bilateral communications.

Ofcom, which also oversees broadcasting, telecommunications and the postal service, said it will first look at whether the so-called hyperscale cloud providers, Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, might limit innovation and growth. They receive about 81 percent of the revenues in the UK public cloud infrastructure market, which Ofcom said is worth $16.85 billion (roughly Rs. 8,072 crore).

The investigations continue a crescendo of global scrutiny into the possible dominance Silicon Valley firms have gained over a range of markets. In June the Competition and Markets Authority, Britain's antitrust regulator, launched a separate investigation into the Google Play store over suspected anticompetitive conduct.

Ofcom said if it finds a market isn't working as it should, it can take the matter to government, refer antitrust matters to the CMA, take enforcement action itself or accept remedies from a business. The independent regulator said it will public a final report within a year.

The calling and messaging study will look at services like Meta Platforms's WhatsApp, Apple's FaceTime, and Zoom Video Communications, and issues like whether they should be able to interact with each other more.

The smart devices investigation is to examine connected televisions and speakers and their bargaining power with those who produce content like entertainment and news.

The global computers market is expected to grow from $369.94 billion in 2021 to $410.40 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9%. The growth is mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The market is expected to reach $595.93 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 9.8%.



Asia Pacific was the largest region in the computers market in 2021. North America was the second largest region in computers market. The regions covered in the computers market are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa.



The computer market is expected to be aided by rapid growth in investments in smart city projects in many countries globally. Smart city technologies use information and communication technologies to efficiently manage and operate urban services including transportation systems, water supply and law and order.

These technologies are enabled through IoT technology. IoT is a convergence of computing devices, mechanical and digital objects. This system facilitates the transfer of data over a network without human interaction and minimal human to computer interaction. Smart cities use computers and related hardware, thereby benefitting the companies operating in this market.

APG Algemene Pensioen Groep N.V. announced investment of €250 million in ""Smart City Infrastructure Fund"", for development of smart city projects across North America, Europe, Australia and other major urban areas in the world. The concept of smart cities is becoming more popular in developing nations too. For instance, more than 1,000 smart city pilot projects are either ready for or are under construction globally and around 500 of these projects are in China.



Interest rates are expected to increase in developed nations, particularly the USA and Europe, between 2019 and 2022, making it harder and more expensive for companies manufacturing computers. The computer market is characterized as requiring fair amount of capital funds to operate, renovate, innovate and expand business.

Story continues

Therefore, changes in the economy such as changes in interest rates are expected to greatly affect the profit margins, cost structures and expansion strategies of the companies in the cloud services market. For instance, the USA Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates in 2021. This will in turn hinder the operation and expansion of businesses in the cloud services market.



The Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as the next big trend in the computers market with the ability to create an impact across the business spectrum. The Internet of Things merged the physical and online worlds to open up to a host of opportunities for companies, governments and consumers. The IoT is a complex ecosystem with multiple players such as device vendors, communication service providers, software vendors and IT service providers. For example, the August Smart Lock uses the Internet of Things platform to automatically lock and unlock the front door of a user's residence, and can also remotely grant access to guests, friends or staff.

In light of Broadcom’s less than stellar track record with prior acquisitions (CA Technologies in 2018, and Symantec in 2019), VMware’s enterprise customers are understandably worried.

“Following the purchases of CA and Symantec, Broadcom raised prices, decreased support, and stopped investing in innovation,” says Tracy Woo, senior analyst for Forrester. “VMware customers would be wise to have an exit plan,” she cautioned.

IDC analyst Stephen Elliot sees it differently. Rather than advising VMware customers to identify the exits, Elliot believes customers should “double down” on their relationship with the vendor, moving towards a more strategic business partnership.

Either way, the deal isn’t expected to officially close until the end of 2023, so enterprises can take a wait-and-see approach before making any decisions.

Broadcom tries to reassure VMware customers and employees

Both Broadcom and VMware executives are aware of the concerns and have been saying all the right things, promising that it will be different this time. “We are approaching the post-closing planning phase of the transaction process with an open mind, while drawing from the lessons learned from our previous acquisitions of CA and Symantec Enterprise,” said Broadcom in a blog post.

And in a recent town hall meeting, VMware President Sumit Dhawan tried to dispel the worries of VMware’s 35,000+ employees. “Let’s not assume. . . that just because they have done what they have done with Symantec and CA is something that they intend to do with VMware because we’ve heard quite the opposite so far,” Dhawan said.

Broadcom insists that it values VMware’s technologies as well as VMware’s strong relationships with enterprise customers, hyperscalers, systems integrators and channel partners. “We don’t want to change any of that, and in fact, we want to embrace those relationships,” says Broadcom.

The company promises that the deal will ultimately be a boon to customers, giving them “greater choice and flexibility to build, run, manage, connect and protect traditional and modern applications at scale across diversified, distributed environments.”

Will Broadcom stifle VMware innovation?

One potential red flag is Broadcom’s stated goal of increasing VMware’s annual profits from $4.7 billion to $8.5 billion within three years. Broadcom contends that it can do this by “eliminating duplicative general and administration functions across human resources, finance, legal, facilities and information technology.”

Forrester’s Woo is skeptical. “Eliminating duplicative back-office functions doesn’t add up to the nearly $4 billion in additional profits Broadcom seeks. What else will they need to cut?” The worry is that Broadcom will take the scalpel to other areas, such as customer support and R&D.

If Broadcom’s vision of a full-stack, mainframe-to-edge computing powerhouse is to become a reality, the company will need to invest not just in high-value projects, as Broadcom has indicated it will focus on, but also VMware initiatives that are just gaining steam, such as its container management software, Tanzu.

Perhaps, the extensive product portfolio, existing enterprise dependencies, and combined sales channels will enable the new VMware to achieve that rapid growth spurt without cuts to personnel, support, or innovation, but nearly doubling profits in three years is an aggressive goal.

Plus, there is Broadcom’s track record of hiking prices, trimming operating budgets, and cutting support after acquisitions, a track record which, according to a survey by 451 Research, already worries VMware’s existing customers.

The survey of more than 300 technology leaders, which was conducted after the acquisition was announced, found that while many tech leaders believe there could indeed be synergies between the two companies, 40% of respondents had negative feelings about the proposed deal.

The top concern from respondents was the same one analysts have been voicing: that Broadcom would stifle innovation.

Will Broadcom treat VMware differently that its other acquisitions?

However, several factors point to a future that doesn’t necessarily follow Broadcom’s track record with previous acquisitions. The first is scale. With a purchase price of $61 billion, VMware is by far Broadcom’s biggest acquisition to date, which puts intense pressure on Broadcom to make it a growing, sustainable operation, rather than milking it dry, as Broadcom has been accused of doing with its prior purchases.

The next factor is the existence of VMware’s strong partner ecosystem. Broadcom needs to build relationships with channel partners, or a big part of VMware’s value could evaporate quickly.

The timing of the deal also comes into play. VMware had been pivoting from being a server virtualization vendor into containers, multi-cloud offerings, and hyperscaler products, so a roadmap that integrates Broadcom’s existing assets in networking, security and AIOps with VMware’s portfolio builds on a transition already in the making.

Finally, a major difference with this acquisition is that VMware products don’t compete with Broadcom’s. “There is not a lot of overlap in these two companies’ portfolios,” says Elliot. “For Broadcom, everything that VMware brings to the table is additive.”

VMware technologies are already deeply entrenched in most enterprises, and the company’s customer relations tend to be well regarded. “VMware is very sticky,” Elliot adds. “Broadcom understands that, and they want to maintain or even expand on that stickiness.”

Elliot argues that VMware’s unique position as a virtualization pioneer with a massive, loyal customer base makes this deal very different than previous Broadcom acquisitions, which had more overlap and were in more commodified market sectors.

“You do a deal like this to transform your business, to drive growth, to create a better relationship with customers,” Elliot said. “Broadcom’s attitude is that they have a lot to learn from VMware. VMware has operating practices that are exceptional and could influence the future of Broadcom.”

Will a brain drain dampen the deal?

At a VMware town hall shortly after the deal was announced, one of the first questions VMware’s Chief People Officer Betsy Sutter fielded was from an employee who asked, “Why should I stay?” The implication is that if Broadcom strips VMware down for parts, world-class engineers, support specialists, and sales and marketing experts will leave.

Sutter disputed the premise, pointing out that the acquisition could open up opportunities for both employees and customers.

Yet, several of VMware’s top execs have already left the company, recruiters from competing tech vendors have been circling, and there are plenty of rumors about an impending employee exodus at VMware.

“The acquisition is supposed to close by the end of 2023, so this is by no means a done deal. Internal turmoil at VMware could pose problems,” Woo notes.

Synergies could open up new business models

One indication that Broadcom is serious about investing in VMware is that the chip maker has announced that the Broadcom Software Group will be rebranded as VMware after the deal closes.

“If Broadcom and VMware can combine strengths, not only will the integration of the portfolio benefit customers, but the synergies among these various products could unlock new business models,” Elliot said.

Broadcom has a vision of transforming itself into a software powerhouse that enterprise customers can rely on from mainframes to networking to security to virtualization to edge computing.

VMware itself had been pursuing multi-cloud and container initiatives, such as Project Arctic and Tanzu Kubernetes, that align with the vision Broadcom has for the future of its enterprise software group. The idea is that Broadcom’s existing software suite, which includes AIOps, cybersecurity, and enterprise automation solutions, will be tightly integrated with VMware solutions for cloud infrastructure and modern applications.

“Because these two portfolios are so large and important to enterprise production environments, the acquisition creates an opportunity (for Broadcom/VMware) to build stronger customer relationships,” Elliot said. “There’s value in the breadth of portfolio, especially if they can stitch these different products together into a coherent whole.”

What should VMware customers do?

For many enterprise customers, their cloud and application infrastructures rely heavily on VMware products, so decoupling would not be easy. However, it’s probably not a bad idea to at least sketch out a potential exit strategy in the event that the worst fears of Broadcom skeptics come to pass.

For most, however, taking a wait-and-see attitude is probably the prudent approach. The deal isn’t slated to close until Q4 2023, which buys enterprises time to assess their options.

Elliot recommends that VMware customers should focus on product planning, future road maps, and better communications to create a more strategic business partnership.

That approach is probably applicable only to very large enterprises. After the previous CA and Symantec acquisitions, Broadcom left smaller accounts out in the cold.

Even so, not only will Broadcom Software Group rebrand as VMware, but the chip maker is paying a premium for VMware. When the deal was announced, the $61 billion price tag represented a 44 percent premium over the closing price of VMware common stock.

It would be an odd move for Broadcom to pay a premium for an asset it intends to strip down for parts.

Whichever path Broadcom chooses for VMware—milk it for short-term profit or invest in VMware like it’s the new crown jewels—existing customers would be wise to keep their options open.

In the short term, it’s probably a smart bet to take Elliot’s advice and see if you’re able to create the strategic relationship that you want with VMware, but if that doesn’t work out, you’ll have bought yourself the time to develop a thorough exit plan.

Global Cyber Security Market

Global Cyber Security Market

Dublin, Sept. 22, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Cyber Security Market by Component (Software, Hardware, and Services), Software (IAM, Encryption and Tokenization, and Other Software), Security Type, Deployment Mode, Organization Size, Vertical and Region - Global Forecast to 2027"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global cyber security market size is expected to grow from an estimated value of USD 173.5 billion in 2022 to USD 266.2 billion by 2027, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.9% from 2022 to 2027.

The increased number of data breaches across the globe, the ability of malicious actors to operate from anywhere in the world, the linkages between cyberspace and physical systems, and the difficulty of reducing vulnerabilities and consequences in complex cyber networks are some factors which are driving the cyber security market growth. However, the lack of cyber security professionals and the lack of budget constraints among SMEs and start-ups in developing economies are expected to hinder the market growth.

By Organization size, SMEs to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecasted period

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) from a variety of industries are going through a digital transformation and using cloud computing to streamline operations, increase mobility, get rid of on-premises technology, and save costs. To protect their online applications and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) against unwanted access, vulnerabilities, and attacks, SMEs are using cybersecurity solutions and services. Cybercriminals use automated techniques to attack SMEs' networks in order to take advantage of their weak security infrastructures.

Therefore, in order to save money, time, and resources, SMEs are seeking cyber security solutions. Additionally, governments are acting to safeguard SMEs in their own nations. But significant problems including operational activity budget restrictions, a lack of capital funding, and a shortage of qualified workers are anticipated to impede market expansion for SMEs in developing nations.

Story continues

SMEs are vulnerable to new security problems as they implement digitalization at an increasing rate. As a result, the IT departments of SMEs make investments in implementing cyber security solutions. Thus, the SMEs are to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecasted period.

By Vertical, the aerospace and defence vertical account for a larger market size during the forecasted period

The civil and military aerospace and defence procurements are included in the aerospace and defence verticals. The rate of growth of security risks in the aerospace and defence sectors is alarming. This vertical is intended to harvest extremely sensitive and confidential data from important sectors, such as the government, prime contractors, and suppliers. Big data and increased digitization in nearly every element of the armed forces raise the likelihood of cybercriminal attacks.

The use of IT and telecommunications tools like RADARs and encryption-based wireless technologies for secure communication are the main drivers, and they will assist in expanding the markets. Additionally, the sector is undergoing a significant digital change, which has increased the need for cyber security services and solutions. Thus the aerospace and defence vertical accounts for a larger market share during the forecasted period.

By Organization size, large enterprises to grow at the highest market size during the forecasted period

Large enterprises and SMEs may protect themselves with the help of cyber security solutions from cyberattacks that aim to breach and undermine their IT infrastructure. For the purpose of protecting their critical assets, large organizations throughout the world continue to implement cyber security solutions at a rapid rate.

In order to include security solutions and services for defending vital assets from cyberattacks, large organisations are redesigning their security policies and architecture. To protect networks, endpoints, data centres, devices, users, and applications against unauthorised use and harmful ransomware attacks, they heavily rely on cyber security.

Large businesses are increasingly using access management tools to enable privileged access to servers and online applications, which promotes market expansion. Large enterprises are more likely to employ cyber security solutions as a result of huge budgets implementing top-notch security solutions and the strong demand for real-time auditing and monitoring of the growing IoT traffic. Thus large enterprises are to have the highest market growth during the forecasted period.

Photoshop is used by both professionals and hobbyists to edit and manipulate images. Photoshop is very easy to use once you get the basics and there are a whole lot of things that can be done with Photoshop. The many things that can be done with photoshop are only limited by one’s imagination and knowledge. However, the issue where Adobe Photoshop is not opening on your PC can be frustrating. With so many tools available in Photoshop. It is easy to mix and match to complete whatever you want.

Adobe Photoshop not opening on Windows 11/10

Photoshop not opening, can be caused by a few things. This problem is not very common however and can sometimes be easily fixed without any technical knowledge of computing. When troubleshooting any problems, whether you think that it is software or hardware related, it is best to start with the easiest fix first. Start with the easiest thing that can be done first and move up to the most challenging. There are a few things that you can try if your Photoshop is not opening.

End Photoshop in Task Manager Restart the Computer Update Photoshop and your computer Reset Photoshop Preferences Repair or uninstall and reinstall Photoshop Use Creative Cloud Cleaner Tool

1] End Photoshop in Task Manager

Fixing the issue with Photoshop not opening can be done simply by ending the Photoshop task in Windows Task Manager. You can go to task manager by clicking the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + Del . A window will appear just click Task Manager. When you click task manager a window will appear showing the tasks that are currently running. You can look for Adobe Photoshop, it will have your version, click on it and press End task. You may also find Task Manager by pressing the windows logo or the magnifying glass and typing Task Manager, the Task Manager window will open. Look for the Photoshop task and end it.

You may be asked to confirm that you want to end the task, just confirm and Photoshop will close. You can then restart Photoshop and see if it will open. If this solution does not fix your problem then move on to the next one.

The reason you end the task is that there may be cases where Photoshop is running in the background. If it is already running in the background, it will not open. This is the reason you would need to end the task and try to reopen Photoshop.

2] Restart the Computer

Restarting the computer when there is a problem sometimes solves issues. This can be a result of everything stored in RAM being dumped and the computer will come up fresh. This may not be the case if you shut down the computer. If Quick Start is enabled in Windows, the computer will not empty RAM. This happens because the computer wants to start up fast. When you shut down and start again, the problems you had may still be there. If you want to completely shut down and start fresh, hold Shift and click Shut Down. This will make sure that you are doing a full shutdown. If you do not want to have to be holding shift each time you shut down. You can choose to disable Fast startup in Power and Sleep Option.

3] Update Photoshop and Your Computer

Many issues with Photoshop can be avoided or fixed, if they arise, by simply keeping the software updated. Check with the Adobe website and see what is the latest version. If you do not have the latest version, update to the latest version. When the update is finished, restart the computer and then try to open Photoshop and see if the problem is resolved.

You should also keep your Windows operating system and computer drivers up to date. Go to Setting and then Windows Update to make sure that you have the latest updates. Check the website of your computer’s manufacturer to see if there are updates for your computer. If you have a custom-built computer, you can check the website of the manufacturer for different parts (graphic card, processor, etc). see if they have updates for your computer parts.

Windows will update the driver for your computer when you do an update, and you can check for optional updates as well. Some computer manufacturers will also have software that you can install that will check periodically for updates. Some of this software will only check when you search. Whatever the case is. Make sure that your computer is updated, this is also good for keeping your computer secure. Outdated drivers and other software can make your computer vulnerable to viruses, hackers, and other malware.

4] Reset Photoshop Preferences

Unexpected behaviors in Photoshop may be an indication that the preferences may be damaged. Restoring preferences to their default is a great way to troubleshoot to see if the preferences are causing the unexpected behavior.

Be sure to backup your preferences before resetting preferences. To reset Photoshop’s preferences using the keyboard quit Photoshop, hold down the Ctrl + Alt + Shift key and launch Photoshop. Click Yes in the dialog that asks, “Delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file?” You may reset Photoshop’s preference using the Preferences dialogue window. Go to Edit then Preferences then General or press Ctrl + K and choose General. You then press Reset Preferences on Quit. Click OK in the dialog that asks, “Are you sure you want to reset preferences when quitting Photoshop?” Close Photoshop then reopen Photoshop. New Preference files will be created in the original location.

Note – This method is for newer versions of Photoshop, the older version does not offer the reset button on the Preferences dialogue window.

You may manually reset preferences by removing the preferences folder. This method ensures all preferences and any user presets which may be causing a problem are not loaded. To try this method close Photoshop and then navigate to the location of the preferences folder. They are located at:

Users/[username]/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop [version]/Adobe Photoshop [version] Settings.

If you do not see the files, they may be hidden so you may have to make Windows show Hidden files.

Remove the entire Adobe Photoshop [Version] Settings folder to somewhere safe for a backup of your settings. Open Photoshop and new preferences files will be created in the original location.

5] Repair or Uninstall and reinstall Photoshop

Whenever you have tried all the easier steps and they do not resolve the Photoshop not opening issue, it may be time to repair or uninstall and reinstall Photoshop. This will fix corrupt or missing Photoshop files and may resolve the Photoshop not opening problem.

Depending on the version of Photoshop that you have, the procedure may be different. You can simply repair the desktop installation by starting the reinstall procedure.

You will be asked if you want to reinstall or repair it. For the first try, repair the installation then restart the computer and try to open Photoshop. If the problem is not fixed by repairing the installation, then it is time to uninstall and reinstall Photoshop.

6] Use Adobe Creative Cloud Cleaner

The Adobe Creative Cloud Cleaner tool is intended for advanced computer users and can fix many common problems (such as removing old Adobe software, cleaning corrupt installation files, and fixing your host files to establish a connection with Adobe servers).

The Creative Cloud Cleaner tool is a utility for experienced users to clean up corrupted installations. This tool removes or fixes problem files and resolves permission issues in registry keys.

Use the Creative Cloud Cleaner tool with the necessary precautions. Before using the Creative Cloud Cleaner Tool, back up your preferences, custom swatches, third-party add-ons, and any other custom settings that you want to keep.

You have already tried repairing or uninstalling the Creative Cloud desktop app, but still can’t update or install your Creative Cloud app.

You want to remove older Adobe software completely.

Your Creative Cloud app fails to launch even though you have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app.

You cannot sign in to Adobe apps even after multiple attempts even after trying these common solutions.

You cannot connect to Adobe servers and have limited access to Adobe apps and services even after trying these common solutions.

You can download the Adobe Creative Cloud Cleaner Tool from the Adobe website and follow the instructions there to use it.

Why is Photoshop unresponsive?

If Adobe Photoshop has frozen and become non-responsive, this means that your computer does not have the available system memory or processor resources available to run the program efficiently. This can happen if you have opened many additional programs opened.

HANGZHOU, China, Sept. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Alibaba Cloud, the digital technology and intelligence backbone of Alibaba Group, has announced its latest international strategic roadmap at the 2022 Alibaba Cloud Summit. During the three-day summit, the trusted cloud provider has revealed new products to support technology innovation among enterprises, an investment of USD1 billion for a global partner ecosystem upgrade, and enhanced customer services to provide comprehensive support throughout a customer's digitalization journey.

Technology innovation to power rapidly increasing cloud consumption

With more enterprises moving to the cloud and an increase in demand for cloud services in a hybrid environment, Alibaba Cloud has made available globally a series of its proven infrastructure products, a multi-model cloud-native database and distributed cloud services. This range of new products aims to provide enterprise customers with a wider scope of cloud services covering network, storage and compute.

Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN) 2.0, the newly available network services, provides global intelligent networking to support enterprises' global expansion. CEN 2.0 supports ultra-large-scale networking capabilities with higher availability, lower latency, enhanced security capability and greater flexibility in pricing options for enterprises, compared to the previous version.

Alibaba Cloud has also unveiled a storage product called ESSD Auto PL, which provides block storage services and supports automatic scaling within seconds to allow businesses to handle sudden traffic surges. As the world's leading elastic block storage product with auto-scaling function, it offers up to one million IOPS (input/output operations per second), significantly higher than the industry average.

Lindorm, the cloud-native multi-model database developed by Alibaba Cloud, successfully supported Alibaba Group's 11.11, the world's largest shopping festival, last year. Designed for fusion-processing requirements for wide tables, time series, space-time and various unstructured data, Lindorm has also been supporting customers in various industries in China – including automotive, finance and manufacturing – thanks to its high availability and low storage cost.

Alibaba Cloud also introduced ACK One (Alibaba Cloud Distributed Cloud Container Platform), a multi-region and multi-cluster container management platform to provide a consistent management, delivery and operation experience for enterprises. It allows users to implement container cluster management, resource scheduling, data disaster recovery and application delivery through a unified platform, whether in a public cloud, private cloud or on-premise environment. ACK One is the latest addition to ACK Anywhere, Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes. Earlier this year, among the eight significant industry players evaluated, Alibaba Cloud was named a ""Leader"" in The Forrester Wave™ Public Cloud Container Platforms Q1 2022 for the first time.

Lastly, to support enterprises' need for hybrid cloud, CloudBox integrates Alibaba Cloud's public cloud infrastructure technologies such as compute, storage and network to provide enterprises with fully managed cloud services for deployment close to customers' business premises. CloudBox delivers a consistent experience as Alibaba Cloud's public cloud, while meeting enterprises' demand for on-premise data processing and low latency compute. CloudBox is designed for multinational companies with business operations in China.

Alibaba Cloud has been strengthening its capabilities in computing, storage, network and security. For example, its recently unveiled Cloud Infrastructure Processing Unit (CIPU), a dedicated processing unit designed for its Apsara Cloud operating system, can reduce network latency to as low as five microseconds and improve computing power performance in data-intensive AI and data analytics scenarios by as much as 30%.

Prioritizing partner benefits to build inclusive technology ecosystem

With its revamped ecosystem strategy, Alibaba Cloud has announced that it is committed to investing USD1 billion to support partners' technology innovation and their market expansion with Alibaba Cloud in the coming three fiscal years. This investment consists of both financial and non-financial incentives, such as funding, rebates and go-to-market initiatives.

To accelerate partners' growth, Alibaba Cloud also launched a ""Regional Accelerator"" program to provide partners operating in different markets with a localized business collaboration model. The model is designed around factors such as a market's level of technical maturity, vertical focus, digitalization needs and business demands, with an aim to boost partners' income and strengthen their technical expertise. Alibaba Cloud ecosystem partners including resellers, technology partners (ISV, SaaS and SI), service and consulting partners can benefit from the program.

The company now describes its solution as a “data platform”. Is that accurate, and what features lift a distributed file system into the data management category?

Background

We’ve followed Weka since our initial introduction to the technology start-up at AWS Reinvent in November 2017. The company’s core solution, originally branded as Matrix (now Data Platform), is a scale-out, distributed file system (WekaFS). The design bypasses much of the standard Linux kernel storage and networking I/O paths, interfacing directly with PCIe-connected NVMe drives and using SR-IOV for networking.

At the host level, WekaFS appears as a local POSIX file system implemented through a virtual file system driver. The solution also supports NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage, NFS v3 (v4.1 in Weka 4), SMB (through SMB-W, a more efficient Weka-specific implementation) and S3 (AWS Simple Storage Service).

Performance

The performance credentials of WekaFS aren’t in doubt. We’ve discussed the high throughput and low latency capabilities in many blogs and podcasts (with some examples shown here).

These attributes make WekaFS suitable for a wide range of applications, but most notably, AI and analytics processes that create widespread random I/O across a mix of small and large-sized files. For a current view of the Weka Data Platform and use cases, check out this video from a recent Tech Field Day event, with all the videos available here.

New and Improved

Weka 4 introduces new features and improves upon existing ones. The most significant changes in Weka 4 include:

Additional cloud support. Weka 4 provides native integration with AWS, GCP, Azure and OCI (Oracle Cloud). In this instance, “native” refers to the ability of the Weka software to understand the deployed environment, operate with platform-specific storage, deploy with solutions like CloudFormation and scale up/down automatically on demand.

Additional protocol support. Weka 4 now supports NFS v4.1 and SMB through SMB-W, a Weka-optimised implementation.

These two videos (featuring Joel Kaufman) give a good idea of the dynamic deployment capabilities, demonstrating how the software is installed and how data is migrated between clouds using S3 snapshots).

Data Platform

The introduction of Weka 4 repositions the technology as a data platform. Although the rebranding sounds good from a marketing perspective, what does it mean to be a true data platform, and what features does Weka 4 have to justify this stance?

First, we need a definition. Excluding the obvious ones relating to a dais or railway platform, the most appropriate explanation we have is as follows:

“A platform is a group of technologies that are used as a base upon which other applications, processes or technologies are developed.”

Typically, we think of operating systems or hardware as platforms. Increasingly, the definition is becoming more abstract as the public cloud is treated as a platform on which applications are developed and deployed.

What does it mean to be a data platform? The most obvious capability of any data platform is the ability to ingest, serve and manage data for many different I/O and usage profiles, in parallel and with multi-tenant isolation. I recently met up with the Weka team in San Jose, where we discussed this specific point. I learned Weka has many customers that routinely operate processes of data ingest, followed by AI model training. These customers also choose to operate data isolation using multiple file systems, all sitting on the same physical infrastructure.

“Requirement 1 – ingest, manage and deliver data from a diverse set of application use cases, with multi-tenant isolation and zero performance impact.”

This capability of Weka 4 is incredibly powerful because it abstracts the hardware and software management from the visualisation of data to the end user. System and storage administrators no longer have to build out separate environments for each line of business. Instead, a single platform can be built that spans all requirements. The only reason to deploy multiple Weka 4 solutions is for geographic diversity, resilience or when using the public cloud.

One important aspect of the Weka design is the ability to scale up and down. This feature is essential in the public cloud, where computing resources are elastic and will expect storage resources (both capacity and performance) to do the same.

Data Anywhere

With the ability to snapshot data to S3, Weka 4 provides the first level of mobility for multi-cloud. Data owners can snapshot data from one cloud provider via an S3 bucket and re-hydrate into another cloud (see Joel’s second video above to understand just how easy this is).

“Requirement 2 – data should be freed from the dependency of physical hardware and made available wherever it is needed, while ensuring data consistency, data efficiency and data protection.”

As we discussed in this post from 2019, businesses need to “own the data” and “rent the cloud”. This is only possible if data can be moved easily from one provider to another, taking advantage of services and solutions (for example) only available on one platform. Note: just because data can be moved easily doesn’t mean we envisage continuous data mobility. Cloud egress still attracts a charge, so data mobility between providers requires an awareness of the cost implications.

Self-Service

The public cloud has taken the concept of technology self-service to new levels. Two decades ago, businesses built service catalogues (and still do) that offer a menu of standardised solutions across storage, networking, compute, virtualisation and applications. The catalogue itself doesn’t translate to self-service. These features are delivered through workflow and automation, which have been implemented within the enterprise with varying degrees of success.

Modern infrastructure consumers (both developers and businesses) want to acquire and consume resources, pay for consumption, and give back resources when they’re no longer used. Making this process work in the on-premises data centre (as well as it does in the public cloud) is a challenge, especially in the storage arena.

Historically, scale-out file systems have been designed and deployed with the deep technical skills of experts. Once in place, the fragility of deployments means upgrades or amendments are approached with trepidation. In modern IT, this simply shouldn’t be the case. The public cloud vendors can clearly scale, upgrade, and improve services with little or no user downtime, so why should on-premises be any different?

“Requirement 3 – the deployment, operation and management of data platforms should be as frictionless as possible, while the user experience should enable resources to be consumed and returned on demand.”

How has Weka met this requirement? Since the last time we saw a demonstration of the Weka solution, the company has implemented a self-service portal that helps customers build and deploy directly into AWS. This capability includes assistance in picking the right AWS instance and an automated build process using CloudFormation.

The Architect’s View®

In this post, we’ve highlighted three requirements we expect to see in modern data platforms. In each case, the definition focuses on the content and user experience rather than the hardware and infrastructure. This is where we see the differentiation between a distributed file system and a data platform. A data platform should hide the complexity of implementation from the user and be focused on delivering features that make the best use of the data being stored. In that respect, Weka 4 meets the brief.

But we think there’s an opportunity to go further. Remember that Weka owns the file system and, as such, can modify or extend the way the file system works. This could mean adding extra metadata, building workflow that is triggered by specific types of content, discovering ransomware, auto archiving PII, the list is endless. AWS does this for S3 with Lambda, while HammerSpace implements metadata extensions into its platform. In this respect, Weka 4 truly is a platform onto which the company itself can build new features and functionality onto what is essentially a base. Weka has barely started on a journey that could transform the way we look at data management in the future.

(NYSE: KEYS), a leading technology company that delivers advanced design and validation solutions to help accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, and Nokia Bell Labs have successfully tested a 260 GBaud ultra-high-speed optical signal transmission over 100 km of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) at the European Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC) 2022 in Basel, Switzerland, exceeding the previous record of 220 GBaud.

Artificial intelligence (AI), 5G and internet of things (IoT) applications are driving the demand for more bandwidth. Leveraging high symbol rate systems increases the aggregate per-wavelength information rate to reduce the cost-per-bit in optical systems. A key trend in the telecom industry is the transition to higher symbol rates through integrated optics which reduces the component count, cost and power consumption.

With the mutual goal of improving network performance and efficiency, Nokia Bell Labs and Keysight combined expertise with other research partners to create the record-breaking demonstration of 260 GBaud Dual Polarization Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (DP-QPSK) coherent transmission over 100 km single mode Fiber.

Keysight Technologies Solution

The demonstration consisted of Keysight's new 260 GSa/s arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) (M8199B), which delivers more than 75 GHz bandwidth and a thin-film lithium niobate I/Q modulator with 110 GHz bandwidth. This enables R&D of transmission systems operated with symbol rates up to 260 GBaud and achieving net bitrates greater than 2 Tbit/s in coherent optical communications.

“Keysight is honored to work with Nokia Bell Labs on achieving 260 GBaud,” said Dr. Joachim Peerlings, vice president of Network and Data Center Solutions at Keysight. “The continued proliferation of AI requires new levels of server and network performance that must scale computing resources within reasonable energy bounds. Higher data rates and new modulation formats will be among the enabling technologies for the industry.”

“We achieved this outstanding record of maximum symbol rate of 260 GBaud by leveraging enabling technologies and the expertise of several partners,” said Haïk Mardoyan, Senior Research Scientist, Nokia Bell Labs. “This result is a first milestone to scale long haul data transport systems beyond 2 Tbit/s per wavelength. Improving the energy efficiency of transponders is a permanent challenge for the industry.”

366,FTC orders Jeff Bezos to testify in Amazon Prime probe,https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/07/12/5a3f60db-4d9b-4809-9e0e-805b998a324e/thumbnail/1200x630/3748db9b12ef6bbc5f04cb125acf3598/download.jpg,22/09/2022,Regulators want to question the executives about the retailer's sign-up and cancellation practices for Amazon Prime.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-prime-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-ftc-probe/,"Federal regulators are ordering Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and CEO Andy Jassy to testify in the government's investigation of Amazon Prime, rejecting the company's complaint that the executives are being unfairly harassed in the probe of the popular streaming and shopping service.

The Federal Trade Commission issued an order late Wednesday denying Amazon's request to cancel civil subpoenas sent in June to Bezos, the Seattle-based company's former CEO, and Jassy. The order also sets a deadline of Jan. 20 for the completion of all testimony by Bezos, Jassy and 15 other senior executives, who also were subpoenaed.

Jassy took over the helm of the online retail and tech giant from Bezos, one of the world's richest individuals, in July 2021. Bezos became executive chairman.

Amazon hasn't made the case that the subpoenas ""present undue burdens in terms of scope or timing,"" FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson said in the order on behalf of the agency. However, the FTC did agreed to modify some provisions of the subpoenas that it acknowledged appeared too broad.

Since March of 2021, the FTC has been investigating the sign-up and cancellation practices of Amazon Prime, which has an estimated 200 million members around the globe. More specifically, some critics claim the company deceptively lures people to enroll in the buying club and makes it hard to quit.

Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on the FTC's order.

Amazon wants FTC to back off

In a petition to the FTC filed last month, the company objected to the subpoenas to Bezos and Jassy, saying the agency ""has identified no legitimate reason for needing their testimony when it can obtain the same information, and more, from other witnesses and documents.""

Amazon said the FTC was hounding Bezos, Jassy and the other executives, calling the information demanded in the subpoenas ""overly broad and burdensome.""

The company said it has cooperated with FTC staff to provide relevant information, offering up some 37,000 pages of documents.

The investigation has widened to include at least five other Amazon-owned subscription programs: Audible, Amazon Music, Kindle Unlimited, Subscribe & Save, and an unidentified third-party program not offered by Amazon. The regulators have asked the company to identify the number of consumers who were enrolled in the programs without giving their consent, among other customer information.

With an estimated 150 million U.S. subscribers, Amazon Prime is a key source of revenue, as well as a wealth of customer data, for the company, which runs an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal ""smart"" tech and beyond. Amazon Prime costs $139 a year. The service added a coveted feature this year by obtaining exclusive video rights to the NFL's ""Thursday Night Football.""

Last year, Amazon asked unsuccessfully that FTC Chair Lina Khan step aside from separate antitrust investigations into its business, contending that her public criticism of the company's market power before she joined the government makes it impossible for her to be impartial.

Reenergized antitrust policy

Khan was a fierce critic of tech giants Facebook (now Meta), Google and Apple, as well as Amazon. She arrived on the antitrust scene in 2017, writing an influential study titled ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox"" when she was a Yale law student.

The FTC is also scrutinizing Amazon's $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical, a concierge-type medical service with roughly 190 offices in 25 markets, as well as the e-commerce giant's $1.7 billion deal for Roomba vacuum cleaner maker iRobot.

Under the Biden administration, antitrust enforcers at the agency and at the Justice Department have been far more aggressive in challenging business combination that could hurt competition, including working to develop tougher merger guidelines.

""Recent decades have vividly illustrated how Americans lose out when markets become more consolidated and less competitive,"" Khan told lawmakers in a Senate hearing this week on competition policy. ""Prices rise, wages fall, and our markets become more fragile and less resilient.""",cloud computing,cbs news
367,Indian leaders are once again testing Big Tech’s commitment to data privacy and free speech - Fortune,"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-831561360.jpg?resize=1200,600",22/09/2022,A new proposal from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration adds to the Indian government’s efforts to seize power from Silicon Valley.,https://fortune.com/2022/09/22/india-tech-bill-social-media-telecom-amazon-meta-youtube/,"Many large American tech companies have long looked to India as their next El Dorado, enchanted by the country’s massive population and steady modernization.

Amazon is investing billions of dollars there, challenging domestic e-commerce giants. Apple is slowly but surely gaining a foothold in the Indian smartphone market, while also eyeing manufacturing expansion within its borders. Hundreds of millions of Indians already use Alphabet-owned YouTube and Meta-owned Facebook and WhatsApp, with room still to grow for each platform.

Yet just as they have in autocratic China for decades, Silicon Valley giants may soon face some sticky ethical wickets when it comes to operating in India.

A new proposal introduced Wednesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration would give the Indian government sweeping powers to regulate digital communication services and access vast troves of user data.

Most concerningly, the proposed legislation would give Indian authorities the ability to take control of communication services and intercept user messages “on the occurrence of any public emergency or in the interest of public safety,” a nebulous provision ripe for abuse. The bill also forces licensed digital communications platforms to “unequivocally identify the person to whom it provides services,” rendering online anonymity impossible. To top it off, the Indian government essentially can’t be sued for abusing provisions of the act.

The plan builds on new rules and proposed guidelines in India about the government’s role in monitoring large tech companies. While some of the debate has been framed around defending user privacy, protecting domestic tech companies, and updating colonial-era laws, the practical implications of the regulations typically involve government officials expanding their surveillance powers.

The latest proposal fits snugly with this trend. Indian officials said the legislation, known as the Indian Telecommunications Bill of 2022, is a much-needed overhaul of laws that date back nearly 140 years in some cases. They also argued the reforms target the “importance of cybersecurity, national security, and public safety concerns, while ensuring constitutional and procedural safeguards.”

At the same time, the bill serves as a trojan horse for building out India’s growing surveillance state. The Internet Freedom Foundation, a leading voice in India for democratic digital rights, tweeted Wednesday that the proposal “increases government powers under vague grounds” and does not contain “meaningful reform.”

The Indian Telecommunications Bill of 2022 remains in the early stages, with amendments or a complete scrapping still possible. But its mere introduction offers another example of the Indian government exhibiting illiberal tendencies that cut against the professed principles of Western tech companies.

In 2019, Indian officials introduced a bill that would give the government “broad powers to store, use and control the large amounts of data it gathered on its citizens, including fingerprints and iris scans,” the New York Times reported. Indian legislators tabled the bill in August amid backlash from privacy advocates and tech giants, though government leaders said a new proposal is forthcoming.

Last year, the Indian government ordered Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to censor about 100 posts, including some authored by high-profile Indian figures, that were merely critical of Modi’s administration and political party. The three platforms complied with the demand, though some of the posts remained up outside of India.

And on Sunday, a new regulation will take effect that requires virtual private network, or VPN, operators to collect personal information about users and provide it to the government upon request. Several companies providing VPN services have abandoned their Indian operations in response, with the Swiss company Proton announcing Thursday that it will join the list.

“It’s going to have a chilling effect. I find it really sad that the world’s largest democracy is taking this path,” Proton CEO Andy Yen told the Wall Street Journal.

If Modi’s administration continues down this path, more tech companies will have to decide whether some moral compromise is worth accessing the Indian road to riches.

NEWSWORTHY

No longer Metamates? Meta is targeting a 10% reduction in company-wide costs in the coming months, a response to this year’s slowdown in revenue growth driven largely by increasing competition from TikTok, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. The Facebook and Instagram parent does not immediately plan to issue layoffs, but company executives are pushing out employees by reorganizing departments and forcing staffers to apply for new roles. Meta also is expected to trim spending on consultants and overhead to reach its goal.

Head in the clouds. The U.K.’s communications regulator is investigating whether Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are violating competition laws through their dominance of the cloud computing market, the Financial Times reported Thursday. The Ofcom regulatory agency said it will “examine the strength of competition in cloud services generally” and the roughly 80% U.K. market share owned by the three companies. Ofcom officials could take enforcement action or recommend rule changes, among other steps, if they find violations of competition statutes.

A dark day in Iran. The Iranian government has restricted access to Instagram and WhatsApp amid a wave of anti-government protests tied to the killing of a 22-year-old woman in police custody. The decision to cut off access to the two sites coincided with a broader shutdown of internet access across Iran, where protesters have clashed with police across the country. Meta-owned Instagram and WhatsApp are the only two global social media platforms still available in Iran.

A crypto succession. Kraken CEO Jesse Powell plans to step down from his post in the near future, ending an 11-year run at the company he cofounded and helped build into one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Powell has served as a high-profile advocate for cryptocurrency adoption, though his libertarian views on workplace culture and political issues has rankled some employees. Powell, who plans to remain as Kraken’s chairman, will relinquish his role once a replacement is found for the company’s new chief executive, current COO Dave Ripley.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

He’s got an ear for it. Apple CEO Tim Cook takes some grief for failing to deliver revolutionary technology on par with the original iPhone, but a Bloomberg Businessweek feature published Thursday argues such criticism overlooks the understated brilliance of AirPods. While Apple doesn’t disclose sales figures for the wireless headphones, industry estimates suggest the company sold an eye-popping 120 million pairs of AirPods last year. If true, that would mean roughly half of revenue in Apple’s “wearables, home, and accessories” division, the company’s fastest-growing category, is attributable to AirPods. (Also: props to the Businessweek illustrator for the magazine’s cover, which features a parka-clad Cook making snow angels in AirPods.)

From the article:

AirPods are fragile, have just-OK bass, and look like the result of a horrific Q-tip accident. They’re easily clogged with earwax, lost in subway grates or couch cushions, and—at least in a handful of cases—swallowed in the wearer’s sleep.

But even if you don’t ingest them, your AirPods will need to be replaced every few years, because their lithium-ion batteries can’t be removed once they’ve run their course. While Apple has said newer versions use more recycled materials, AirPods remain costly both to the environment and our wallets, especially compared with the wired EarPods that came free with the company’s products for most of the past two decades. And yet, as anyone who’s been out in public lately can attest, people love ’em.

Rolling in the grave. The world never got to experience LG’s expandable smartphone, but at least we now know what we missed. Engadget reported Wednesday that a South Korean tech reviewer got his hands on LG’s ill-fated Rollable, a phone-shaped device capable of expanding into a small tablet, and posted a video of the shelved product on YouTube. LG had high hopes for the Rollable, teasing its arrival in January 2021, but the South Korean conglomerate abandoned the smartphone manufacturing business just three months later after failing to gain any significant foothold. While the Rollable had its issues, including a screen with some imperfections, an 11-minute, hands-on video by BullsLab shows just how cool it could have been.",cloud computing,fortune

The groundbreaking partnership between ESA and an SES-led consortium, with the European Commission support, is advancing Europe to the front of space innovation with satellite-enabled QKD. Together with its European partners, SES will build the first sovereign European end-to-end space-based QKD system, developing and operating a dedicated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite and building a state-of-the-art QKD operations centre in Luxembourg. The project is co-funded by the ESA contribution of Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and the Czech Republic under ARTES, as well as the European Commission through Horizon Europe.

Using the EAGLE-1 system, ESA and the European Union Member States will achieve the first step to demonstrate and validate QKD technologies from low earth orbit to the ground. The EAGLE-1 project will provide valuable mission data for next generation Quantum Communication Infrastructures (QCIs), contributing for example to the EU plans to deploy a sovereign, autonomous cross-border quantum secure communications networks.

The EAGLE-1 satellite is due to launch in 2024 and will then complete three years of in-orbit mission supported by the European Commission. During this operational phase, the satellite will allow European Union governments and institutions as well as critical business sectors early access to long-distance QKD to path the way towards an EU constellation enabling ultra-secure data transmissions.

To implement the ultra-secure cryptographic key exchange system of EAGLE-1, the consortium will develop the QKD payload, terrestrial optical station, scalable quantum operational networks and key management system to interface with national QCIs.

Josef Aschbacher, ESA Director General, said, “ European space innovation has gained strong momentum both from a technology perspective and in terms of commercialisation. It allows us to develop and implement next-generation, future-proof projects in space across critical domains like secure communication, next-generation networks and cybersecurity. Led by ESA, partially financed by the European Commission and implemented by SES, EAGLE-1 is a major step towards making the secure and scalable European Quantum Communications Infrastructure a reality.”

Elodie Viau, Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications at ESA, said, “ In today’s increasingly interconnected world, keeping information secure is paramount. Robust encryption keys as well as technologies enabling their secure distribution are vital to this endeavour. We are proud to forge this partnership between ESA and a consortium led by SES to create the EAGLE-1 highly secure and autonomous quantum key distribution system. ESA enables the European space industry to succeed by federating industry around large-scale programmes, achieving competitive leaps forward.”

“ European security and sovereignty in a future world of quantum computing is critical to the success of Europe and its Member States,” said Steve Collar, CEO of SES. “ We are proud to leverage our multi-orbit credentials and our innovative platforms and solutions in partnership with ESA, the European Commission and the Luxembourg Government to advance quantum communications and implement the EAGLE-1 system, which is called to be a cornerstone for the development of secure and sovereign European networks of the future.”

Executives with Novant Health, Whoop, Baptist Health South Florida, Health Union and Alexion Pharmaceuticals are among the featured speakers scheduled to appear at the event, October 12-13, at Convene-Commerce Square, 2001 Market Street, in Philadelphia.

The healthcare and life sciences industries are undergoing a seismic transformation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, with life sciences companies moving from “blockbuster focus” to “patient centric” approaches to drug development and delivery while adapting to new regulations and calls for greater transparency, ISG experts say.

Healthcare payers, meanwhile, are struggling with accelerating digital transformation, regulatory and other pressures in a bid to fend off competition from hyperscalers and other disruptors, while providers look to cope with increasing cost pressures and evolving patient demographics as they adapt to telemedicine, internet of medical things and other emerging trends.

In response to these developments, the future of healthcare will become increasingly more digital, personalized and interconnected, ISG experts say.

“Personalized, digital medicine is no longer coming, it is here, and it will only become more pervasive,” said Jenn Stein, partner, ISG Life Sciences lead and co-host of the event.

Stein pointed to a number of digital innovations reshaping the medical industry, including “mobile and edge computing that facilitates decentralized clinical trials, the digital pill that reports critical ingestion stats, the wearable device that records vital biometrics, and imaging technology that enhances effectiveness of therapies and procedures. All of these will depend on interconnected, interoperative, cloud-based systems and resilient supply chains.”

Automation may be the key to overcoming the current staffing crisis among healthcare providers and attracting younger patients, ISG expert say. Eric Eskioglu, MD, executive vice president and chief medical and scientific officer for Novant Health, will explore the role smart platforms will play in improving patient-centric engagement and provider effectiveness during his industry spotlight presentation on October 13.

Later, Ellen Reilly, strategic advisor, Healthcare and Life Sciences, for advanced fitness and health wearable company Whoop, will explore the critical role of digital therapeutics in expanding patient access, care and efficiencies in a fireside chat with ISG’s Stein.

Digital systems connecting clinical development, patient care and engagement, and supply chain processes are part of a growing collaboration among ecosystem partners that will be explored in a panel discussion between Tony Ambrozie, senior vice president and chief digital information officer for Baptist Health South Florida; George Llado, former senior vice president and chief information officer for Alexion Pharmaceutical, and Ganesh Nathella, business unit head for Mindtree’s health business

Separately, Olivier Chateau, co-founder and CEO of Health Union LLC, will join a panel discussion on how data can drive a better, more personalized future in healthcare.

In the wake of pandemic disruptions, supply chain resiliency also will be a key topic of discussion during the event.

“More than 90 percent of Fortune 1000 companies have experienced significant supply chain disruption over the past two years,” said Bob Krohn, partner, ISG Healthcare, and event co-host. “Creating greater resiliency in the complex healthcare and life sciences supply chains that deliver important healthcare products and therapies means preparing for external headwinds, such as geopolitics, regulations and competitive cost pressures, as well as internal forces, like human talent and working capital, that can impact the supply chain cycle.”

Successful responses to supply chain threats, Krohn said, include “organizational restructuring, targeted acquisition and strategic divestiture to gain greater control of the supply chain, along with digital transformation curated by innovation executives, driven by business leaders and enabled by technology and security experts.”

Additional sessions will explore how digital health is accelerating transformation in the healthcare industry; how data transparency is reducing variation in care and improving experiences, and how analytics are powering personalized patient experiences and streamlining operations. Speakers include Bryan Hill, CTO and vice president, Digital Health & Innovation for Cognizant; Taka Torimoto, lead solutions architect for OutSystems; Paul Watson, vice president, Healthcare & Life Sciences for Hitachi Vantara, as well as ISG experts.

The ISG TechXchange: Healthcare and Life Sciences event is sponsored by Cognizant, CitiusTech, Hitachi Vantara, OutSystems, Capgemini, Mindtree, Onica by Rackspace Technology, LTI, Quantiphi and UiPath. Media sponsors are CIOInsights, CIOReview, the TBM Council and The AI Journal.

September is nearly over, and Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Halloween, Super Saturday, and the festive season will soon be upon us. With the holidays comes increased sales opportunities, driven by increased traffic. When you’re ready for the spikes, you welcome the traffic and the sales. If you’re not, you put both profits and reputation at risk.

The holiday eShopping season presents to your business a chance to shine. It’s time to assess your readiness to manage the increased traffic, and put some appropriate measures in place to guarantee that your customers, many of whom will be new, have the best experience possible.

1. Review your numbers

How much increased activity are you actually expecting? Take a look at your current load, and try to calculate your projected load. Some indication of what to expect can come from figures recorded in previous years, if you have them. These figures won’t always be entirely reliable depending on the dates and days of the week when holidays and promotions fall, what marketing and awareness are being generated, and what the event is. Looking at the percentage increase in previous figures (compared to the normal traffic in the previous year) will help, but is rarely, truly, accurate. A contingency above 20% is always recommended. If you don’t have these figures, we found this document a solid and comprehensive start for general web capacity planning.

It is, in addition, often worth considering traffic after an event. Will there be an increase (above your normal load) in visitor numbers from people redeeming gift certificates or making additional/expanded purchases? Will traffic increase in general, due to increased site awareness and the effects of digital marketing?

2. DDoS protection

Even very short periods of website downtime can be costly in lost sales traffic and serve as a cause of negative PR and alienated potential customers. Protection at the edge, to further minimize the chances of site downtime, helps websites and applications guarantee delivery through automatic optimization. Relying on manual network management and load balancing is no longer an option. Staying ‘up’ in a time of peak activity is critical, and an obvious call for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack mitigation. When traffic peaks, it’s possible to cache pages, minimize page rendering time, and offer patrons a more frictionless user experience. Guaranteeing business continuity without performance impact is crucial, and DDoS protection enables organizations to do this without the added cost of increasing bandwidth.

3. Improve the queuing experience

eCommerce platforms must offer the best possible user experience, even on their busiest days. Setting expectations with your customers can be a real benefit for customer retention. If a potential buyer knows they only have to wait two minutes, they’ll likely wait. If they don’t, they’ll likely get confused, frustrated, leave, and take their money elsewhere.

You may use a virtual online queuing system to streamline the visitor experience during peak traffic times. These branded, first-in-first-out, virtual waiting rooms enable you to communicate to a customer continuously updated estimated remaining wait time. Potential customers remain in the virtual waiting room until it is their turn to access your website.

4. Server scaling

While there are ways around this, you should consider increasing server capacity once you have a realistic estimate of increased traffic. Behind every eCommerce site is a physical group of servers – your server farm, be they local or in the cloud. This provides the computing power necessary to give website visitors the experience they expect, under normal load.

When loads are increased through increased activity, however, it may be necessary to “scale up” server bandwidth and capacity to deal with the additional traffic. This is not as simple as it sounds – especially if your hosting is in-house, requiring new physical resources, rather than in-cloud – and will require detailed prior planning and additional budget. It is also worth noting that, while visitor capacity is obvious, there are other factors to consider. Detailed planning of a variety of elements needs to be conducted, including increased concurrency under increased traffic, guaranteeing consistency, allowing for the difficulty of customers searching at scale within bulk data, and speed.

5. Consider page load time

Do you know how fast your pages load? Google Page Speed Insights will help you find out. Not only is this an SEO ranking factor, but it’s also an important consideration for your eCommerce visitors. A 0-4 second load time is preferable for online conversion, with the highest conversions occurring in the first 2 seconds. With each additional second of load time, website conversion rates drop by an average of 4.42% [Portent].

Using a global content delivery network (CDN) can seriously speed up page load time by employing local PoPs to deliver content, load balancing, content caching, and (in the case of our Imperva CDN) native failover into your Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) platform.

6. Sales support

Have your online chat team primed and ready to offer advice. Getting your support team in sync, and having the right number of informed staff ready to help potential customers, will be vital for the smooth delivery of the sales experience. Organizations need to give customers a minimal amount of friction and the maximum amount of help in their purchase journey.

Capacity testing, interface accustomization, and roleplaying with FAQs can be a big help. Creating scripts for the buyer process, as we would with traditional UX testing, can prepare sales advisors and get them accustomed to interfaces and processes before they have to do so under increased load.

Be ready, or lose out

Customers will go to your competitors if they have a bad experience, and now is the time you can make buyer relationships that last. Starting now, a little prior planning, and a little investment in the right tools, can make all the difference to your busiest sales season and in creating those long-term relationships with customers beyond the holiday season.",cloud computing,imperva.com

Over the past two years, interest in digital transformation has surged because of the increased dependence on remote working models resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Shifting an organization’s applications and data to the cloud introduces numerous benefits, such as reducing operational costs and increasing competitive advantages. However, it also expands an organization’s cyber attack surface and makes them more vulnerable to many cyber threats.

Cybersecurity has become a necessity in almost every industry. But even for technology companies, the nuances of cybersecurity may be outside the domain of the organization’s expertise.

To counter growing cyber threats, organizations of all sizes and industries work daily to strengthen their cyber defenses. Investing in cybersecurity awareness training and installing the latest technological security products (both software and hardware) are how most organizations combat the increased volume of cyber threats. However, in a complex threat landscape that changes almost daily, countering all risks is complicated, and can take a lot of resources if you are going to manage network security on your own.

This article discusses a new cloud-native network security deployment service used to inspect and protect against malicious ingress, egress, and east-west traffic within an organization’s network: network security as a service (NSaaS). It also introduces Trend Micro Cloud One™ — Network Security as a pioneer solution in this field.

What is network security as a service (NSaaS)?

While it is possible to handle cybersecurity concerns by maintaining an in-house cybersecurity team, organizations can also opt for a solution such as network security as a service (NSaaS), alleviating their cybersecurity burden and freeing internal resources.

NSaaS is a modern cloud solution run by a managed security service provider. NSaaS works by controlling and managing all security solutions installed on client network perimeters. The solutions managed include firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), security information and event management (SIEM), and anti-spam systems. It also monitors all digital interactions in the client IT environment to detect cyber threats early and respond to them quickly.

Today’s IT environments are more complex than before. Modern IT environments span on-premises and cloud environments. The variety of users accessing these environments, such as organization employees, third-party vendors, contractors, sub-contractors, and other suppliers, has added even more complexity. The number of internet of things (IoT) devices is also growing, which means more entry points for cyber attackers to exploit.

These emergent issues make handling the security of computer networks without seeking external help from a professionally managed service provider a daunting task, and one rife with potential errors. In cybersecurity, avoiding errors that lead to security problems is crucial because one mistake can ruin the entire business.

An NSaaS provider does more than simply handle the security configuration issues of network perimeters. For instance, NSaaS also takes care of identity and access management and suggests security rules that all users must follow when accessing your IT environment.

NSaaS: The answer to many network security challenges

IT leaders worldwide appreciate the importance of cybersecurity’s capability to mitigate cyber threats and respond to them quickly once they happen. For instance, your in-house cybersecurity teams are responsible for the following duties to ensure the security of your organization's network:

Tracking vulnerabilities in the entire IT environment, including endpoints, servers, IoT, and cloud apps, and working to solve them promptly.

Monitoring security defense solutions, such as IDS and IPS, firewalls, antivirus, antimalware, and SIEM.

Identifying attacks and suspicious activity and responding to them before they escalate.

Acquiring an internal security operations team is possible for large-scale organizations. However, most firms worldwide are small to medium-sized. They cannot afford the cost of having an entire cybersecurity team. For instance, having an internal security operations team can have the following drawbacks:

Budget limitations — Maintaining your in-house security teams requires considerable spending to gather a team of experts with various cybersecurity skills.

Lack of experts — Finding professional cybersecurity experts isn't easy. If your team has many vacant positions that you failed to fill, a threat actor could exploit this to attack your organization.

Challenge to retain — Suppose you have successfully gathered a perfect cybersecurity team. Now, how many team members do you expect to stay with you? For example, experienced members may leave for other companies to increase their salary after a while. In contrast, less professional staff may work with your company for one or two years to accumulate experience and then go to another company.

Difficult to manage — Your cybersecurity team is responsible for all aspects of cybersecurity operations. Managing all team members is difficult because you will always need a reputable manager to oversee teamwork all day, every day.

Outsourcing your cybersecurity needs to an external security provider brings numerous benefits to your organization, such as:

A significant reduction in costs. Maintaining in-house teams will cost you considerable money. For example, hiring one professional cybersecurity engineer will cost you more than $100,000 annually, while outsourcing your entire network security to an external provider will cost you considerably less. Additionally, most NSaaS providers will offer their service on a subscription basis. The client can select the tier that best fits its current workload and increase it later as necessary.

The use of highly professional cybersecurity experts, even when the number of skilled IT experts is small compared to market demand. For example, according to Cybersecurity Ventures , there are 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide. Your managed NSaaS provider can hire the best talent in the field that small and medium-sized (SME) firms cannot afford.

Managed security providers leverage advanced security solutions, such as network detection and response (NDR) and other proprietary solutions, to protect computer networks and data. They use the latest computing technologies (machine learning and artificial intelligence) to detect threats such as unknown malware and zero-day exploits.

Enhancing your overall cyber defenses. Outsourcing your network security protection to an experienced external provider allows your organization to use the latest technological defenses and gain support from professional and knowledgeable cybersecurity experts, who work around the clock to protect sensitive resources from ever-changing threats.

Finally, outsourcing your cybersecurity needs allows your internal IT professionals to focus on organizational objectives while leaving the repetitive tasks of network monitoring and incident handling to a professional external security provider.

This video was recorded on September 21, 2022.

Chris Hill: YouTube is going after TikTok with one of the best weapons they have, financial incentives for video creators. Motley Fool money starts now. I'm Chris Hill joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst Maria Gallagher. Thanks for being here.

Maria Gallagher: Thanks for having me.

Chris Hill: Let me say upfront, we are recording this late morning. This is a couple of hours before the Fed is going to make whatever announcement they make about interest rates. I fully expect it when they make that announcement, there will be some sort of reaction, possibly an overreaction on Wall Street. By the time folks are listening to this just now, we're recording this before that announcement. We're going to dip into the Fool mailbag. But let me start Maria with Alphabet, specifically YouTube, which announced this morning, it has a new revenue sharing model for creators of short-form videos. And for anyone who is wondering about the impact of TikTok on the business world, here is just the latest example of that where Alphabet is saying, OK, what can we do monetarily to get people off TikTok and creating TikTok like videos on our platform.

Maria Gallagher: I also think it can't be overstated the importance of creators to these type of ad revenue based platform. So to talk just a little bit about creators, they're about 50 million people that consider themselves to be influencers, creators online. Only about two million of them do it as their full-time job, but it's actually become an incredibly desired career. Being a YouTuber is one of the most popular answers when you ask kids what they want to be when they grow up. It's actually three times more popular than saying an astronaut, which was historically the most popular answer. So I just think that that's an incredibly interesting shift in the way advertising run that's happened in the last 15-ish, but really the last 5-10 years. Historically, YouTube has paid out it's creators in it's long form videos. But just like you said, they've announced that they're more directly competing with TikTok, that they're helping monetize on their short form videos, as well as something that I think is really important, is they're working with a new music library.

Since one of the major downsides of creating on YouTube is the licensing agreements of using popular music. That's going to be really important for creators as well. I will say that over the past three years, YouTube has paid creators over $50 billion in 2021, YouTube paid more than 15 billion to its creators, which was only about 200 million for TikTok. Just within a creator fund or the YouTube partnership program, it's more lucrative to be on YouTube but that's not including things like paid brand deals that a lot of influencers say make up a lot of their earnings. With a platform like TikTok that's shorter-form, more likely to go viral, that's a really good way for influencers to blow up within TikTok, and then they can monetize themselves really well on YouTube. But I think it's just like you're saying, it's so competitive for these businesses to try and retain those creators. YouTube is really saying TikTok is a threat to what has been a pretty clear dominance that YouTube has had over the past 15 years.

Chris Hill: It was 2019 when Alphabet started breaking out YouTube revenue in their quarterly earnings. I believe the most recent quarter was the slowest rate of revenue growth that they've seen. Clearly, this is an area they are focused on. When do you think we're going to get some evidence that this is working for them, not working for them, because it occurs to me listening to you that one of the ways that they may actually get a groundswell of support here is if they get some early success, then they can get those creators on YouTube shorts to start essentially being ambassadors for how they're making money.

Maria Gallagher: What I think is pretty fascinating about this too, is that it isn't mutually exclusive. If you follow a creator, they're probably going to post the same thing to multiple different platforms in a slight variation. But I think it's going to be hard to see how this competition works out because I don't think it'll say, and now no one's using TikTok anymore. It's just going to say, well now they're also making YouTube shorts. And so I think that's going to be pretty difficult for people to see. I think it's just YouTube trying to make sure not that many creators leave their platform. Trying to keep creators on and helping them monetize. I imagine 15 second videos are easier to make than 15 minute videos, but some people say that actually the shorter the video, the harder it is to make. I have never tried to be an influencer, so I can't comment on if that is true or not. But I think that it's trying to incentive people to not leave the platform, but also say, here's another way you can monetize your platform within YouTube.

Chris Hill: I hadn't thought of that before, but just the idea that this is from a creator standpoint. It is a retention strategy for YouTube to basically give people who have been doing longer form videos, giving them an additional option in terms of making money for themselves?

Maria Gallagher: Yeah, absolutely. It's interesting because I am a person who I really like influencers. I really like creators. I am an advertiser's dream because if I like someone, I'll probably buy whatever they're selling me. So it feels excessive if so many people they have, you see the first time that they tests out of joke, it'll be on Twitter and then they'll maybe make a TikTok about it, and then maybe they'll make a longer form bid about it on YouTube. It's interesting, I think we're seeing within the creator economy, the backstage look at how these things are made. With YouTube shorts, I think that's also going to be another tool of saying, OK, where in the life cycle of a comedian, where in the life cycle of this joke are they with YouTube shorts versus maybe a longer YouTube video that just like a sketch. I just think it's another interesting way to look at how this creator economy is evolving.

Chris Hill: What was the last thing you bought as a result of being influenced by someone on TikTok or YouTube?

Maria Gallagher: I bought vitamins that were really weird. This influencer I like swears by it. It's like a probiotic vitamin that made my stomach hurt.

Chris Hill: Okay. We'll move on to the mailbag, then, our email address is [email protected] We got a question from Sophia in San Diego. Who writes, who is the CEO you would most hate to see leave the company that they're running? I know Craig Jelinek is 70 years old, but I am a happy Costco shareholder and really hope he doesn't retire anytime soon. Thank you for listening and for the question, Sophia. Great question. I'm reminded of Craig Jelinek got the job because longtime CEO, Jim Sinegal step down in the most unceremoniously way, which was they put out their quarterly earnings report and then at the bottom of that report was basically like, Jim Sinegal is stepping down and longtime lieutenant Craig Jelinek is taking over. Whenever Jelinek leaves, I'm expecting it'll be that it's not going to be what we've seen out of say, Starbucks and their CEO transition recently. But to Sophia's question, who's the CEO that you would really hate to see you leave the company?

Maria Gallagher: I think this is a tricky question because you want a CEO to create a company in which when they leave things are OK, so it's a tricky question, but I would say one of my favorite CEOs is probably Lisa Su at AMD. She came in in 2014 and really turned the company around. She decided the company would really go big on building tech for these high performance computing applications, and this set them up to power, Cloud computing, data centers, AI gaming, and with these types of companies, it's really in a 3-5 year lifecycle so you need a CEO who has really good foresight and so I think that that's actually pretty rare to have someone who can see the trends that far in advance and say this is what we're going to focus on because she said, listen, we're not going to focus on phones, sensors for Internet of things. We're going to focus on this other portion and so I really admire her and I think she would be hard to find someone who is as good as she is.

Chris Hill: You're right. Whoever is the next CEO of AMD has a very tough act to follow, but you're also right that, that really should be part of the job, just making sure that the transition to the next leader is as smooth as possible.

Maria Gallagher: Yeah, everyone talks about keyman rescue, you don't want to really have that so interwoven with the performance of your company because that's not a great long-term sustainable strategy.

Chris Hill: Keep the emails coming [email protected] You can also call the Motley Fool Money hotline 703-254-1445. You can leave a question on the voice mail and you may end up hearing your voice on the show. Call us 703-254-1445. Maria Gallagher, always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.

Maria Gallagher: Thanks so much for having me.

Chris Hill: Unlike gymnastics or Olympic high diving, you don't get style points in investing, which means some investors might be making it too difficult on themselves. Ricky Mulvey has more.

Ricky Mulvey: Bear markets are already hard enough to deal with. It's easy to make these periods even more difficult on yourself. Joining us now to talk about how you can make your investing life a little easier is Motley Fool Senior Analysts, contributing learner, Asit Sharma. Asit good to see you.

Asit Sharma: Ricky, good to see you, man.

Ricky Mulvey: Actually, I just got back from Australia, which was a good time. I started thinking about this because on the flight back, people where all just weird stuff onto the plane and the guy sited behind me, this is a 14 hour flight from Sydney to LAX, was in a full suit and tie for the entire time. When we landed in Los Angeles, I looked back and not even the tie was loosened. I started thinking, you get style points, but that doesn't necessarily count for anything. Maybe the same is true in investing.

Asit Sharma: I think it is true investing also, Ricky. Now you and I love to flip things over, so we are going to spot this gentleman. This thought, hey, I'm a business person, I'm a suit. I don't feel comfortable if I'm not dressed in full business Regalia with my tie knotted, even if it's a 14 hour flight, I just wouldn't be comfortable wearing yoga pants.

Ricky Mulvey: I was taking him seriously the entire time.

Asit Sharma: Well, that's actually where I'm landing. I think he could have loosened his tie during the flight rather than get up and stretch and loosen it then and say, wow, what a flight.

Ricky Mulvey: Just to touch. I hope he's doing all right. But I was thinking, what are some of the ways that we just make life unnecessarily difficult on ourselves?

Asit Sharma: The first one's easy for me. It's time management. If I could manage my time better, I think my life would be easier. Knowing this though I don't spend a lot of time trying to get better at managing my time. Now speaking of time, Ricky, sometimes we don't stop to analyze how we can optimize a certain process that's become routinized in our lives. For me example, I had this lamp, the light wasn't right in my working environment, and I went weeks and weeks before I rearranged it. Anybody who's lived in a home with a skateboard or a misplace pair of dumbbells probably has experienced the same thing after awhile the aggravation level, will catch your attention or you'll get a little bit of an injury. [laughs] Then you finally want to make an optimization at that point. You could do it earlier.

Ricky Mulvey: It's called metacognition. It's thinking about how you're think. It's easy to go down some odd paths doing that. Speaking of making things more difficult in investing, I think there are a lot of ways that investors just make their lives more difficult. For the past few years, I look at email inboxes where investors often send questions. Before this, I worked on a call-in radio show. One of the thoughts that always came to my mind is reading these questions, it's like, why are you making this just so difficult on yourself? What are some of the ways you think investors are putting, let's say the weight in front of their toe?

Asit Sharma: First comes to mind something that you shared with me, which I totally agree with, it's when you're checking your brokerage account all the time. The other thing you had mentioned to me, trading on the news cycles. Trying to stand or sit in front of a big screen and watch CNBC and trade that news. That's really difficult. For me I guess when you put all the work on the back-end versus the front end, you're just making it difficult for yourself. By that I mean, we've all done this, I've done this in my career many a times. Let me be honest for once I've done this many times. You buy a stock, you're not really paying much attention. Your portfolio is doing well, the markets doing well, sounds like a good idea, you buy it without much thought. Then the market turns on you, suddenly the stock is down 50, 60, 70 percent and then you're doing a whole lot of work on the back-end. All of a sudden you want to know what does management think about this company's future? When we'll cash flow turn positive? What is their competitive position? Do they have a moat? All the things that might have been well applied in one hour or two hours on the front end, now you're spending weeks and months trying to figure out in many cases. That's making things difficult on yourself.

Ricky Mulvey: I think a lot of investors are going through that right now.

Asit Sharma: Yes, unfortunately.

Ricky Mulvey: What are some of the ways you can make investing easier on yourself? Some ways that you can take that rack of weights away from your foot so you don't stub your toe so much?

Asit Sharma: By the way, Ricky, the research backs me up on that phenomenon. If you look at urgent care nurses, their commentary and standup comedians, are well-documented. I think long-term holding something you and I have discussed diversification. These are bedrock principles, but they make so much sense when you've diversified your portfolio out to at least 25 positions and they go up to 40, 50, I've got basically 70 securities that I hold. You begin to become more adept at position sizing. Suddenly it makes sense to put 1 to 2 to 3 percent in any given position, and keep adding two positions that are rising in your conviction, business results are coming in well. That's a lot easier than, again, working backward where you put 60 percent of your available capital into one idea. Another which you've pointed out to me and I so much agree with this, is just focusing on business. When you're researching the stock, after you've bought the stock, keep focused on the business results because eventually, the stock price will catch up even if the market is this big weight, compressing all values, compressing all multiples. Eventually things normalize and so, the investor who spends time studying and undermstanding great businesses just has to buy those companies and hold onto them. They'll eventually be proven right.

Ricky Mulvey: Focusing on what is at the weighing machine instead of the voting machine.

Asit Sharma: Exactly.

Ricky Mulvey: Then I think I've also heard some Motley Fool Analysts give themselves behavioral rules for buying stocks and index funds. One thing that Jim Gillies mentioned a few weeks back, was that he buy stocks only on down days. Do you apply any similar rules for yourself?

Asit Sharma: I've got one which I use in good markets and bad markets, which is, I won't buy a stock until a weekend has crossed. If it's Monday, I have to wait till the next Monday to buy a stock. This is working for me because I love Saturday mornings, I love Sunday mornings. They're my leisure and creative times, so my mind floats and wanders, I think about the week that went past, I think about the future, I read some fiction, and I do house chores. In that frame of mind, I find that most receptive to make investing decisions. It takes away some of the angst in a down-market that I might be experiencing, or some of the FOMO in an upmarket that makes me want to just buy a stock before I've done my homework and rational thinking about it.

Here's a second one that I use in a market like the one we're in, which is just tough to deal with. I didn't mean to laugh so sarcastically earlier, when we were talking about the markets, I'm suffering too a bit here in my portfolio. But I give myself permission to sit out a few weeks if I need to. Sometimes we think that we as investors must be pretty active in the markets. Even if like myself, you're investing every paycheck, a little bit of the money that comes into your checking account. You could sit that out. I did that this spring. It must have been, four, five weeks where I didn't make any investments, even though I'm a dollar-cost averager by nature. That was good for me, so those couple of rules come to mind.

Ricky Mulvey: You mentioned active trading makes investing more difficult. I think that's why you see so many professional investors lose money. Morgan Housel on a recent blog post pointed out that it was 80 percent of them, and then that's compared to the S&P 500, and he pointed out two reasons. One of which is that professionals need other people's money to invest, and then number 2, entry barriers are low. The stat he pointed out that kind of shocked me was that there are more mutual funds in the United States than Starbucks locations, which maybe that shouldn't be shocking because it's easier to open a mutual fund than a Starbucks. But I still found that surprising. What is your takeaway from that 80 percent number and what do you think that means for individual investors who were making this game even more difficult?

Asit Sharma: Charley Ellis is this famed investment consultant to big institutions, endowment funds, pension plans, etc. These guys manage hundreds of billions of dollars collectively. He's expressed some similar sentiments in an article called The Loser's Game, which he later made into a book. The ideas you've got all these hoards of smart, well-educated managers being turned out every year, and they've got a wealth of information right at their fingertips; it makes it harder for all but a few to beat each other at the same came. He also mentions the high costs that are associated with active funds versus passive funds. Sure, they may show a low fee, like a one percent fee, but they've got operational costs that create a hurdle for their investment returns. Now here's the interesting thing Ricky, Charley Ellis wrote this article in 1975. These insights he gave is about 50 years ago, coming on 50 years ago. This has been apparent for some time and it's going to be apparent, I think even going forward. Active investing is a hard game. That's why if you look at our investment principles, Motley Fool's investment principles, they mirror and borrow from passive ETF style hold for the long-term investing.

Ricky Mulvey: We do like the individual companies and as we close out, investing isn't just difficult for yourself, it's difficult for the companies you own. One way, that the investing life of the companies you own can be a little bit easier is by having a great balance sheet. When you think about a company that's making its life easier on itself right now, who do you think of?

Asit Sharma: First, I want to hear from you because you gave a great example when we were talking about this episode and then I'll give mine.

Ricky Mulvey: I'm not the analyst here, my job is supposed to be easy Asit.

Asit Sharma: Let me talk about your example then. Go ahead.

Ricky Mulvey: I was thinking about The Trade Desk, going into a tough advertising market environment. But they have a fortress like balance sheet. We were talking about working capital earlier and I think that makes it easier for them to weather this storm versus some of the other high-flying tech companies we often talk about.

Asit Sharma: I agree. I mean, spot-on, they've got $1.5 billion of net working capital on their books, no long-term debt. What if they have a couple of quarters where all kinds of companies are pulling back their advertising budgets and they don't do well. That hasn't been the case, actually, they've been thriving. But you'd sleep well at night as a shareholder. The company that I wanted to talk about has a little bit weaker balance sheet with some good reasons than it's had in previous years. But it has monster free cash flow and that's Adobe. Now I know a lot of you investors were taken aback by Adobe's, offer to buy a company called Figma for about 50 times its annualized recurring revenue. It's a $20 billion deal, half cash, half stock. The thing that occurred to me about Adobe over the weekend, Ricky, is they are going to generate $50 billion prof in free cash flow over the next five years. Even if they totally whiff on this deal, they've made it much easier on themselves in a very uncertain macroeconomic environment to pull up a smaller competitor. If they have to ride off some goodwill, it's not going to be a huge deal to them. Monster free cash flow, strong balance sheets, they make it easier on these companies in times of stress and dress.

Ricky Mulvey: Asit Sharma, always pleasure, thank you for your time.

Asit Sharma: Thank you so much Ricky. This is so much fun.

Chris Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

377,Propelling Python Into the Next Decade: Anaconda’s OSS Vision,https://assets.anaconda.com/production/Blog/iStock-530758656.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=82&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1663686629&s=5dd85f92448ba47a2679ef0a26dbef01,22/09/2022,"This year marks Anaconda’s 10th anniversary, and we’ve been taking time to reflect on all we’ve accomplished as a company and as part of the Python open-source development community—and to think about where we are going from here.

There is still so much to do, and in this blog post I’ll try to provide a snapshot of where we see some new challenges for Python and where Anaconda’s open-source development work is heading.

Before jumping into an extensive vision document like this, it is important to acknowledge its limited perspective. I want to talk about the problems that Anaconda open-source software (OSS) developers are focusing on, but this is not a proclamation that these are the problems everyone in the Python ecosystem should focus on. OSS works best when there is a diversity of perspectives, priorities, and skills operating asynchronously to explore the space of possible software. Only one of us has to uncover a good idea, craft a useful bit of code, or write an excellent document for us all to benefit. The goal should be to find a place where each of our perspectives and skill sets can have a positive impact, and this blog post is a reflection of where we think Anaconda is well situated to help move open-source Python forward.

What makes Python great?

Before talking about what we want to see in the next 10 years of Python, I first want to stop and discuss why we want Python to continue to be a popular language. Python has come to dominate a wide range of programming use cases for a variety of reasons:



It is easy enough for non-traditional programmers to learn.

It is powerful and versatile enough for experts to create complex software.

There is a path from Python user to Python ecosystem contributor for people with different levels of software development expertise.

It is readily available for all major desktop operating systems and reasonably portable to many platforms.

Domain experts in a wide range of areas build specialized packages for themselves and their colleagues.

Python is easy to interface to other software, whether that is in the form of loading compiled libraries from other languages, communicating with servers over a network, or system orchestration with good old-fashioned command-line scripts.

Of course there are ways in which Python falls short of these ideals, but it has been successful enough at meeting them to become one of the top languages in the world. We want to lean into these strengths and keep pushing Python to become a computational tool that anyone can use anywhere—which is a challenge, as there are large segments of “anyone” and “anywhere” that Python will miss out on without exploring in some new directions.

What are the new challenges Python faces?

The goal of making Python into something “anyone can use anywhere” is becoming harder to achieve as we are presented with more and more computing options. For so much of Python’s existence, the vast majority of developers only had to worry about a small number of chip vendors and operating systems, new platforms were slow to emerge, and more exotic system architectures were generally only available to a handful of expert developers and users. A number of technology trends have permanently broken this status quo, and while many Python developers have worked hard to adapt Python to the new reality, there is still a lot of work to do.

Trend #1 - An Evolutionary Explosion of Silicon

Through much of the history of the microcomputer, we could rely on hardware performance to increase year over year, without requiring any fundamental changes to the software we were writing. This ceased to be true in the mid-2000s, as multi-core central processing units (CPUs) transitioned from exotic to essentially mandatory to continue to improve the performance of general purpose CPUs. Since then, we have seen the rise of chip specialization to squeeze out more performance from a fixed power budget, including such things as vector instruction sets, graphics processing units (GPUs), AI accelerators, on-chip hardware accelerated video codecs, and an explosion of silicon startups trying to bring other novel ideas to market.

In one sense, Python, as a high-level interpreted language, is amazing for being able to write code that runs on many different chip architectures, as long as someone has done the heavy lifting to port the Python interpreter and recompile all the needed Python extension modules. However, that same Python interpreter has many assumptions baked in, which makes usage of multicore CPUs challenging and doesn’t directly offer any help for taking advantage of the multitude of specialized accelerator technologies (like GPUs) that are available. That work has fallen to a booming ecosystem of Python modules, but each has had to basically build their own compiler infrastructure from scratch to support these new forms of computing. For the majority of smaller Python projects, adding accelerated computing support is still very daunting.

Trend #2 - The Blurring of the Computer and the Cluster

For most of us, the thing we program is a single “computer,” which we imagine as an operating system running on a CPU which has access to data in one of three locations: RAM, “disk” (SSD or otherwise), and the network. RAM is much faster than disk, and disk is similarly much faster than the network. For compute-bound workloads, we often ignore the speed of the disk and the network as one-time startup costs, and imagine RAM as a uniformly fast source of data, regardless of how it is laid out in memory or what CPU core is accessing it. Data is either “in memory” or not, and we don’t need to worry about anything else beyond that.

In reality, computer architectures are much more varied and complex. We have servers with huge numbers of CPU cores with non-uniform access to memory, potentially multiple levels of non-volatile memory with different speed and latency characteristics, accelerators (like GPUs) with their own memory systems and interconnect strategies, and extremely fast and low-latency networking technologies. The inside of a computer is looking more like a cluster, with resources connected by a dizzying array of bus technologies. At the other extreme, high-performance networking and cluster orchestration tools are making the boundaries between servers in a rack or a data center more fuzzy. As a result, it will be critical to have Python tools (like Dask, to name one example) that allow users to easily partition computations across many compute domains, manage data locality, and move compute to data whenever possible.

Trend #3 - Cloud Computing Goes Mainstream

Back in the early days of Anaconda (when we were still called Continuum Analytics), one of the common points of discussion I had with enterprise customers was if and when they would be migrating some of their workloads to cloud computing services. Those timelines were often in the hazy future, but now that time of transition is mostly past. Cloud computing is now part of every organization’s IT strategy (if only as part of a hybrid approach), and cloud technologies have trickled down to become part of many individual developers’ and research scientists’ toolboxes (see Pangeo, for example).

This trend does not bring many new challenges to Python itself, as most cloud APIs are already paired with excellent Python libraries. Instead, cloud computing has lowered the capital costs of using all the new technologies coming from trends #1 and #2. In minutes, anyone with a credit card can have access to a server or a whole cluster with cutting-edge CPU, memory, and networking technologies. The only thing stopping such a user from benefiting from this amazing hardware will be the flexibility of their software stack and the ease with which they can port their code to actually take advantage of it—or lack thereof.

Trend #4 - The Death and Rebirth of the Personal Computer

When the Anaconda Distribution first was created, the hardest problem to solve was getting the most popular Python data science packages built and working on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Although incompatible in various ways, these three desktop operating systems are much more similar than they are different. Python is well-adapted to a UNIX-like world of command lines, files, sockets, processes, and threads, which are present in some form on every popular desktop operating system. With some caveats, a Python user can feel very at home developing on any one of these platforms.

However, the past 10 years have seen a massive shift in the computing landscape. More people than ever before have access to a “personal computer,” but they are not the traditional “PCs” that Python grew up with. The most common personal computing systems are now phones, tablets, and Chromebooks. Even on desktop systems, most users spend a huge amount of time using a web browser. As a result, the most popular software platforms in 2022 are (1) the web and (2) mobile operating systems like iOS and Android. The distinguishing feature of these new platforms is that they are radically different from the desktop operating systems of old. There are significant security restrictions on file and network access, they have no built-in command-line interfaces by default, and software distribution mechanisms are entirely unfamiliar to someone used to writing Python scripts. Nevertheless, web browsers and mobile devices are where the next generation of Python users need to learn how to code and share their work. How do we give them the tools to do so?

How can we help Python meet these challenges?

We can’t tackle these challenges with one magic solution, but rather we need several overlapping, complementary strategic directions that will support each other. We’ve identified five areas here at Anaconda where we believe we are well positioned to have an impact. Each of these areas is bigger than any single open-source project, but I’ll mention a few example projects along the way. The list will not be comprehensive, nor should it imply that we think other projects don’t also address these issues. We will need a variety of approaches from many different groups to tackle the challenges before us.

Strategy #1 - We need more compilers, both broad and narrow.

The key tool in the mapping of human-readable programs to hardware-executable machine code is the compiler. We might imagine that Python, as an interpreted language in its most common implementation, doesn’t need to worry about compilers, but we’ve seen evidence that compiler techniques are essential for enabling Python to improve performance. But Python doesn’t need a single, universal compiler; it needs a whole range of compiler tools to address different needs.

At the broadest scale, we want to see Python interpreters that can incorporate just-in-time compilation methods to remove some of the overhead from executing a dynamically-typed language. As many have pointed out, Python’s design makes this very challenging, but there is a lot more we can do for the majority of Python users out there. Efforts like the Faster CPython work happening at Microsoft, as well as projects like Pyston and PyPy, are all using various compiler techniques to try to speed up every Python program. More work can be done here, not exclusively limited to single thread performance. We also think the nogil fork of CPython is very promising and hope to see ideas from it incorporated into the Python interpreter.

Complementary to the broad approach of improving the Python interpreter, there is also space for more focused compilers to tackle specific domains or unique hardware targets. As one example, Anaconda has been developing Numba with the PyData community for a decade at this point, and it has been adopted by a wide range of users doing scientific and numerical computing. Numba’s focus on numerical computing, primarily with NumPy arrays, has allowed it to achieve extremely high speedups (anywhere from 2x to 200x) on user code. We’ve seen various ways that Numba’s limited scope and extensibility has allowed it to be ported to non-NumPy data structures as well as to new hardware targets. We think this idea could be pushed further to inspire the creation of a set of modular components for both ahead-of-time as well as just-in-time (and hybrid!) compiler use cases. This would further expand adoption of compiler methods in the ecosystem, and make Numba just one example of a broad class of compilers used in Python projects.

Note that adjacent, and very relevant, to the compiler discussion is that of distributing compiled software. This is where we continue to believe conda will be extremely important as we need to be able to deliver a wide range of compiled libraries and applications (not just Python) to an ever-increasing number of platforms. Some of these platforms will be very unusual, like web browsers and embedded systems, so conda capabilities will need to continue to grow.

Strategy #2 - Expand our toolbox of data models.

One underappreciated aspect of the success of projects like Numba and Dask is that their creation depended on the widespread prior adoption of projects like NumPy and pandas. These projects gave Python users a common vocabulary and mental model for working with data in bulk as multi-dimensional arrays (NumPy) or dataframes (pandas). In the case of Dask, these high-level APIs were generally quite amenable to parallel computation and could be ported directly to Dask’s container APIs. This meant that a NumPy or pandas user could switch to Dask, parallelize their computation over dozens of nodes, and not actually have to learn many new concepts. In the case of Numba, the benefits of NumPy usage are more low level. Because NumPy arrays have a well-understood and simple memory layout, it is possible for tools like Numba to generate efficient machine code on the fly to work with NumPy arrays, in a way that is not possible for data stored as collections of Python objects. Without broad use of NumPy arrays as the standard way to manipulate numerical data, Numba would have had a much harder time gaining adoption in the ecosystem.

Arrays and dataframes have been much of the focus of the last decade, but there are other kinds of data out there. We’ve recently become more involved in projects to promote other data models in the Python ecosystem, such as the Awkward Array project. Awkward Array comes from the high-energy physics community, which needs to work with large semi-structured datasets that have nested lists of variable size and missing data. Data of this variety is very awkward (hence the name) to work with in the form of NumPy arrays or pandas dataframes, but is seen in a variety of applications. Similarly, we have also been working on improving adoption of sparse matrices, especially the expanded definition of them that comes from GraphBLAS. GraphBLAS is an attempt to create the standard building blocks of graph algorithms using the language of linear algebra. We think there is much potential for tools like GraphBLAS in the Python ecosystem, and their usage will make future work on parallelizing and scaling computations on sparse and irregularly-shaped data much easier.

Strategy #3 - A computer is a cluster, and a cluster is a computer.

Thanks to projects like Dask (and several others), Python has a robust set of tools for working with large data sets on clusters of computers. The essence of these tools is to partition datasets into independent pieces, minimize data motion, and bring the computation to the data whenever possible. This enables efficient scaling in a world where communication latency and bandwidth are significant constraints. At the same time, these tools provide a very useful abstraction layer over the cluster, allowing a user to program it as if it was a single system, leaving a scheduler to decide how and where to execute code. Making the distributed computing paradigm as easy as possible will continue to be an ongoing goal here at Anaconda.

It is equally valuable to think about programming a single computer as if it were a cluster. At a hardware level, this is already somewhat true as systems can be composed of multiple CPU cores with “preferred” memory regions where access is faster. Additionally, computation could be happening within a server on accelerator devices (like GPUs) with their own distinct memory from the CPU. Somewhat unique to Python, however, is the biggest problem, which is that the Global Interpreter Lock in Python limits the ability of even compiled extensions to fully utilize a high core count system with a single Python process. Long term, we need to tackle issues like the global interpreter lock (GIL) (but not only the GIL!) that hold Python back in multithreaded workloads. In the meantime, tools like Dask provide a good interim solution, which is starting a set of Python processes on a single system and partitioning work between them. Dask’s lightweight architecture is perfect for use on a single computer, but there are additional tricks we can play to make the “single system cluster” use case more efficient. Given the availability of very large servers on the cloud, we think there is a lot of potential upside to improving efficiency of Python on high core count servers.

Strategy #4 - The network is your data lake.

Much of the previous discussion has focused on computation: how to describe computation, how to speed it up, and how to partition it across many computers. Equally important, but less talked about, is the I/O side of the equation. Where is your data and how easily and efficiently can you load it?

The most obvious answer is to put all your data in one place, and in a small number of file formats. This sort of standardization is an attractive option, and some organizations can spend the needed resources to create and enforce consistent usage of a data lake. However, many organizations (and most individuals) do not have it in their power to fully enforce a data lake, leaving data workers to deal with a proliferation of data sources across many different systems and file formats. In fact, the ability to quickly integrate new data sources into an analysis, without having to wait for a proper data lake integration, could be a competitive advantage for some groups.

In much the same way we are betting on computational heterogeneity, we are also betting on data heterogeneity. Data will live where it lives, and while centralizing and organizing it is a worthy goal for many groups, the task will never be complete and tools need to acknowledge that reality. Toward this end, we work on a number of projects designed to give Python users easy access to the widest possible range of data storage systems and file formats. Fsspec has become a popular filesystem-like abstraction layer for many projects (including Dask) that allows files stored locally, in object storage on the cloud (like S3), or in various server APIs (like Google Drive), to all be treated the same way. On top of these abstractions, we created Intake, which offers a flexible plugin architecture and a lightweight YAML-based specification for catalogs of data sources. Intake is designed to work equally well with tools like NumPy and pandas, as well as Dask for larger distributed workloads.

The most recent of our additions to the data access space is a project called Kerchunk, which allows indexing of archival data formats that are usually not designed for efficient cloud computing. Kerchunk can scan a potentially large set of files in a variety of formats (such as NetCDF, TIFF, etc.) and build a metadata index of the data to enable modern tools, like Xarray, to access this data much more efficiently, and without the need to transcode the data first. Being able to make all data, even older data, easily usable in a cloud environment is a key part of our Python strategy.

Strategy #5 - Embrace the post-PC world.

10 years ago, there was a tendency among many PyData developers to ignore platforms they personally did not use, usually Windows. Resources were scarce, and many maintainers were volunteers, so why should they pay attention to a platform that they were unfamiliar with and was hard to test? This was not an unreasonable attitude, but it would have excluded a huge number of users from the Python ecosystem if not for the efforts of a handful of enthusiasts (shout out to Christoph Golke, among others) who kept Windows support on PyData alive. Windows users of Anaconda were some of the most grateful users I encountered at conferences when I was working at the Anaconda booth. Eventually, the emergence of free continuous integration services with Windows, macOS, and Linux support made all three major desktop operating systems nearly co-equal citizens in the PyData ecosystem.

I believe we are on the verge of making a Windows-scale mistake again by treating the web browser and mobile operating systems as “too strange” to be first-class Python platforms. For sure, the limitations of these platforms are much more significant than the differences between Windows and Linux. Nevertheless, the sheer number of users for whom these are the primary computing platforms is enormous. We need to jump in and figure out what Python should be on these platforms, or risk having a whole generation of computer users miss out on the great things that the Python ecosystem has to offer.

Now, we don’t have to start from scratch here. Python has been visible in the browser for many years thanks to “notebook” projects like Jupyter (and influential older projects, like Sage). Jupyter provides a browser-based front end to running code in a kernel (usually Python) that executes outside the browser. The Python kernel runs as a normal application somewhere, either on the user’s computer, or a remote server, and communicates with the web-based frontend via a websocket. This architecture cleverly sidesteps all the constraints of code execution inside a web browser, but means that a Jupyter notebook is not truly self-contained. I can view a notebook, but cannot interact with it, unless I create a Python environment somewhere and start up Jupyter to load the notebook.

Our long history of work connecting Python to the browser also includes the stack of data visualization projects we helped to create and popularize, such as Bokeh, Datashader, HoloViz, and Panel. These projects are all designed to empower Python developers to create live, interactive data visualizations in the web browser, but without having to become experts in an entirely new stack of front-end technologies. We’ve seen many users create amazing things when given the ability to target the browser from Python.

But, what if we could go one step further and push the Python runtime itself into the browser? In fact, JupyterLite is already doing this for notebooks! Thinking more broadly, there are a lot of great things we can build if we treat Python as a first-class language inside the browser and leverage the extensive library of Python packages we already have. Along these lines, we are very interested in the potential for WebAssembly to bring many language communities (not just Python) to the browser. Python is already a universal glue between many languages and libraries on the desktop. Putting it into the browser (with projects like Pyodide and PyScript) has the potential to now glue the best packages from the Python world together with Javascript. The work will be challenging, and many things will simply not be possible within the confines of browser security models, but even support in the browser for some or most of what Python can do will enable many great applications to be built.

For mobile operating systems, the situation is somewhat simpler. Both iOS and Android are much closer to macOS/Linux than web browsers, and Python can run with much fewer modifications. Most of the challenges here relate to providing Python interfaces to native interfaces (both GUI and other platform services) and automating the unfamiliar process of packaging applications for various app stores. This is where a project like BeeWare is very exciting, with subprojects tackling each of these issues: Toga (GUI), Rubicon (native API bridges), and Briefcase (app packaging). The more platform knowledge that can be baked into BeeWare, the easier it will be for a Python developer of any skill level to turn their prototype into an app and share it with a much wider audience.

Can we do this?

In short, yes! The explosive growth of the PyData ecosystem over the past decade has given today’s Python users capabilities and features that were difficult to imagine in 2012. Interactive data visualizations in the browser, GPU-accelerated computing in Python, and effortless distributed computing in a Jupyter notebook all seemed like distant goals back then, but they are a reality now. Imagine what we can do in another decade with an even bigger community than we had back then.

But, we will have to do it together. The ideas described in this post will be much of the focus of Anaconda’s OSS efforts, but these ideas will not reach their potential if our small team is the only one working on them. We hope others will also be inspired to tackle these areas, either by joining us on key projects, or going off and trying out their own ideas. As long as we stay focused on our individual strengths, continue to expand the community of contributors, and learn from each other, great things will happen!

VMblog: Can you please introduce Traefik Labs, the company you founded?

Emile Vauge: Of course. My name is Emile Vauge, and I am a software developer that became an entrepreneur by accident. A few years ago, I needed to build an infrastructure that could deploy thousands of microservices, and I needed to find a way to manage network traffic automation. I started dreaming of a dynamic reverse proxy, natively integrated with orchestrators, which didn't exist at the time. This led to me creating Traefik Proxy, an open source reverse proxy written in Go, in 2015. I launched Traefik Labs to develop the product into the fully automated reverse proxy and load balancer that has become. Today, Traefik Proxy has over 3 billion downloads, 39K stars on GitHub, and 700 contributors.

VMblog: Open source is at the heart of Traefik Labs since its inception. What does it mean to be an open source company?

Vauge: I knew from the beginning that I wanted Traefik Proxy to tap into the vision and support that an open source community can provide. Open source truly is the best way to create a great product. Open source products are built for and by the public, and being an open source company means interacting with community users and contributors at every step of the way. It involves being transparent and clean in all aspects, as open source projects maintain significant public exposure. All in all, this creates an accelerated feedback loop between users and developers that leads to a superior product.

VMblog: Traefik Proxy counts over 3 billion downloads and is in the top 10 of the most downloaded projects from Docker Hub. To what do you attribute this success?

Vauge: At the heart of this answer is the simple truth that Traefik Proxy is a great product that solves an acute need. It allows teams deploying microservices to route traffic with simplicity, and it integrates with your existing infrastructure components, configuring itself automatically and dynamically. But having a great product is not enough. Traefik Proxy has been a part of the cloud native revolution from the beginning and is a leading player driving its advancement. Today, every developer working with containers recognizes Traefik and its innate simplicity. It is a brand built, driven, and loved by the community.

VMblog: Traefik Proxy has a long history of open governance and community contributions. How is the growth of Traefik Proxy led by the community?

Vauge: It's easy to build open source projects when the community is small enough for everyone to know each other. It becomes much harder when the community consists of many thousands of people. Traefik Proxy grew very quickly in adoption, and the number of PRs, questions, and issues coming from the community became overwhelming. We had no choice but to create strong structures to handle requests. We automated processes to merge PRs, welcomed external contributors, and hired maintainers to join the project. Clear documentation, processes, and governance have been absolutely crucial. Most importantly, we prioritized the way we communicate our roadmap. Anyone interested in joining the community can visit our open roadmap to understand and interact with the ways Traefik Proxy might develop.

VMblog: Your mission at Traefik Labs is to make networking boring. What is the next step?

Vauge: The market is continuing to mature, and the next big challenge involves enabling multi-cluster Kubernetes so companies can scale. This is why we recently launched Traefik Hub, a cloud native networking platform that helps companies publish and secure containers from the origin up to the edge instantly. This is becoming increasingly necessary for companies hoping to bring computing power closer to the end-user, so applications can become faster and more performant. Traefik Hub provides developers with a centralized dashboard through which they can scale into the edge, across different regions and multiple clusters. It allows any developer with or without strong skills in networking to publish services anywhere. While Traefik Proxy made management of the reverse proxy and ingress control boring, Traefik Hub will make multi-cluster Kubernetes boring.

Mark Russinovich, the chief technology officer of Microsoft Azure, says developers should avoid using C or C++ programming languages in new projects and instead use Rust because of security and reliability concerns.

Rust, which hit version 1.0 in 2020 and was born at Mozilla, is now being used within the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), at Meta, at Amazon Web Services, at Microsoft for parts of Windows and Azure, in the Linux kernel, and in many other places.

Engineers value its ""memory safety guarantees,"" which reduce the need to manually manage a program's memory and, in turn, cut the risk of memory-related security flaws burdening big projects written in ""memory unsafe"" C or C++, which includes Chrome, Android, the Linux kernel, and Windows.

Also: Understanding Microsoft's grand vision for building the next generation of apps

Microsoft drove home this point in 2019 after revealing 70% of its patches in the past 12 years were fixes for memory safety bugs due largely to Windows being written mostly in C and C++. Google's Chrome team weighed in with its own findings in 2020, revealing that 70% of all serious security bugs in the Chrome codebase were memory management and safety bugs. It's written mostly in C++.

""Unless something odd happens, it [Rust] will make it into 6.1,"" wrote Linus Torvalds Monday, seemingly ending a long-running debate over Rust becoming a second language to C for the Linux kernel.

The Azure CTO's only qualifier about using Rust is that it was preferable over C and C+ for new projects that require a non-garbage-collected (GC) language. GC engines handle memory management. Google's Go is a garbage-collection language, while the Rust project promotes that Rust is not. AWS engineers like Rust over Go because of the efficiencies it offers without GC.

""Speaking of languages, it's time to halt starting any new projects in C/C++ and use Rust for those scenarios where a non-GC language is required. For the sake of security and reliability. the industry should declare those languages as deprecated,"" Russinovich wrote.

Also: The most popular programming languages and where to learn them

Rust is a promising replacement for C and C++, particularly for systems-level programming, infrastructure projects, embedded software development, and more -- but not everywhere and not in all projects.

Indeed, Russinovich added later: ""There is an enormous amount of C/C++ that will be maintained and evolve for decades (or longer). Last night I coded a feature for Handle, adding to the roughly 85,000 lines of Sysinternals C/C++ code I've written. That said, I'll bias towards Rust for new tools.""

Rust is certainly moving forward and is likely to be in the Linux kernel soon.

The AOSP, which is a Linux distribution, started using Rust on new code in April 2021 but left its C/C++ code base in place. That month, AOSP also backed calls for Rust as an option for new code in the Linux kernel.

Also: Windows 11 22H2: These are the big new security features

Meta recently promoted Rust as a primary supported server-side language alongside C++. AWS invests in Rust for infrastructure software. Azure engineers have used it to build cloud tools for testing WebAssembly modules in Kubernetes. On the other side, the Chrome team is tied to C++ for the foreseeable future, despite interest in Rust; simply switching to Rust wouldn't eliminate a significant proportion of security vulnerabilities for years, they said. Instead, Chrome is bringing memory safety to its C++ code base.

Also, Rust shouldn't be viewed as a silver bullet for all the bad habits developers practice when coding in C or C++.

Bob Rudis, a cybersecurity researcher for GreyNoise Intelligence, who was formerly with Rapid7, noted developers can carry across the same bad security habits to Rust.

""Given what it takes (time/money/people/services) to make ""real"" C/C++ projects safe-r at any speed, I tend to agree [with Russinovich]. Having said that, it's possible to bring the same bad practices to Rust,"" he wrote.

ZDNet's Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols broadly agreed with that sentiment:

""As others have said, you can write ""safely"" in C or C++, but it's much harder, no matter what dialect you use than it is in Rust. Mind you, you can still foul up security in Rust, but it does avoid a lot of old memory problems.""",cloud computing,zdnet

CIOs are tasked with managing seemingly endless amounts of data, but they can’t unlock insights without a system that breaks down silos to provide a unified view.

One solution many CIOs are considering, according to a recent study by Forrester Consulting commissioned by Elastic, is to deploy a consolidated platform based on search-powered technology that can analyze log data to simplify and optimize IT environments.

This creates a powerful one-two punch for IT teams: an observability and APM solution, combined with a security solution, both running on the same unified, search-powered technology platform.

A consolidated observability and security platform uses one of the most basic technology outputs — the log file — to reveal real-time insights in an IT ecosystem. Log files collect data on system errors, network traffic, device configurations, and much more.

Many IT teams are adopting open-source log analysis tools, which offer an economical, practical way to do things like flagging potential cyberattacks and creating a network outage map to diagnose the cause of downtime. However, as systems get more elaborate, IT teams need help plucking grains of insight from sand dunes of data.

Read this next: Observability can be the secret to enabling the board room

For example, Jaguar Land Rover, one of the world’s most celebrated luxury car brands, uses an observability platform to guide the development of increasingly sophisticated in-car computer systems. The platform’s anomaly detection helps engineers diagnose rare problems that crop up in the product development lifecycle.

“Our leadership teams and engineers are extremely busy, so it really reduces pressure when they only have to act on exceptions while allowing the technology to handle the rest,” said Andy Walker, Senior Project Manager at Jaguar Land Rover.

Another organization, WePay, a transaction management service, upgraded to an observability platform to help manage an increasingly sophisticated cloud-native development environment.

“We needed to consolidate our monitoring and compliance tools to streamline the log analytics and improve the performance of our infrastructure and applications,” said Kartik Deshpande, a software engineer with WePay.

The goal is to dig deep into log data to make IT environments observable. This pays off in two areas: monitoring and observability, and cybersecurity.

How logging factors in

Software developers lean heavily on log-data analysis tools, which are essential in distributed systems with multiple dependencies. A microservices infrastructure, for instance, could have dozens of event-driven services. Log data can reveal breakdowns in these systems.

Log-based observability platforms arose to solve common problems for software developers. Today, these same platforms can help enterprise IT teams understand what’s going right (and wrong) on their networks.

Logging software data has three subsets:

Telemetry: Data transmitted by applications and devices. Telemetry could include IP addresses, error codes, and installed system software.

Metrics: Measurements revealing the performance of a system. Metrics might include page-load times, downtime, and latency.

Traces: Visualizations of paths that data and resources take through a distributed system. Traces can help reveal breakdowns between interconnected services.

A powerful consolidated observability platform combines telemetry, metrics, and traces to provide comprehensive real-time insights on the health of an IT system.

Monitoring and observability

Robust log analysis tools allow IT teams to monitor users, network traffic, completed transactions, and other informative data points. A consolidated observability platform takes things to the next level, generating awareness that allows quick, intelligent responses to problems in three areas:

Applications: A modern, distributed ecommerce website often has separate applications or microservices services for transactions, translations, currencies, returns, and other operations. Observability reveals problems or breakdowns in these systems.

Environments: An ecommerce company folds its transaction platform into a technology environment with apps for logistics, marketing, personnel, and resource management. Observability technology helps break down data silos and pinpoint troublemakers.

Anomalies: If a network switch fails or a wildfire takes out a data center, logging systems send error messages that make it easier to get systems back online.

Observable applications and environments establish criteria for system health and flag deviations from standards. This provides a strong foundation for securing sensitive data.

Cybersecurity

Mobile computing and internet-of-things sensors exponentially increased the number of network endpoints, making it increasingly difficult to lock out intruders. A consolidated observability platform helps IT teams in two crucial cybersecurity disciplines:

Next-generation security information and event management (SIEM). Next-gen SIEM uses artificial intelligence and machine language (AI/ML) to notice subtle anomalies that older SIEM systems missed. AI/ML apps need massive datasets to improve accuracy over time without human intervention. An observability platform processes data in the volumes required for AI/ML.

Extended detection and response (EDR and XDR). EDR and XDR provide comprehensive detection and response across mobile devices, network endpoints, cloud environments, and other target-rich areas outside the traditional enterprise network perimeter.

“Complexity is only going up,” said Gagan Singh, VP of product marketing at Elastic. “You may not be aware of every aspect, every service, every infrastructure component” in your operating environment. “But you're still probably responsible for some aspect of maintaining it, operating it, and running it.”

With consolidated observability platforms, IT teams can see through a tangle of devices, apps, and data, and learn what’s really going on in their environments. That’s crucial to both reducing downtime and thwarting intruders.

Analyst Brian White, who has a buy rating and a $215 price target on Salesforce (CRM), noted that the announcement of the Genie platform was likely the biggest announcement from the cloud computing giant, as it is a “a hyperscale real-time data platform"" that can help the company's customer relationship management platform extend even further than before.

The company described it as ""the heart of real-time Customer 360,"" with Genie ingesting and storing real-time data streams at massive scale, while also combining it with real-time transactional data.

At the investor day, Salesforce (CRM) management, led by Co-CEO Marc Benioff, Co-CEO Bret Taylor and CFO and President Amy Weaver, said customers want to buy more Salesforce products in a suite, with potential plans teased on this front.

""When customers use more Salesforce clouds, the average [annual recurring revenue] per customer rises meaningfully and attrition drops,"" White wrote in a note, adding that customers who use more than four of Salesforce's (CRM) clouds are just 20% of its customers, but account for roughly 85% of total annual recurring revenue in mid and large markets.

In addition, Salesforce (CRM), which set a $50B revenue target by 2026, had a more ""shareholder friendly message,"" as the theme was profitable growth, White explained.

""The three growth pillars highlighted by Salesforce include leveraging the advantage of Customer 360, growing within industry verticals, and expanding geographically,"" White wrote in the note, adding that the company also expects a 25% or more non-GAAP operating margin at the $50B revenue target.

The company also said that it is committed to returning between 30% and 40% of free cash flow to shareholders via buybacks.

To this point, on Aug. 8, the United States Department of the Treasury’s Oﬃce of Foreign Assets Control issued legal sanctions against digital currency mixer Tornado Cash.

As per the regulatory body, since the platform’s inception in 2019, it has been used for a host of illicit money laundering activities estimated to be worth $7 billion. Of this sum, it is estimated that $455 million was controlled by the notorious Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group. Additionally, Tornado Cash was also used to launder over $96 million of ill-gotten funds derived from June’s Harmony Bridge hack and $7.8 million from this month’s Nomad heist.

Before proceeding any further, however, it would be best to understand what exactly a cryptocurrency mixer is. Simply put, it is an offering that helps obfuscate potentially identifiable or tainted cryptocurrency funds with others to erase any trails linked with the assets, thus making it impossible for anyone to trace the tokens back to their original source.

“Tornado existed only because most blockchains were not private enough. If successive updates of Ethereum or Bitcoin include protocol integrations like Mimblewimble, will the next step be to block them as well? This act is yet another reason to push for Web3, a free web, controlled by users and not by some big brother governments”, said Abraham Piha, blockchain investor and co-founder and CEO of Web3-focused firm tomi.com.

tomi.com was founded in early 2021 and is planning to change the internet world and be the first decentralized Web browser.

tomi is a Web3 infrastructure-based firm that aims to provide an alternative and decentralized web.

They utilize high-performance computing technology, decentralized DNS and a unique browser to expand solutions for increasing decentralization of cloud services and digital assets.

Thereby allowing unlimited access to information worldwide free of censorship, exploitation of data, or manipulation of users, while preventing misuse of the internet for immoral purposes, as decided by the public in order to enable free speech and free economy.",cloud computing,bitcoinist

JDK (Java Development Kit) 19 arrives about six months after Java 18 and exactly a year after Java 17 – the most recent long-term support (LTS) release of Java.

With the release of Java 17, Oracle announced plans to move JDK LTS releases from every three years to every two years, meaning the next LTS release will be Java 21 in September 2023.

The open-source version of JDK 19 OpenJDK 19 is also available from Oracle under the GNU General Public License, version 2, with the Classpath Exception.

Oracle now releases new versions of Java every six months in March and September with the aim of giving developers smaller but more frequent updates than its previous big-bang updates every few years. LTS releases remain supported for at least eight years.

As noted by Sharat Chander, Oracle's director of Java SE product management, JDK 17 was the second LTS under the release cadence announced in 2018. With it, Oracle introduced ""new and simpler license terms"" that allowed companies to use it at ""no cost for at least the next three years, allowing one full year of overlap with the next LTS release.""

Oracle explained at the time that JDK 17 and future JDK releases are provided under Oracle's No-Fee Terms and Conditions (NFTC) license, a free-to-use license for Java 17. The license lasts for a year after the next LTS release and then Java 17 moves under the Oracle Technology Network License.

Java 17 was a big deal. A survey by Java dev tool maker Perforce earlier this year found that 37% of its users were still on Java 8, which was released in March 2014. A further 29% used Java 11, released in September 2018. Both are LTS releases. Some 37% of the Perforce's 876 Java users planned to move to Java 17 LTS.

That's a rather small sample of Java developers worldwide. Oracle notes that tech analyst IDC estimates there are 10 million Java developers, representing about 75% of full-time developers. Java ranks in the top three most-popular languages across multiple indexes, along with JavaScript/TypeScript and Python.

There's Java the programming language and then there are several Java platforms that Java apps run in, consisting of the Java Virtual Machine or ""JVM"" and its application-programming interfaces. The two main platforms are Java Standard Edition (Java SE) and Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE).

Chander notes that ""Java SE subscribers get access to Oracle's Java SE Support and commercial features such as GraalVM Enterprise, Java Management Service and the Advanced Management Console,"" pointing users to The New Java SE License Terms blog for details about the license.

As for new technical features, Java 19 includes seven JDK enhancement proposals (JEP), but they're mostly preview or incubator features.

Notably, Java 19 includes JEP 422 - Linux/RISC-V Port, which ports the JDK to the open-source Linux RISC-V architecture. RISC-V has in various measures won the support of Intel via its new foundry services business and NASA, which wants to use RISC-V chips for its next-generation spaceflight computers.

The RISC-V (pronounced ""risk-five"") standard was invented by University of California Berkeley professors David Patterson and Krste Asanović 12 years ago. Developers are free to change a RISC-V chip's instruction set architecture (ISA) versus the closed ISAs of Intel x86 and Arm processors.

Another interesting addition is JEP 425 ""Virtual Threads (Preview)"" for the Java platform. Virtual Threads is the first JEP as part of Project Loom, a multi-year effort to improve Java's performance on large server applications.

""Virtual Threads are lightweight threads that dramaticaly reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications,"" note the proposal's authors.

Also: How to run websites as apps with ease in Linux

Chander explains the benefits of virtual threads versus Java's threads and how Project Loom aims to come up with an alternative to the three ""bad options"" developers have, which is to waste hardware through underutilization, waste programmer effort with worse programming models and observability, or switch away from Java.

""There are a lot of great things about Java's threads. They offer a natural programming model, with readable, sequential code using control flow operators that users understand – loops, conditionals, exceptions. Users get great debugging and serviceability, and readable stack traces. And threads are natural units of scheduling for OSes,"" Chander points out.

""The problem is that the implementation of threads by the OS is too heavyweight. It takes too long to start a thread for each connection, but worse, the number of threads the OS can support at any one time limits the number of concurrent transactions a server can handle – to well below the capacity of the hardware or the network – and so threads become a severe constraining factor on server throughput.""

He said many people assumed Oracle would embrace the asynchronous programming style offered by so-called ""reactive"" frameworks but added: ""Reactive may be the best people can do with the current JVM, but our goal is to do better, which we can do by making threads lighter and more scalable, letting developers keep using the model and tooling they've been using successfully for years.""

Here's a list of all seven JEPs in Java 19:",cloud computing,zdnet

In response to pressure from regulators, consumers, or both, banks around the world continue to adopt the central tenet of open banking: Make it easy for consumers to share their financial data …",https://mongodb.com/blog/post/how-data-mesh-facilitates-open-banking,"How the Atlas Search Team Empowers Engineers: Meet Nolan Lum

To take advantage of the benefits of having a modern database, MongoDB users need the ability to search and filter quickly against their dataset. Nolan Lum is a senior software engineer on MongoDB’s Atlas Search team where she helps create the fastest and easiest way to build relevance-based search capabilities directly into applications. I spoke with Nolan about what it is like to grow her career on the engineering team at MongoDB. Keep reading to learn about her experience and why the Atlas Search team offers great career opportunities for people with all sorts of backgrounds. Jackie Denner: Thanks for sharing more about your experience today, Nolan. To start, can you share some experiences that brought you to where you are now at MongoDB? Nolan Lum: My first experience with software engineering was in high school, and I continued to study computer science at UC Berkeley. After graduation, I worked at technology companies as a software engineer for over three and a half years. I have worked as a software engineer at MongoDB for almost two years now. I’m currently contributing to the Atlas Search team. JD: Tell me about Atlas Search. What is Atlas Search and how does that fit into the bigger picture at MongoDB? NL: Atlas Search is part of MongoDB Atlas. Atlas Search takes the data stored in MongoDB and indexes it for full-text search. It is a separate Java executable that currently runs alongside MongoDB. It replicates the data users store in MongoDB and makes it available for relevance-based, full-text search. JD: What kind of projects does the team work on? NL: The team is tackling search-related challenges from a variety of perspectives. From the product perspective, we are working on indexing data so that it is quickly accessible and scalable and making the experience of searching and using your database faster and better than using off-the-shelf solutions . From the engineering perspective, we’re solving challenges like how to handle data consistency or whether we should provide guarantees on what data you read back from us versus the database. JD: Tell me about an Atlas search project or feature that you've worked on. NL: I worked on a feature called Resumable Initial Sync that aimed to optimize a process in our replication subsystem. The original Initial Sync process would restart from scratch if another action caused it to pause, increasing the overall time to finish the sync. I updated the process to be resumable, so users can pick up where their initial sync left off after a sync interruption. This internal update helps our users have a better experience using MongoDB. It was a fun technical challenge because I had to think carefully about which asynchronous operations were happening in which order to ensure we accurately represented our place in the overall replication process. I'm proud that we were able to ship this feature update without creating any bugs or losing anyone’s data. Our team has good processes in place to ensure that we ship defect-free software as quickly as possible. JD: What do you like about working on the Atlas Search team? NL: This team appeals to me because there are interesting challenges for every type of engineer. We offer opportunities for traditional engineering, product challenges, hard technical problems, and more. We likely have a project that interests you. I also like that I work with team members from different roles in addition to other engineers, which promotes learning and growth through the work process. While working with other engineers is important, I also value the information I learn from collaborating with other types of team members. For example, during the past couple of weeks, our product managers hosted talks highlighting two important use cases for us to consider. The information they shared helped the engineering team better understand which features are the most valuable to spend our time building. JD: It sounds like a collaborative environment. NL: It is, and to a greater degree than I've experienced in the past. We value working together. One of our shared company values addresses the concept of “disagree and commit.” I’ve heard some people question if that actually works in practice, but here I think it is working well. I see my co-workers disagree sometimes, but after we work toward a consensus, the team rallies around the solution to move forward together. JD: What is the leadership on the Atlas Search team like? NL: The team is organized in a way that allows everybody, including the managers, to succeed. Instead of traditional engineering manager roles, we have team leads who are both people managers and engineers. This works for our team because the technical managers are in touch with the team’s day-to-day challenges beyond setting roadmaps and planning meetings. The philosophy behind what it means to be a manager focuses on empowering engineers at the company to succeed and giving them the space to do that. I think we do a good job at that. JD: What has your personal experience been like working on the Atlas Search team? NL: My experience on the team has been shaped by the wide range of experience levels of my colleagues. Our team’s spirit of mentorship has given me the opportunity to learn from other engineers who are senior to me or who come from different backgrounds, which has helped me grow my own skills. I’ve also been impressed with how equal and diverse the retention is at MongoDB, which in turn helps me feel comfortable being myself at work. Taking into consideration that there are far fewer women engineers in the industry, when one female engineer leaves a company, it makes a proportionally higher difference in team diversity than her male counterpart. I’ve noticed that MongoDB spends extra attention on supporting and retaining women engineers to help keep an authentic, inclusive culture at our organization. JD: What stood out to you about MongoDB while you were interviewing to join the organization? NL: When I was interviewing at MongoDB, I was looking to work at a company that offered me growth opportunities and mentorship, and a fair and thoughtful approach to measuring performance. I wanted to contribute to an engineering organization with a positive culture that valued more than just shipping as many products as possible. One of the reasons I decided to accept an offer at MongoDB was a conversation I had with our Executive VP of Engineering, Cailin Nelson . After I spoke with her, I felt like this was a company where I could flourish. It's inspiring to have women in leadership across the organization. JD: What was your experience during and after the hiring process at MongoDB? NL: At the time of our hiring conversation, I had almost four years of working experience, and I wanted to grow my career to recognize the increasingly advanced skills I had picked up. The conversations I had with MongoDB employees gave me the sense that the performance and team cultures were fair and that the potential for career advancement was available to me. After working here and observing other engineers here for two years, I am still impressed with how MongoDB values everyone’s performance equally and avoids the favoritism trap that so many tech company cultures fall into at scale. I was originally hired as a software engineer, and I have since been promoted to senior software engineer based on my performance. JD: Did you have search-focused engineering experience before working on the Atlas Search team? NL: Before joining this team, I didn't know a lot about search specifically. MongoDB’s engineering culture made ramping up a positive experience. Relevant experience is a plus, but if you’re interested in learning about search but don’t have specific experience in it, it’s not a dealbreaker against joining the team. I encourage people to apply even if their experience isn’t necessarily search-specific. Interested in transforming your career at MongoDB?

387,ASML: A Growing And Profitable Monopoly Franchise,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1209570201/image_1209570201.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,22/09/2022,ASML enjoys a monopoly position by being the only supplier of cutting-edge lithography systems. Read why we are happy to remain shareholders of ASML stock.,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4542524-asml-growing-profitable-monopoly-franchise,"Michael Vi

Company overview

ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the world’s largest developer, manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors manufacturing equipment. The group sells lithography systems to semiconductor manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) or Intel (INTC). These lithography systems enable chipmakers to print with a high degree of precision the patterns that form the electronic circuits on a chip. The company is headquartered in Amsterdam and has a market capitalization of around € 188B.

ASML produces two kind of lithography systems: Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) and Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV). DUV is an old technology that has evolved over time while EUV is a new state-of-the-art technology. EUV technology has been developed by ASML, which is the only provider of EUV machines. This technology is very complex and enables to produce light with much shorter wavelengths than DUV light (13.5 nanometer, which is 14 times shorter!). The shorter the wavelengths, the higher the precision and the thinner the lines printed on the microchips, which allow semiconductor manufacturers to increase the number of transistors on a chip, thus significantly improving its performance. The thickness of patterns and details etchings can now be up to 5 nanometers, which is impressive given a 5 nm etch is twenty thousand times thinner than the thickness of an A4 paper. To be fair, more advanced DUV systems (immersion systems) can also produce up to 5 nm chips but the process requires multiples immersions (given DUV systems etch 32 nm patterns per single exposure) while EUV can do it at once, resulting in better productivity and lower production costs. According to Morningstar, such technology reduces the cycle-time by 3-to-6 times and reduces costs by 15% to 50% compared with multiple patterning schemes. In addition to lithography systems, ASML also sells metrology and inspection systems that measure the quality of patterns on chips and help to locate and analyze chip defects.

ASML generates three quarters of its revenue with the sales of systems and one quarter with the sales of services.

Moats

ASML has strong intangible assets backed by technological superiority (only player to have developed EUV systems), well-educated and specialized workforce and large R&D spending. The company has spent 17.5% of its revenue over the last decade in R&D, which represented an R&D budget of € 750M a decade ago and amounts € 2.5B nowadays. Total R&D spending amounts € 14.2B over the last decade and they have started to develop this technology at least since 2005. Besides, the company has a strong relationship with its key customers, which participate to the development and financing of the EUV technology. In 2012, TSMC, Samsung and Intel, the three most important customers, acquired an aggregate 23% equity stake in order to fund the development of EUV. Since then, they all have sold their shares.

The time and money required for the development of similar technologies are real barriers to entry. The technological expertise is even more difficult to overcome as highlighted by the inability for existing competitors such as Nikon and Canon to compete with ASML for EUV tools despite being able to produce DUV systems. Finally, customers are more likely to prefer ASML’s products (for a similar level of performance) because they trust the brand and are already familiar with existing products. A potential competitor would have to develop a much better technology or a significant cheaper one to eventually convince chipmakers to switch.

ASML Stock key metrics

ASML's financial numbers are very impressive. Revenue grew at a 13% CAGR over the last decade and grew at an even faster pace of 22% CAGR over the period 2016/2021 thanks to the launch of higher-priced EUV systems (first unit sold in 2015). Operating margins improved from 25.6% in 2016 to 36.3% in 2021. As a result, EPS and FCF per share grew at a 31% and 50% CAGR over the same period, respectively. Finally, the ROIC improved significantly and averaged roughly 30% in average since 2015. Please note that 2021 ROIC benefits from the huge increase in deferred revenue that reduce the working capital (higher current liabilities).

The company is highly cash generative, which enable ASML to generate enough cash flow to pay for its development. ASML spent most of its cash on share buyback and dividend after meeting its capex requirements and occasional M&A transactions.

Growth opportunities

Semiconductors are mission-critical components that are essential in the proper functioning of electronic goods. Given continuous technological progress (5G, artificial intelligence…), increasing connectivity and data usage (autonomous vehicle, cloud computing, IoT…), and a strong willingness from humans to adopt new technologies, the demand for semiconductors is poised to keep growing over the coming decade. In addition, many governments consider semiconductors as an important part of their sovereignty and support projects that will bring back production capacity in their countries.

Source: ASML

Improving the performance of a chip requires decreasing the etching thickness of integrated circuits, which will support the uptake of cutting-edge EUV tools. While the number of EUV system units shipped has increased significantly since its launch in 2015 (86% CAGR), it still account for a small portion of unit-mix (8% of total unit sold). However, EUV machines enjoy a much higher selling prices and stronger pricing power than other systems. As a result, EUV accounts now for 46% of total systems revenue whereas it was only 2% in 2015.

ASML has sold a total of about 140 EUV systems in the past decade, each one now costing up to $200 million, according to Wennink. The price tag for its next machine, called High NA, will be more than $300 million. Source: CNBC

Source: Annual reports and author

The services segment accounts for about a quarter of total revenue and has also been growing nicely (a 17% CAGR since 2015) thanks to the growing installed base (15% units CAGR over the same period). The installed base should continue to grow going forward thanks to the increasing number of system sales. Customers will most likely continue to value high-value services such as software and tool upgrades that enable to improve the productivity (downtime reduction, cost reductions, production optimization, defect detection…) and extend the lifetime of systems.

Source: Annual reports and author

The company expects to generate between $ 24B and $ 30B of revenue in 2025 and believe that revenue will grow at a 11% CAGR over the period 2020/2030. Gross margin should improve from 52.7% in 2021 to≈ 55% in 2025 (midpoint of the 54%/56% guidance). We believe that these estimates are realistic because the demand is very strong as highlighted by the order book (more about that in the next section) and higher-margin EUV systems will account for a larger portion of business mix.

A quick review of Q2 financial results

ASML reported better than expected Q2 financial results but lowered its Q3 and full-year outlook. However, the company remains positive on global demand despite a more challenging economic environment. ASML does not notice any cancellations or push out from its clients and still face a demand, which is above its current manufacturing capacity. Total orders are at an all-time high (€ 8.5B) and the backlog reaches € 33B, offering significant visibility.

ASML now expects a full-year revenue growth of 10% (20% previously) and a gross margin comprised between 49% and 50% (52% previously). The guidance downgrade is the result of lower revenue due to fast shipments combined with an unfavorable product mix (fewer EUV systems) and inflationary pressure. In general, ASML completes final tests within its production facilities before shipping the systems to its clients. However, clients want to receive systems as quickly as possible because ASML faced delays in systems production because of supply-chain issues. As a result, ASML accelerates the delivery process by postponing the final tests in customer locations but cannot close the transaction before these tests have been fully implemented, thus revenue are not recognized (they are booked as deferred revenue).

The lower 2022 revenue expectations is not an issue for two reasons: 1) it does not affect cash flow (invoiced upon shipment) and 2) the situation will reverse over time (meaning that ASML will book more revenue at some time than what the number of shipment implies). We note that the guidance downgrade is fully the result of a delay in revenue recognition and has nothing to do with the number of systems shipped or the price of these systems. Indeed, the initial guidance expected 2021 revenue of € 18.6B to grow 20% and reach € 22.3B in 2022. However, the company expects now €2.8 billion value of fast shipments, a € 1.8B increase from initial expectations. Subtracting that number to the original revenue guidance of € 22.3B lead to € 20.5B, which is 10% higher than 2021 revenue, in line with new revenue growth rate expectation.

Valuation

The stock currently trades at a 4.9% FCF yield and a forward P/E of 26x, which seems justified for a company able to post a 30% ROIC and to grow revenue at a 10% CAGR over the next decade. Our model assumes that ASML will deliver the high-end of the company guidance in terms of unit sold. On top of that, we pencil strong pricing power (and product-mix improvement) for EUV machines. As a result, our scenario assumes EUR 32,9B revenue in 2025, significantly more than the EUR 30B company guidance. We derive a 41% operating margin and a net income of EUR 11.4B when the consensus forecasts a 38.5% operating margin and EUR 10.5B net income. Finally, we apply a FCF yield of 5% and a PE of 20x to value the company. The expected return is around 6/7% per year over the coming years, to which must be added a dividend yield of 1% (that will increase towards 2% as dividend grows) and the benefit of share repurchases that will most likely yield around 1/2%. As a result, we can expect a return around 8/10% per annum.

Conclusion

ASML is a high-quality company whose business should continue to grow for many years thanks to the strong demand for semiconductors and its solid pricing power. We believe that the company could still offer attractive returns for its shareholders that is why we are happy to remain shareholders of the company.

Risks:

Bargaining power: ASML’s is highly dependent on few powerful clients (TSMC, Samsung, Intel, Micron…)

Supply chain disruption: ASML relies on a few key suppliers for some strategic components.

Technological disruption: Failing to develop new cutting-edge technologies while a competitor does could lead to a feat similar to Nikon or Canon who failed to adapt to new lithography technologies.

Geopolitical risk: Most semiconductors are manufactured in Taiwan, which is a disputed territory. Taiwan and the US considers Taiwan as a sovereign nation while China believes it is not.",cloud computing,seeking alpha

Depending on who you talk to about VDI vs. DaaS, you may hear them defined in terms relating to agility, flexibility, and control. However, as more organizations adopt “-as-a-Service” models it is important to differentiate between them and identify which use cases suit which model better. Remote and hybrid work is pushing the boundaries on both.

This blog is an introduction to the concepts of VDI and DaaS and why you should select VDI vs. DaaS, or even consider a combination of both. You can also refer to our infographic that gives a glimpse of VDI vs. DaaS for high-level understanding.

What is VDI?

Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) is a technology that refers to the use of virtual machines (VMs) that IT uses to provide and manage virtual desktops. VDI hosts desktop environments on centralized servers and deploys them to end users on request via a remote display protocol. It is worth noting that organizations can also leverage solutions such as VMware App Volumes to deliver apps at scale and simplify their VDI management.

A VDI environment can be set up on premises, in a public cloud, or even in a hybrid and/or multi-cloud deployment. It also provides apps, available inside virtual desktops, for end users to use for their day-to-day functions.

VDI has proven to be very effective during times like pandemics or natural disasters, when your employees cannot be present at their usual physical work location. It offers advantages such as user mobility, ease of access, and flexibility without compromising data security.

Benefits of VDI

Remote access. End users can connect to their virtual desktop from any location through any device, making it easy for employees to access all their files and applications and to work remotely from anywhere in the world.

Cost savings . Since compute processing is done centrally on a server, the hardware requirements for end devices are less rigid. Users can access their virtual desktops from older devices, thin clients, or even tablets, reducing the need for IT to purchase new and expensive hardware.

. Since compute processing is done centrally on a server, the hardware requirements for end devices are less rigid. Users can access their virtual desktops from older devices, thin clients, or even tablets, reducing the need for IT to purchase new and expensive hardware. Security . In a VDI environment, data lives on a server rather than an end-client device. This serves to protect data if an endpoint device is ever stolen or compromised. Plus, you can provide access to certain environments depending on a user’s credentials, and multi-factor authentication to make it more secure.

Plus, you can provide access to certain environments depending on a user’s credentials, and multi-factor authentication to make it more secure. Centralized management. VDI’s centralized format allows IT to easily patch, update, or configure all virtual desktops in an environment. A central control plane helps IT admins manage the environment better no matter the user’s location and device.

Challenges of VDI

Here’s a list of common VDI challenges, but it’s worth noting that using cloud-based VDI can help you tackle some of them. You can explore end-to-end solutions from VMware that are leveraged by thousands of customers globally and make your VDI very reliable.

Infrastructure costs. Because VDI is mostly managed on premises, the IT organization needs to purchase their own hardware for compute, storage, and networking. Plus, IT needs to spend on software components such as hypervisors, monitoring tools, and more, which can add up fast.

Plus, IT needs to spend on software components such as hypervisors, monitoring tools, and more, which can add up fast. High level of management expertise required . With VDIs, internal IT teams need to manage the entire VDI environment, so it is important that they are experts at virtualization, monitoring, app lifecycle management, and more. A few typical tasks may include maintaining the right level of access, network management, imaging, and app management.

A few typical tasks may include maintaining the right level of access, network management, imaging, and app management. Security. Although you can set your stringent security parameters for your own VDI environment, it is essential that you have the best security solutions at your disposal. It is also important you maintain your software, network, and applications so there are no backdoors. VMware offers many industry-recognized infrastructure and endpoint security solutions, including Carbon Black Endpoint, which has integrations with VMware Horizon.

Common VDI use cases

Remote/hybrid work. Because VDI makes virtual desktops easy to deploy and update from a centralized location, an increasing number of companies are implementing VDI to support remote workers and hybrid workplaces.

Because VDI makes virtual desktops easy to deploy and update from a centralized location, an increasing number of companies are implementing VDI to support remote workers and hybrid workplaces. Bring your own device (BYOD). VDI is an ideal solution for environments that allow or require employees and contractors to use their own devices. As compute processing is done on a centralized server, VDI allows the use of a wider range of devices such as thin clients, tablets, or even smartphones. It also offers better risk mitigation, because data lives on the server and is not retained on the end-client device.

It also offers better risk mitigation, because data lives on the server and is not retained on the end-client device. Task or shift work. Nonpersistent VDI, which is a stateless virtual machine image, is particularly well suited to organizations such as call centers, which have many employees who use the same software to perform limited tasks and do not need access to multiple applications.

What is DaaS?

Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) covers a range of desktop virtualization business models where a service provider or vendor will manage the infrastructure, management plane, and sometimes the desktops themselves as a service. Frequently, DaaS offerings are sold per user or per virtual desktop, so that environments can scale smoothly, one user at a time. This is opposed to traditional models that may scale in larger increments, due to the need to buy server hardware. This model also makes it easier to scale back down if needed.

DaaS helps take away another layer of management from IT as most of the environment is managed by a vendor (see image below for more context). It moves the expense model from CapEx to OpEx because the organization does not have to invest in hardware and software capacity beforehand.

In this image, you can see how our various VMware Horizon offerings exemplify different models of VDI and DaaS.

Not all DaaS is the same. For example, Gartner divides DaaS into three categories: client-defined, vendor-defined, and managed DaaS.

In this blog when I mention DaaS, I refer to managed DaaS, which means it is completely managed by vendors. In this scenario, the cloud service provider/vendor manages the infrastructure, operating system, image and license management, and end-user support.

In comparison, client-defined DaaS is when a client specifies various pieces of solutions that they want to leverage and what the user experience will be like. This way, they can get some features of best-of-breed VDI solutions without having to manage them. Vendor-defined DaaS, as its name implies, is defined and managed by the vendor. In this case the client manages the virtual machine configurations.

Benefits of DaaS

Vendor managed . This is the biggest benefit, where a client does not have to deal with any parts of the puzzle, as it is all managed by the vendor. Thus, customers can focus on their core business differentiators instead of becoming a VDI and app expert. Managed DaaS helps keep your IT organization focused and leaner. You won’t need to stay up late when new patches or new OS versions are released.

You won’t need to stay up late when new patches or new OS versions are released. Scalability. When a company plans to merge with another, the IT team may not be able to wait for infrastructure to be purchased and scaled. They likely need desktops, and they need them fast. Managed DaaS solves this challenge in a shorter amount of time and with additional capacity at their disposal.

Managed DaaS solves this challenge in a shorter amount of time and with additional capacity at their disposal. Anywhere presence. Managed DaaS gives a great advantage of using capacity anywhere in the world. Of course, it is limited by where the vendor has presence and has capacity available. Growing your own IT team’s reach globally can take months of planning and years of execution effort.

Managed DaaS gives a great advantage of using capacity anywhere in the world. Of course, it is limited by where the vendor has presence and has capacity available. Growing your own IT team’s reach globally can take months of planning and years of execution effort. More predictable costs. If you want to avoid any surprise costs, managed DaaS can help because costs are very well defined and can be kept under control by moving to an OpEx model.

Challenges of DaaS

Security. For some organizations, DaaS represents the opportunity to leverage the security expertise and resources of a service provider. However, organizations in highly regulated and security-conscious industries such as government, healthcare, and financial services will have more work to do to find a vendor that meets their requirements. Or, they may not find the risks of shared resources to be acceptable.

However, organizations in highly regulated and security-conscious industries such as government, healthcare, and financial services will have more work to do to find a vendor that meets their requirements. Or, they may not find the risks of shared resources to be acceptable. Uncontrolled cost spikes. Although DaaS comes with the promise of less costs, over time you might have more zombie/unused resources that eat up your budget. This can inflate the costs when you don’t have the right cloud cost management tools. Establishing the right KPIs can help keep your infrastructure costs low.

This can inflate the costs when you don’t have the right cloud cost management tools. Establishing the right KPIs can help keep your infrastructure costs low. Less flexibility. When you buy a vendor-defined solution you cannot customize your environment beyond a certain point. If you need levers to change the configuration or use the hardware which is lying free in your on-premises environment, you might be better off developing a client-defined DaaS or a pure VDI environment.

Common use cases for DaaS

Long-term project support . As organizations expand in new regions it can be both time-consuming and hard work to set up new resources quickly. Using DaaS can solve that challenge while it also supports scaling.

Short-term needs. Managed DaaS can prove helpful for your short-term needs, such as surges in customer volumes because of discounts, workforce expansion, healthcare emergencies, and more. Instead of buying new infrastructure and resources, then managing and securing them, you can rely on DaaS.

Managed DaaS can prove helpful for your short-term needs, such as surges in customer volumes because of discounts, workforce expansion, healthcare emergencies, and more. Instead of buying new infrastructure and resources, then managing and securing them, you can rely on DaaS. Reduction in management responsibilities. Not every growing organization has a big IT budget. Moreover, in times when finding the right talent is rare and expensive you can leave the management of your desktop virtualization environment to an expert. Also, making sure your environment is running around the clock can prove challenging if you support a global customer base. DaaS provides you with the right tools at a predictable price point, and you don’t need in-depth knowledge of all systems.

VDI vs. DaaS: 3 main differences

Management. VDI usually needs more management since it is home grown when it comes to the desktop and apps. A more skilled workforce is required unless you use best-of-breed solutions, such as those provided by VMware. In contrast, the DaaS environment is managed by the vendor. Apps would still need some hands-on management from IT. However, the learning curve and skills required are not as extensive as for VDI.

Cost. VDI leverages on-premises infrastructure and can therefore be more expensive. IT also needs to account for additional capacity required for scalability. Then add the power, cooling, and space costs. In the case of DaaS, you pay as you go, and so this option can be less expensive. However, these costs can grow with the environment and thus IT needs to stay vigilant.

Flexibility of end-user experience. VDI can provide more flexibility in terms of VM resources and desktop configuration options, so as a result, the user experience can be more finely tuned to different use cases and workloads. Plus, by using solutions like App Volumes, IT can further simplify app lifecycle management. With DaaS, most use cases need customization and more time investment. Or in some instances, certain use cases might even be challenging to replicate.

This workflow allows organizations to provide managed, trusted access to their macOS workloads on AWS. Software engineering, security, and creative teams can all use ephemeral macOS environments on AWS, managed and secured by Jamf. This can provide unprecedented ease for organizations to scale macOS resources far and wide.



“The relationship between AWS and Jamf brings the power of AWS to the leading Apple Enterprise Management framework, providing real value at scale to organizations across many internal workgroups,” said Dean Hager, CEO, Jamf. “We’re excited to continue to push the envelope on what’s possible with cloud-first technologies centered around the Apple platform.”

Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity

Amazon EC2 Mac instances allow customers to run on-demand macOS workloads on the cloud, extending the flexibility, scalability, and cost benefits of AWS to all Apple developers. With Amazon EC2 Mac instances, developers creating apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Safari can provision and access macOS environments within seconds, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from pay-as-you-go pricing. Customers can seamlessly provision and access macOS compute environments to enjoy convenient, distributed testing and fast app builds, bringing additional choice to developers so they can use Mac as their trusted platform, on-premises or on the cloud. Customers can also consolidate development of cross-platform Apple, Windows, and Android apps on AWS, leading to increased developer productivity and accelerated time to market.



AWS offers organizations the flexibility of choosing Intel or Apple-design M1 system on a chip (SoC) with its Amazon EC2 virtualized machines. Mac developers re-architecting apps to natively support Macs with Apple silicon may now build and test apps and take advantage of all the benefits of AWS. Developers building for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV will also benefit from faster builds, and be able to launch and connect to as many or as few virtual Macs as needed to scale up or down to handle changes in business or build requirements.



""As a service provider managing tens of thousands of Macs across our enterprise customers, we understand the value that Jamf provides. It enables us to ensure the security, management, and seamless onboarding of Apple devices into our platform of services,” said James Ridsdale, founder of dataJAR. “Our employees love using Mac and we are seeing a significant increase in Apple device adoption across our customer base. Jamf allows us to manage this scale efficiently. We are excited to see Jamf’s work with AWS to continue to provide more options for organizations who are looking to adopt a range of computing options for their employees, contractors, and engineering workflows through the management of Amazon EC2 Mac virtualized instances. We think this will be a compelling solution for many types of customers.”

Jamf helps IT and security teams manage and secure these new machines

An organization needs to ensure that its virtual machines are as secure as their physical machines. Leveraging the power of Apple and AWS, Jamf has taken the concept of zero-touch-deployment further than before. Amazon EC2 infrastructure is built on Mac Mini’s in secure data centers. Now through Jamf’s leading management and security solutions, organizations can now provide trusted access to virtual Macs in the same manner they do physical Macs, which provides flexible resource allocation to organizations that rely on Mac for critical components of their business.

“We are proud to work with Jamf to help organizations succeed with Apple,” said David Brown, vice president of Amazon EC2 at AWS. “Now AWS, in conjunction with Jamf, is able to power a holistic, cloud-first Apple Enterprise Management experience, ensuring a high level of product availability, quick and convenient software distribution to all endpoints, and the perfect environment to spin up and manage dynamic native Amazon EC2 resources on Apple for a multitude of organizational needs.”



This custom workflow is available for AWS and Jamf customers today.

Comparing NVMe-oF Protocols for Cloud-Native Applications

NVMe-oF and Kubernetes for Cloud-Native Applications

Benefits of NVMe-oF over TCP/IP for Cloud-Native Applications

Cloud-native applications have different storage needs from legacy applications or traditional software that’s hosted in the cloud. To work effectively, they require high-performing and low latency storage. In practice, the recommendation is to use local NVMe® flash, regardless of the orchestration platform.

A cloud-native application is software designed to run on a private or public cloud. It is built to leverage the innate capabilities of the cloud computing software delivery model. Often these applications are deployed as virtual machines (VMs) managed by OpenStack, VMware vSphere®, or containers managed by Kubernetes.

From an infrastructure architect’s perspective, the more performance available from the storage, the more it is possible to scale cloud-native applications without requiring any change to the storage system. This is especially true if the storage is disaggregated (not attached directly to servers). In that case, architects can add more servers to more and more applications without having to scale storage in tandem. In this context, network-attached NVMe flash storage is ideal to deliver the high performance and low latency requirements.

Comparing NVMe-oF Protocols for Cloud-Native Applications

NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) provides the best storage characteristics for cloud-native applications—extending the low latency and high performance characteristics of NVMe over a network to remote devices. Multiple transport options exist for NVMe-oF, however, the most commonly used are NVMe-oF over Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), NVMe-oF over Fibre Channel, and NVMe-oF over Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). All three enable the creation of an end-to-end NVMe storage solution with high performance and low latency.

NVMe-oF over RDMA—offers a way to exchange information between two computers’ main memories across a network without involving the operating system (OS) processor or cache of either machine.

NVMe over Fibre Channel—transfers data between storage arrays and servers using standard fibre channel (FC) Protocol, which supports access to shared NVMe flash.

NVMe over TCP/IP—uses the TCP transport protocol to transfer data across IP (Ethernet) networks.

Criteria NVMe-oF RDMA NVMe-oF Fibre Channel NVMe-oF using TCP (NVMe/TCP) Overhead cost Medium High Low Infrastructure considerations and complexity, including interoperability and ease of use Complex—with scalability limitations, requiring switches with RDMA capabilities Complex—requiring a dedicated network, FC switches and HBAs Simple—leveraging standard TCP/IP network. It is a scalable approach, requiring no special switches. Accessibility Limited Limited Anywhere

Comparisons between NVMe-oF over RDMA, NVMe-oF over FC, and NVMe-oF over TCP/IP, looking at cost, infrastructure considerations and accessibility for cloud-native applications.

The table above compares NVMe-oF over RDMA, NVMe-oF over FC, and NVMe-oF over TCP/IP as storage transport protocols for cloud-native applications. In terms of overhead cost, NVMe-oF over FC emerges as the most expensive of the three. This is because fibre channel requires a dedicated network that requires FC host bus adapters (HBAs). The protocol also needs FC switches. These items contribute to a higher cost for fibre channel versus RDMA or TCP.

Of the three, NVMe-oF over RDMA comes with overhead costs that are in between those of Fibre Channel or TCP. RDMA does not require a dedicated network, but the protocol does need special RDMA switches. In contrast, NVMe-oF over TCP/IP does not need its own switches, adapters, or network. It is therefore the lowest cost option in most cases.

RDMA and fibre channel rate lower than TCP in terms of infrastructure complexity, ease of use and scalability. RDMA faces limits to scalability due to its need for RDMA switches. Fibre channel is similarly complex because of the requirements for FC switches, HBAs, and a dedicated network. It is a complex process to scale beyond a single rack of RDMA or FC storage using a single switch. Routing limitations present themselves in this scenario, as well.

NVMe over TCP is comparatively simple. It just runs on a standard Ethernet TCP/IP network. There is no need for special network adapters or switches. And, it’s more highly scalable and routable—easy to scale across multiple routes and different networks. This difference also relates to the accessibility of storage. Cloud-native applications are relatively less accessible to RDMA and FC storage, when compared to TCP. NVMe-oF over TCP/IP is accessible to cloud-native applications anywhere.

NVMe-oF and Kubernetes for Cloud-Native Applications

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system that automates software deployment, scaling, and management. A server running cloud-native applications might easily have Kubernetes running dozens or hundreds of microservices, which would clearly affect the way the servers interact with storage resources.

Many cloud-native applications use the microservices architecture, an architecture that efficiently allocates resources to smaller (micro) services designed for a particular task—making the application flexible and ideally suited to cloud software architecture.

Some cloud-native applications are input/output (IO) intensive. They require high bandwidth and low latency. They need a storage solution and a protocol that meets those requirements. Other times, the containers collectively working as applications may not require a lot of I/O operations per second (IOPS) and low latency; instead, the issue is volume. In the cloud, there might be hundreds or even thousands of applications running in parallel as containers on many physical servers. Taken together, they create a requirement for high performance from storage, coupled with high bandwidth and low latency.

Cloud-native applications orchestrated by Kubernetes have distinctive storage needs that can be met by NVMe-oF. Most Kubernetes apps are data intensive, so they need the kind of high-performing storage that NVMe-oF provides. This is particularly true for stateful applications like databases. These need low latency from storage in order to drive acceptable levels of application performance. Storage for such apps must also be able to scale easily if the app itself is to scale.

Kubernetes apps also do well when they have access to the right level of resources. Whether it’s compute, network, or storage, the resources supporting a Kubernetes app should ideally be available in the right proportions. This is not possible if the app relies on Direct-Attached Storage (DAS) connected to the server running the Kubernetes app. It is virtually guaranteed that the server will have DAS that is either under- or over-utilized. Neither is desirable, from a performance or economic perspective.

A disaggregated approach is preferable. If storage is not directly connected to servers running Kubernetes apps, it is possible to achieve dynamic, independent scaling of compute and storage. With this approach, storage will always be available to the Kubernetes app in the right proportion, and with the right performance characteristics.

Disaggregated storage also results in the ability of the Kubernetes app to access data from anywhere. The app and storage become portable, in effect. This is beneficial because Kubernetes apps may run and move across different servers. Data has to be accessible across all these places. Some architects solve this problem by placing storage in a cluster.

Benefits of NVMe-oF over TCP/IP for Cloud-Native Applications

NVMe-oF over TCP/IP offers several benefits for cloud native applications, beyond great accessibility, lower overhead costs, and reduced complexity. It provides virtualized and centralized storage pools that can act as local flash storage. With this approach, NVMe-oF over TCP/IP means accelerated application performance, coupled with easy and efficient scaling.

For Kubernetes apps, the right NVMe-oF over TCP/IP implementation can deliver the performance of DAS but through a clustered storage solution with the convenience and ubiquity of Ethernet networking. Ethernet is already present in every IT environment, so it’s easy to deploy a portable storage cluster.

Conclusion

NVMe emerges as the best storage medium for cloud-native applications. It serves the performance needs of Kubernetes apps and comparable cloud-native software. Out of NVMe transport options, NVMe-oF over TCP/IP presents the best mix of qualities for cloud-native workloads. It enables high-performing storage at lower levels of cost and complexity compared to NVMe-oF over RDMA or fibre channel.

Lightbits operationalizes the advantages of NVMe-oF over TCP/IP, running on standard TCP/IP Ethernet networks that require zero modification to applications. It can be deployed on commodity servers. The Lightbits Cloud Data Platform is software-defined block storage that offers hyperscale efficiency and flexibility. It delivers cloud-native, high-performance, scale-out and redundant NVMe/TCP storage that performs like local flash—without needing a dedicated storage network like fiber channel, InfiniBand, or RDMA.

Through clustering and enterprise data services, Lightbits enables simpler, more agile and efficient handling of data. The platform, with its disaggregated architecture that separates storage from compute, is simple to consume. It accelerates applications running on-premises, in private and edge clouds on bare metal, containerized, or virtual environments. The results include high data availability, high availability, and data durability.

The Lightbits platform, with its unique approach to NVMe architecture, brings forth the best capabilities of NVMe-oF over TCP/IP in supporting cloud-native applications. With Lightbits, cloud-native applications can enjoy the low latency and high availability made possible by a clustered, disaggregated storage architecture.

I began teaching inner-city kids in a summer camp, where I learned, practiced and taught many valuable lessons, including the importance of having fun and in keeping a positive daily routine. Later, I taught for the government and was inspired by the use of technology to save lives (both government and civilian). This was a catalyst for leading me back to computer technology (I was a programmer and technophile as a child). Finally, after earning a Master’s in Education and while teaching aboard, I learned how to utilize Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in a daily routine, in order to transfer knowledge to students. Essentially using some of the very technologies which serve to distract them, to teach them. And, to provide them the tools to teach themselves.

Daily, incremental presentation of relevant and challenging information is efficient, fun and provides a foundation for learning, communication and confidence which extends beyond the walls of classroom and corporate office alike.

Purpose

This project describes how to create a Webex bot which posts to a Webex space you have created. Adaptive Cards will be used to design the message the bot will post. Knowledge of Python is necessary in order to program the bot, message, and space details. GitHub Secrets, Actions, and Workflows will be utilized to automate exactly what and when the bot posts.

Layout and Functionality

A card similar to the above is posted on a regular schedule to the ‘Word of the Day’ Webex room. A random word is chosen each time from hundreds of the most cutting-edge and interesting terms relevant to development, coding, networking, cloud computing and the sociology of technology. The word is in green font. A multi-word/sentence definition is provided below that. Below the definition is a button with green font that is clickable and will take the user to the source and/or more information on the word of the day.

Write Code that Posts to a Webex Space / Room

Create the Webex Room

Click on the + sign at the top of Webex and select ‘Create a Space’. Then name it and click ‘Create’. Now the room is created and you should see it appear in the rooms column on the left of Webex. Now, we need the Room ID of the new room. We can get it by using the Webex for Developers interactive Rooms API call. Make sure you’re logged in and select to use your personal access token. In the ‘sortBy’ field, type ‘lastactivity’. Click the ‘Run’ button and a list of the most recent rooms you’ve interacted with should be returned.

The room you just created will be on top. Save the id of the room. Later, we will use that as the value of our ‘teams_room’ variable. You can save the other values somewhere as well. It’s good practice to keep notes when creating things; you never know when you’ll need them.

Craft the Template of the Message to Be Posted to Your Webex Room

I prefer using Adaptive Cards when posting to Webex spaces. If you’re starting from scratch, you’ll definitely need the Buttons and Cards Designer found on Webex for Developers. Play around with it using ‘Preview mode’ until it looks right and then copy the code with ‘Copy card payload’. Save it somewhere.

Next we want to create a message to post in the Webex space that will contain the card we just created. You can test this out with the interactive Create a Message on the Webex for Developers page under the ‘Try it’ tab. Don’t forget to paste your Adaptive Card code you saved into the ‘attachments’ field, as well as the roomID you saved from the previous API call. Click ‘Run’ to create the message. When you get it working, click the ‘Example’ tab and copy the code. You will use this to build your request.

Building the App in Python

Okay, we have our Webex Room and the core of the message, based on the adaptive card. Now, let’s write some Python code that will make everything come together and run. I use the Visual Studio Code IDE.

Create a virtual environment and start building your code inside of it.

I use Python and the requests library to do all the work for this app. You can see that the code is pretty simple -> https://github.com/xanderstevenson/word-of-the-day-bot/blob/main/chatops.py. The main ingredients are the adaptive card we created, some if/else statements and a simple requests function for posting to a Webex room. I import ‘return_word’ function from a file in the same directory called ‘terms’. This is also a Python module and basically picks a random term from a list to post with the card to the Webex room each time the chatops.py module is run.

Create a Bot to Post the Message to the Webex Space

So far you have your Webex Room and you have Python code to post messages to your room. But who will post the messages? That’s where the bot comes in.

Go to Webex for Developers / My Apps and ‘Create a New App’ (You’ll need to be logged in to do this). Choose ‘Create a Bot’. Follow all the steps and create the bot. You’ll then get a Bot Access Token. Save this as the TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN variable in the ‘~/.bashrc’ file with the line export TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN=””. Use the command ‘source ~/.bashrc’ to load the variable into the environment. You can check this worked with the command ‘echo $TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN’. In my main module, chatops.py, you’ll see the line ‘access_token = os.environ.get(“TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN”). This sets it up so the bot is the one doing the posting in the Webex space. Cool, right?

Running the App from your Local Console (for debugging)

Now I can run the command ‘python chatops.py’ or ‘python3 chatops.py’ to run the app locally (since the Python verrsion is 3.8.10). Every time I run this command, a new random word of the day will appear in the Webex space. I only use this for testing purposes.

(venv) alexstev@ALEXSTEV-M-FCUD wod % python chatops.py your message was successfully posted to Webex Teams

Running the App on Schedule (Using GitHub Workflows and Actions)

In order to run the app on a schedule, we use GitHub workflows. In order to do that, you’ll need to create a GitHub repo named ‘.github’ and create a directory in it called ‘.github/workflows’. So that structrure will look like this: ‘.github/.github/workflows/’.

Next, you want to create a workflow file in the workflows directory. It will contain a name, a trigger, a job, and basic steps (including checkout and run). To learn more about what all this means, check out this tutorial: How To Build Your First GitHub Actions Workflow. I also have a ‘workflow templates’ directory in the ‘.github’ repo that contains the workflow as a template, as well as a properties.json file describing everything.

This is what mine looks like –> https://github.com/xanderstevenson/.github/blob/default-branch/.github/workflows/wod-workflow.yml

It’s only 29 lines of code! Automation all day!

One key component in my workflow is this line ‘TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN }}’. I store that in the repo you’re reading now under Settings -> Secrets -> Actions.

Now we want to connect the Workflow we created with the repo and the code we want to run. In my word-of-the-day-bot GitHub repo, I click on the Actions tab and click on ‘New workflow’ and find my workflow listed amongst all the recommended and prebuilt workflows in a section titled ‘By Alexander Stevenson’. If you’ve already done this, you can go back a step to Actions and click ‘Select workflow’ to pick the workflow you want.

If everything is setup correctly, the code will run completely and the Webex space will receive a new message. If not, you’ll get an email to the address associated with your GitHub account. You can also click on the ‘Actions’ tab in your code repo and you’ll see a detailed description of why your code failed.

Other Considerations

Word Choice and Sources

For this project, words were chosen which are relevant to modern and future technologies. I also deliberately chose words which have cross-functional use in network and software development. Additionally, I chose a mix of words which will be of interest to a wide range of IT professionals, i.e., engineers, managers, human resources personnel, testers, programmers, developers, cybersecurity, etc..

I used a variety of resources to find the most cutting-edge terms but without getting too deep or technical. Neither did I choose words which would be too common or simple. Last but not least, I tried to compile a list of words that will make anyone who uses them sound smart. Well, not really. Actually, humor is a common theme. Trying too hard to sound smart usually has the opposite effect.

Sources (not all-inclusive)

Transform Wikipedia Article to MP3 Files

By clicking on the ‘Learn More’ button on each Word of the Day message, users are taken to a webpage which will provide an even deeper definition. The vast majority of the time, this will be a Wikipedia article. Personally, I plan on reading the entire article so that I can truly grok each term.

A colleague of ours at Cisco, John Capobianco, has developed a package called wikitrola, which will transform any Wikipedia page into an MP3 file.

If you have neither the time, patience, nor desire to read the Wikipedia article, just use wikitrola and you can listen to it while multitasking or relaxing.

Codebase Updates

I had created an empty init.py file in the root directory out of habit. Before Python 3.3 this was done to to make Python treat the directories as containing packages and facilitate importing between modules. From Python 3.3+ Implicit Namespace Packages are supported which allows the creation of a package without an init.py file. This however only applies to empty init.py files. So empty init.py files are no longer necessary and can be omitted.

Anyone with a Cisco domain account and Webex can join the Word of the Day.

From smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers all utilising and functioning with a growing collection of apps that perform a multitude of tasks for us; the users.

With the revenue from the sales of paid-for apps and advertising revenue from free-to-download apps expected to exceed $900 billion next year, businesses, services, and those just with an idea to simplify a task or to create a game all want to produce their own mobile app. How easy is this for beginners? There are several helpful tools that you can use.

Read on to find out which tools are the best for beginners and what is needed to create your first mobile app.

What Will Your Mobile App Contain?

According to QuyTech, the must-have, ideal features for every mobile app include voice search, some form of social media integration, personalisation features for the user to customise, and the ability to work offline to conserve mobile data costs. The visual aspect of any mobile app is also paramount. How will my app look?

Your app must be visually appealing with clear buttons and icons and a strong visual identity. You will certainly want to use awesome animation maker-create videos online to achieve this strong, vivid, appealing, recognisable visual look.

Types of Mobile App Development Tools

All smartphones, tablets, and computers have an operating system (OS) installed when you purchase one. These different OS types are generally incompatible with each other. Apple computers utilise MacOS, whereas their smartphones use iOS and their tablets iPadOS. Many other phones and tablets manufactured by various companies use the OS Android, whereas most personal computers (PCs) use either Windows, Linux, or ChromeOS.

Because these OS are incompatible, apps created for Android will not work on Windows and apps created for use on iOS devices will not work on a Linux-based OS. This means you will need to create separate versions of your app for each system. The best way to create an app that works flawlessly is to use a mobile app development tool native to a specific OS. It will only create an app for one OS and not others. However, cross-platform development apps exist and can be useful for many developers.

Best Mobile App Development Tools for a Beginner

Here are some of the best tools a beginner can use to create their first mobile app. Including both free and paid tools, some require more prior knowledge than others. Space Technologies has an exhaustive list for developers and those just starting.

1. AppGeyser

AppGeyser is a simple-to-use app development tool designed for those just starting. It is free-to-use, and you do not need any coding experience. Unfortunately, AppGeyser will not suit all beginner developers as there is no support for iOS devices like iPhones and iPads. This limits its useability and usefulness for many those beginning their mobile app journey.

2. PhoneGap

PhoneGap and its’ cloud-based sister development tool, PhoneGap Build, is a versatile and powerful system for developing cross-platform apps. PhoneGap Build is entirely free-to-use with an easy-to-use interface that relies upon pre-configured plugins, much like a Desktop Audio Workspace (DAW) or video editor.

3. Mobilesmith

Mobilesmith is designed for businesses and organisations that need a mobile app primarily for employees and workers.

PARIS, Sept 22 (Reuters) - French carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) will control 80% of its electric vehicle value chain well ahead of its 2030 target as it develops partnerships in batteries, electric motors and power electronics, its chief executive said on Thursday.

Luca de Meo said the research and development costs were too high to go it alone and drew parallels with Apple's business model, which he described as relying on a variety of partnerships when it first ventured into smartphones.

""Our old recipes are not enough anymore. The huge investments they (the shifts to electrification) require are not sustainable,"" de Meo told the Auto Motor and Sport congress in Stuttgart, Germany.

""We want to co-invest, co-develop and co-create.""

Renault is pushing ahead with plans to split its electric vehicle (EV) and combustion engine businesses as it seeks to catch up with rivals such as Tesla (TSLA.O) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) in the race to cleaner driving.

It expects to unveil a detailed blueprint for the new EV entity at a capital markets day this autumn.

Three years ago, Renault controlled just 10% of the EV value chain. That figure now stood at 30% and would hit 80% well before the end of the decade, de Meo said.

Renault was forging partnerships ""all along the EV value chain"", he continued.

Alliance partners Nissan (7201.T) and Mitsubishi (7211.T) have not yet said whether they will take part in Renault's future EV unit.

Nissan chief executive Makoto Uchida told the Nikkei newspaper this week that discussions continued on the Japanese group's participation, whether through an investment or another form.

NEW DELHI/HONG KONG, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Indian automaker Mahindra & Mahindra (MAHM.NS) is in talks with global investors to raise between $250 million and $500 million to accelerate its plans to build electric vehicles (EVs), a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Mahindra is in early talks with global green funds and private equity firms, the person said, adding that it wants a long-term investor who can help build out its EV business.

Some investors, however, in recent months have shown interest in participating in a funding round of worth around $800 million, two banking industry sources said, adding that they have held talks with the company about such offers.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

While Mahindra is not actively looking to raise a higher amount than $250-$500 million, it is not closed to the idea of raising the deal size depending on the terms and valuation, the first source said.

""Mahindra wants to bring a benchmark investor onboard but does not want to dilute a large stake at present,"" he said, adding that these plans are at an early stage and subject to changes.

Mahindra's new EV unit for which it is raising the funds was valued at $9.1 billion in July after its first raise of $250 million from British International Investment (BII). read more

It was not immediately clear what valuation the investors are offering or what the company is seeking for the new round.

Mahindra told Reuters in a statement it has committed to investing $500 million in the electric SUV space along with BII, and that the two companies will work together to bring other ""like-minded, climate focussed investors"" in the EV unit.

The talks come weeks after Mahindra outlined an ambitious plan to launch five electric SUVs over the next few years and is targeting such models to make up 30% of its total annual SUV sales by March 2027. read more

The carmaker's first electric SUV is expected to be available for sale in January.

The funds will help the automaker build a war chest to compete against rival Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) which dominates India's nascent electric car market.

Tata, last year, raised $1 billion from TPG's Rise Climate Fund for its EV unit at a valuation of $9.1 billion, making it the first major clean mobility deal in India. read more

In India, the world's fourth-largest car market, electric models make up just 1% of total annual car sales of about 3 million units. The government wants to grow this to 30% by 2030 and is offering companies billions of dollars in incentives to build EVs and their components locally.

Mahindra has partnered with Germany's Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) to procure components like electric drivetrains and batteries for its electric SUVs, and the two are exploring joint vehicle projects, building battery cells locally and developing charging solutions.

The Indian automaker has said it is open to making some investments in a battery cell maker to secure future supplies, and is also evaluating the need to set up manufacturing capacity for EVs, according to local media reports. read more

Mahindra's fundraising also comes at a time when there is growing investor interest in India's clean mobility transition resulting in ""more money chasing few assets"", one of the two banking sources said.

Some of the current investor interest is a spill over from Mahindra's first fundraise, a third banking source said.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) on Thursday announced a management shuffle and the streamlining of its product development and supply chain units, days after flagging a likely inventory build up of up to 45,000 cars that may lack certain parts.

The automaker said Chief Financial Officer John Lawler would take on the additional responsibility of overseeing the makeover of its global supply chain operations until it names a new supply chain chief.

The global auto industry is undergoing rapid transformation as focus shifts to electric vehicles from those powered by gasoline, driving companies such as Ford and General Motors Co (GM.N) to commit big investments, while redrawing their strategies to compete in the fast-emerging market.

WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) is recalling nearly 1.1 million U.S. vehicles because the window automatic reversal system may not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.

The electric vehicle manufacturer told the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration (NHTSA) that it would perform an over-the-air software update of the automatic window reversal system. The recall covers some 2017-2022 Model 3, 2020-2021 Model Y, and 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles.

Tesla said that it was not aware of any warranty claims, field reports, crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the recall.

NHTSA said a closing window without the proper automatic reversing system may exert excessive force by pinching a driver or passenger before retracting, increasing the risk of injury.

NHTSA said the vehicles failed to comply with the requirements of a federal motor vehicle safety standard on power windows.

Tesla said that during product testing in August employees identified window automatic reversal system performance that had ""greater than expected variations in response to pinch detection.""

1/2 A Tesla logo is pictured on a car in the rain in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., May 5, 2021. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri Read More

After extensive additional testing, Tesla determined that the vehicles' pinch detection and retraction performance in the test results did not meet automatic reversal systems requirements.

Tesla said that starting Sept. 13, vehicles in production and in pre-delivery received a software update that sets power-operated window operation to the requirements.

The software update ""enhances the calibration of the vehicle’s automatic window reversal system behavior,"" Tesla said.

Tesla shares were down 3.5% in Thursday afternoon trading.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on Twitter Thursday criticized the description of the callback as a recall.

""The terminology is outdated & inaccurate. This is a tiny over-the-air software update. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no injuries,"" he said.

Both NHTSA and Tesla in documents made public on Thursday referred to the campaign as a recall.

Mercedes boss says electric G-Glass on track for 2024 originally appeared on Autoblog on Thu, 22 Sep 2022 11:11:…",https://www.autoblog.com/2022/09/22/electric-mercedes-gclass-2024/,"Arnold Schwarzenegger’s wishes will come true, and soon. Mercedes Chairman Ola Källenius stated in a media roundtable today that an electric G-Class will launch in mid to late 2024. And from Källenius’ description, it sounds like a blast to drive.

Källenius said he went for a drive in a prototype late last fall, and it was probably the most fun he had all year. He sampled it at Mercedes’ testing facility in Graz, Austria, where the internal combustion G-Class is traditionally put through its paces, testing angles, wading depths, etc. The drive had him convinced: “From now on, going off-road is electric.”

It’s a change of track from a few years ago, when the fate of the G-Class was in the air. ""In the past, there were discussions whether we should eliminate the model. The way I see things now, I'd say the last Mercedes to be built will be a G-Class,"" Källenius said in a speech in 2019. But as Mercedes goes all-electric by 2030, ditching the internal combustion engine is a prerequisite to the G-Class’ survival. We don’t know yet if the G will follow the naming structure of Mercedes’ other electric models, which would likely make it the EQG.

When initially asked about timing, Källenius first stated that the electric off-roader would be “coming to a theater near you soon.” That might have simply been a figure of speech, but we wouldn’t be surprised if the electric G Wagen did make a debut appearance in some action or spy movie. Schwarzenegger would approve.

Tesla recalls 1.1 million vehicles over windows that can pinch fingers originally appeared on Aut…",https://www.autoblog.com/2022/09/22/tesla-window-pinch-recall-software-update/,"Tesla has issued a recall for nearly 1.1 million vehicles due to window automatic reversal system that may not react correctly after detecting an obstruction. In other words, fingers could be pinched with too much force before the window reverses direction. The vehicles included in the recall include certain 2017-2022 Model 3, 2020-2021 Model Y, and 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles.

According to documents posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, ""A closing window may exert excessive force by pinching a driver or passenger before retracting, increasing the risk of injury."" Further, ""these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 118, ""Power-Operated Window Systems.""

The automaker will issue an over-the-air update to rectify the problem. Vehicles built after September 13, 2022, received the updated software from the factory and are therefore not included in this recall.

The problem was found during ""conformity of production testing"" that the technicians from Tesla conducted from August 19, 2022, through August 23, 2022. During their tests, technicians found that the window automatic reversal system ""had greater than expected variations in response to pinch detection."" Tesla isn't aware of any injuries related to the faulty automatic reversal system.

NEW DELHI, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The proposed comprehensive free trade pact between India and the United Kingdom, likely to be signed by next month's end, could accelerate joint ventures and boost bilateral investments, the head of the body promoting bilateral trade said on Thursday.

Richard Heald, executive chair of the UK India Business Council (UKIBC) said negotiation teams were working overnight to meet the deadline of Diwali, the Indian festival of lights falling on Oct. 24, as political leaders had already given a go-ahead.

""Negotiations teams no more have negotiation rounds, they are working 24X7,"" to finalise the pact, he told Reuters in an interview noting UK businesses looked forward to collaborating with Indian companies in renewable energy, autos, education, health care and defence sectors once the pact was signed.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month held a telephone conversation with his UK counterpart Liz Truss and exchanged views on further strengthening the India-UK comprehensive strategic partnership in all sectors.

India expects to increase exports of leather, textiles, jewellery and food products besides more visas for Indian students and businesses.

India's merchandise exports to the UK rose over 28% to $10.5 billion in 2021/22 financial year ending March, while imports rose to $7 billion.

Both countries launched negotiations in January this year for the trade pact that aims to double bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030. read more

UKIBC, which provides inputs to both countries on trade, expects the agreement would also address non-trading barriers and facilitate ease of doing business, besides ""sensitive"" issues of data protection as well, Heald said.

""I can see there could be a chapter on continuing progress on ease of doing business and that would focus certainly on areas such as deregulation.""

Leading Indian companies were already setting up research and design facilities in Britain to develop their own technologies, particularly for batteries for electric vehicles, and in other sectors like health care, he said.

""It is that sort of facilitation that FTA can stimulate.""

Ford shuffles management, seeks new global supply chain head originally appeared on Autoblog on Thu, 22 Sep 2022 18:…",https://www.autoblog.com/2022/09/22/ford-management-changes-supply-chain/,"DETROIT — Ford is restructuring its vehicle development and supply chain operations, shuffling multiple executives just days after announcing that it would build up to 45,000 vehicles with parts missing due to shortages.

The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker gave some executives new roles and said that its chief financial officer will begin reworking supply chain operations until a new global purchasing chief is hired.

The changes arrive at a time of profound change for Ford and the auto industry, which for more than a century have made a living by selling petroleum-powered vehicles. The company has plans for half of its global production to be electric vehicles by 2030, but like its main competitors, Ford will need to keep selling gas-burning vehicles to fund the massive transition.

Earlier this year CEO Jim Farley split the company into two units, Ford Model e to develop electric vehicles, and Ford Blue to handle internal combustion cars, trucks and SUVs.

Early Thursday, Ford announced that CFO John Lawler would run a makeover of its supply chain operations until the company finds a new supply chain chief.

Doug Field, who was hired from Apple Inc., will now become chief advanced product development and technology officer. He'll lead vehicle design and hardware engineering, and continue duties overseeing electric vehicles, software and digital systems, and driver assistance systems.

Former Chief Operating Officer Lisa Drake, now vice president of EV industrialization, takes on manufacturing engineering as Ford plans to produce EVs at a rate of 2 million per year by the end of 2026.

The company also announced two new hires from Hewlett-Packard and Google to develop vehicle software and driver assistance systems.

“Developing and scaling the next generation of electric and software-defined vehicles requires a different focus and mix of talent from the accomplished Ford team,"" Farley said in a statement.

Ford previously announced that Hau Thai-Tang, former head of product development and purchasing, will retire Oct. 1 after more than 34 years with the company. It announced Thursday that Dave Filipe, vice president of vehicle hardware, will retire.

Guidehouse Research Principal E-Mobility Analyst Sam Abuelsamid said Farley is changing the people Ford hires as it joins other automakers in developing new vehicles that can be changed over time with software updates. “Customers like to get new features added over the life of a car,” he said. “The industry likes it because they see potential for new revenue streams.”

But that change takes a different mindset than people who are used to developing vehicles that aren't changed for years until the next version comes out, he said.

Ford, he said, will probably experience instability for a while as large changes happen. “They need to hire a lot of people with different skill sets,” he said.

On Monday, Ford revealed that a parts shortage would keep many of its most profitable vehicles sitting on lots waiting to be fully assembled. The issue forced the automaker to slash its third-quarter earnings forecast. The company also has been hobbled by problems with manufacturing launches of new vehicles and high warranty claims.

Ford also said Monday that its inflation-related supplier costs for the third quarter were about $1 billion above what it had been planning for.

Last month the company let go of 3,000 white collar workers to cut costs and help make the long transition from internal combustion vehicles to those powered by batteries.

Governments across the globe are pushing to eliminate combustion automobiles to mitigate the impact of climate change. Companies like Ford are orchestrating the wind-down of their combustion businesses over multiple years, even though they are still generating the cash to fund electric vehicle development.

Shares of Ford fell just under 1% Thursday as the broader markets dipped. The shares are down about 38% for the year.",electric vehicles,autoblog

EPA considers tougher emissions rules for heavy trucks originally appeared on Autoblog on Thu, 22 Sep 2022 08:36:00 EDT…",https://www.autoblog.com/2022/09/22/epa-heavy-truck-emissions-regulations/,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will consider adopting more stringent greenhouse gas emissions rules for heavy trucks after Congress passed new incentives to speed the adoption of zero-emission vehicles, the agency told Reuters.

In March, the EPA proposed new rules to cut smog-forming and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from heavy-duty vehicles. The agency said it will reopen the proposed GHG rules after passage in August of the climate and spending Inflation Reduction Act, a move that could speed the U.S. shift to electric heavy-duty vehicles.

The EPA will be issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to consider more stringent GHG standards for model years 2027 through 2029 in December.

EPA Office of Air and Radiation official Joseph Goffman told Reuters ""the big change here is the Inflation Reduction Act. Congress definitely sent a very strong message backed by significant resources.""

The EPA believes much greater zero-emission vehicle adoption rates are possible for 2027 through 2029.

The EPA still plans to finalize the proposed smog-forming truck rules by December.

Jed Mandel, president of the Truck & Engine Manufacturers Association, which represents companies like Daimler Trucks, Caterpillar and Cummins, said on Wednesday ""getting all these rules and regulations working in concert is extremely important and very challenging.""

Mandel said it is unclear how the incentives under IRA ""will impact the industry in the near-term.""

Nonprofit RMI said the inflation reduction law's up to $40,000 Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle tax credit ""will turbocharge adoption of electric medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks."" and will make electric trucks cheaper to operate than diesels in most cases.

In March, the EPA said the new heavy truck GHG standards when fully phased in would result in up to 24% to 25% lower carbon dioxide emissions, but environmentalists have pressed the agency to do more.

Sierra Club transportation official Katherine Garcia said ""it’s vital that the EPA’s policies match the urgency of the air quality and climate crises. ... We urge the administration to move quickly to finalize the near-term heavy-duty standards.""

The EPA in March proposed tighter standards for 17 of the 33 subcategories of vocational and tractor vehicles, including school buses, transit buses, commercial delivery trucks, and short-haul tractors.

Next month, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) will consider new rules to require zero-emission truck deployments starting in 2024 ""and would establish a clear end date of new medium- and heavy-duty internal combustion engine vehicle sales in 2040.""

CARB Chair Liane Randolph told Reuters the board will be voting on purchase requirements for delivery van fleets of 50 or more vehicles to transition to zero-emission purchases. ""They need to transition to zero,"" Randolph said.

Transportation is the largest source of U.S. GHG emissions, making up 29% of emissions, and heavy-duty vehicles are the second-largest contributor, at 23%, the EPA said.

413,Too many electric cars charging at night may overload electrical grid,https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/22155435/SEI_126461026.jpg,22/09/2022,"As electric car ownership rises, we will need new infrastructure to avoid overwhelming electricity grids – including public charging stations and more daytime charging",https://www.newscientist.com/article/2339237-too-many-electric-cars-charging-at-night-may-overload-electrical-grid/,"As electric car ownership rises, we will need new infrastructure to avoid overwhelming electricity grids – including public charging stations and more daytime charging

As electric car use grows, we will need to make changes to the energy grid to meet charging demand Dinendra Haria/SOPA Images/Shutterstock

The growth in electric car ownership could strain power grids if most drivers continue charging primarily at home overnight. Investment in daytime charging options will be crucial to help the western US power grid handle the demand with an estimated 50 per cent of drivers using electric vehicles by 2035.

That finding comes from computer models looking at how driver charging behaviours and available charging station infrastructure at home and in public places could impact peak net electricity demand – the highest electrical power demand minus power provided by solar and wind power.

If drivers primarily charge vehicles at home during the night, that could lead to a 25 per cent surge in peak net electricity demand when states reach 50 per cent electric vehicle ownership, and possibly surpass grid capacity at even higher levels of ownership. But expanding daytime charging opportunities could reduce that increase in peak net electricity demand to just 7.5 per cent and help reduce the costs of expanding grid capacity.

“One of the big results from our study is that just making the shift of which charging infrastructure you build and where you encourage people to charge is a huge difference in the result for the grid,” says Siobhan Powell at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, who led the research while at Stanford University in California.

Powell and her colleagues used computer models to analyse charging patterns from the behaviour of 27,700 electric vehicle drivers in the San Francisco Bay Area. Such real-life data allowed the computer models to predict how an expanded population of 48.6 million future electric vehicle owners might impact the western US power grid that serves 11 states, including California.

The findings also show how a shift to daytime charging patterns could help the western US grid efficiently use its excess solar power, says Ram Rajagopal at Stanford University. Daytime charging can tap solar power when it is immediately available, instead of requiring power grid operators to invest in more energy storage to store daytime solar power for night-time charging.

The computer models showed that having more drivers charging during the day could reduce the grid’s energy storage requirements by between $700 million and $1.5 billion, compared with a business-as-usual scenario with many drivers charging at home during the night.

Getting to the point where 50 per cent of personal vehicles are electric by 2035 seems optimistic, says Gil Tal at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the study. He also noted that some of the anticipated surge in overnight charging demand could be mitigated by the fact that, with more people working from home, some electric cars may be charged at home during the day. But overall he says the study’s findings are encouraging, suggesting that future electric car adoption should be manageable.

“Their analysis is showing that the demand for electricity from transportation is very flexible demand,” says Tal. “And a lot of the problems can be solved by changing the time of use and the day of use.”

While this research was ongoing, the US Congress passed an infrastructure bill that was signed into law by President Joe Biden in November 2021 that included $7.5 billion specifically for a national network of charging stations for electric vehicles.

“It was not necessarily based on any kind of study that shows the impact on the grid, it was based on other considerations,” says Rajagopal. “But it turned out that things just lined up perfectly for this.”

Pleas…",https://www.autoblog.com/2022/09/22/lamborghini-twin-turbo-v8-lmdh-racing/,"The car that replaces the Lamborghini Huracán is rumored to get a twin-turbocharged hybrid V8 possibly making something like 850 horsepower. The engine's origins and details remain in the shadows, but it's possible we'll get a preview of some of its components in Lamborghini's LMDh prototype racer. The Italian brand announced its entry for the Le Mans Hypercar (LMH) class of the FIA World Endurance Championship and the GTP class of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship would be powered by a twin-turbo V8 developed in-house by the Squadra Corse motorsports division.

All we know for now about the competition mill is that it will be a 90-degree V8 with an output of around 670 horsepower, midway between the 644 and 697 ponies allowed in the regulations. Partners in the enterprise include Bosch, which will develop the electric motor in the energy recovery system, Williams Advanced Engineering will supply power management software and the energy storage unit, while Xtrac will provide the seven-speed hybrid transmission. The engine will weigh at least 396 pounds, the minimum required by regulations, and enable a top speed of 210 miles per hour or thereabouts.

This is the first time Squadra Corse has developed an engine for Lamborghini, and various race media have said it's not only different to the V10 used in Lamborghini's current Huracan GT3 and Super Trofeo cars, it's distinct from the twin-turbo 4.6-liter V8 going into the Porsche 963. The Huracan successor is thought to get an evolution of the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 in the Urus. However, it is impossible to believe Squadra Corse is expending the whopping amounts of time and money required for a race-winning engine for an internal-combustion powerplant that will only ever be used on track. The point of IMSA, the ACO, and the FIA coming together on mutual regulations for LMDh and LMH was to support road-applicable technology able to race in the premier sports car series' around the world.

We should get our first look at Lamborghini's new race car by next year's Rolex 24 at Daytona at the latest. A year of testing in 2023 will lead to official competition outings in 2024, the teams running the car yet to be announced.

415,How Many Vehicles Could Tesla Deliver This Quarter?,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/701913/tesla-stock-tsla-deliveries.png,22/09/2022,The electric-car maker should post strong sequential and year-over-year growth.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/how-many-vehicles-could-tesla-deliver-this-quarter/,"As the end of the third quarter approaches, one quarter-end report that usually gets quite a bit of attention is Tesla's (TSLA -7.55%) update on vehicle production and deliveries. The electric-vehicle (EV) maker typically reports its quarterly deliveries two to three calendar days following each period's end.

Investors will likely be watching Tesla's Q3 update on vehicle production and deliveries extra closely since the automaker suffered a tough second quarter. Due to a temporary shutdown at the company's Shanghai factory earlier this year, deliveries fell 18% sequentially in Q2. Investors are likely hoping for sharp sequential growth in Q3, as well as impressive year-over-year growth.

Expect a huge jump in production

While a steep sequential decline in Q2 deliveries might fool some investors into thinking Tesla's business is facing dire circumstances, this couldn't be further from the truth. Investors should zoom out. While deliveries were down 18% sequentially, falling from about 310,000 in the first quarter of 2022 to just under 255,000 in Q2, they were up 27% year over year.

Stepping back to look at the company's momentum over the trailing-12-month period does an even better job of capturing the company's impressive execution on its growth plans and the surging demand for Tesla's EVs. Trailing-12-month deliveries for the period ended June 30, 2022 soared 58% year over year.

While this overarching sales trend and Tesla's recent history of execution increase the odds of continued strong growth going forward, there are some specific reasons why Q3, in particular, should be good for Tesla. First and foremost, management said in Tesla's Q2 letter to shareholders that the company produced a record number of vehicles at its two main factories (one in California and one in Shanghai) in the final month of the year.

This momentum gave the company confidence to guide for ""a record-breaking second half of 2022."" Furthermore, management said in Tesla's Q2 earnings call that it expects total production to increase about 50% this year. This would require accelerated production levels in the second half of the year.

As another underlying catalyst, Tesla started ramping up production at two entirely new factories earlier this year. These factories -- in Germany and Texas -- should begin contributing materially to the company's production volume during the second half of the year.

What about demand?

With strong production seemingly in the bag for Q3, how will sales fare? Another part of the equation investors must consider before they can make an educated guess about sales is demand, right? But anyone following Tesla closely knows this isn't a concern, either.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk and CFO Zachary Kirkhorn both asserted in the company's recent earnings call that demand simply isn't an issue for the company. This is because lead times on deliveries of new vehicle orders are so far out.

Put another way, demand exceeds supply by a wide margin. U.S. orders today of the base version of Tesla's Model Y, for instance, won't be delivered until sometime between December of this year and April of next year, according to the company's website.

With all of this said, it seems highly likely that Tesla's Q3 deliveries will hit a record level, likely passing Q2 deliveries by 5,000 or more. I'm personally estimating Q3 deliveries between 315,000 and 330,000. But given the company's sprawling global supply chain, it's getting increasingly difficult to guess where deliveries will fall. Whatever the case, we can expect strong sequential and year-over-year growth with near certainty.",electric vehicles,motley fool

CAGUAS, Puerto Rico — Hurricane Fiona was on a track Thursday to menace Bermuda and far-eastern Canada after leaving hundreds of people stranded across Puerto Rico, where it smashed roads and bridges and caused historic flooding.

Government officials have been working with religious groups, nonprofits and others braving landslides, thick mud and broken asphalt by foot to provide food, water and medicine for people in need, but they are under pressure to clear a path so vehicles can enter isolated areas soon.

Nino Correa, commissioner for Puerto Rico's emergency management agency, estimated that at least six municipalities across the island had areas that were cut off by Fiona, which struck as a Category 1 hurricane and was up to Category 4 power Thursday as it headed toward Bermuda.

Manuel Veguilla said he has been unable to leave his neighborhood in the north mountain town of Caguas since Fiona swept in on Sunday.

""We are all isolated,"" he said, adding that he worries about elderly neighbors, including his older brother who does not have the strength for the long walk it takes to reach the closest community.

Veguilla heard that municipal officials might open a pathway Thursday, but he doubted that would happen because large rocks covered a nearby bridge and the 10-foot space beneath it.

Neighbors have shared food and water dropped off by nonprofit groups, and the son of an elderly woman was able to bring back basic supplies by foot Wednesday, he said.

Veguilla said that in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that struck five years ago and resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths, he and others used picks and shovels to clear the debris. But Fiona was different, unleashing huge landslides.

""I cannot throw those rocks over my shoulder,"" he said.

Like hundreds of thousands of other Puerto Ricans after Fiona, Veguilla had no water or electricity service, but said there is a natural water source nearby.

Fiona sparked an islandwide blackout when it hit Puerto Rico's southwest region, which already was still trying to recover from a series of strong earthquakes in recent years. Some 62% of 1.47 million customers remained without power Thursday, four days after the storm, amid an extreme heat alert issued by the National Weather Service. A third of customers, or more than 400,000, did not yet have water service.

The executive director of Puerto Rico's Electric Energy Authority, Josué Colón, told a news conference that areas less affected by Fiona should have power by Friday morning.

But officials declined to say when power would be restored to areas hit hardest by the storm.

""We are working by steps. Our next step is now to focus on the critical load"" — service to hospitals and other key infrastructure — said Daniel Hernández, the director of renewable energy for LUMA Energy, which distributes power in Puerto Rico.

The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent hundreds of additional personnel to help local officials as the federal government approved a major disaster declaration and announced a public health emergency on the island.

Neither local nor federal government officials had provided any overall damage estimates from the storm, which dropped up to 30 inches of rain in some areas. More than 470 people and 48 pets remained in shelters.

""Our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico who have endured so much suffering over the last couple of years,"" said Brad Kieserman, vice president of operations and logistics at the Red Cross.

After Puerto Rico, Fiona pummeled the Dominican Republic and then roared over the Turks and Caicos Islands as it strengthened. Officials there reported relatively light damage and no deaths, though the eye of the storm passed close to Grand Turk, the small British territory's capital island, on Tuesday.

""God has been good to us and has kept us safe during this period when we could have had a far worse outcome,"" Deputy Gov. Anya Williams said.

Fiona was forecast to pass near Bermuda late Thursday or early Friday, and then hit easternmost Canada early Saturday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.

The Canadian Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for Nova Scotia from Hubbards to Brule, Prince Edward Island, Isle-de-la-Madeleine and the coast of Newfoundland from Parson's Pond to Port-Aux-Basques.

The U.S. center said Fiona had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) on Thursday morning. It was centered about 410 miles (660 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda, heading north-northeast at 15 mph (24 kph).

A hurricane warning was in effect for Bermuda, where Premier David Burt sent a tweet urging residents to ""take care of yourself and your family. Let's all remember to check on as well as look out for your seniors, family and neighbors. Stay safe.""",electric vehicles,npr
417,Larry Page's flying taxi startup Kittyhawk calls it a day,https://regmedia.co.uk/2018/03/13/kitty_hawk_cora_air_taxi.jpg,22/09/2022,"More proof, if it were needed, that not everything connected to Google is gold

In a terse note on Twitter yesterday, it said: ""We have made the decision to wind down Kittyhawk. We're still working on the details of what's next.""

The company is significant to the ""flying car"" pipe dream in that it was founded in 2010 by computer scientist Sebastian Thrun, who also started the Google X R&D outfit and Google self-driving car project, now known as Waymo. Google co-founder Larry Page directly funded the concept.

Kittyhawk's last publicly released all-electric VTOL aircraft was able to take off, fly, and land completely autonomously ""on a small landing pad only slightly larger than its wingspan.""

""It is ultra-quiet and battery-efficient, flying hundreds of miles on a single charge and is almost inaudible within 30 seconds of takeoff,"" the company's website says.

""Inspired by that, we're now working on a next-gen commercial design. Our ambitions for the next-generation aircraft are even bolder. We're reinventing the future of aviation by applying modern technology to traditional aviation principles to reimagine advanced air mobility. We're building flying vehicles that are affordable, autonomous and ubiquitous.""

Obviously, these plans are now on hold. Kittyhawk's first commercial aircraft could only carry one passenger, monitored by a ground operator, which the company played off as a positive, saying ""no pooling with strangers."" It aimed for $1-per-mile air travel, cheaper than calling an Uber.

However, Kittyhawk was in a joint venture with Boeing called Wisk Aero, which is also attempting to bring a flying taxi to market capable of carrying up to four passengers. The aviation giant has invested $450 million in the endeavor.

A Boeing spokesperson told Bloomberg: ""Kittyhawk's decision to cease operations does not change Boeing's commitment to Wisk. We are proud to be a founding member of Wisk Aero and are excited to see the work they are doing to drive innovation and sustainability through the future of electric air travel.""

It could be that Kittyhawk's backers ultimately saw Wisk, where the former company's technology lives on, as the better bet.

The air taxi is a tough nut to crack. Numerous companies are trying – Archer Aviation, Beta Technologies, Eve Urban Air Mobility, Joby Aviation, and Vertical Aerospace to name a few – but, as with any flying machine, regulators must be involved.

Wisk's Cora ""established the world's first [Federal Aviation Authority] certification basis for passenger-carrying, remote-piloting aircraft"" in 2018, though next-generation vehicles have yet to be approved.

Infrastructure has also proved to be a blind spot. Flying taxis, especially those claimed to be autonomous, need to be integrated with existing air traffic and have specific places to land near to where the passenger wants to go.

What's the point when your emissions-free, electric VTOL taxi lands 70 miles from where you want to be? You'd then need a regular taxi, and heaven forbid it runs on fossil fuels. ®",electric vehicles,theregister.com

Sources have revealed that the British car manufacturer has started the tendering process to upgrade the factory. Current plans call for an extended shutdown at the plant to begin in 2024 when the actual conversion will begin.

The site will be responsible for building both plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles using the EMA platform. This factory currently houses 3,700 employees and will soon benefit from an enlarged body shop. Both the Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Discovery Sport are manufactured at the site.

Jaguar Land Rover’s EMA platform will prove very important for the brand. The British car manufacturer claims that in addition to support plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles, it can support any shape of battery and all kinds of different battery chemistries. Autocar reports that plug-in hybrid models based on the architecture will use the company’s small 1.5-liter three-cylinder.

Jaguar Land Rover has an ambition for electric vehicles to account for 60 per cent of its global sales by 2030, while 30 per cent will come from mild-hybrid or standard hybrid models, and the remaining 10 per cent will be plug-in hybrids. The automaker then hopes to be selling nothing but zero-emission vehicles by 2036.

The Jaguar brand will undergo a particularly significant overhaul. It will go upmarket and be repositioned as a rival to Bentley. Jaguar’s ‘Reimagine’ strategy will see it launch a line-up of all-electric vehicles consisting of two crossovers and a two-door coupe. While Jaguar itself has only confirmed two electric crossovers, recent reports suggested that a third was in the works.",electric vehicles,carscoops

The United States on Wednesday said its commerce secretary and South Korea’s trade minister exchanged “frank views” over Seoul’s pending legislation on network usage fees on foreign content providers and Washington’s electric vehicle credits during a meeting.

The Inflation Reduction Act law, signed by President Joe Biden last month, eliminates federal tax credits for electric vehicles made outside North America, meaning companies, including Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Corp, will no longer be eligible for such subsidies.

South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol arrived for his first official trip to the US this week but the tensions threatened to disrupt a recent display of alliance strength with Washington.

In South Korea, there is a legislative push to make the likes of Netflix and Alphabet’s Google pay local network fees.

While the readout from the US Commerce Department said Secretary Gina Raimondo and South Korea’s Lee Chang-yang reaffirmed the importance of the bilateral economic relationship, it also hinted at tensions.

The pair “exchanged frank views on US concerns about South Korea’s pending legislation to impose network usage fees on foreign content providers and South Korea’s concerns relating to electric vehicle tax credits,” it said.",electric vehicles,al jazeera english

The car is still a prototype with a ways left before production, but Ariel popped up recently to deliver a rather in-depth update, perhaps realizing that five years is a literal lifetime in the fast-evolving hypercar market. Not only does the creative hyper-hybrid leverage the instant torque of its quad-motor drive for eyebrow-shearing performance, it packs an optional range-extending micro-turbine to give it the autonomy and flexibility of a gas hypercar.

Yes, the ""Hipercar"" name is among the most awful we've ever seen, but it's also tempered by reasoning and a limited lifespan. It stands for ""High-performance carbon reduction"" and is merely a development fill-in. Ariel says that the official model name has yet to be finalized.

A name that weak would definitely be a drag on a car that looks so angry and menacing it could be a movie supervillain's getaway ... or weapon. Ariel is known entirely for open, unclad super vehicles, so a fully enclosed body represents previously unexplored territory. It has clearly thrown itself all in on the unfamiliar task, creating an unmistakably skeletal design that ties back into its grown-go-cart DNA. The Hipercar hood looks much like the motorsport-style nose of the Atom, albeit with the addition of wing-like fairings that sweep around to the sides and backward to create a perimeter. These pair with a lower set of wings to sandwich the beady headlights.

Ariel used Bramble CFD software to design its bodywork for the best aero performance, hence the myriad fins, wings and spoilers all over Ariel Motor Company

It's not a pretty car by any stretch of the imagination, but Ariel leans on aerodynamics, not sensual beauty, to guide its carbon fiber shaping. For example, the prominent fins sticking up off the front fenders are designed to cut drag on the side mirrors, while the rear fins help to stabilize the haunches and improve cornering. The myriad cuts and planes up front suck air in and guide it through to a more optimal route.

Ariel plans to offer two- and four-wheel drive options, both carrying a 295-hp Equipmake electric motor for each of their respective drive wheels. So the 2WD version will have 590 hp (440 kW), along with 664 lb-ft (900 Nm) of torque, while the 4WD variant will lunge past the 1,000-hp hypercar threshold for a total of 1,180 hp (880 kW) and 1,327 lb-ft (1,800 Nm).

The Hipercar weighs in at an estimated 3,307 lb (1,500 kg). Top speed is intentionally limited to 155 mph (249 km/h), but the car delivers top-tier performance at the lower end of the speed spectrum. Estimated sprint times check in at 2.09 seconds (0-60 mph/96.5 km/h) and 4.4 seconds (0-100 mph/161 km/h), with mid-tier acceleration from 60 to 120 mph (96.5 to 193 km/h) rolling in at 3.5 seconds.

But that's for the prototype, and Ariel expects even better numbers once it's completed the adjustable torque-vectoring system that will go into the production car. It estimates those at below 2 seconds for the 0-60 and below 4 for the 0 to 100.

Electric acceleration with fuel flexibility ... the Ariel Hipercar promises to be like no other Ariel Motor Company

When the driver isn't pushing the car to its absolute limits, the 62-kWh battery pack will deliver roughly 150 miles (241 km, WLTP) of range. Those who prefer to drive their Hipercar farther distances without the hassle of stopping to charge can add the optional Cosworth turbine range-extender. The 110-lb (50-kg) micro-turbine kicks in when activated by the battery management system, and runs at a fixed 110,000 rpm to develop a continuous 35 kW output to maintain battery charge level. There's also an on/off manual override.

Ariel hasn't put forth a finalized battery + turbine range estimate yet, but perhaps the even bigger advantage is that drivers can simply refuel at a gas station. The turbine can also run on a variety of other fuels, and Ariel hopes to add a hydrogen option in the future to cut harmful emissions entirely.

Butterfly doors Ariel Motor Company

As far as charging goes, Ariel plans to go the Hyundai route of equipping the 800-V Hipercar with a split-charging system that can also operate at voltages below 500 V. This way it's ready for the present and future.

Ariel admits it has another year or two of development ahead before production. As of now, it plans to build a limited number of Hipercar models, each priced below £1 million (approx. US$1.13 million), including all taxes.

Tesla is recalling nearly 1.1 million cars in the US because the windows might close too fast and pinch people's fingers.

Documents produced by American regulators show the windows may not react correctly after detecting an obstruction.

Tesla chief executive Elon Musk criticised the description as a recall calling it ""outdated and inaccurate"".

The car giant says a software update will fix the problem.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the fault is a safety-standards violation.

The world's largest electric-vehicle manufacturer has had repeated run-ins with federal safety regulators, whom Mr Musk calls ""the fun police"".

Previous recalls have been due to:

rear-view cameras

bonnet latches

seat-belt reminders

sound-system software

The latest recall covers all four Tesla models, specifically 2017-22 Model 3 sedans and some 2020-21 Model Y SUVs (sports utility vehicles), Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.

Tesla discovered the problem with the automatic windows during production testing in August.

Owners will be notified by letter, from 15 November.

Company documents indicate vehicles made after 13 September already have the updated software needed to remedy the issue.

Tesla said it was not aware of any warranty claims, crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the recall.

Tesla shares were down 3.5% on Thursday afternoon trading.

Mr Musk hit out on Twitter after the news broke.

""The terminology is outdated and inaccurate. This is a tiny over-the-air software update. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no injuries,"" he said.

However, as the stock market is expected to remain under considerable pressure...",https://stocknews.com/news/rivn-coin-dkng-amc-bbby-5-overhyped-stocks-on-wall-street-to-avoid-right-now/,"After a lull, Wall Street has witnessed the comeback of the meme frenzy over the past few months. Last year, meme stocks took the whole world by storm after their logic-defying rallies despite fundamental weakness.

Since the outsized rallies in meme stocks were not backed by fundamentals or positive news, these stocks failed to sustain the price levels they reached last year. And many retail investors incurred heavy losses as these meme stocks eventually crashed back to earth.

The return of the meme frenzy this year is evident from the outsized rallies of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) earlier this year. However, the hype around these meme stocks died out quickly because of the uncertain macroeconomic environment.

The Fed increased the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points yesterday. The central bank officials are now predicting that the key rate will end this year at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, up from the previously indicated 3.25% to 3.5% in June.

This is expected to keep the stock market under pressure in the upcoming months. Given this backdrop, it could be wise to avoid fundamentally weak overhyped stocks Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN), Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN), DraftKings Inc. (DKNG), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC), and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY).

Tesla has announced it is recalling some 1.1 million cars in the US citing a safety issue with the automatic window reversal system. The announcement was made on Thursday as the company informed The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the issue.

The electric carmaker says the recall covers the 2017-2022 Model 3, 2020-2021 Model Y and 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles. The automatic window reversal system in the cars can sometimes fail to detect obstructions when closing, increasing the risk of injury, according to Tesla.

The NHTSA has confirmed that the vehicles in question have failed to comply with the requirements of a federal motor vehicle safety standard on power windows, adding that the fault could result in excessive force and pinch a driver or passenger before retracting.

As pointed out by the NHTSA, under US law it is illegal for anyone, including a manufacturer, distributor, dealer or retailer to sell an item or vehicle that fails to comply with Federal motor vehicle safety standards. As such, a recall must be issued if any such issues are discovered.

Tesla has stated that the problem with the window reversal system was detected during product testing in August. The carmaker noted that it was not aware of any warranty claims, field reports, crashes, injuries or deaths related to the recall.

In the case of this recall, Tesla owners will not be required to bring their vehicles in for any repairs as the company plans to remedy the issue via an over-the-air software update.

Tesla added that since September 13, all of its vehicles in production and in pre-delivery had already received an update that sets power operated window operation to the federal requirements. Notification letters are expected to be sent out to owners of the recalled vehicles on November 15, 2022.",electric vehicles,rt
427,The Only 3 Stocks Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood Both Like,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/701375/buffett6-tmf.jpg,22/09/2022,These famous investors don't agree on much. But these three stocks are exceptions.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/3-stocks-warren-buffett-and-cathie-wood-both-like/,"Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood aren't exactly two peas in a pod. They have very different investing styles.

Buffett studied Ben Graham, the father of value investing. His Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.59%) (BRK.B -1.13%) portfolio is loaded with the stocks of well-run, established companies. Wood, meanwhile, loves to invest in the stocks of up-and-coming companies with potentially disruptive businesses.

But these two well-known investors actually agree with each other in a few cases. Here are the only three stocks that Buffett and Wood both like.

1. BYD

You won't find BYD (BYDD.F -0.16%) listed among Berkshire's holdings in its regular 13-F filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, Berkshire owns 18.9% of the Chinese electric vehicle maker. BYD is also one of the stocks held by Wood's ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ -4.17%).

To be sure, BYD doesn't enjoy as much favor with either Buffett or Wood these days. Berkshire has reduced its position in the electric vehicle stock in recent weeks. ARKQ also sold some of its BYD shares earlier this month.

Berkshire's selling took an especially heavy toll on BYD, with the stock sinking more than 30% since early July. BYD has taken shareholders on a roller-coaster ride in 2022, with its share price now down close to 20% year to date.

However, at this point, there's no reason to believe that either Buffett or Wood has given up on BYD. Wood, in particular, remains bullish about the future prospects for electric vehicles.

2. General Motors

BYD isn't the only automaker that's high on the list for both Buffett and Wood. Berkshire has owned shares of General Motors (GM 0.40%) since 2012 and still has a 3.6% stake in the company. ARKQ also has a small position in GM.

Buffett sold some of Berkshire's shares of GM in the second quarter of 2022. Wood, on the other hand, appears to be more bullish about the stock. Earlier this month, ARKQ bought around 120,000 shares of GM.

General Motors hasn't been a winner for either famous investor so far this year. Its stock has plunged more than 30%, primarily due to worries about the economy.

However, GM just might make both Buffett and Wood richer over the long term. The company has ramped up its production of electric vehicles. It's also positioned to potentially be a leader in autonomous vehicles with its majority ownership of self-driving ridesharing company Cruise.

3. Amazon

Buffett and Wood don't just agree on auto stocks. They also both like Amazon (AMZN -5.00%). Berkshire owns nearly 10.7 million shares of the e-commerce and cloud hosting giant. Amazon ranks as the twelfth-largest position in the ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX -3.07%) as well.

Technically, one of Buffett's two investment managers initiated Berkshire's position in Amazon. However, Buffett has admitted that he was ""an idiot"" for not buying the stock sooner. Wood's attraction to Amazon in the past related primarily to the company's fintech opportunities. Now, though, she appears to be more interested in Amazon's efforts to launch satellites.

Like BYD and GM, Amazon has been a loser for Buffett and Wood in 2022. The stock has fallen close to 25% year to date. Even a 20-for-1 stock split in June didn't help boost Amazon's share price.

But Amazon still has plenty of room to grow in e-commerce. Its cloud hosting business continues to fire on all cylinders. The company also has opportunities in new markets, including healthcare and self-checkout for physical stores.",electric vehicles,motley fool

429,Why Tesla Dropped While Nio and Li Auto Shares Jumped Early Today,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/702051/li-auto_l9_interiorjpg.png,22/09/2022,A surprising announcement from a Chinese EV maker implies that demand is strong and growing.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/why-tesla-dropped-while-nio-and-li-auto-jumped/,"What happened

Tesla (TSLA -7.55%) has put much time and focus into expanding production capacity at its plant in Shanghai, China. There are indications that those efforts will pay off, but the stock is getting hit Thursday after a large unrelated recall from the EV leader. Tesla shares fell by more than 4% in morning trading, and were still down by 3.1% as of noon ET.

Meanwhile, shares of Chinese EV makers Nio (NIO -8.06%) and Li Auto (LI -6.59%) went in the other direction after a sign that EV demand remains strong in China. Nio was up nearly 5% and Li Auto 10% at their respective highs of the day. As of noon ET, Li was still up 7.3%, but Nio had relinquished its gains.

So what

Tesla is recalling 1.1 million of its electric vehicles due to concerns about the way their fully automatic windows react when they detect obstructions while closing. The key concern is that those closing windows ""may exert more force"" than they are supposed to before reversing automatically, which could pinch drivers or riders. The recalls include Model 3 vehicles made since 2017, as well as multiple model years for the Model Y, Model S, and Model X, according to The Wall Street Journal.

This news seems to be hitting the stock on a day when news out of China might otherwise have provided it with a boost. However, it's worth noting that Tesla plans to fix the problem with over-the-air software updates, so the costs to the company for the fix should be minimal. The automaker also said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the problem.

Now what

News from Li Auto drove the Chinese EV makers higher Thursday. The maker of battery-electric vehicles that also include small gasoline engines as ""range extenders"" made a surprise announcement that it would be launching its new L8 SUV earlier than planned at the end of September.

Yanan Shen, co-founder and president of Li Auto, said the early launch was ""based on overwhelming market response in anticipation of its release."" That's good news, since demand in China has been inconsistent since the spring, when a series of COVID-19 lockdowns in major Chinese cities began to impact both production and consumer demand across the industry.

Tesla took advantage of some of those delays to implement planned increases in production capacity at its Shanghai plant. That facility now has the ability to produce about 1.1 million vehicles per year.

Nio has also been increasing its capacity and launching new models. That company expects to begin deliveries of its mid-size ET5 sedan later this month and has high expectations for it. Investors appear to be viewing the high demand for Li Auto's new SUV as a good sign for Nio as well.

Tesla's recall announcement may have dampened investors' enthusiasm about its stock, and Li's news may have boosted their opinions about Nio's outlook -- but the market may have overreacted on both fronts Thursday. Still, if the EV market in China does rebound as expected, it really should be good news for all three of these companies.",electric vehicles,motley fool
430,Tesla recalling 1.1 million vehicles to fix faulty window reversing system - Fox Business,https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2021/12/0/0/tesla-model-3s.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,22/09/2022,"Tesla is recalling nearly 1.1 million vehicles to update the software that operates their window reversing systems, which can pinch an occupant's extremities too hard.",https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/tesla-recalling-million-vehicles-window-reversing-system,"Tesla is issuing a voluntary recall on nearly 1.1 million vehicles because the pinch protection feature on their power door windows may allow them to squeeze too hard before rolling the glass down.

Tesla first discovered the issue during in-house testing in August and validated in early September, according to documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The pinch protection feature is meant to prevent injury to an occupant's extremities as a window closes.

Federal guidelines say that the system should be activated at no more than a squeezing force of 100 Newton before reversing.

The problem affects a total of 1,096,762 2017-2022 Model 3, 2020-2021 Model Y, and 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles.

Tesla said it is unaware of any incidents or injuries related to the issue and has already implemented a firmware update that recalibrate the system's operation to pre-delivery vehicles and new vehicles being built.

Tesla has been ordered to recall nearly 1.1 million vehicles in the US due to a safety issue with the electric windows, according to reports.

The problem concerns the windows’ obstruction recognition, which is responsible for detecting objects that might get caught, such as a child’s fingers.

The recall concerns Model 3 cars from 2017/22, Model Y cars from 2020/21, as well as Model S and Model X vehicles from 2021/22.

Tesla reportedly told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it would attempt to fix the issue via an over-the-air software update, according to Reuters.

The automatic window reversal system may not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, Tesla said in documents posted on Thursday by US safety regulators.

The NHTSA said that it is a violation of federal safety standards for power windows.

Tesla discovered the problem during production testing in August. Owners will be notified by letter starting from 15 November.

The company also said in documents that vehicles in production got the update starting on 13 September.

Tesla was not aware of any warranty claims or injuries due to the problem as of 16 September, according to the documents.

When a group of young climate activists confronted Dianne Feinstein at her San Francisco office in 2019, the six-term Democratic senator cited her deep experience in Washington in refusing their demand that she endorse the Green New Deal.

""I've been doing this for 30 years. I know what I'm doing,"" Feinstein, then 85, told the students. ""You come in here and you say, 'It has to be my way or the highway.' I don't respond to that. I've gotten elected, I just ran, I was elected by almost a million-vote plurality, and I know what I'm doing. So, you know, maybe people should listen a little bit.""

Feinstein added that the Green New Deal, a package of aggressive environmental reforms championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, would die at the hands of Senate Republicans.

""You can take that back to whoever sent you here,"" the senator told Isha Clarke, a 16-year-old student from Oakland.

One student protested that Feinstein should instead listen to her constituents.

""You didn't vote for me,"" Feinstein chided.

""It doesn't matter,"" a 10-year-old named Magdalena shot back. ""We're the ones who are going to be impacted.""

A video of the exchange — recorded the same year Time magazine named the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg its ""person of the year"" — went viral.

Clarke, now a sophomore at Howard University and cofounder of Youth vs. Apocalypse, told Insider the protest got a ""huge reaction"" from the public.

""We are literally facing the end of humanity and politicians are like, 'Sorry, no can do' in the face of people who it's going to impact,"" Clarke said.

The nonbinding Green New Deal resolution, meanwhile, went nowhere — just as Feinstein predicted.

The episode illustrates the tension between the nation's youngest Americans, who are demanding political action on a huge scale to fight the planet's climate crisis, and aging government leaders who don't share their sense of urgency.

After decades of failure, Democrats finally managed to do something to address the biggest challenge facing the planet. In August, President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that contained significant environmental provisions, including incentivizing clean energy and reducing carbon emissions with more than $300 billion in direct investments and tax credits.

But the bill — dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act — proved to be a compromise package that failed to even acknowledge the climate crisis in its name. Some environmentalists derided it as a half measure at best, counterproductive at worst. And the law is insufficient to reach the Biden administration's goal of net-zero carbon emissions by the middle of this century in order to curb the worst effects of climate change, including rising temperatures, warming oceans, rising sea levels, and more intense storms and droughts.

With Democrats bracing to lose their razor-thin majority in the House and a challenging 2024 election-season looming, the party will need to energize younger voters and empower a new generation of leaders to build on its partial climate wins — all while many aged leaders simply refuse to yield.

'An unforgiving generation of voters'

Climate change is a uniquely generational issue.

There's a clear age divide — particularly among Republicans — when it comes to addressing it. Millennials and Gen Zers across the political spectrum are more likely than their parents and grandparents to support climate action. They're better educated on the issues, and they're more open to structural change. They also have much more at stake — older people will likely be dead before planet Earth experiences the most severe impacts.

Lawmakers are increasingly aware that younger constituents will hold them accountable on climate.

""I hear Republican senators say, 'If we don't clean up our act on climate, we are going to lose the next generation of voters for our party,'"" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and champion of climate policy, said. ""Anybody who has political sense understands that there is an unforgiving generation of voters coming along that is gonna be very pissed that we allowed this to drift for 20 years when we knew better.""

But today's American political leadership is old and only getting older.

About one in four members of Congress are in their 70s or 80s, including octogenarian leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. The average member of Congress is more than two decades older than the average American. Biden and his leading 2024 adversary — Donald Trump — are both nearing 80. Young people vote far less frequently than older folks and are often shut out of elected office by a slew of incumbency advantages and veteran lawmakers who refuse to step down.

Four months in the making, Insider's ""Red, White, and Gray"" series explores the costs, benefits, and dangers of life in a democracy helmed by those of advanced age, where issues of profound importance to the nation's youth and future — technology, civil rights, and, yes, energy and the environment — are largely in the hands of those whose primes have passed.

Historically, environmental action takes place when young people overwhelmingly demand it and leaders listen.The US passed its bedrock pieces of major environmental legislation back in the early 1970s, under President Richard Nixon, a conservative who privately derided the environmental movement but respected the power of grassroots activism in changing public opinion.

Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency, signed the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act, and established the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among other major environmental achievements.

""It's not that Nixon was an environmental guy, it's just the public demanded it and the energy came from younger people,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University whose forthcoming book digs into the environmental movement of the 1960s. ""The climate revolution that's needed — it's there, they're organizing online, but it has to become a tidal wave where it dominates.""

The generational divide on climate

Age — particularly among conservatives — is a key divider in Americans' views on climate policy.

Almost half – 47% – of Republicans and Republican-leaning people between the ages of 18 and 29 think the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change, but fewer than one in five Americans aged 65 and older said the same, according to a Pew Research Center poll from May. There's a similarly wide gap on many climate-related issues, from whether energy companies should transition to more renewables to whether stricter environmental laws are worth the cost.

Younger Democrats were also more likely to be frustrated by the Biden administration's action on climate than their older counterparts, Pew's polling found before the IRA was passed.

But US political leadership doesn't look like America, and older people tend to vote much more frequently than younger people, thus skewing national priorities away from climate. And the electorate is only getting older.

Generational gaps on key public-policy issues aren't specific to climate change. Older voters are generally less likely than younger people to support dramatic policy shifts and structural change. They're more rigid and concerned with preserving their economic stability, while millennials and Gen Zers have fewer expectations of stability, Jennie Stephens, a professor of sustainability science and policy at Northeastern University, said.

""Younger people see kind of an inevitability about change,"" Stephens said. ""They know the world isn't gonna just stay the same, and we can either respond to these changes in crisis mode, in reaction to once things start happening, or we can also advocate for being more proactive and preparing for the changes.""

But most policy debates aren't genuinely existential in the way climate change is. From heat waves to droughts to floods, people born in 2020 will experience between two and seven times more extreme-weather events in their lifetimes than people born in 1960, according to a 2020 study published in the journal Science.

Millennials and Gen Zers, in particular, have benefited from more education and better information about the crisis. For years, older Republicans were shaped by partisan, fossil-fuel-backed claims that climate science was bunk, that climate policy could only be achieved with overwhelming economic costs, and even that climate change was a hoax devised by China to strangle American manufacturing, as Trump falsely claimed in 2012.

""What it comes down to for older Republicans is they're fearful of policies coming for their jobs and coming for their families' livelihoods,"" Benji Backer, the 24-year-old founder of the conservative climate-action organization American Conservation Coalition, said. ""Young people grew up in a time where we learned about how fighting climate change didn't have to be at the expense of the economy.""

Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina who was ousted from Congress in 2010 in part over his support for a carbon tax, agreed that the GOP's decades of anti-climate messaging has deeply influenced older voters.

""Talking points are slow to die,"" he said.

Lawmakers and the generational gap

Politicians' views are also shaped by these generational trends.

Inglis said he was a climate skeptic until his then-18-year-old son, Robert, told him in 2004, ""Dad, I'll vote for you, if you're going to clean up your act on the environment."" He later visited Antarctica and the Great Barrier Reef with congressional colleagues, met with scientists, and saw evidence of climate change with his own eyes.

As a general matter, older politicians tend to approach the climate crisis with less urgency. Julian Brave NoiseCat, a writer and climate activist, pointed to Ocasio-Cortez, the country's youngest-ever congresswoman, who's put climate at the center of her policy agenda and embraced left-wing climate activists.

""She goes full-throated activist on the climate issue, which is obviously not the way that older Democrats tend to do it,"" NoiseCat said of the progressive lawmaker. ""Younger Democrats tend to have a much more friendly relationship and response to the party's activist class than older Democrats do.""

A spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez declined to make the congresswoman available for an interview for this story. But the lawmaker recently told GQ that ""generational tension has existed among virtually every single social movement in American history.""

But there are exceptions to the young-old disconnect on environmental issues, particularly on the left. Elderly Democrats like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Ed Markey are among the most outspoken advocates.

""There's this misconception that in order for an elected official to be responsive to and understanding of young people's concerns, they need to be young themselves. I just don't think that's true,"" said Marcela Mulholland, the political director at the left-leaning think tank and polling firm Data for Progress, pointing to Sanders and other older progressive Democratic leaders.

But, she added, there should be far more young leaders in positions of power.

Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said the real divide on climate is a partisan one and questioned how crucial activists were in securing the climate wins in the reconciliation bill. The congresswoman has a long record of championing climate legislation and negotiating with environmental groups and industry.

""I'm not young. I'm not old. I worked my fucking butt off last year and this year,"" the 68-year-old lawmaker said outside the Capitol after the House voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act on August 12. ""People need to make their voices heard and keep their foot on the pedal, but I also think sometimes you gotta have people that are willing to do the work to make it happen.""

Dingell, who succeeded her late husband, Rep. John Dingell, after his nearly 60 years in Congress, has faced pressure from progressive activists to take bold action on climate. She and her late husband spent much of their careers supporting the auto industry, a major player in their home state, though the congresswoman has pushed for the transition to electric vehicles.

The role of fossil-fuel interests

Lawmakers' positions on climate issues are also heavily influenced by their constituents' beliefs and donors' financial interests. Ultimately, most politicians will do what they can to get reelected.

""It behooves a leader of whatever age to mostly pay attention to high-propensity voters"" who are disproportionately older and less concerned with the climate, Inglis said.

Fossil-fuel interests have played a central role in stymieing progress on climate change for decades. Many experts argue their power intensified following the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC, which opened the floodgates to corporate and outside spending in elections and empowered the oil and gas industry and other interests to more effectively oppose climate legislation.

This year, the oil and gas industry and electric utilities are among the top-five spenders by industry on political lobbying, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets.

""Right now, politicians of any age are responding to the possibility of getting reelected, and there are two factors there: One, how do their constituents feel? And two, how subject are their constituents to the massive expenditure of money in the political arena?"" Michael Oppenheimer, a prominent climate scientist and professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton, said.

During the past 15 years, the Republican Party has taken a sharp turn to the right on climate.

In 2008, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican leader Newt Gingrich sat on a couch outside the Capitol and filmed a TV ad calling on Americans to ""take action to address climate change.""

Nearly a decade later, Trump ran for and won the presidency — with Gingrich's early and staunch support — while calling climate change a ""hoax.""

Many Republicans in Trump's GOP have embraced that position.

Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican, declared, ""There is no climate crisis. It is a hoax,"" while railing against the Inflation Reduction Act on the House floor in August.

Matt Schlapp, the head of the Conservative Political Action Coalition, put it simply in a May tweet: ""I don't give a crap about climate change.""

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia argued in June that climate change and carbon emissions are actually ""healthy for us"" and good for the planet.

Thirty Republican senators and 109 Republican representatives in the 117th Congress have openly questioned or denied the science of human-caused climate change, according to a 2021 report from the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Those members have taken a total of $61 million in donations from the oil, gas, and coal industries during their careers, the report found.

""It's impossible to deny the power of the fossil-fuel industry carrot-and-stick in the behavior of the Republican Party. I've seen it in my time in the Senate,"" Whitehouse said. ""We went from having multiple bipartisan, good, strong climate bills to having none. And it happened instantly upon the Citizens United decision.""

Most of that money goes to Republican lawmakers. GOP House leader Kevin McCarthy and Sen. Mitt Romney have, in their respective chambers, collected the most lifetime donations from people and political committees associated with the oil and gas industry, according to OpenSecrets.

But a slew of Democrats also rake in cash from fossil-fuel interests while also investing their own money in fossil fuels.

Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the most influential shapers of the IRA, were the only two Democrats among the top 15 Senate recipients of oil and gas money during the 2022 election cycle, OpenSecrets reported.

Backer, the American Conservation Coalition founder, argued that younger Republican lawmakers are taking climate change much more seriously than their older peers. He pointed to Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Dan Crenshaw of Texas, and John Curtis of Utah, and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, among others.

""I would say almost every member of Congress that's Republican under 50 really gets it on climate,"" Backer said. ""These are people who span the spectrum of conservative to moderate, but they're all younger, and they all care about climate and they've all done stuff about it.""

But even younger legislators who've made it to Congress are often prevented from holding positions of real power in the chamber for years as older leaders hang on. Most committee chairs — particularly in the Democratic Party, which doesn't have term limits for leadership — are baby boomers or members of the silent generation, a cohort whose members were born between 1928 and 1945.

""If you're a young legislator, like Jamaal Bowman, or AOC, or Rashida Tlaib, they have to sit and wait for like 20 years to be chairperson of a committee and have the ability to move legislation that actually is the thing that goes to the floor,"" said Brett Hartl, the director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit that advocates for endangered species and other environmental causes. ""That's gonna feel pretty damn hopeless.""

Young people are critical to the fight

Some climate activists describe a duality of the Inflation Reduction Act: It's both unprecedented in scope yet still an incremental step in the right direction.

The law has received largely positive reviews from climate experts, who praise the more than $300 billion in tax credits for electric vehicles and solar energy and investments in forest and coastal restoration and pollution reduction, among other priorities.

If implementation goes as planned, the law would reduce US greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 2005 levels by 2030, short of the 50% reduction for which the US is aiming.

But many are still demanding bolder action to reach both domestic and international climate goals.

""The IRA is completely insufficient,"" Hartl said. ""Almost anything and everything the Biden administration has done thus far, from an EPA side of things, has been insufficient. It's not going to get any easier. The more we delay and procrastinate and the more half measures just dig us deeper into the hole.""

But there's no sign older voters and lawmakers will allow a new generation of lawmakers and climate advocates to take over.

Whitehouse argued that the GOP and its conservative allies have systematically worked to disempower younger voters, and thus hurt Democrats and progress on climate.

""I am concerned that there are interests at work in American politics who would very much like to turn off young voters and make the government process so unappealing to them that they don't show up,"" Whitehouse said. ""And I think it's very clear that there is a political equation, and that is: High young-voter turnout equals larger Democratic Party majorities. And its corollary is, larger Democratic Party majorities means stronger climate legislation.""

While environmental crises of years past have certainly posed tremendous challenges, they pale in comparison with the disaster that climate change could wreck on the planet if it's not swiftly addressed. The crisis is urgent, and younger generations simply don't have a decade — or even a few years — to lose.

Four years before Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992, Dr. James Hansen of NASA famously testified before Congress that greenhouse-gas emissions were causing global warming. In the 30 years since, Feinstein and her colleagues failed to take significant actions to slow climate change.

While the Green New Deal is far from becoming law, it heavily influenced the Biden administration's original $3.4 trillion Build Back Better plan, which effectively served as an opening bid in Democrats' internal bargaining that ended with the scaled-back IRA.

Just as the young climate activists in Feinstein's office demanded, progressive Democrats used the ambitious framework to shift the Overton window and push their own party to think bigger.

""I'm very hopeful and I do think it's possible to do the sort of radical intervention that we need,"" said Clarke, the student activist and Feinstein protester who's now 19 years old. ""I'm a true advocate for maintaining radical optimism.""

""You have to shoot for the stars, land on the moon,"" Clarke added. ""Throughout time, people have not gained the progress that they have by aiming to compromise.""",electric vehicles,business insider
434,China May Find It Hard to Cool Lithium’s Rally This Time Around,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ncw_aBGWYlsG49THmTLP9g--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/1da4e27cc0c88edbb19e5695fefd08a8,22/09/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Scorching gains for lithium, a raw material vital for powering electric vehicles, threaten to push costs even higher for Chinese battery...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-may-hard-cool-lithium-230000905.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Scorching gains for lithium, a raw material vital for powering electric vehicles, threaten to push costs even higher for Chinese battery makers, and the government is finding itself powerless to do anything about it.

Even after a meeting last week where Chinese authorities pleaded with major producers to stabilize prices, lithium carbonate surged to a fresh record, rising to 500,500 yuan ($70,716) a ton. In yuan terms, that exceeds the level prevailing when Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk called prices “insane” earlier this year.

“In the short term, I don’t think the meeting will help China cool the rally,” said Peng Xu, analyst at BloombergNEF. Prices for seaborne spodumene -- a partly processed form of lithium -- are increasing amid a supply-demand mismatch and that’s squeezing the margins of Chinese lithium refiners, Xu said, adding there’s still room for further gains from current price levels.

It was easier for China back in March, at the time of the previous peak. Then, officials hauled in representatives of the supply chain and told them they wanted “rational” prices. That did at least stall the rally. But it came at a time when virus lockdowns were curbing demand, and downstream users were also struggling to cope with high costs for other battery materials like nickel and cobalt. Now, things are different.

China’s manufacturing is picking up, with output of electric vehicles more than doubling from a year ago in August. The China Passenger Car Association expects EV sales to hit a record 6 million this year, double the number in 2021. Lithium supply still trails demand, and there are concerns about the availability of power in key production hubs this winter. In a sign of market tightness, an auction of Australian spodumene just attracted the highest-ever winning bid.

Story continues

A slumping Chinese currency is also playing a role in the surge in domestic prices. The yuan has tumbled more than 10% this year, and is heading for the worst annual performance since 1994. The Federal Reserve’s 75-basis-point hike on Wednesday only made things worse. China typically buys raw materials in dollars, so the weakening yuan increases costs for the nation’s importers.

In China’s meeting with the lithium industry last week, authorities asked major firms to ensure prices don’t hugely deviate from production costs and urged consumers to strike long-term agreements. The nation also said it will help boost exploration, stabilize imports and promote recycling of raw materials.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol asked U.S. President Joe Biden to help address Seoul's concerns that new U.S. rules on electric vehicle subsidies will hurt the country's automakers, Yoon's office said on Thursday.

Seoul's opposition to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed by Biden last month, has overshadowed Yoon's first trip to the United States since taking office in May.

The new law eliminates federal tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) made outside North America, meaning companies like Hyundai Motor Co and its affiliate Kia Corp will no longer be eligible.

Yoon relayed the concerns to Biden in London, where both leaders attended the funeral of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, and again in New York on Wednesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, his office said.

""President Yoon requested close cooperation so that the U.S. administration can resolve our concerns in the process of enforcing the Inflation Reduction Act,"" Yoon's office said in a statement.

Biden said he was ""well aware"" of South Korea's concerns and asked to continue discussions, it added.

The White House said the two leaders discussed a broad range of issues including supply chain resilience, economic and energy security and climate change, but did not mention electric vehicle credits.

Seoul sees the IRA as a betrayal of Biden's vows to boost economic ties after South Korean companies unveiled bold investment plans in the United States.

The U.S. Commerce Department earlier hinted at tensions between the two countries after a meeting between U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and South Korea's trade minister Lee Chang-yang in Washington on Wednesday.

The pair ""exchanged frank views on U.S. concerns about South Korea's pending legislation to impose network usage fees on foreign content providers and South Korea's concerns relating to electric vehicle tax credits,"" it said.

Story continues

In South Korea, there is a legislative push to require overseas content providers including Netflix and Alphabet's Google to pay local network fees.

Seoul's trade ministry said Raimondo sympathized with Seoul's concerns on the IRA and vowed to continue consultations.

""Our side clearly conveyed the concern that the (IRA) does not match the U.S. drive for supply chain cooperation and would bring a negative impact on future projects,"" it said in a statement.

US driving fatalities fell to 10,590 in the second quarter, down from 11,135 in the same period last year, but they remain a scourge to humanity.

Swedish automaker Volvo, a perennial safety leader, thinks we can do better. The carmaker announced that all future models will be outfitted with laser-based sensors, known as lidar, which they say will cut serious accidents in their vehicles by 20%. Skål to that.

See The Light

Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote sensing technology that uses pulsed lasers to create high-resolution images to capture an accurate 3-D view of the world. Cars outfitted with lidar can sense their surroundings and avoid obstacles like pedestrians, but high costs (a single lidar sensor can run over $1,000) mean the technology has largely been employed only by self-driving and commercial vehicles -- rather than as an extra safety feature in regular old human-operated cars.

Still, analysts expect the use of safety sensors will soon become more commonplace; in the EU cars will soon be mandated to come with obstacle-activated emergency braking capabilities by law, and companies including BMW and Mercedes have announced lidar in certain models.

Volvo, which became the first carmaker to introduce three-point seatbelts in the 1950s, is looking to cement its place as a safety leader:

The electric version of its flagship XC90 sport utility vehicle, the EX90, will feature a lidar sensor that allows it to see ""a black tire on a black road at 120 meters ahead, or a pedestrian at 250 meters,"" according to Volvo boss Jim Rowan.

That will give the car an extra 3-4 seconds of decision time and will reduce collisions by an estimated 9% and fatal or injury-inducing accidents by 20%. Volvo added it is ""intent"" on rolling out the tech to all future models.

Lidar Contrarian: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has come out strongly against Lidar technology, claiming that ""anyone relying on LIDAR is doomed...it's like having a whole bunch of expensive appendices...in my view, it's a crutch that will drive companies to a local maximum that they will find very hard to get out of."" Instead, Tesla uses cameras and radars to inform its automated driving features – and presumably cut back on the doom.",electric vehicles,motley fool
437,Airships Rise Again (2021),https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/D14zguqZo8qblOdoVXwMARXSlkE=/fit-in/1600x0/filters:focal(2132x2586:2133x2587)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer/d4/f7/d4f7cc05-fef1-4202-b60d-11fd48551ed7/opener.jpeg,22/09/2022,Zero emissions and a million pounds of lift renew the appeal of these century-old giants.,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/airships-rise-again-180979343/,"Tom Grundy, the CEO of Hybrid Air Vehicles, started his career working on fighters and drones for BAE Systems, and he was a project engineering manager for Airbus during the development of the A380. But these days his focus is on a type of aircraft that can do things the fixed-wing fliers he has spent his life admiring can’t—even though the basic technology keeping them aloft is substantially older. Welcome to the second age of the airship.

Grundy’s company is promoting its striking, pillow-like AirLander 10, initially designed for military surveillance, as a pleasant, low-emission alternative means of regional air travel. In May the company announced plans to begin service for up to 100 passengers per flight on a handful of short-haul routes (Liverpool to Belfast, Oslo to Stockholm, Seattle to Vancouver, among others) in 2025. A Scandinavian company is in talks about using the AirLander to give tours of the North Pole.

The chief market for the airships of the 21st century, however, will not be passenger service but freight hauling. The new airships can carry heavier loads farther and cheaper than helicopters can, with lower emissions than fixed-wing aircraft—potentially zero emissions, if the ships are powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

Historically, there have been two major types of airship. Rigid airships, as the name implies, are built around a hard skeleton. Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin of Germany flew the first rigid airships, and on his account, they are sometimes called Zeppelins. The other type of airship is non-rigid. Non-rigid airships have no skeleton. They consist of an envelope inflated with a lifting gas such as helium, from which is suspended a gondola for crew, passengers, and cargo. The familiar Goodyear blimps have been mostly non-rigid airships. The engineers at Hybrid Air Vehicles looked at the history of rigid and non-rigid airships and came down solidly on the non-rigid side—with a twist. Rather than the cigar or American football shapes of past airships and blimps, the AirLander looks more like a pillow. A radically different design, it’s a lifting body—and heavier than air. It relies on both aerostatic lift from helium and aerodynamic lift to fly, making it a hybrid airship. “About 40 percent of our lift is aerodynamic,” Grundy says. “When we turn our engines off and we slow down, we’re heavier than air. We come down and land just like airplanes do.” The appealing energy efficiency of airships comes from their ability to float in the air as boats do on water—so it seems strange to purposefully erode that lighter-than-air quality. But there is another, problematic side to aerostatic buoyancy. “If you are taking 50 tons of cargo to a remote part of the world,” Grundy says, “and you want to put that 50 tons down in [that same spot], you now have 50 tons of buoyancy you have to deal with.” Like a pool float held underwater, it’s going to surge upward once you let off the pressure. Airships of yore would manage by venting lifting gas (not something you want to do with limited and expensive helium), taking on ballast, and elaborate rope and mooring procedures. That’s a nonstarter if you want to make money taking big things to places with little infrastructure, Grundy says, but he believes the AirLander is the answer. When the AirLander had its first flight in Lakehurst, New Jersey in 2012, it was intended as a U.S. Army surveillance craft. The Army canceled that program the following year, and HAV brought the ship across the Atlantic to Cardington, about 60 miles north of London, for a 2016 series of flights that would test its viability for civilian use. In November 2017, the unoccupied AirLander broke free from its mooring mast and deflated. Grundy says the lessons of this incident resulted in improvements to the production model, which remains on schedule. “Our base business plan sees us delivering 12 aircraft per year” beginning as soon as 2025, he says.

Gentle Giant

The Graf Zeppelin was 776 feet long. Even non-rigid airships could be enormous, according to Wichita State University professor of aerospace engineering Brandon Buerge. He cites the U.S. Navy’s N-Class blimps of the 1950s, tasked with anti-submarine and early-warning missions. They could be as large as 400 feet long and 120 feet tall, “bigger than anything we’ve been flying with any regularity,” Buerge says.

Early on, the German Zeppelins racked up an impressive record for safety and capability. The Graf Zeppelin flew more than a million miles beginning in 1928, circumnavigated the globe, and lifted more than 43 tons. “How long did it take before fixed-wing aircraft caught up?” Buerge asks. (About 30 years. The C-133 Cargomaster—first heavy lifter in the U.S. Air Force—entered service in 1958 and could carry more than 55 tons, but it had four jet fuel-guzzling turboprops.)

Still the rigid giants eventually proved fragile. The German airships used flammable hydrogen for lift, which led to the Hindenburg disaster. And the U.S. Navy’s rigid airships displayed an alarming tendency to break up in bad weather. The Germans scrapped the Graf Zeppelin at the start of World War II, while the American Navy stuck with non-rigid blimps, using them to escort shipping convoys. The blimps proved much more resilient, with one N-Class blimp, the Snowbird, crossing the Atlantic twice and beating the Graf Zeppelin’s record for endurance by flying for more than 264 hours through all kinds of weather.

“Those are the ships they would plow through ice storms,” Buerge says. “It’s hard to kill a non-rigid airship.”

No Mirage As you approach Moffett Federal Air Field in Sunnyvale, California, Hangars Two and Three are easily visible from U.S. 101, their parabolic apexes and massive door frames hulking over the relatively flat desert landscape. Seeing them from a distance does not prepare you for the feeling of their immensity as you stand between them. The giant hangars channel the early summer breeze like a box canyon. In the 1930s, they housed U.S. Navy airships like the Macon, a behemoth 785 feet long and 150 feet high. More recent tenants include the California Air National Guard and NASA. The current occupant of Hangar Two, LTA Research, is using it to house airships again. My tour guides on this bright June morning are LTA CEO Alan Weston and LTA chief of operations James McCormick, who acts as a sort of ground wire for Weston’s seemingly boundless energy. Inside the hangar, a chorus of birdsong echoes down from the rafters far overhead. Before us stands the naked, cigar-shaped skeleton of the airship they have dubbed Pathfinder 1, a 400-foot-long vessel that could easily swallow the fuselage of the Boeing 737 that brought me to California. It’s more organic sculpture than airframe, a latticework of black carbon-fiber tubes rising like the bones of an ancient leviathan awaiting its taxidermied skin—in this case, high-tech sailcloth. “Isn’t that cool?” Weston asks. His excitement is catching, but he is in some ways a strange ambassador for the return of a technology that for most of the last 70 years has been more prevalent in science fiction than in the real world, those floating billboards hovering over football stadiums notwithstanding. “Most of my career has been in spacecraft and rockets,” Weston says. He designed kill vehicles for President Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars program and spent 23 years doing research and development for the U.S. Air Force. Then he served as director of programs at NASA Ames Research Center until his retirement in August 2013. Retirement did not last long. Late that same year, Google co-founder Sergey Brin asked Weston to create a company to build an airship that could carry cargo on his humanitarian relief missions.

Weston’s enthusiasm for his new project grew as he studied the history of airships. The Hindenburg disaster of 1937 might have been the death of airships in the popular imagination, but there have been fresh design efforts in every decade since. (John McPhee’s book The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed documents a push by a strange coalition of former Navy airship men and Presbyterian ministers to develop a hybrid airplane/rigid airship in the 1970s. Their ship flew, but no one wanted it. Their dreams of at once revolutionizing air freight and missionary work went unfulfilled.) His history lessons complete, Weston concluded that the challenges that plagued the older rigid airships could be overcome. They would use non-flammable helium as a lifting gas, for starters. And the flaws that brought down Navy airships like Akron and Macon—a faulty altimeter and structural damage, respectively—could be corrected with modern avionics and strong, light materials. Each of the 13 rib-like carbon fiber “mainframes” that make up the length of Pathfinder 1 weighs just 600 pounds, but together, they support a vessel with 28 tons of lift. A broken carbon tube can be replaced in-flight. “The beautiful thing about a rigid airship is you can almost do anything you want,” Weston says. “The problem with all these blimps is you don’t have any hard points.” Pathfinder 1 will support a gondola, diesel generators, solar panels, batteries, electric motors, and vectored thrust propellers, as well as a small gangway running the length of the envelope for accessing the interior frame. While LTA will not disclose the dimensions of its in-development Pathfinder 3, it will be substantially more capacious than Pathfinder 1, with room enough in the crew gangway for passengers and for hydrogen—for fuel cells, rather than for lift. Beyond Pathfinder 3, LTA aims to build a massive rigid airship that will dwarf the Zeppelins of the past. All LTA will say on the record about its next-gen giant is that it will be too big to be built in Sunnyvale—LTA is in the process of moving into the former Goodyear Airdock hangar in Akron, Ohio. “The AirDock goes on top of this,” Weston says, gesturing up toward Hangar Two’s distant ceiling. “This is 160 feet tall. The AirDock is 200 feet tall.” That ship isn’t scheduled to fly until 2023 at the earliest, and Weston and his team have plenty to keep them busy in the meantime, like fully outfitting Pathfinder 1 and flying it to its new home in Akron—following a series of flight tests around the San Francisco Bay area. Though Weston hopes to begin these short-distance “camping trips” this year, they are currently unscheduled. “History is full of airship projects that crashed or something bad happened because people were in a rush,” Weston says. “We’re going to be careful.”

The Curse of Buoyancy

Igor Pasternak shares Tom Grundy’s view that buoyancy control is key to building a commercially practical airship. The founder of Worldwide Aeros Corporation in Montebello, California, Pasternak built tethered balloons called aerostats as a teenager growing up in Ukraine. Airships, he says, are “what I have been doing all my life.” He thinks, though, that relying on aerodynamic lift and vectored thrust will limit an airship’s operational capacity. Requiring a runway, even a short one, is another limitation. The vehicle under construction at Worldwide Aeros, the Aeroscraft Dragon Dream, is a non-cylindrical rigid airship. It takes a different approach than Hybrid’s AirLander, using a low-pressure system to compress and release helium to modulate the lift of the airship—compress the helium, shrink its volume, and you reduce aerostatic lift. Prove a heavy-lifting airship can perform true vertical take-offs and landings without ground infrastructure, Pasternak says, and “we are talking about a huge shift, dramatic shift” in the transport business. That proof is yet to come. The design review for the Dragon Dream operational demonstrator was completed only last summer, and he won’t say when its next test flight will be. As with LTA, he’s pushing the humanitarian applications of airships, having entered into a partnership with the World Food Program that he hopes will eventually see his invention delivering food to famine-struck regions.

The emphasis on charity might help to cover up some observers’ skepticism. “Hope springs eternal” is what aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia says when I ask him if the new airship ventures will change the market. “Frankly, it doesn’t scale,” he explains. “Air travel is all about scale, getting 300 people into a 777. You just can’t do that with these things.” He can’t readily think of a cargo someone would need to send faster—and at a higher price—than by ship, but slower than by jet. And exotic cargo flown to remote locales is often a one-way trip. “Air cargo is all about equipment utilization, with UPS and FedEx being the best examples of that,” he says. “They have these elaborately choreographed route networks that are all about efficient use of equipment and not having too many one-way trips.” LTA, Weston admits, is in a privileged position. With a nonprofit humanitarian mission and the backing of some of the world’s wealthiest people, Weston has been freed to think about the challenges of lighter-than-air flight one step at a time. He wants to build airships with no carbon footprint, and so hopes to utilize hydrogen fuel cells in Pathfinder 3 and beyond. Combine oxygen from the air and on-board hydrogen in a fuel cell and you can generate power as well as water, both for consumption and for ballast. “You’re generating the stuff you’re going to drink and use to wash your hands and take a shower with as you are flying around,” Weston says. “We actually gain weight with the water. One kilogram of hydrogen generates nine kilograms of water, so we have plenty of buoyancy control.” He muses that the success of airships in humanitarian relief could spur the market more generally. Perhaps low-cost, hydrogen-powered cargo airships could spur other industries, such as shipping, to transition to hydrogen power. “I view this as the project of a lifetime,” Weston says. “There’s more opportunity, in my head, to do something useful than anything I’ve ever seen.” To Buerge the aerospace engineer, helicopters seem like a reasonable analogy to the new airships. “I don’t ride on a helicopter with any regularity, and you probably don’t either,” he says. But even though the civilian helicopter market isn’t near the size of the commercial aircraft industry, “I wouldn’t call helicopters an unsuccessful technology, or a technology that doesn’t exist in a serious way.” And there’s one element of airships that hasn’t been tested seriously in recent memory: the experience of flying in one. Buerge once flew in two blimps, a Polar 400 and a Skyship 600, on one of those warm summer days that generate puffy clouds and bumpy rides in fixed-wing aircraft. The dynamics were more like a boat than an airplane, the bow coming up gradually, the ship gliding over a thermal, and then down again. Smooth. “The response isn’t anything that someone that is used to flying in heavier-than-air vehicles would interpret as turbulence,” he says. “It was as close to a magic carpet as I have ever experienced.”",electric vehicles,smithsonian.com

Featuring 21 regions around the world, the report analyzes five parameters to determine how well prepared regions are when it comes to investing in infrastructure to transition to Electric Vehicles (EVs).

The Netherlands consistently emerges top, alongside the UK and California. Sharing well defined strategies for EV infrastructure roll-out, as well as strong tax incentives and a growing volume of public charge points, these frontrunners are setting the tone for mass EV adoption.

As the global EV market evolves, countries need to ramp up investment in charging infrastructure to successfully transition to zero emission vehicles. In the report, 23 metrics across five parameters have been identified as most influential for measuring investment readiness. They have been used to determine what regions are doing well and where they could improve.

The parameters are:

1. Government leadership and incentives

Policy changes and stricter environmental regulations are some of the strongest catalysts for global EV transition.

Hong Kong leads the way, offering tax exemptions, an existing ban on ICE vehicles and penalty charges if driving in low emission zones without meeting required standards. It also has a clear net zero declaration and government budget for charging infrastructure incentives higher than 0.08% of GDP.

2. EV market maturity and readiness

A region needs to have a mature EV market to support viable investment in charging infrastructure. A mature market is characterized by vehicle affordability, availability of vehicles and ramped-up production capabilities.

Europe leads the way, particularly Norway and the Netherlands. In contrast, many South American countries have room for improvement, such as Argentina, Chile and Mexico, which have less than 2% market share of EVs currently.

3. Returns potential

Utilization is key to stable returns, and it is important to get the balance right between too much infrastructure and low utilization, and under provided infrastructure versus too high utilization, creating ""queues at the plug"". Returns potential is also affected by electricity and fossil fuel prices.

Of the regions measured, China is strongest. Europe also performs well, particularly Spain, Norway and the Netherlands.

4. Charging infrastructure

Availability and accessibility of charge points is a major factor in the transition to EVs. This means access to reliable charging at departure (street, garage or driveway), on the road, and the destination.

The Netherlands leads the way, but New York and California also do well. Although the number of charge points are relatively low, both US states will benefit from a clear national strategy, and have reliable power networks. However, New York would benefit from increasing it's ratio of public charge points, which is currently forecast to be more than 16 vehicles per charge point, compared with California's ratio of 6-10 cars per point.

5. Ease of doing business

Strong government leadership allied with a robust legal system and regulatory policies, along with strong GDP per capita, demonstrates potential and attractiveness to invest in a growing EV market.

The Netherlands, US and Singapore all top the table here.

Simon Swan, Global New Mobility Solutions Director at Arcadis, said:

""The Electric Vehicle market is moving quickly, with new charging hubs and technologies becoming available all the time. Accelerating this transition is critical for cutting emissions and limiting the impact of climate change. Widespread EV adoption is key, and even in slower to develop markets, there is progress. This index is a snapshot in time, and regions will improve as they adopt new government incentives, increase their charging infrastructure or as the EV market matures. With clear leadership and the right policies, electric vehicles can play a crucial role in tackling the climate crisis.""

The Global Charging Infrastructure Market Report is an expansion of Arcadis's 2021 Global EV Catalyst Index. The updated report features additional regions, including Norway, Turkey, Hong Kong and South America, and expanded metrics, with the inclusion of 'ease of doing business' and 'returns potential' categories.

The regions measured are: Netherlands, UK, Germany, Norway, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Canada, California, New York, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Thailand, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina.

It’s not that math isn’t a great tool for figuring out how things work in the real world, but that it’s easy for humans to not know what they missed when doing the math and running computer simulations. The thing about the real world is that you’ll figure out pretty quickly if you didn’t account for something.

Want a crazy example of this? Here’s a short YouTube video showing what happens when the real world lets you know that you didn’t get the math right.

In this case, the stunt’s planners got a cable that was strong enough for the combined weight of the people who were going to swing from the bridge. But, they forgot about the G forces that happen when swinging, which multiply the amount of force that the cable needs to withstand. When they swung, the cable broke, and the daredevils were sent plummeting into the water that was far below. Luckily, none of them died, but several of them sustained severe injuries.

Daimler & Mercedes Won’t Make This Mistake

Even the most skilled and talented engineers know that the job isn’t done until you’ve got feedback from real-world testing, and those working for Daimler Truck are no exception. They designed a really great electric long-haul truck, but now it’s time to send the prototypes into harm’s way to see how they can take the real world.

On a single charge, the Mercedes-Benz eActros LongHaul will have a range of 500 kilometers and can achieve megawatt charging. In September in Hanover, Mercedes-Benz Trucks will debut a “prototype prototype” of the eActros LongHaul as the main attraction at this year’s IAA Transportation show.

“As with all our e-trucks, we will rely on early practical tests with customers for our eActros LongHaul,” said Michael Scheib, Head of Product Management, Mercedes-Benz Trucks. “By doing so our engineers will be able to incorporate valuable knowledge gained from real-world operations – especially with regard to high-performance charging – directly into the development of the series-production vehicle. We are very pleased with the planned partnerships with Amazon and Rhenus.”

Amazon and Rhenus are planning to test the eActros LongHaul as part of a new project called “High performance charging for long-haul trucking” (aka “HoLa”). HoLa is a research project that aims to develop, operate, and study a high-performance charging infrastructure for battery-powered long distance transportation. In addition to Daimler Truck, other companies and research institutions are involved in this project.

To power the trucks, CCS charging stations will be set up at several spots on the A2 between Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia initially. As the project continues, planned sites will be equipped with megawatt charging station (MCS) charging stations that support the new MCS charging standard as a member of CharIN — the worldwide association for standardizing charging infrastructure. Daimler Truck is actively involved in CharIN’s development of a new MCS charging specification, serving as an active participant within CharIN.

The HoLa charging points will be placed along the A2 at several sites. These are distributed across both motorways and logistics centers. As a result, the system may be tested under real-world conditions, as well as obtaining genuine user experience. The rapid charging of battery electric vehicles is one area of testing: battery-powered vehicles should be able to charge fast enough that they can complete the 45-minute statutory break period.

Why They’re Doing This Instead Of Skipping To Truck Sales

Customers will be accompanied by a team from Mercedes-Benz Trucks to ensure their satisfaction throughout the project. The drivers of the e-truck will be trained in how to operate the vehicle and charging system extensively. Drivers’ comments will be recorded during regular interviews and questionnaires, which will be compiled and evaluated for future prototype development and charging technology improvement.

By installing measuring devices in the e-trucks, they are able to collect data points while these vehicles drive. These transmitted data sets will then be evaluated by Mercedes-Benz Trucks before sharing selected information with their partnering research institutions.

It’s this data collection that makes the difference in not only finalizing designs (to fix whatever isn’t working great), but also for sufficient knowledge to sell and support future mass production.

Handling Some Serious Juice

The eActros LongHaul uses batteries with lithium-iron phosphate cell technology (LFP). These are most notably characterized by their long service life and higher usable energy. At a charging station with an output of one megawatt, the batteries can be charged from 20 to 80% in under 30 minutes. The truck’s long range on a single charge, combined with megawatt charging, results in overall ranges that match those of conventional trucks — enabling two-shift operations.

The eActros LongHaul, according to Mercedes-Benz and Daimler, delivers a particularly well-balanced driveline for an outstanding driving experience. In addition, the eActros LongHaul comes standard with a number of safety features provided by the manufacturer. The concept behind the Mercedes-Benz Trucks battery-electric long-distance transport is to provide customers with a comprehensive package that includes vehicle technology, consulting, charging infrastructure and services. Customers should choose the eActros LongHaul because it is economically viable, environmentally responsible, and reliable.

Wait, What? A Megawatt!?

Right away, it’s pretty clear that we’re dealing with a lot of power, both for batteries to store, for motors to use, and for the truck to move to the wheels. It’s pretty clear why Mercedes and Daimler need to test these in the real world to make sure they aren’t breaking or having electrical problems.

At the same time, though, it’s not an otherworldly figure. A Tesla Semi can sometimes be seen charging using four Supercharger stalls, which produce 250 kW. That’s a megawatt, in total. So, we’re talking about the energy needed to rapid charge four cars, which is pretty small when you consider that a semi-truck can weigh as much as 15-20 cars.

Either way, this may give us a clue as to why other long-haul electric trucks aren’t for sale and on the road with customers yet. The development process needs to iron out all of the kinks before serious business operations can depend on them.

Market dynamics

Drivers

One of the key factors fuelling the expansion of the electric traction motor market is the increasingly stringent pollution laws that OEMs are being forced to produce and sell electric and hybrid cars. Day by day, there are more and more worries about the damaging impacts of various modes of transportation on the environment, such as air pollution. Automobile manufacturers have been compelled to create automobiles that adhere to local regulatory norms as a result of growing environmental pollution concerns.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that by 2020, there will be 10 million electric cars on the road globally, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) making up two-thirds of the fleet. With registrations tripling to 1.4 million (10% sales share) in 2020, Europe had the greatest growth, becoming the world's largest market for electric vehicles for the first time. With 1.2 million registrations, China finished in second (5.7% of total sales), while the US followed in third (2% of sales) with 295,000 registrations. Several factors have contributed to the rise in popularity of electric and hybrid vehicles. The popularity of electric and hybrid cars has been fuelled in part by government subsidies, zero emissions, improvements in battery technology, and improved user experiences. Sales of electric cars including BEVs, HEVs, and PHEVs have surged as a result of the stricter pollution regulations.

Automated systems have taken the role of mechanical links as a result of vehicle electrification. For instance, the rising use of 48-volt electrical systems in automobiles has increased the demand for powerful electric traction motors to provide the necessary power requirements. The motor business has been directly impacted by the rise in electric car sales, which bodes well for the future of the electric traction motor market.

Restraints

Electric traction motor market growth is being hampered by the high initial deployment costs in the rail industry. Deploying railroads, including locomotives, metros, trams, and other types, comes at a relatively high initial cost. Setting up field-level devices and equipment with new technology involves a sizable initial expenditure. Setting up the sophisticated infrastructure for organising transmission networks and administering new and current systems also incurs significant costs. Railway officials are also quite concerned about the significant operational and maintenance expenses following implementation.

Budget restrictions on the railroad prevent the government and commercial parties from implementing cutting-edge railway technology and solutions. Therefore, it is anticipated that the high initial cost of establishing railroads with cutting-edge technologies and solutions, such as electric traction motors, would restrain the market's expansion in the next years.

Opportunities

Due to changing fuel prices and the growing need to reduce CO2 emissions, the number of electric and hybrid vehicles is fast increasing. Nearly 40% of American automobile owners named fuel economy as the most important factor in increasing the efficiency of their vehicles, according to the Automotive Fuel Economy Survey. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that around 10 million electric vehicles were sold globally in 2020, an increase of 63% from the year before. Over 95% of the world's supply of electric two- and three-wheelers comes from China. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that China is making major efforts to address air pollution, which causes around 1 million fatalities annually. By making the required adjustments in the automobile industry to fulfil the air quality criteria established by the government, the nation is concentrating on managing air pollution and lowering carbon emissions. Aside from China, which has a sizable percentage of electric vehicles on the road, most nations in the world are seeing an increase in demand for electric automobiles.

Challenges

By degrading the winding insulation in electric motors, excessive heat brought on by overheating can lead to motor failure. Overload, inadequate power conditions, extremely effective service factors, frequent turning on and off of the motor, and a lack of airflow around the motor are all causes of overheating. In hot climates, electric motors also frequently overheat. Insulation failure is the cause of around 30% of all motor failures, while overheating is the cause of about 60%. Significant dependability problems plague permanent magnet motors; when subjected to high temperatures, these motors lose their magnetic. These motors' permanent magnets demagnetize, which lowers their torque capacity. Electric motors must thus function optimally to meet this task. Therefore, spaces with functioning electric motors require the installation of suitable cooling and ventilation systems.

441,China Could Retaliate Against America’s “Discriminatory” EV Tax Credits,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Xpeng-P7.jpg,22/09/2022,China joins Europe and Korea in voicing their concerns.,https://www.carscoops.com/2022/09/china-could-retaliate-against-americas-discriminatory-ev-tax-credits/,"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was supposed to help spur electric vehicle adoption, but it’s confusing buyers, angering other countries, and leaving some automakers unsure if upcoming models will qualify for incentives.



In a sense, it’s been a mess and that’s before factoring in the countless electric vehicles that are no longer eligible for incentives due to the law’s America first ideology.

The latest country to take issue with the act is China, which stands to lose out due to sourcing and assembly requirements. According to Bloomberg, a spokesperson for the country’s Ministry of Commerce said the IRA “discriminates against similar imported goods and is a suspected breach of the World Trade Organization principles.” Shu Jueting added, “China will continue to assess and evaluate implementation of the legislation and will take measures to safeguard its legal interests when necessary.”

The latter can be viewed as a threat, although officials didn’t elaborate on what actions they could take. However, there are a number of avenues the country could pursue if push comes to shove.

Of course, China isn’t the only country crying foul over the Inflation Reduction Act. Even before the bill became law, European Commission spokesperson Miriam Garcia Ferrer said members viewed it as “discriminating against foreign producers in relation to U.S. producers” and “this would mean that it would be incompatible with the WTO (World Trade Organization).”

The criticism continued after President Biden’s signing as South Korea has been pushing for a “flexible implementation” to avoid hurting Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis. However, the United States has downplayed its impact by telling South Korea’s national security advisor Kim Sung-han, the “IRA is likely to bring more pluses than minuses to Korea.”",electric vehicles,carscoops

SAIC Motor is China’s largest automaker. Having made significant inroads in Europe with several models, SAIC is now stepping up its efforts to reach more markets with its line-up of electric vehicles. SAIC was recently ranked 68th on Fortune’s latest Global 500 list with a total revenue of $120.9 billion.

SAIC is about to step it up a notch by introducing more EVs to the European market to add the wide selection of its EVs under the various brands that are already available in Europe. This week at IAA Transportation 2022, SAIC showcased a new electric trio, the MIFA 9 PMV, the T90 EV pickup, which were both being presented to the German public for the first time, and a fully electric 7.5 tonne lorry which was making its European premiere in Hanover, Germany.

The MIFA 9 is a 5.27-meter-long 7-seat MPV being introduced in the passenger transport segment. The acronym stands for “Maximum, Intelligent, Friendly and Artistic.” SAIC says the MIFA 9 combines generous space with a high level of comfort. It comes with a wide range of assistance systems to ensure maximum safety. Its 180 kW/245 hp electric motor provides 350 Nm of torque. It has a 90 kWh high-voltage battery that gives a range of up to 440 kilometers (WLTP combined cycle).

The Maxus T90EV was also on show. The Maxus T90EV is already available to order in the UK, with deliveries starting in Q1 2023. It starts from £49,950, excluding VAT. The T90EV is designed for both on- and off-road driving, and is equipped with a high-level spec and a contemporary and stylish interior. It has a range of 220 miles / 354 km (WLTP combined city/highway driving cycle) and a payload of 1000 kg. The Maxus’ visually sporty exterior is complemented by a modern interior with a 10.25-inch digital touchscreen instrument cluster providing a minimalist look. The Maxus T90EV will arrive earlier than several other highly anticipated pickups, showing SAIC’s commitment to avail EVs in more vehicle classes as soon as possible.

SAIC is electrifying yet another popular vehicle segment with its new 7.5-tonne Maxus Electric Light lorry. The 7.5-tonne MAXUS Electric Light truck has a 128 kWh lithium-iron-phosphate battery that enables a combined WLTP range of more than 210 kilometers when fully charged, and up to 412 kilometers in city traffic using the WLTP City Cycle at half load at a constant speed of 40 km/h. The battery can be charged in around 1.5 hours at 100 kW fast charging stations (DC), and the process takes around 11 hours at 22 kW points (AC). The 5.85-meter (with body: 6.40-meter) long electric truck has, among other things, twin tires at the rear and numerous advanced assistance systems such as an emergency braking system and a lane departure warning system.

“The MAXUS brand goes beyond light commercial vehicles, as demonstrated by our ever-expanding range of electric vehicles. Our long-term goal is to be as relevant to cars and trucks as we are now to the LCV market. To achieve this, we will continue to invest heavily in innovation, research and development, and design,” explains Jack Zhu, General Manager for Europe at MAXUS parent company SAIC. “The IAA Transportation is the leading trade fair for transport, commercial vehicles and logistics. At the MAXUS premiere in Hanover, we are putting our growing range of electric vehicles in the spotlight with an all-electric stand. As one of the most innovative and advanced electric commercial vehicle brands in Europe, SAIC MAXUS takes its leadership in this sector seriously.”

“With this trio, MAXUS is once again underlining its versatility in the all-electric commercial vehicle segment. Whether courier service or logistics, gardening or shuttle service, our model portfolio will cover almost every type of transport in the future,” explains Gerald Lautenschläger, Managing Director of Maxomotive Deutschland GmbH as the importer of the commercial vehicle brand in Germany. “MAXUS’ participation in the IAA shows the importance of the German and European market: this is the only way to implement the brand’s ambitious growth strategy.”

444,Buick Plans To Dramatically Reduce Dealerships But Aims To Offer A Better Customer Experience,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Buick-Wildcat-Concept-3.jpg,22/09/2022,Improving throughput of a smaller dealer pool could amplify the buying experience for Buick customers.,https://www.carscoops.com/2022/09/buick-plans-to-dramatically-reduce-dealerships-but-aims-to-offer-a-better-customer-experience/,"Times are changing for the automotive industry and Buick itself is no different. A new report suggests that the GMC sub-brand is planning to dramatically reduce its dealership network as it ramps up for an all-EV push. The brand’s global vice president, Duncan Aldred, laid out a plan that’s benchmarked against BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz.

Earlier this month we told you about how Buick is planning to offer basically all of its 2,000 dealers a buyout if they don’t want to make the switch to electric vehicles. Buick as a brand has promised that by 2030 it will only sell EVs and it’s expecting a number of its dealers to take the money as opposed to spending what could be seven figures to continue on.

Now, a new report from The Detroit Free Press suggests that the dealer headcount reduction could be almost tenfold. Aldred made clear that there’s no specific number of dealers that Buick wants or expects to take the buyout for now. Nevertheless, to hear him talk about what rival companies are doing, it sounds like Buick would be content if about 9 out of 10 dealers parted ways.

“It’s not a case where, ‘Oh we have a master plan and this is what we want.’ We’ll manage what we get,” Aldred said. “But the reality is – Buick has 2,000 dealers. We do typically 200,000 sales a year. BMW has about 300,000 sales a year and they have about 200 to 300 dealers. Lexus, the same and Mercedes-Benz is the same. Buick has the lowest throughput in the industry.”

Reducing the number of dealers overall would allow Buick to sell more cars through fewer locations which in turn would improve total profit for each dealer. With that additional capital, Buick hopes that dealers will spend more to improve the buying experience to the point that the brand can go toe to toe with the likes of Lexus, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and others on that front.

Of course, many Buick dealers are paired with another GM brand. In fact, across the nation, only 18 standalone Buick dealerships exist. Of the ones paired up, many already have some sort of future EV infrastructure plan for Chevrolet, GMC, or Cadillac electric vehicles.",electric vehicles,carscoops

Much of the news of India's shift to electric vehicles (EV) is limited to passenger and some commercial vehicles. But what often goes unnoticed is that EVs are perfectly suited for several niche markets as well. Agricultural automobiles like tractors and tillers are an example.

This is particularly relevant in India, which has always considered agriculture a primary economic sector. Although official figures show that agriculture accounted for only 20% of the GDP in 2020-2021, over 50% of the total population still depends on it. Most importantly, several government initiatives aim to boost this sector.

Electrification of agricultural automobiles is already happening in several developed markets. India is yet to adopt them, but that doesn't mean Indian companies are not already working on them. Speaking to DIGITIMES Asia recently, Antony Cherukara, CEO of VST Tillers Tractors, explained that the company has already begun partnering with other vendors.

""Electrification is already happening in some parts of the world like the US, but eventually, we believe that will come into India as well,"" Cherukara said. ""We have invested in an electric, autonomous tractor company called Zimeno Inc (Monarch Tractor). We also supply components to them.""

VST's plans for electrification in the local market

Having already worked with global companies, VST is all set for electrification in India. Cherukara expects the electrification of the Indian agricultural automobile market to happen in the next five to 10 years.

""VST definitely has plans for electrification,"" Cherukara said. ""We have been working on this area for the last three years. With this experience and the work we are doing for multiple companies, we are in a position to bring out products for the Indian market as well. But we believe the electric tractor market will emerge in India in the next five to 10 years. We would be more than ready for that by that time.""

But Cherukara is clear that electrification is a major shift for a company and industry that has depended heavily on ICE vehicles for a significant time. VST would have to partner with battery suppliers and other major component manufacturers in the EV supply chain to make this change possible.

""In terms of partnerships, we would definitely be interested in battery management systems and technologies in the electrical parts,"" Cherukara said. ""We have been predominantly offering IC engine driven mechanical kind of tractors. So, these are competencies that we would need to enhance as we move forward and would be looking at partnerships in these areas.""

What it takes to meet the unique needs of Indian farmers

Given the nature of their work, the agriculture sector has unique challenges that need to be overcome before EVs can make inroads. These challenges may be even more pronounced in a country like India, which is still at a developing stage of the EV ecosystem.

""The key challenge in the tractor segment is the number of hours that the tractor can operate on a single charge,"" Cherukara said. ""Unless it's six to eight hours, which means a full day's operation, it doesn't really serve the purpose of a farmer. In countries like the US, farmers buy a replaceable battery to get a continuous six to eight hours of operation because one stack approximately gives about three to four hours. But that may not be feasible in India simply because of the cost of batteries and affordability factor for the Indian farmer.""

This means that when it comes to customer adoption, a lot depends on affordability. When the cost of batteries and technology lowers, we may see a big shift toward electric vehicles. Cherukara expects this to happen first in compact and small tractors and then the larger tractors because of the reason of operational duration.

Global markets offer attractive opportunities

While VST has a clear vision of the EV trajectory in India, it is also eyeing opportunities abroad. The company sees fertile grounds in places like California, where a combination of government initiatives and farming efforts are making progress.

""In the US, the ecosystem is much more mature in terms of charging infrastructure and affordability,"" Cherukara said. ""For example, there is massive support from the government for the tractors sold in California. There is a significant subsidy for electric tractors in such markets, and many large farmers even prefer autonomous tractors. These markets will scale up faster because of the ecosystem, so we will participate in these areas.""

The global chip shortage concerns have hurt EV companies in most sectors, but agriculture automobiles have not had much trouble because their use of semiconductors is not significantly high. There have been general supply chain constraints, but these are also easing now. As things get more affordable and the EV ecosystem in India develops further, this would be a sector to watch closely.",electric vehicles,digitimes

The recall affects nearly all Tesla models manufactured since 2017, according to recall documents posted by federal regulators. Tesla says it first noticed the issue during testing in late August of this year, when technicians found the ""window automatic reversal system performance that had greater than expected variations in response to pinch detection."" The testing continued nearly into mid-September when Tesla decided to do a voluntary recall.

The issue is basically non-compliance with regulations around window reversal systems. As Tesla puts it, ""When closing in circumstances subject to FMVSS 118, Section 5, the window may exert more force than Section 5 permits before retracting. The window may also retract less than the distance required under Section 5."" The result is that, ""If a window is closing and detects an obstruction, the condition may increase the risk of a pinching injury to the occupant,"" according to the automaker.

The recall cuts almost across Tesla's entire range of cars, from the pricey Model X down to the more affordable Model 3. The affected models are: Model S and Model X vehicles produced between 2021 and 2022, Model Y cars produced between 2020 and 2022, and Model 3 cars produced between 2017 and 2022. Tesla says 100 percent of the cars in these categories are affected by the issue.",electric vehicles,vice news

When Elon Musk unveils the first AI-powered Tesla robot later this month it will mark a new chapter for the electric vehicle company.

And in fact, the robot, which is known as Optimus, is built with the same sensors and chipsets that are used in Tesla’s wildly popular self-driving automobiles.

When the world’s richest man first introduced the robot concept in 2021, slides presented by the company stated that it would stand five feet eight inches tall, and weigh125 pounds.

Tesla claimed that it would be capable of lifting 150 pounds, carrying 45 pounds, and traveling at five miles per hour. Mr Musk joked that the robot would be designed so that humans were able to run away from it, and overpower it.

Tesla’s Autopilot cameras will be installed in the robot’s head, which will also feature a screen for useful information.

In an essay for China Cyberspace magazine, Mr Musk wrote that Optimus was designed to replace human labour in “repetitive, boring and dangerous tasks.”

(via REUTERS)

“But the vision is for them to serve millions of households, such as cooking, mowing lawns, and caring for the elderly,” he wrote.

“Achieving this goal requires that robots evolve to be smart enough and for us to have the ability to mass produce robots. Our ‘four-wheeled robots’ – cars – have changed the way people travel and even live. One day when we solve the problem of self-driving cars (i.e., real-world artificial intelligence), we will be able to extend artificial intelligence technology to humanoid robots, which will have a much broader application than cars.

“We plan to launch the first prototype of a humanoid robot this year and focus on improving the intelligence of that robot and solving the problem of large-scale production.

“Thereafter, humanoid robots’ usefulness will increase yearly as production scales up and costs fall. In the future, a home robot may be cheaper than a car.

“Perhaps in less than a decade, people will be able to buy a robot for their parents as a birthday gift.”

Mr Musk will reveal the first prototype of the robot at the company’s annual AI Day on 30 September.",electric vehicles,independent
448,Kia Moves Start Of Electric Car Production In US Forward To 2024,https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/02/KIA_EV9_2.jpg,22/09/2022,News reports out of South Korea indicate that Kia may move the start of production at its new factory in Georgia forward to 2024.,https://cleantechnica.com/2022/09/22/kia-moves-start-of-electric-car-production-in-us-forward-to-2024/,"Earlier this year, Kia announced it was talking with officials in Georgia about building a factory for making electric cars near Savannah. As originally planned, it would start producing cars in 2025, beginning with the Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 7, both of which are capacious 7-passenger electric SUVs that should get lots of interest from American car buyers.

Then the Inflation Reduction Act happened and Kia suddenly found itself cut off from federal tax credits for its cars because they are not manufactured in the US. Now Reuters reports that news sources in South Korea are claiming production at the new Georgia factory will begin in 2024 instead of 2025. Kia and its parent company Hyundai Motors, along with officials in South Korea, are protesting the new law and imploring the Biden administration to provide relief from the IRA until the companies can start producing electric vehicles in America.

There are a lot of jobs involved. Kia says the new $5 billion factory in Georgia will employ 8,500 workers when it ramps up to full capacity. It seems likely officials in Georgia are also on the phone to Washington asking the government to cut Kia some slack.

Is the announcement that the factory will begin production earlier than expected an attempt to curry favor with the Biden administration? What do you think?

Inside EVs says that while Kia’s primary goal is to ensure consumers can take advantage of the federal tax credit when they purchase its EVs, there are other obvious benefits. Kia has become known as a manufacturer that produces compelling EVs and its vehicles are widely successful. The biggest issue in the US to date has been the lack of availability of Kia’s electric and plug-in hybrid models. Moving EV production to the States could help Kia deliver more EVs to keep up with the growing demand.

“This really is huge news,” Inside EVs says, “since it could mean an eventual onslaught of more affordable EVs in the US coupled with the tax credit that will make them even more affordable. It’s moves like this that will significantly boost EV adoption in the US, so it looks like it will be a win for lawmakers and Americans.”

As we said in August, policies matter, and while the Inflation Reduction Act is far from perfect, it is accomplishing one of its primary goals, which is bring back some of the manufacturing jobs that fled to other countries over the past 30 years of globalization. That’s good news for American workers.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox.

My name is Russ Mitchell. Sammy Roth is on vacation, and I’m attempting to fill his fine and well-crafted shoes. I cover automobiles at The Times. So I’m making electric cars and EV chargers the theme of this week’s Boiling Point.

I own an electric car. I test drive electric cars. I’m a big fan of electric cars.

But the public charging system for electric cars? Not a fan.

I recently piloted a Ford F150 Lightning EV from my Berkeley home down Interstate 5 to Long Beach, a 400-mile trip. The truck? Great. The charging experience? Miserable.

The misery was meted out in several ways. Charging stations were hard to find. Maps that locate stations were not reliable. Paying for a charge with a credit card often proved troublesome, sometimes impossible. Worst of all, way too many chargers were broken or otherwise out of order. (“Unavailable” is the preferred industry euphemism.)

Running low on juice at the foot of the Grapevine, for example, I found a ChargePoint station off Interstate 5 at Frazier Mountain Park Road. The station comprised two chargers on the far weedy fringes of a nearly empty Jack in the Box parking lot. Only one of the two was what’s called a DC fast charger.

The fast charger wasn’t working. Its digital readout read “unavailable.”

I called the toll-free customer service number. Yep, the charger was unavailable. Why? Not sure.

The other charger, unoccupied, was the more common slow charging variety. I plugged in, eschewed Jack in the Box in favor of a sandwich at Subway, waited an hour and 15 minutes. In that time, I’d added nine miles of range. Pathetic, yes, but nine was enough to make it down Interstate 5 to where I found a ChargePoint fast charger that worked.

A charger that is operating properly should not provoke so much joy.

Billions of dollars in state and federal subsidies will soon be pouring down on the EV charging industry. Over time, millions of public chargers are to be installed, more than a million in California alone. Great for EV owners. The more public chargers, the better.

But numbers won’t be enough. If the reliability of those chargers doesn’t improve — and dramatically — the state of California may well encounter a public backlash against the mandate that all new cars starting in 2035 must be electric.

My Interstate 5 experience was not a one-off run of bad luck. I’ve had similar problems with public chargers back home.

A study of San Francisco Bay Area charging reliability led by a researcher at UC Berkeley released earlier this year found that of 657 chargers, 23% were out of order and an additional 5% were fitted with a cable that couldn’t reach a car. Of the three biggest vendors, ChargePoint was the worst (36% not working), EVgo second worst (25% not working), followed by Electrify America (19% out of order).

The poor record is reflected in surveys. A Plug In America poll in 2021 found that 34% of EV owners surveyed reported problems with public chargers, with broken fast chargers the most common concern.

Another, published in August by market researcher J.D. Power, found that 20% of respondents showed up at a public station and did not charge up; of those, 72% said the station was out of service. Those poor numbers are worse this year than last, despite — or perhaps because of — the growth in new charging stations.

Listed on maps as public chargers, I managed to find these EVgo units up a ramp in an apartment building parking garage marked “Residential Parking Only.” Neither worked with my vehicle. (Russ Mitchell / Los Angeles Times)

My experiences on the trip illustrate the frustration.

I found plexiglass screens placed over ChargePoint touch screens throughout Long Beach that rendered a credit card purchase impossible. I ran across a Rivian driver who spent 15 minutes on the phone with Electrify America to get his app to work with the charger.

I found supposedly public chargers in buildings with no public access, including one up the ramp of a Long Beach apartment building with the entrance marked “Residential Parking Only.” Neither of the two EVgo chargers were working. One was marked “unavailable.” The other wouldn’t charge after I plugged it into my vehicle. The person on the toll-free EVgo line didn’t know why and said she’d help find another location.

Why are public chargers so unreliable?

One reason: Responsibility for service and maintenance is diffuse. Installing and operating a charging station involves a mix of players. The marketer. The installer. The site owner, often retailers that include Whole Foods as well as individual mini-mart owners. The electric utility. The internet provider. The credit card company. The manufacturer of the charger itself.

The marketers — think EVgo, Electrify America, ChargePoint — might be responsible for service and maintenance, or might not. In ChargePoint’s business model, machines are sold to site owners, who assume the responsibility to keep them in working order.

Here, I must note that Tesla has built a vast network of fast and reliable chargers.

It cost Tesla a lot of money to do this, cash that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk raised through means sketchy or not: selling huge numbers of cars, boosting Tesla’s stock price with false promises about future products, selling features like “Full Self Driving” for $15,000 that aren’t full self-driving. The result is a unified system in which the ultimate responsibility for charger reliability sits with Tesla.

Drive into Harris Ranch Inn & Restaurant near Coalinga on Interstate 5 and the Tesla difference becomes clear. There are 80 newly installed chargers soon to go into operation. There are clearly visible road signs that use arrows to easily direct drivers to the 18 chargers, located in another area, that are open and available.

For those with electric cars not named Tesla, you can search for six Electrify America public chargers in two different spots in the hotel-restaurant’s parking lot. The day I was there, one charger was unavailable.

There are six Electrify America chargers at the Harris Ranch Inn & Restaurant near Coalinga off Interstate 5. Tesla has 18 there, with 80 more on the way. Electrify America said it hoped to expand at Harris Ranch and was building a new station at nearby Kettleman City. (Russ Mitchell / Los Angeles Times)

Electrify America has more true fast chargers than the competition. The network gets some of its funding — hundreds of millions of dollars — from Volkswagen, part of its penalty after its cheating ways on diesel emissions were revealed in 2015.

Other charger companies are funded by venture capital, or have gone public through special purpose acquisition companies. One of them, Greenlots, was recently bought by Shell. All are under pressure to show profits in a business in which it’s unclear where charging profits will come from sans subsidies.

Both the federal government and California will require the recipients of billions of dollars in grants and other subsidies to maintain stations with 97% reliability. But it’s unclear thus far how company performance will be determined.

Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed a bill to require information collection, and the state says it’s studying the issue. There’s been little to no discussion about how that 97% figure will be enforced. The Bay Area study noted that although it found only 75% of public chargers were operable, the companies were reporting 95% to 98% uptime to the California Air Resources Board. The study’s methodology could account for the difference, but 20 percentage points is quite wide.

I called the three big EV charger companies to ask about the reliability problems and what they’re doing to solve them.

Anne Smart, head of global policy at ChargePoint, said reliability was improving. The company looks at comment sections online and “we see quite a trend in statements that when drivers go to these stations, they are up, they are usable.”

She noted that the $5 billion over five years to be handed out across the U.S. in federal subsidies will require 97% uptime. (California gets $384 million of that, on top of state funding.)

Asked what ChargePoint was doing to reach such high levels of reliability, she said that the majority of its public chargers were independently owned and operated.

“The site hosts are critical, she said, adding that “we provide maintenance services to help the owners keep the equipment running. … We provide a free app to locate the stations and we can receive communications from the driver when a station is not working.”

She advised ChargePoint customers to use the company’s app for payments, or use the contactless chip reader on many of the company’s chargers. Sometimes the credit card readers don’t work because they’ve been exposed to “dust or wildfire particulates,” she said.

Electrify America acknowledged that reliability was a serious issue and detailed the ways the company was addressing it.

“There are problem spots, and we recognize it,” said Rob Barrosa, head of business development. “It’s all about what you are going to do as a company to stand behind your performance.”

Five years ago, the company built what it calls a Center of Excellence where “we test every electric vehicle you can imagine” to identify potential problems from the start.

The company also maintains a network operations center. In addition to trying to keep things running, it collects and analyzes data on charger performance. “We’re looking at hundreds of thousands of charging sessions for patterns, where anomalies or errors are occurring.”

Electrify America puts at least three chargers at each station. The average, it says, is five, and in some places as many as 20.

“Redundancy is important,” Barrosa said. “If you put a single charger somewhere” and it doesn’t work, “that doesn’t instill a lot of confidence.”

The company is pressing its charger manufacturers to improve quality as well, he said. “We’ve actually tried to take ownership of the technology” and dump suppliers who can’t keep up.

And, the company has a roaming fleet of “secret shoppers” who drive around in different EVs to test the company’s equipment.

“We are doing everything we can to stay ahead,” he said. “You have to keep upping the bar over and over again.”

EVgo likewise copped to the problem, although Chief Commercial Officer Jonathan Levy felt obliged to say, “I tell people the state of charging is better than people think.” But, he added, “we have a lot of work to do to go from bleeding and leading edge” to mainstream experience.

The company has opened its own “innovation lab” in El Segundo to test cars from all the manufacturers to make sure the public charger and electric vehicle play nice together.

EVgo, founded in 2010, was an early player, and “some of those early chargers are out there and aging,” he said. The company has started replacing those.

As with Electrify America, it’s building stations with more charging points so a broken charger won’t necessarily spoil a car trip.

“We make money when chargers work,” he said. “When we don’t, we lose money, so we’re motivated to make the chargers work.”

If I were grading the public charger industry, right now I’d issue a harsh D+. At the parent-teacher conference, I’d say that Johnny is not living up to his potential. Let’s hope he applies himself.

And now, here’s what else is happening:

POINTS OF VIEW

New Tesla chargers at the Harris Ranch Inn & Restaurant, off Interstate 5. Like other EV and charger companies, Tesla would benefit greatly from the billions in subsidies Proposition 30 would produce. (Russ Mitchell / Los Angeles Times)

The Times editorial board may have surprised many people with its vote-no position on Proposition 30. That’s the tax-the-rich plan to pump $80 billion more into subsidies for electric vehicles and charging stations. (On top of the billions in subsidies already being provided by state and federal taxpayers.) A small portion of the money would go to wildfire response and prevention.

The editorial board is deep-set on pushing aggressive public policies to address climate change. In this case, though, the editorial says, “While it may be tempting to put the burden on the rich — again — for one of California’s top priorities, voters should say no. Proposition 30 has too many flaws. It’s bankrolled by one special interest and it doubles down on an unsustainable funding model.”

Personal incomes of more than $2 million a year would be taxed an additional 1.7%, for a total marginal rate of 15.05%, the highest in the country. California’s budget is disproportionately dependent on wealthy people and the income that comes from their investments. As stocks go up and down, so does the state’s revenue. And the more wealthy people are chased out of the state by high rates, the less revenue is available for state programs.

The special interest in question is Lyft. The state now requires that 90% of the miles traveled by ride-hailing companies such as Lyft and Uber be covered by electric cars. So Lyft has its own special interest. Lyft’s drivers buy their own cars. Lyft clearly wants as much subsidy money for EVs and charging stations as possible to make sure its drivers are able to afford the requirement.

Meantime, guest contributors Hal Harvey and Justin Gills write in The Times that buying a Prius alone won’t fix climate change.

In an opinion piece titled “Climate change is a big problem. Citizens must demand many small solutions,” they focus on reforming building codes to decrease energy consumption.

It’s an issue that gets less attention than it deserves, perhaps because the subject isn’t as much fun as talking about cars. File it under boring but important.

The importance was brought home to me on my trip down Interstate 5. It was in the thick of the most recent heat wave. The Amber Alert signs along the road said this: “Extreme Heat. Save Power. Stay Cool.” Talk about mixed messages.

For increasing numbers of people, staying cool means air conditioning. Better-built insulation would result in more efficient cooling.

In another opinion piece, Paul Thornton, letters editor at The Times, has his own take on EVs. “An electric car is still, well, a car — and mass car ownership has devastating environmental consequences beyond tailpipe emissions.”

Simply swapping in a less polluting powertrain into a transportation system that by itself has produced enormous environmental damage isn’t going to cut it if we’re serious about addressing climate change, he notes. (And, personally, I have doubts about whether most people are willing to give up current convenience and consumerism for the sake of future generations.)

KOCH BROTHERS, LITHIUM, GREEN CHICKEN

The batteries that power electric vehicles require prodigious amounts of mined minerals — lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, graphite and the like. The more EVs produced, the more mines must be dug.

Some EV proponents would prefer that those mines be dug in somebody else’s backyard. In Chile, say, or the Congo.

The dilemma that will increasingly confront America’s environmentalists is distilled in a recent piece by Substack author Doomberg, a couple of anonymous writers whose trademark is a cartoon version of a green chicken.

Doomberg launched their $30-a-month Substack in April and said they’d already drawn several thousand subscribers. (Do the math.) The pair boast decades of experience in heavy industry, private equity and finance.

Not all readers of The Times will agree with Doomberg’s opinions, but they raise essential issues that demand consideration. Reflect on their latest take, which looks at the discovery in Maine of what is said to be “the richest known hard rock lithium deposit in the world.” It’s a few miles northeast of the Sunday River ski resort.

Lithium isn’t simply essential to EV production. EVs are powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lithium is intrinsic.

U.S. lithium production is scant. Chile and Australia are big lithium exporters. China has a hammerlock on production of most of the minerals involved in EVs. President Biden has been pushing to ease mine permitting to encourage more U.S. control over essential materials for the manufacture of electric vehicles and battery storage systems for solar and wind power, with economic and geopolitical implications.

But some environmentalist groups in Maine, vocal in support of electric vehicles, are fighting to prevent the $1.5-billion lithium mineral load from ever being unearthed. As Doomberg puts it, they’d “like all the benefits the mining sector brings to modern life while taking no part in the reality of acquiring energy resources or critical-to-the-economy minerals.”

The reality that “clean” electric cars are not pristine was made clear in the recent announcement that the Koch Minerals & Trading company sank $252 million into Compass Minerals, which is developing a lithium carbonate operation near the Great Salt Lake in Utah.

Expect heated controversy around mining for EV materials in the U.S. over the next few years.

ONE MORE THING

If Juan Galaiviz of Santa Ana sold his gasoline car to buy an EV, there’d be two cars on the road. Alternatively, he could destroy the car he has now and eliminate its future pollution. (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)

People often ask me whether they should buy an electric car. I ask why they want one. The most common response is a variation on “I want to do my part to save the planet.” (And save money on gasoline too.)

Not everyone appreciates my take on the subject: If you want to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases, and you already own a car, you should really keep that car until it can’t be driven anymore. Yes, that noisy, foul-smelling, gasoline-guzzling greenhouse-gas-spewing machine.

Heavens, why? The logic is simple. If you do sell that car to buy an electric vehicle, the new owner will keep burning the gasoline you used to burn, and keep emitting the same carbon dioxide and toxic pollution you once inflicted on Mother Earth.

Meanwhile, you’ll be responsible for all the emissions that come with your brand new electric car — the emissions associated with the vehicle’s manufacturing process, the manufacturing process of the batteries, the emissions that come with the mining and transporting of minerals that allow the batteries to function.

And then there’s the emissions that emanate from the generation of electricity used to charge up your car — unless you are connected to a 100% renewable electric grid. Even then, the making of solar cells and panels and giant windmills emits carbon dioxide too.

There are myriad studies on the greenhouse gas costs of making and using a new electric car. The costs are far less: more than 40 tons of what’s called carbon dioxide equivalent over the life an an average size internal combustion car, compared with about 20 tons for an electric car, according to the International Energy Agency.

Even if the electricity is clean, you’re stuck with the carbon costs of manufacturing — about 5 tons, about the same as for gasoline and diesel cars, the IEA reports.

Bottom line, by keeping your old car, you save the atmosphere from at least 5 tons of carbon.

You could have your gasoline combustion car destroyed — even better for the planet. Then you could buy your new EV with a fairly clean conscience.

Of course, you could try to do without a personal motor vehicle at all and walk, use a bicycle, take public transportation. That’s the best choice.

But most people need a car. If you’re driving a 20-year-old Toyota while someone else is buying a brand new Tesla, congratulations. By comparison, the environmental steward is you.

The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker gave some executives new roles and said that its chief financial officer will begin reworking supply chain operations until a new global purchasing chief is hired.

The changes arrive at a time of profound change for Ford and the auto industry, which for more than a century have made a living by selling petroleum-powered vehicles. The company has plans for half of its global production to be electric vehicles by 2030, but like its main competitors, Ford will need to keep selling gas-burning vehicles to fund the massive transition.

Earlier this year CEO Jim Farley split the company into two units, Ford Model e to develop electric vehicles, and Ford Blue to handle internal combustion cars, trucks and SUVs.

Early Thursday, Ford announced that CFO John Lawler would run a makeover of its supply chain operations until the company finds a new supply chain chief.

Doug Field, who was hired from Apple Inc., will now become chief advanced product development and technology officer. He'll lead vehicle design and hardware engineering, and continue duties overseeing electric vehicles, software and digital systems, and driver assistance systems.

Former Chief Operating Officer Lisa Drake, now vice president of EV industrialization, takes on manufacturing engineering as Ford plans to produce EVs at a rate of 2 million per year by the end of 2026.

The company also announced two new hires from Hewlett-Packard and Google to develop vehicle software and driver assistance systems.

“Developing and scaling the next generation of electric and software-defined vehicles requires a different focus and mix of talent from the accomplished Ford team, Farley said in a statement.

Ford previously announced that Hau Thai-Tang, former head of product development and purchasing, will retire Oct. 1 after more than 34 years with the company. It announced Thursday that Dave Filipe, vice president of vehicle hardware, will retire.

Story continues

Guidehouse Research Principal E-Mobility Analyst Sam Abuelsamid said Farley is changing the people Ford hires as it joins other automakers in developing new vehicles that can be changed over time with software updates. “Customers like to get new features added over the life of a car,” he said. “The industry likes it because they see potential for new revenue streams.”

But that change takes a different mindset than people who are used to developing vehicles that aren't changed for years until the next version comes out, he said.

Ford, he said, will probably experience instability for a while as large changes happen. “They need to hire a lot of people with different skill sets,” he said.

On Monday, Ford revealed that a parts shortage would keep many of its most profitable vehicles sitting on lots waiting to be fully assembled. The issue forced the automaker to slash its third-quarter earnings forecast. The company also has been hobbled by problems with manufacturing launches of new vehicles and high warranty claims.

Ford also said Monday that its inflation-related supplier costs for the third quarter were about $1 billion above what it had been planning for.

Last month the company let go of 3,000 white collar workers to cut costs and help make the long transition from internal combustion vehicles to those powered by batteries.

Governments across the globe are pushing to eliminate combustion automobiles to mitigate the impact of climate change. Companies like Ford are orchestrating the wind-down of their combustion businesses over multiple years, even though they are still generating the cash to fund electric vehicle development.

Shares of Ford fell just under 1% Thursday as the broader markets dipped. The shares are down about 38% for the year.",electric vehicles,yahoo entertainment

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Tesla is recalling nearly 1.1 million U.S. vehicles because the window automatic reversal system may not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.

The electric vehicle manufacturer told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that it would perform an over-the-air software update of the automatic window reversal system. The recall covers some 2017-2022 Model 3, 2020-2021 Model Y, and 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles.

Tesla said that it was not aware of any warranty claims, field reports, crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the recall.

NHTSA said a closing window without the proper automatic reversing system may exert excessive force by pinching a driver or passenger before retracting, increasing the risk of injury.

NHTSA said the vehicles failed to comply with the requirements of a federal motor vehicle safety standard on power windows.

Tesla said that during product testing in August employees identified window automatic reversal system performance that had ""greater than expected variations in response to pinch detection.""

After extensive additional testing, Tesla determined that the vehicles' pinch detection and retraction performance in the test results did not meet automatic reversal systems requirements.

Tesla said that starting Sept. 13, vehicles in production and in pre-delivery received a software update that sets power-operated window operation to the requirements.

The software update ""enhances the calibration of the vehicle’s automatic window reversal system behavior,"" Tesla said.

Tesla shares were down 3.5% in Thursday afternoon trading.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on Twitter Thursday criticized the description of the callback as a recall.

""The terminology is outdated & inaccurate. This is a tiny over-the-air software update. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no injuries,"" he said.

Both NHTSA and Tesla in documents made public on Thursday referred to the campaign as a recall.

BMW distributor in Malaysia, Millennium Welt has announced new BMW i Charging facilities at the twentyfive.7 Experience Gallery in Kota Kemuning, which will serve residents with battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles within and around the Kota Kemuning township.

This follows the opening of the BMW i Charging facilities by Millennium Welt at the Gamuda Gardens Experience Gallery in Rawang, Selangor in February. Outfitted with two BMW i Wallbox Gen 3 chargers, these are open to members of the public and are available to use free of charge, daily from 9am to 6pm.

Compared to the chargers at Gamuda Gardens which are Gen 2 units, rated at 11 kW output each; the Gen 3 units at the twentyfive.7 Experience Gallery support charging of up to 22 kW, subject to the supported charging capacity of the vehicle. For an EV such as the BMW iX xDrive40, the Type 2 connection supports 11 kW AC which will give the iX xDrive40 a full charge in seven hours 15 minutes.

“More than just a new way of mobility, [using electrified vehicles] is a way of living that is also more responsible to the environment. As such, we remain committed not just in the delivery of premium electric vehicles to our customers, but also the ecosystem that enables it to be better integrated into everyday life,” Millennium Welt managing director Bryan Wong said in a statement.

“Planning ahead to support our community in all our townships, we are glad to once again partner with Millennium Welt to install the BMW i Charging facilities in our developments, this time in twentyfive.7. We anticipate the facilities will benefit our many residents and visitors alike,” said Gamuda Land executive director Jess Teng.",electric vehicles,paul tan's automotive news

Supplies are limited, and will remain so for years because digging new mines and refineries with a lot of optimism doesn’t work. It takes years to establish a new mine, therefore companies must plan several years ahead.

However, as I previously mentioned, Japanese auto manufacturers are in a bind when they’re almost entirely reliant on rare earth minerals and battery minerals from China. Given this backdrop, it’s not surprising that the Japanese government has realized they need to get ahead of the curve by developing their own clean energy technology and being more competitive elsewhere if they want to keep up with China. According to Quartz, China’s stranglehold on key minerals that drive not just clean technologies but also a variety of other important things including medical imaging came to a head for Japan in 2010 after a territorial dispute.

Could China’s victory against Japan in the past be influencing Japanese carmakers’ technology decisions today? After all, supply-chain disruption was a big part of how China won, and now that country is pouring resources into hydrogen fuel cells while most other nations are backing battery electric vehicles.

Honda has been on a similar road until quite recently. I’ve called them boneheads at least once for not taking electric vehicles seriously, much like Toyota. But Honda has made some moves more recently that show that the company could be changing its mind.

In April 2021, worldwide Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe spoke about the company’s plans for electrified vehicle sales as part of its goal to have carbon-neutral goods and operations by 2050. The aim is for 100% of North American purchases to be battery-electric and fuel cell electric vehicles by 2040. Readers may learn more about that news by going here.

Last July, the company gave us a sneak peek of its design studio working on the Prologue EV. Not only was it doing innovative things to design its EV, but it seemed like it was building its own version of the upcoming budget-friendly Chevrolet Equinox EV. We received notice of the Acura Precision EV concept a month later. It was clearly intended by the Acura Design Studio in Los Angeles to push the boundaries of Acura design and technology, displaying Acura’s future vision for electrified vehicles with unique manual and full driving automation experiences. This concept became the ZDX.

As I pointed out at that time, it might not seem like partnering with GM was the best move to make, as GM is pretty far behind Tesla and some other players, but it is gearing up to dominate a very important slice of the automotive market, the $30,000-$35,000 segment. This gives GM a real shot of catching up, or at least getting a lot closer, in the next few years. Honda can take the first part of that ride with GM and then jump off toward its own higher-end projects as it gets its own platforms sorted out and ready to produce.

So, it makes sense to be cautiously optimistic about Honda right now, but we also need to keep an eye on the company to see how serious it is about BEVs.

Honda Just Made A Deal That Tips The Scales Toward “They’re Serious” A Bit

Earlier this month, the company announced a deal with Hanwa Co., Ltd. (Hanwa), a major Japan-based trading company, that will help procure essential metals for batteries necessary for its electrified vehicles.

Honda made the following statement about its carbon neutrality objective: “We committed to achieving carbon neutrality for all of our products and corporate activities by 2050, as we’ve done since last year. To do so, Honda is pushing to make battery-electric cars (EVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCVs). By 2040, Honda aims to release 30 EV models around the world with production volume of more than 2 million units each year in order to achieve this goal.”

Honda says that it established a strategic collaboration with Hanwa, a major trading firm with expertise in the area of resource procurement, to ensure that its electrification strategy is continuously implemented. Honda will maintain steady metal acquisition in the medium to long term, ensuring critical metals such as nickel, cobalt, and lithium are available for batteries at the core.

Honda also said in its press release that it will continue to collaborate with a variety of suppliers to guarantee efficient supply of vital resources, allowing the company to more fully execute its electrification plan and eventually achieve carbon neutrality.

This Doesn’t Prove Much Alone, But Good Things Are Adding Up

Talk is cheap, and there has been a lot of cheap talk over the years in the automotive industry regarding EVs. Like the iPhone a few years ago, there’s always a “Tesla killer” waiting in the wings, and big auto is always just around the corner from giving those whipper snappers and their edgy techno-king their comeuppance. But, over and over again, it hasn’t materialized for one reason or another.

Honda first talked the talk in 2021, and then started walking the walk some this year. It has partnering with GM to not have to start at square one, and is saying that it has plans to eventually move on from that arrangement or grow its own development on top of it. But, it’s important to keep in mind that building an Ultium-based vehicle with GM means using GM’s battery supply chains, and that means Honda won’t have anything of its own for serious growth later.

So, this latest battery supply deal might not seem like much on its own, but it’s some fairly solid “show me the money” proof that Honda is serious about getting its own battery supply chain going for its own Honda-platform electric vehicle that it has promised to move toward to. This isn’t proof that Honda is going to finish up its plan, but unlike talk, making deals like this isn’t cheap. So, it’s a little more walk being walked.

So, there’s reason to be a little more optimistic about Honda’s future with BEVs. I think that’s a good thing, as Honda tends to make high quality products that buyers love and that tend to last when cared for even in a half-assed way by the owner. For Honda to make a serious EV effort means there could be some real good quality EVs coming in the next few years. We can always use more of that.

455,Nvidia intros Drive Thor for autonomous vehicles,https://img.digitimes.com/newsshow/20220922vl205_files/2_2b.jpg,22/09/2022,"Nvidia has introduced Drive Thor, its next-generation centralized computer for safe and secure autonomous vehicles.",https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20220922VL205/adas-autonomous-driving-nvidia.html,"Nvidia intros Drive Thor for autonomous vehicles

Nvidia has introduced Drive Thor, its next-generation centralized computer for safe and secure autonomous vehicles.

Drive Thor, which achieves up to 2,000 teraflops of performance, unifies intelligent functions - including automated and assisted driving, parking, driver and occupant monitoring, digital instrument cluster, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) and rear-seat entertainment - into a single architecture for greater efficiency and lower overall system cost, said the vendor.

The next-generation superchip comes packed with the cutting-edge AI capabilities first introduced in the Nvidia Hopper multi-instance GPU architecture, along with the Nvidia Grace CPU and Nvidia Ada Lovelace GPU. Drive Thor with MIG support for graphics and compute enables IVI and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) to run domain isolation, which allows concurrent time-critical processes to run without interruption. Available for automakers' 2025 models, it will accelerate production roadmaps by bringing higher performance and advanced features to market in the same timeline.

""Advances in accelerated computing and AI are moving at lightspeed,"" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. ""Drive Thor is the superhero of centralized compute, with lightning-fast performance to deliver continuously upgradable, safe and secure software-defined supercomputers on wheels.""

Signaling the transportation industry's support for this new supercomputing architecture, Geely-owned automaker Zeekr announced it will integrate Drive Thor on its centralized vehicle computer for its next-generation intelligent electric vehicles (EV), starting production in early 2025.

Drive Thor supports multi-domain computing, isolating functions for automated driving and IVI. Typically, dozens of electric control units are distributed throughout a vehicle to power individual functions. With Drive Thor, manufacturers can efficiently consolidate many functions on a single system-on-a-chip (SoC), which eases supply constraints and simplifies vehicle-design development, resulting in significantly lower cost, less weight and fewer cables, said Nvidia.

Drive Thor is the first AV platform to incorporate an inference transformer engine, a new component of the Tensor Cores within Nvidia GPUs. With this engine, Drive Thor can accelerate inference performance of transformer deep neural networks by up to 9x, which is paramount for supporting the massive and complex AI workloads associated with self driving, said Nvidia.

The new superchip also uses the latest NVLink-C2C chip interconnect technology, while running multiple operating systems. The advantage of the NVLink-C2C is its ability to share, schedule and distribute work across the link with minimal overhead. This equips automakers with the compute headroom and flexibility to build software-defined vehicles that are continuously upgradeable through secure, over-the-air software updates.

""The shift to software-defined vehicles with centralized electronic architectures is accelerating, driving a need for more powerful and more energy-efficient compute platforms,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights. ""The virtualization, high-speed data transfer and massive processing performance of Nvidia Drive Thor can enable safer vehicles, better user experiences and potential new revenue streams.""",electric vehicles,digitimes
456,Electric vehicles are way too expensive for mass adoption,https://images.livemint.com/img/2022/09/22/600x338/oped2_1663869018756_1663869056883_1663869056883.jpg,22/09/2022,High R&amp;D spends and competition have done little to cheapen EVs,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/electric-vehicles-are-way-too-expensive-for-mass-adoption-11663868928599.html,"How much does it cost to build an electric car? As new electric vehicle (EV) makers burn through billions of dollars of cash and pour hundreds of millions more into research and development (R&D), the answer, it would seem, is a lot. And all that money hasn’t moved the world much closer to mass adoption. EVs are built with fewer parts than regular cars and they’re often sourced from other companies. Vehicle makers don’t necessarily build the car, either, often buying off-the-shelf software and expanding on it. So how much value-addition does the firm that ends up putting its brand on the product really contribute? What do the likes of Li Auto, Rivian Automotive, Nio, XPeng and their peers spend billions of dollars on, even as most of them run up net losses?

R&D outlay continues to surge, and yet there are relatively few vehicles to show for it. For China’s Nio, this expense rose 143% in the second quarter compared to a year ago. The increases, it noted, came from personnel and “incremental design and development"" costs for new technologies. Over that period, it went from spending $6,250 of R&D per vehicle sold to $12,964. Meanwhile, net losses deepened to $404.5 million from around $91 million.

Its fellow EV manufacturer, the New York-listed and China-headquartered XPeng, boosted R&D by 47% for hiring and employee compensation. Li Auto, in a June prospectus, said it was raising more money in the US for next-generation vehicle technologies, smart cabins and autonomous driving, along with developing future car models. Its latest quarterly earnings showed a 134% increase in expenditure, while it delivered just 28,687 cars in the three months through June. That’s over $8,000 of R&D per car.

For Rivian, which is even further away from getting to large-scale manufacturing anytime soon, expenditure is so high and production is so low that the per-car economics barely make sense.

There’s limited disclosure on the stages of development or the features that are costing so much, nor on why so many R&D specialists are being hired. Unlike, say, pharmaceutical companies that release detailed presentations about their drug pipelines, development phases and clinical trials, EV makers (and even incumbents) wax lyrical about their soon-to-be mass produced vehicles with only thousands of cars to show for it, and no sign that what they do make is that much better. What even is a good or competitive electric vehicle at this point? Whether it takes you 200 kilometres (124 miles) or slightly more, it doesn’t change the fact that many of these models still cost close to the median US household annual income of around $67,000, which is very high.

Investors like to justify this capital-draining behaviour by noting that all startups burn cash and lose money. Sure, but those are firms in their early years. These firms have tapped public debt and equity markets, subsidies and incentives—they’re well past being able to lean on this logic. Their future depends on the unit economics and how much it costs for them to grow.

Compare this to EV makers like Tesla and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s BYD Company that have ramped up production aggressively in their markets over the past few years, put their weight behind the right batteries and boosted their volumes significantly. For each dollar or yuan of capital they spend, there are products to show—better cars and batteries. Elon Musk’s firm has cut waiting times for its various models in China.

The issue isn’t just the spending. People want to buy EVs, but waiting times in the US and Europe can be as long as 15 months or more. They don’t want to—and can’t—wait until manufacturers figure out how to run their businesses well or how to efficiently invest in production. Instead of splashing out on marketing expenses or extraneous on-the-margin technology, they should really be cementing the purchase price of cars rather than telling eager buyers they’ve had to raise them. At this point, prospects of breaking even remain distant for these manufacturers.

The current levels of R&D expenditure relative to EV makers’ units produced show these firms weren’t really ready to be public companies—especially those that rushed to the market through special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). It’s possible they just aren’t sure their spending will yield results, or that they can make commercially viable cars at scale. Either way, investors and consumers shouldn’t be funding their futuristic vehicles when there aren’t enough EVs to begin with.

As fears of an imminent global recession loom, profitability is more important than ever for investors. The likes of Tesla and BYD have a path forward. For the others, it’s unclear.

Washington startup Carbon Lite Trailers is looking to bring carbon construction to the tiny end of the spectrum, using it to create a simple utility-cum-camping teardrop so lightweight it can be pulled by a motorcycle as well as a humble electric car. Called the Rift, the trailer easily shifts between cargo hauling and camping via a lightweight removable galley wall, offering seven-day-a-week utility. Crisp edges, gullwing doors, glossy gelcoat carbon fiber and striking graphics combine to create a trailer that looks straight out of the motorsport market and rides like it isn't even in the rear-view.

A family business started up by seemingly just the right family, Carbon Lite was founded by Chris Durham. Looking to build on his 35 years of experience in product design and manufacturing in the aerospace, automotive and action sports segments, Durham set his sights on disrupting the camping trailer market with a new breed of ultralight trailer. He didn't have to look far for good help, bringing on his wife Nancy, a business and finance guru, and his son Matthew, who brought along 20 years of composite manufacturing know-how of his own.

We've seen some lightweight trailers before, including the chicken-feather-composite Earth Traveler T300 that now lists at 400 lb (181 kg) and the 500-lb (227-kg) German-built Kleox Shelter, so we have to take issue with Carbon Lite's claim that its trailer is half the weight of the nearest competitor (the Kleox isn't its competition, but the US-built Earth Traveler is). However, Carbon Lite's Rift is very light, with a base weight that comes in at 450 lb (204 lb) for the basic road-going model or 660 lb (300 kg) for the more fully equipped and rugged variant.

Carbon Lite distinguishes its trailers from others with high-lifting gullwings Carbon Lite

That light dry weight is no coincidence, of course, owing primarily to Carbon Lite's specific formula of pre-impregnated fiberglass and carbon fiber. It's crafted a monocoque for a signature blend of low weight, high strength and long-lasting durability. The roof, sidewall and floor panels all include foam core insulation.

Like any other traditional teardrop, the Rift has a sleeper interior and a rear galley separated by a wall. This particular sub-10-lb (4.5-kg) wall removes rather easily, however, turning the teardrop camper into a utility trailer with easy-loading tailgate hatch.

A teardrop isn't quite as ideal as a flatbed or box when it comes to hauling things behind the vehicle, but the Rift's open interior should be able to handle home improvement supplies, tools, refuse and more. We suppose owners will want to be careful not to load it up with anything too dirty or pungent, so as not to taint their weekend camping experience, but the dual-use design helps ensure the trailer spends more time earning its keep and less time sitting idly in a garage or under a tarp.

The Rift's carbon monocoque comes coupled to a powder-coated aluminum chassis for further weight savings. A 1,200-lb (544-kg) Timbren Axle-Less suspension cushions the 15-in aluminum wheels.

A dramatic arch, sharp edges and a graphics package help the glossy gel-coated carbon give the Rift a distinctive identity Carbon Lite

Saving weight in the strictest sense also means paring down standard equipment. So the base-level US$29,000 Rift Utility Camper comes as a largely empty shell with a few essential add-ons thrown in to get the buyer out adventuring with less fuss. A pair of Yakima crossbars adds integrated gear-carrying; a roof hatch keeps the interior breathing; a GoalZero Yeti 150 serves as a 14-Ah onboard power supply; and a Sub Z cooler provides cold food & bev storage. There's also interior and exterior lighting. In place of the fixed or folding foam mattress common in teardrops, Carbon Lite goes light and simple once again with an inflatable double. Owners can store their own cooking gear and dishes in the galley and have a road-trip-worthy trailer ready to go.

Those looking for a dirt-ready Rift build with additional equipment can slide upmarket to the $39K 660-lb (300-kg) Rift Adventure Trailer. Ride upgrades include a 2,000-lb (907-kg) Timbren suspension, off-road tires, running boards with carbon inserts, and a protective nerf bar around the edges. This variant comes with a fridge, slide-out stove and sink in the galley, a power pack upgrade, and a folding mattress/sofa. A front cargo box is also available and melds quite seamlessly with the tear body.

The front utility box is available as an add-on Carbon Lite

Carbon fiber construction isn't cheap, even when you shrink it down to teardrop size. Those looking for a more semi-budget option can do their their own finishing with the $19,000 Finish it Yourself model, which includes the body and chassis, suspension, wheels and tires, roof hatch, doors and windows.

While all those prices are certainly intimidating for a small, basic teardrop trailer, we do like seeing someone experimenting with carbon fiber tiny camper design. As more and more vehicles go electric, finding ways to lighten tow loads is going to be critical.

After moving into a new larger production facility, Carbon Lite announced Rift availability on Tuesday. More info is available at the website linked below.

If you want to read about some more EV stocks, go directly to 5 Best Electric Vehicle Stocks to Buy for Long Term.

Even as the sales of electric cars skyrocket across the globe, boosting the best electric vehicle stocks to buy for the long term, like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and General Motor Company (NYSE:GM), the percentage of EVs on the roads compared to gasoline vehicles is still shockingly low. According to a report by The New York Times, of the 250 million cars on the roads in the United States, fewer than 1% are electric vehicles.

Automakers expect EVs to comprise more than a quarter of all car sales by 2035, bridging some of this gap. However, even these projections indicate that by that time, only 13% of the vehicles on the roads will be electric. For context, the European Union is already moving ahead with plans to phase out internal combustion engines by 2035. Per data by the NYT, even by 2050, as electric vehicles comprise 60% of new sales, gasoline cars will still outnumber EVs on the roads in the United States.

US President Biden has recently outlined an ambitious plan to reach net carbon zero emissions by 2050, pushing a new climate bill that includes hundreds of billions in subsidies and tax credits for EV manufacturers and adopters to meet the target. Per the NYT, if the US is to meet this goal and go towards a fully electric fleet on the roads, it would also have to phase out the internal combustion engine by 2035. Investors are already loading their portfolios with EV stocks in anticipation of this EV boom for the coming decades.

On September 14, Needham analyst Vikram Bagri launched new coverage of a number of EV manufacturers, noting that a key takeaway from the industry was that the ""growth forecasts for EVs still appear conservative"". The analyst further added:

Story continues

“The individual OEM targets, government mandates for banning internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles around the world, and capital being invested in the space all point to stronger growth in EV adoption.”

The analyst elaborated that the rapid rise in gas prices in 2022, increasing availability of EV models, and government support has made the environment for EVs ""more constructive than ever"", with adoption picking up rapidly. However, he also cautioned that the bullishness on the EV space overall does not translate to bullishness on all players operating in the industry for the near-term.

""EVs Still Appear Conservative"": Best Electric Vehicle Stocks to Buy for Long Term

10. BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/A

BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF) engages in the research, development, manufacture, and sale of automobiles and related products in China. One of the top arguments for listing the firm as one of the best electric vehicle stocks to buy for the long term is the bullish sentiment on the stock from Warren Buffett, a legendary value investor known for his long-term bets. Buffett owns an 8% stake in the company, purchased back in 2008. BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF) has slowly become the largest EV maker in the world in terms of production.

BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF) is expanding in global markets like Norway as the sales of EVs increases in China as well. The August sales numbers for the company jumped nearly 185% year-on-year.

Just like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and General Motor Company (NYSE:GM), BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF) is one of the best electric vehicle stocks to buy for the long term.

9. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 9

Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) operates as a resource company in the United States and Argentina. The stock is featured on the list of best electric vehicle stocks to buy for the long term because it is one of the top US-based companies with interests in lithium. Lithium is the most essential material needed for the development of EV batteries. Lithium production and refining facilities are presently monopolized by the Chinese, but the US is subsidizing domestic firms to make them more competitive globally.

On September 19, Piper Sandler analyst Charles Neivert assumed coverage of Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) stock with an Overweight rating and a price target of $38, noting that lithium is an absolute global necessity as the world begins to tackle climate issues.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Singapore-based investment firm Himension Capital is a leading shareholder in Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC), with 3.3 million shares worth more than $66.9 million.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Massif Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC): The volatility noted above in LAC has resulted in solid returns via our options trades around our core equity position. At the current time, we are short calls on LAC, as we have done multiple times throughout the position’s life, expiring on May 21, 2021, at a $17.5 and $22.5 strike price. The volume of contracts sold at each strike corresponds to the size of the equity position we want should the calls expire in the money, and the underlying equity gets called away from us. The thought process behind this trade construction is that if we know the size of the position we want at a particular price point, there is no reason not to accumulate additional returns by pre-selling the stock we would have sold anyway. High levels of volatility positively impact the price of options, increasing the premium we can earn from selling covered calls. To date, we have sold covered calls on LAC that have expired worthless four times, yielding a roughly 7% return on the equity position’s current value or 71bps for the portfolio overall. The outstanding covered calls appear to be trending towards a similar worthless expiration. If they do, the covered call trades on LAC will result in us owning the shares with committed capital of -$0.28 per share. Although we believe in the fullness of time LAC warrants a $30+ valuation, the prices achieved in early January of this year were not justified by the underlying fundamentals. Some will argue we should have sold down our position. We had already established our option positions and believe LAC is an emerging major in the lithium mining industry. Thus, we decided to maintain the position unchanged. Although still relatively high, the current $15 per share valuation is not crazy compared to where we think the firm should be trading based on fundamentals, so we are no longer overly concerned with the position as is..(click here to read more)

Petroleum products imported by Kenya increased by 12.0% to 6.4 million tonnes in 2021, costing the country a whopping $3 billion!

Kenya’s fuel subsidy program that was rolled out to cushion consumers from skyrocketing petrol, diesel, and kerosene prices has been a hot topic in the country. In February of 2021, the BusinessDaily gave a good summary of the policy interventions in Kenya’s petroleum sector. The government started collecting an additional Sh5 per liter of fuel in 2020 as part of a development levy. This was about 5 cents (USD) per liter at the time. The money would go into a “petroleum development levy fund” which would be used to cushion consumers when crude prices went above $50 per barrel. Well, as we know, things became a little hectic in the global energy sector over the past year, with oil going well above $50 per barrel. The government had to dip into this fund to subsidize retail fuel prices to help cushion consumers from the price shocks. The price of oil even went up to well over $100 a barrel this year and this caused some headaches as the subsidy would be unsustainable in the long term.

In his inaugural address last week after being sworn in as president, President William Ruto said, “Our people are confronted daily with increasingly unaffordable prices, especially food and transport. In our economic forums across the country during the campaign, citizens consistently shared their anxiety, pain and fury on this matter. It calls for an urgent and decisive resolution. The interventions in place have not borne any fruit. On fuel subsidy alone, the taxpayers have spent a total of KSh 144 billion ($1.2 billion), a whopping KSh 60 billion ($500 million) in the last 4 months.”

A Twitter user ephraimnjegafans had an interesting analysis of this subsidy. He says that the money could have been used for more long term solutions such as purchasing electric buses. “This money could have bought 28,000 electric buses at a cost of KSh 5 million each.” Here, he was referring to the BYD K6 electric buses that are available to purchase in Kenya for KSh 5 million each, excluding the battery. Bus operators can then lease the batteries for KSh 20 ($0.18) per km on Basigo’s the pay-as-you-drive model for battery and associated services. The user goes on to add that the move would help reduce electricity costs in the long term as part of an accelerated adoption of electric mobility which will take up “idle” power.

Kenya’s total installed capacity of electricity increased to 2,991 MW in 2021 from 2,836.7 MW in 2020. Peak demand is close to 2,200 MW. However, in the off-peak night time, demand drops to around 1,200 MW. This means that the power company has some excess capacity at night leading to the venting of geothermal steam. Kenya has done really well to grow the share of renewables in its electricity generation mix. Renewables provided 89% of Kenya’s electricity generation in 2021, thanks to contributions from geothermal, wind, hydro, and some utility-scale solar. Kenya is one of the major players in the geothermal space and is in the top 10 in the world when it comes to geothermal generation installed capacity. Kenya’s installed geothermal capacity is now close to 1,000 MW. It would be a shame to keep putting all this clean geothermal to waste during the off-peak periods.

Minibus operators in Nairobi say their daily operations are generally around 200 km per day. The BYD K6, with a range of about 250 miles in city driving, could potentially meet their needs throughout the day and then be charged overnight at the depot. The 28,000 buses charging overnight could then help boost the power utility’s revenues by soaking up kWh at night while also displacing some diesel imports, saving foreign currency.

A study by Madara, et al. in 2018, with data up to the end of 2017, states that a total of 55,435 minibuses (matatus) have been registered in Kenya since 1968. Their paper also suggested that the number of in-service matatus is estimated to be between 11,056 and 14,789. Since 2017, KNBS data shows that 459, 812, 1932, 1084, and 822 new matatus were registered from 2017 to 2021, respectively. That means a total of 4,297 matatus have been added since that study. Using the higher figure, and assuming none of the 4,297 new matutus are out of service, it would mean that a total of 19,086 matatus are active in the whole of Kenya. That gets you thinking — 28,000 brand new electric BYD K6s would have been transformational in Kenya’s public transport sector.

In March this year, Kenya Power acting CEO Rosemary Oduor said “Kenya Power can supply electricity to charge 50,000 buses and two million motorcycles during off-peak hours.” Therefore, KPLC can quite comfortably charge 28,000 electric minibuses.

In his address soon after being sworn in as president, President William Ruto reaffirmed Kenya’s commitment to transition to 100% clean energy by 2030. During his campaign, President Ruto’s Kenya Kwanza Coalition put together quite an impressive manifesto that included strong support for electric mobility.

Kenya has a lot of locally generated clean, renewable electricity that can help enhance Kenya’s energy security, as well as reduce costs in the transport sector as well. Kenya stands to benefit quite a lot from substituting a significant portion of imported petroleum products with this locally generated clean electricity by accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles. Imports of petroleum products contribute a huge chunk of Kenya’s import bill. With Kenya’s trade deficit continuously widening, this import substitution will need to be looked at ASAP. According to the latest Economic Survey from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), there was a 30.9% growth in imports in 2021. The increase in imports widened the trade deficit from KSh 999.9 billion in 2020 to KSh 1.4 trillion in 2021. That’s a trade deficit of about $11.8 billion! Imports rose from KSh 1.6 trillion in 2020 to KSh 2.1 trillion, mainly driven by an increase in imports of petroleum products.

Kenya’s Trade Deficit Over The Past 5 Years

Kenya’s Petroleum Fuel Imports Over The Past 5 Years

The fuel subsidy has now been removed for petrol for now, sending petrol prices to an all-time high. Subsidies remain in place for diesel and kerosene.

We hope the new government moves fast to accelerate electric mobility adoption.

462,Why Renewable Energy Stocks Dropped on Thursday,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/702069/solar-farm-in-mountains.jpg,22/09/2022,A number of pressure points have hit renewable energy all at once today.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/22/why-plug-power-blink-charging-and-chargepoint-drop/,"What happened

Renewable energy stocks struggled on Thursday, as a combination of falling energy prices and rising interest rates hurt the industry. Plug Power (PLUG -6.24%) fell as much as 7.1% in trading today; Blink Charging (BLNK -7.12%) fell 10.4%; ChargePoint Holdings (CHPT -6.74%) dropped 7.3%; and First Solar (FSLR -2.51%) declined a more modest 4.4% at its low. The stocks closed the day down 6.2%, 6.7%, 5.4%, and 2.8%, respectively.

So what

The most notable move in energy markets today was natural gas falling 7.6% in U.S. trading. That's a big decline in prices for a commodity that provides most of the electricity in the U.S.. You'll notice that Plug Power, Blink Charging, ChargePoint, and First Solar are all suppliers in the electricity market, so when a competing commodity falls in price, it makes sense that your product would become less valuable, as well.

A more problematic headwind is the increase in interest rates around the world. In the U.S., 10-year government bond rates were up 17 basis points today alone and have risen 68 basis points in the past month and 239 basis points this year.

Interest rates are particularly important for renewable energy projects because they usually have high upfront costs and long useful lives, which means they can be financed for decades. Higher interest rates mean the future cash flows from each project are less valuable, lowering the value of all renewable energy projects. That's why we're seeing a decline in valuations for all types of renewable energy assets.

The macro challenge is that higher interest rates are intended to slow the economy, which may also mean incrementally less demand for energy. That would put new construction for renewable energy at a disadvantage against the legacy fossil fuel asset.

Why are renewable energy stocks down? Today is a worst-case scenario of lower fossil fuel prices, higher interest rates, and a potentially weaker economy.

Now what

Ups and downs like today are really par for the course for renewable energy. The industry has benefited from falling interest rates over the last decade, but even that hasn't meant strong profitability for most companies.

While I think higher rates and falling commodity prices are a headwind, I don't think this is worth giving up on the industry. There's a bright future for wind, solar, hydrogen, and electric vehicles.

I suggest focusing on companies that are profitable and can adapt to any market condition. In this list of companies, only First Solar is making money and has any kind of differentiation in the market.

If you're buying high-quality renewable energy stocks like First Solar, this could be a great buying opportunity. But it's also a warning that less-established companies that have been built on hype are facing difficult market conditions for the foreseeable future.",electric vehicles,motley fool

At the 2022 Chantilly Arts & Elegance contest running on Sept. 25 at the Chateau de Chantilly, north of Paris, Renault will show off the R5 Turbo 3E, a concept for a high-performance version of the 5 Prototype that channels the legendary R5 Turbo and its R5 Turbo 2 successor, both wild hot hatches with mid-mounted engines and rear-wheel drive.

The R5 Turbo 3E skips the internal-combustion engine this time in favor of an electric powertrain, and is built around a bespoke tubular chassis. The powertrain consists of a pair of electric motors at the rear axle, which generate a peak 375 hp and can hustle the car from 0-62 mph in 3.5 seconds and to a top speed of 124 mph. Powering the motors is a 42-kwh battery. No range estimate has been provided.

Like the original R5s, the R5 Turbo 3E seats only two. But instead of an engine filling in for the rear passenger seats, Renault's design team has installed a roll cage. That's important as the R5 Turbo 3E has been built for drifting. It has a number of features typical of the wild gymkhana-style vehicles piloted by the likes of Ken Block, like the wide rear rubber, prominent hand brake lever, and a 50-plus steering angle.

One additional key nod to the original R5s can be found in the cabin. Here, the ten analog dials facing the driver have been replaced by ten tiny digital screens. You'll also find carbon-fiber racing bucket seats, a safety harness, and a steering wheel all sourced from Sabelt.

While the R5 Turbo 3E is unlikely to see production, its powertrain could potentially feature in a high-performance version of the modern 5 hatchback. Alpine is thought to be planning a tuned version of the 5, and this could be the avenue for the potent powertrain.

Following its Chantilly debut, the R5 Turbo 3E will appear at the 2022 Paris auto show starting Oct. 17. It will share the stage with a modern Renault 4 and an Alpine concept.",electric vehicles,motor authority

The state’s largest electric power ­distributor is experimenting with a new “transactive energy rate” it plans to roll out to members in a few months. The New Hampshire Electric Co-op plans to send daily messages to customers detailing the price of power during each hour of the next day. Customers can then choose to limit energy use during peak times—or use ­bidirectional charging technology to send power back to the grid and get a credit on their energy bills. Only a few electric vehicles, like the Nissan Leaf and Ford F-150 Lightning, come with bidirectional charging capabilities, but use of the technology is on the rise. The co-op believes the new rates could help prevent grid overload. “We recognize that members can provide the resources that we need through their distributed energy resources,” said Brian Callnan, vice president of power resources and access. —Elizabeth Russell

Starting next year, Princeton University will grant free tuition, room, and board to students whose families earn less than $100,000 a year. The new financial aid policy will take effect in fall 2023. Qualifying students—about a quarter of the current student body—will also get an additional $4,050 a year to cover the cost of books and other school-­related expenses. And the school plans to scrap a $3,500 activity fee for all students. Donations will fund most of the aid, school President Christopher L. Eisgruber said. Princeton’s Annual Giving campaign brought in $81.8 million last year. The policy is designed to attract students of varying backgrounds and show that “a Princeton ­education is an affordable ­education.” —Elizabeth Russell

Georgia

Incidents involving handguns at Georgia schools have tripled in the last few years, prompting administrators to enforce extra security measures. Cobb County, a district with over 100,000 students, now allows certain school staff ­members to carry guns. To limit dangerous items being brought into classrooms, Clayton County ordered 52,000 clear backpacks. Any opaque bags will be searched. And Atlanta’s school board approved spending $2.6 million to install advanced screening systems. Police have responded to at least 10 reports of gunfire resulting in four injuries on Georgia campuses this year. During the last school year, Atlanta’s largest districts reported nearly 200 total disciplinary cases for bringing a firearm to campus. —Beckah McCallum

California

A state-funded website launched Sept. 13 tells women how to get “reproductive healthcare” and abortions in California, even if they live across the country. The same week, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that his campaign paid for 18 pro-abortion billboards in states with pro-life laws. The signs say things like “Texas doesn’t own your body” and point to the new website. They’re appearing in Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Texas. California’s budget now includes $200 million for promoting abortion in the state, and Newsom told any woman seeking an abortion to “come to California.” State pro-life groups argue public funds shouldn’t promote abortion and insist other, more pressing issues need that funding. In November, California voters will consider an amendment that bars the state from denying or interfering with “reproductive freedom.” —Mary Muncy

South Carolina

“Jane Doe One” and “Jane Doe Two” have filed the first of what could be an avalanche of lawsuits against the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) following a report earlier this year that found the denomination’s leaders mishandled claims of abuse. The suit alleges a youth pastor sexually abused teenagers, but Randall Hood, attorney for the plaintiffs, is seeking damages that ricochet: “The SBC, South Carolina Baptist Convention, and Northside Baptist Church did nothing to protect our client, and it resulted in even more victims.” Personal injury litigators across the nation are advertising free case reviews because “thousands may be eligible to file lawsuits against the SBC.” A lawyer for the SBC Executive Committee said it could not be held liable for behavior it didn’t know about and a person over whom it had no authority. He also claimed the allegations of abuse related to the lawsuit did not appear in the report released by Guidepost Solutions earlier this year. —Kim Henderson

Montana

The state’s Department of Public Health and Human Services on Sept. 19 said it will abide by a judge’s order that it allow changes to the sex listed on birth certificates. A state law passed in 2021 permitted amendments to sex on birth certificates only to correct a clerical error or ­follow a court order after a ­surgical procedure. But state District Court Judge Michael Moses temporarily blocked that law in April, saying it was too vague since it did not state the type of surgery required. Yet rather than revert to a 2017 law that allowed Montanans to “correct” their certificate by filing an affidavit of gender transition, the health department on Sept. 9 issued stricter rules that only allowed changes to correct clerical errors, arguing that previous rules were based on an incorrect premise that surgery changes a person’s sex. The judge later rebuked health department officials for attempting to sidestep his April injunction. The state is considering its next steps. —Todd Vician",electric vehicles,wng.org

Fly ash. Incinerated garbage. Grass. What if these and other materials could be turned into electric cars, solar panels, and smartphones?

Researchers in Virginia Tech's Department of Mining and Minerals Engineering are working to give companies and innovators stable, sustainable, domestic supplies of the critical minerals needed for a thriving economy and a green energy future.



The U.S. Geological Survey maintains a list of several dozen critical minerals — many of which must be mined — that are important for society to advance. Lithium and cobalt, for example, are essential to the production of electric vehicles, which are a major part of the American climate protection strategy.

Environmentalists typically take a dim view of mining, given historical damage from the industry. But electric car manufacturers such as Tesla have made it clear that without reliable mined resources, production will remain limited and such vehicles will remain expensive. That challenges mining engineers to develop environmentally and socially responsible ways to harvest these critical minerals — a challenge perfectly suited to a land-grant research university.



“I think we understand our dependence because of the push toward electric vehicles, wind turbines, and solar panels — all the technologies that are moving us toward decarbonization of our society and our country,” said Richard Bishop, professor of practice in mining engineering. “And all of those technologies require critical minerals.”",electric vehicles,vt.edu

New York, Sept. 22, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Global Used Car Market By Vehicle Type, By Propulsion Type, By Sales Channel, By End-Use, By Region, Forecast & Opportunities, 2017- 2027F"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06317591/?utm_source=GNW



The global used car market was valued at USD 813.79 billion in the year 2021 and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.40% through 2027 due to the shortage of semiconductors and microchips, which are limiting the production of new cars. At the global level, the demand for used cars is increasing as they are more cost-effective compared to new cars. All these reasons are expected to drive the global used car market in the upcoming five years.

The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the automotive industry in many ways.Due to COVID-19, many automotive companies have faced losses as the production capacity was halted due to the decrease in demand for new vehicles.



To stop the spread of the pandemic, almost all the automotive factories, showrooms, and workshops were closed, resulting in a significant decline in production and sales of new cars across the globe.Many countries across the globe imposed lockdowns which adversely impacted the economic condition of most of the countries across Asia-Pacific and Middle-East & Africa regions.



Owing to this, the lower-income buyer’s preference for used cars increased further over new cars.

Low Price of Used Cars

Over time, people’s standard of living across the globe has improved.Many people are willing to buy a private car to fulfil their daily mobility requirements.



Nowadays more and more young people are showing interest toward purchasing a second-hand car, as the used car is more cost-effective as compared to a new car.While buying a used car buyers save a purchase tax compared to a new car.



The price of a used car is almost 50% lower than a new car, which means that the price-performance ratio of a used car is sufficient over the new car.The subsequent value preservation rate for the used car is acceptable, at the time of buying the used car which has been driven for a year, its hedging rate does not fluctuate so much, which is completely acceptable.



For all these reasons, used cars are exponentially more affordable than buying a new car.

Less Depreciation

Used cars have less depreciation rate than the new car.The moment when the new cars are driven by the owners, the value of the new car begins to depreciate.



The value of a new car can depreciate by as much as 30% depending on the car.During the second and third years of a new car, the value depreciates at a much slower rate, from 5% to 8%.



In the fourth year of a new car, the depreciation value jumps up to 15% as the warranties expire and mileage has accumulated.The used car depreciation rate is much less than the new car.



Owing to the less depreciation rate in used cars, demand for used cars increased over the year in many countries of Asia-Pacific and in the Middle East and African, which is driving the global used car market.

Changing Consumer Perception

The good condition used cars are changing the mindset of buyers regarding new cars as the attractive value price offered by the used car is making the people buy the used car over the new car.When the COVID-19 pandemic started, governments of many countries had to restrict public gatherings and also reduce the availability of public transport.



Due to less public transport availability, the demand for personal mobility increased, and used cars come as an attractive option for buyers as they are much cost-effective as compared to a new car. The increase in nuclearization and urbanization are also the key factors for the growth of the global used car market.

Suitable for new drivers to practice

When the newcomers buy a new car and drive it for the first time it can be risky for them as they may meet an accident.As they need to hone their driving skills, then a used car comes as a good option for them as the buying cost is low compared to new car.



Used cars have many benefits over a new car owing to which the younger generation gets attracted toward the good condition used car. By increasing demand for used car among the buyer, the sales of used cars is expected to increase during the forecast period, thereby driving the global used car market.

.

Market Segmentation

The global used car market is segmented based on vehicle type, propulsion type, by sales channel, by end use, region, and competition.Based on vehicle type, the market is further segmented into hatchback, sedan, and SUV/MPV.



Based on the propulsion type, the market is bifurcated into internal combustion engine and electric. Under vehicle type, sedan segment dominated the market with a total share of 35.12% in the year 2021 among the other vehicles. The Asia-Pacific region has the largest market share, accounting for 28.95% as of the year 2021.

468,More than half of US car sales to be electric by 2030,https://img.digitimes.com/newsshow/20220922vl203_files/2_2b.jpg,22/09/2022,"Just over half of passenger cars sold in the US will be electric vehicles by 2030, according to a report from BloombergNEF, thanks in part to consumer incentives included in the US$374 billion in new climate spending enacted by President Joe Biden.",https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20220922VL203/electric-vehicle-us.html,"More than half of US car sales to be electric by 2030

Just over half of passenger cars sold in the US will be electric vehicles by 2030, according to a report from BloombergNEF, thanks in part to consumer incentives included in the US$374 billion in new climate spending enacted by President Joe Biden.

Those incentives, among them a point-of-sale tax credit of up to US$7,500 for a new EV purchase, are likely to boost the pace of adoption, BloombergNEF analysts found in the report. Prior to passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August, projections for EV sales by 2030 came in at 43% of the US market. With the climate-spending measure in place, that estimate was revised upwards to 52%.

The latest projection from BloombergNEF puts the US on track to hit a key target set by Biden last year, for half of all cars sold in the US to be battery-electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell-powered by the end of the decade.

Bloomberg

In 2021, electric vehicles accounted for less than 5% of sales in the US, below the global rate of nearly 9% and well below the adoption rate in countries like China, where plug-ins currently account for roughly 24% of new car sales. Norway became the first country to see electric overtake combustion engine vehicle sales last year. Under the revised forecast from BloombergNEF, the US will surpass the global average in 2026 instead of 2028.

The three automakers with the most domestic battery production coming online in the near term - Tesla, GM, and Ford - are set to benefit most from the new law, according to the report. At the insistence of West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, the IRA restricts the full US$7,500 credit to vehicles assembled in North America, with additional phased-in thresholds for manufacturing batteries in North America.

In the new report, analysts noted that these requirements ""will take time to adjust to,"" particularly as automakers contend with critical minerals and battery rules. But those challenges are expected to lessen over time, a shift that could also bring more electric cars into an affordable price range.

""In the next year or so, there shouldn't be too much of a difference (in sales),"" said BloombergNEF electric car analyst Corey Cantor. ""Later in the decade, we expect not only the EV tax credit but the battery production tax credit to drive a steeper decline in EV costs.""",electric vehicles,digitimes
469,Nissan Buys Shares in Battery Company. Is This A Sign of More EVs?,https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/04/2023-Nissan-LEAF-10-source-e1649814628438.jpg,22/09/2022,"The race to get batteries is very real for automotive companies. Supplies are limited, and will continue to be limited for years because you can’t open up new mines and refining facilities with heavy doses of wishful thinking. It takes years to get a new mine…",https://cleantechnica.com/2022/09/22/nissan-buys-shares-in-battery-company-is-this-a-sign-of-more-evs/,"The race to get batteries is very real for automotive companies. Supplies are limited, and will continue to be limited for years because you can’t open up new mines and refining facilities with heavy doses of wishful thinking. It takes years to get a new mine going, and that means manufacturers need to think years ahead.

But, as I’ve pointed out before, Japanese auto manufacturers are in a tough spot when it comes to depending on rare earth minerals and battery minerals that largely come from China. This backdrop is important to understand, as the Japanese government has realized that it will have to be more proactive in developing its own clean energy technology and being more competitive in other areas if it hopes to keep up with China. According on Quartz, China’s grip on the minerals that drive not just clean technologies but also a variety of other crucial things like medical imaging came to a head for Japan in 2010 after a territorial dispute. By cutting off supplies, China was able to bring Japan to its knees. This might explain why Japanese carmakers are sticking with hydrogen technology while the rest of the world goes with battery-electric vehicles (BEVs).

In addition to the geopolitical issues at play is the US response in the latest version of EV subsidies. In order for an electric vehicle’s battery to qualify for tax credits and rebates in upcoming years, it will need to be sourced from minerals that come from countries that are not China — a country which American government has grown increasingly wary of. This could lead to more plug-in hybrid (PHEV) vehicles on the road, but exactly how many credit-eligible BEVs can be built depends largely on whether or not we have a sufficient supply friendly countries’ batteries.

We’ve seen other Japanese companies, especially Toyota, adopt a very cautious approach to EVs. An interview at CarBuzz with a Toyota executive shows us their thinking, and it goes beyond supply issues and geopolitics. They’re committed to electrification, but they’re not committed to going all-in on BEVs (or “pure EVs”). They’re going to focus on whatever technology they think best fits the customer’s needs, including PHEV and hydrogen. Toyota offers a wide range of cars to appeal to different markets. Toyota should be able maintain the required changes in each sector by offering variety and diversity in its products.

Honda has, until very recently, been on a similar trajectory. I’ve called them boneheads at least once for not taking EVs seriously, just like Toyota. More recently, the company seems to have realized that the US market is going to go heavy for EVs, and has partnered with GM to get back on track, but it is still not offering much and its own non-GM offerings are still years away, and it’s just a promise.

At the same time, though, we’ve seen Nissan be a bit of a pioneer in BEVs, even if they’re in an environment that doesn’t favor them. Nissan beat Tesla to market with an electric sedan (the first-gen LEAF beat the Model S to market), and offered it at a much more affordable price point, even if it had far less range, among other things. So, gauging where exactly Nissan is on electrification can be challenging, because it’s not afraid to break from the pack at times on EVs.

A New Mineral Deal Offers Some Clues

I can’t predict with certainty whether Nissan will go serious about quality EVs going forward, but we can look for clues on their long-term thinking. As I mentioned above, you cut deals on battery supplies (and battery minerals) years in advance or go without.

Nissan revealed in a press release that it has completed a definitive agreement to acquire shares in Vehicle Energy Japan Inc. (VELI), a firm involved in the automobile lithium-ion battery sector. After regulatory procedures, including necessary approvals and permissions, are completed, Nissan will purchase the stocks.

Nissan will acquire all of Vehicle Energy Japan’s common shares, as well as subscribe to the company’s common shares. Following the merger, Vehicle Energy Japan will become a Nissan subsidiary in which it will share ownership with existing shareholders Maxell, Ltd. and Hitachi Astemo, Ltd.

Nissan tells us that Vehicle Energy Japan has an integrated battery supply chain from cells through packs, as well as sophisticated battery management systems. It develops, produces, and sells lithium-ion batteries, module batteries, and battery management systems for electric vehicles in the future market.

Nissan also let on a bit about what the strategic importance of this purchase is. Nissan says, in its long-term vision, Nissan Ambition 2030, that it aims to create significant value beyond mobility by placing electrification at the core of its business strategy and expanding the possibilities of journeys and society. Vehicle Energy Japan will be a critical component in Nissan’s plans to further electricize its lineup as a major supplier to Nissan. The investment will enable Nissan to secure a dependable battery supplier and contribute to the advancement of next-generation batteries with a competitive edge in terms of both performance and cost under the vision. Vehicle Energy Japan will provide a constant supply of batteries to Nissan, as well as other clients, thanks to Maxell, Hitachi Astemo, and Nissan’s ongoing support.

What This Can & Can’t Tell Us

By grabbing control of more future battery supply, we can see that Nissan does seem serious about future EV models beyond the LEAF and the Ariya, which is good news. But, what we can’t learn from this deal is how much of the market they predict will be electric in 2030, and how much of that market they want to be the manufacturer for.

In other words, getting supplies is one thing, but getting enough supplies to make most or all of its vehicles BEVs (as opposed to PHEV or hydrogen) is another question entirely.

Hopefully this is a sign of more to come. But, if we’ve learned anything from the last decade of EV development, it’s to not make too many assumptions about what will happen in the industry, as it often changes rapidly.

471,Tesla’s giant ‘safety recall’ of 1 million vehicles is just another software update,https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Tesla-Software-Update-Interior-2.0.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,22/09/2022,"The media has reported today on Tesla having to recall a massive number of electric vehicles in the US, but the fix for the “safety recall” is again just another software update that Tesla has already started to push.

The post Tesla’s giant ‘safety rec…",https://electrek.co/2022/09/22/tesla-safety-recall-1-million-vehicles-another-software-update/,"The media has reported today on Tesla having to recall a massive number of electric vehicles in the US, but the fix for the “safety recall” is again just another software update that Tesla has already started to push.

Earlier this year, NHTSA issued a series of recalls on Tesla vehicles that were highly reported in the media.

What was less reported, though, is that almost all of those recalls were fairly simple software issues that Tesla has been able to fix through over-the-air software updates.

Whenever there’s a safety-related issue, NHTSA has to issue a “safety recall,” even if the automaker doesn’t have to physically recall any vehicle, which leads to some confusion.

Now we have another example today as the media reports on Tesla having to “recall” over 1 million vehicles:

The problem is that Tesla vehicles don’t react based on the standard for reversing when an object is detected in a power window.

NHTSA wrote in the recall report:

Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2017-2022 Model 3, 2020-2021 Model Y, and 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles. The window automatic reversal system may not react correctly after detecting an obstruction. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 118, ‘Power-Operated Window Systems.’

The “remedy” is a simple over-the-air software update that Tesla is already starting to push:

Tesla will perform an over-the-air (OTA) software update of the automatic window reversal system, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed November 15, 2022. Owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752. Tesla’s number for this recall is SB-22-00-013.

Here’s the list of vehicles affected in the US:

MAKE MODEL YEAR TESLA MODEL 3 2017-2022 TESLA MODEL S 2021-2022 TESLA MODEL X 2021-2022 TESLA MODEL Y 2020-2021

In a similar situation earlier this year, the automaker issued a recall that was reported as a “massive” recall on over 800,000 vehicles due to “a seat belt issue,” which sounds pretty bad, but in fact, it had to do with a reminder alert to buckle the seat belt that sometimes wouldn’t appear under very specific conditions.

It is creating a situation where the media sensationalizes major “recalls” when, in fact, a simple over-the-air software update is needed, and no owner actually needs to bring the car to a dealership or service center, as is the case with traditional recalls.

It actually highlights one of Tesla’s biggest advantages over the rest of the industry: the high level of connectivity in its vehicles, and its lack of reliance on third-party dealers to service them – even for most recalls.

In a joint letter, they urge policymakers to reconsider their push for full electrification of new cars by 2035, arguing that world events necessitate a different approach.

“Since the publication of the Commission’s proposal for CO2 standards in cars and vans in July 2021, the geopolitical landscape has changed dramatically, with implications for energy and raw material dependencies,” states the letter.

“This is likely to have an impact on the speed and economic efficiency of the electrification of the new light duty vehicles fleet,” it continues.

The letter is signed by a wide range of organisations related to the fuel sector, including biofuel trade associations and FuelsEurope, which represents big oil companies like Shell, TotalEnergies, BP and ENI. It also includes Japanese carmaker Mazda and CLEPA, the European association of automotive parts suppliers.

“We all fully support that electrification will be the major technology for light road transport decarbonisation. However, recent geopolitical developments have underlined the uncertainties related to the pathway to full electrification of new cars by 2035,” they warn.

The high cost of raw materials necessary for the production of batteries, such as nickel, lithium, and cobalt, and the EU’s dependency on third countries for these resources, are highlighted in the letter as threats to the affordability of electric vehicles.

The lack of charging infrastructure to support the switch to electric vehicles, a long-standing criticism of the auto sector and fuels industry, is also put forward as a risk factor that “creates uncertainty” for potential EV customers.

It is additionally alleged that the greenhouse gas intensity of the EU’s electricity supply could decrease the emissions savings from electric vehicles, as member states look to carbon-heavy energy sources to make up the shortfall from banned Russian gas.

“There is no guarantee that we will have sufficient renewable electricity to satisfy the increasing demand from electrified transport, with the risk that marginal electricity consumption may even come from coal,” states the letter.

“The current vehicle standards, based solely on the tailpipe emissions, does nothing to prevent this, to the detriment of the overall GHG emissions reduction.”

While charging with electricity from coal does diminish the eco-credentials of EVs, research by the clean mobility NGO Transport & Environment found that even on carbon intensive grids such as Poland, electric cars are around 30% cleaner than diesel and petrol vehicles.

E-fuels and biofuels

Signatories are not calling for a return to fossil fuels, but rather want EU policymakers to recognise the potential of biofuels and green hydrogen-derived synthetic fuels to decarbonise the road sector.

These low-carbon liquid fuels should “complement” the electrification strategy, the letter states.

Alternative liquid fuels are compatible with the EU’s goal of a climate neutral transport sector, said Marko Janhunen, chair of the Advanced Biofuels Coalition, a signatory of the joint letter.

“We need significant investments in such fuels not only to fuel the hard-to-decarbonise transport but also to fuel the legacy fleet of tens of millions of cars for decades,” he told EURACTIV.

“Current geopolitical events underline the need for diversification of energy sources,” he added.

Negotiations are currently underway between EU member states, the European Parliament, and the European Commission to finalise legislation that will enshrine into law the permissible CO2 emissions from cars and vans.

While both the European Parliament and Council have agreed in principle to the Commission’s suggestion of a zero-emission limit on the sale of cars from 2035, there is discord over the role alternative fuels should play.

A clause inserted by EU member states, who met at the EU’s Environment Council in June, obliges the European Commission to prepare a report by 2026 that looks into technologies such as “plug-in hybrids” and “CO2 neutral fuels”.

This report must take into account “technological developments, including as regards plug-in hybrid technologies,” says the Council text, agreed on 30 June by the EU’s 27 environment ministers.

A paragraph inserted into the preamble of the agreement provides further leeway:

“Following consultation with stakeholders, the Commission will make a proposal for registering after 2035 vehicles running exclusively on CO2 neutral fuels in conformity with EU law, outside the scope of the fleet standards, and in conformity with the Union’s climate neutrality objective.”

The joint letter urges policymakers to shift this paragraph into the articles of agreement, making it a legally binding part of the final legislation.

In remains to be seen if European Parliament negotiators, who tend to be more sceptical towards alternative fuels as a means to decarbonise passenger cars, will accept the Council’s position.

EU deal on car CO2 standards leaves door ajar for e-fuels The decision by EU countries in the early hours of Wednesday (29 June) to ban the sale of polluting vehicles by 2035 was widely seen as a death sentence for the internal combustion engine in the EU.

Belgium vehicle to grid market is projected to grow at a formidable rate during the forecast period, 2023-2027

The market growth can be attributed to the high penetration of smart power generation systems across various end-user sectors. Besides, rising demand for electric vehicles and rapid technological advancements are contributing to the market growth.

Despite low demand for EVs in Belgium compared to other nations such as the Netherlands and Germany, rising awareness among consumers and persistent efforts by EV manufacturers to promote the adoption of EVs are expected to further support the growth of the Belgium vehicle to grid market in the future.

Technology known as ""vehicle to grid"" allows electric vehicles to send any unused electricity to the grid. Future plans to use car to grid technology to power homes as well as the use of electric vehicles to store energy and use that energy to power other systems such as mobile phones, laptops, and similar gadgets are potential applications of the system.

The technology allows for energy provision during peak times. When the renewable energy sources that depend on the weather are unable to meet the demand for electricity, this system has the ability to produce an additional source of power.

High investments by market players to increase the sales of electric passenger car and commercial vehicles and expanding the electric vehicle charging infrastructure are also fueling the growth of the Belgium vehicle to grid market. Enhanced support by government authorities and more foreign direct investments are likely to positively impact the Belgium vehicle to grid market growth.

The development of the market would also be aided by coordination between electric car manufacturers and those that operate charging stations and points. In the next five years, the expansion of the Belgium vehicle to grid market will be facilitated by increasing potential customers' awareness of the financial ramifications, the existing and planned charging infrastructure, the various types of charge points, and the offered driving range.

The bidirectional charging segment is expected to register the fastest growth in the market during the forecast period, owing to their rising adoption for recharging the vehicle battery and utilize the stored energy during peak hours.

Major players operating in the Belgium vehicle to grid market are Elia Group, Jedlix BV, FUERGY Industries j.s.a., NUVVE Corp., ABB Group., YUSO BV, among others.

This announcement builds on top of EVgo’s June announcement of plug & charge support for GM electric vehicles with DC fast charging capability. After signing up just once, GM customers can conveniently use fast charging on the EVgo network. The charger and car work together to securely match the driver’s vehicle with their EVgo and GM brand app accounts. To enroll, GM customers first need to register their vehicle in the GM brand app (myChevrolet, myGMC, myCadillac), then link their EVgo account and activate Plug & Charge within their GM brand app.

Now, drivers of non-GM EVs can do something similar. The availability of Autocharge+ to all drivers with a compatible CCS EV is made possible by the launch of Autocharge+. The Cadillac LYRIQ, Chevrolet Bolt EV, Chevrolet Bolt EUV, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Ford F-150 Lightning, Genesis GV60, GMC Hummer EV, Hyundai Ioniq Electric, Hyundai Kona Electric, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia Niro Electric, Kia EV8, Mercedes-Benz EQS, Polestar 2, Subaru Solterra, and Toyota bZ4x are among the vehicles that are Autocharge+ compatible.

AutoCharge is only available to EVgo clients. Existing and new customers must join their EVgo vehicle by going to the vehicle section, adding or selecting their EV, and requesting to enroll via the app for existing and new customers. Drivers must then connect into an EVgo charger to finish the process.

How Does It Work?

If your electric vehicle is enrolled in Autocharge+ and has a CCS connector, it will be able to send a unique identifier to EVgo’s charging station so the EVgo network knows it’s you, and knows that you’ll be paying the bill for the charge. This idenitifer will work similarly to your EVgo program card (the one that you scan at the station if you’re not using the app). Once the station gets that signal, charging sessions will automatically begin, so you can spend more time running errands or relaxing instead of worrying about starting the charging process.

Setting It Up

To see what Autocharge+ looks like, I fired up my EVgo app on my phone to check it out. The first thing I had to do was update my vehicle in the app, which still had my Nissan LEAF in it. Sadly, that vehicle (if I hadn’t traded it in) wouldn’t be compatible with Autocharge+ because it’s a CHAdeMO car and EVgo only provides this for CCS vehicles.

After adding my Bolt EUV to the app, I then went to the payment methods section and updated that. But, I didn’t see the Autocharge feature like on EVgo’s website. It turns out that because I hadn’t used the app in a while, it didn’t get updated automatically. So, I went to the Google Play store to get the latest version of the app.

When I opened the app, it had me verify my phone number and my email again, presumably because they need the app to be more secure if they’re going to use your financial information the way Autocharge+ does. After doing that, the app didn’t just ask me for the year, make, and model of my vehicle. It offered to scan my VIN number, which I went ahead and did because I know it needs that for Autocharge+. It wouldn’t scan my windshield VIN, but it was able to scan the sticker in the door jamb (manual entry is also available).

But, when I went to the vehicle section, it informed me that I can’t use the EVgo app to enroll my vehicle. Linking with the myChevrolet app is still required for my vehicle (or, if you have another GM brand EV, you’ll need that brand’s app). It was hard to figure out how to do this in the myChevrolet app, but in short, go to the “energy” screen and click the three dots at the top, and that’ll bring up a menu with a “public charging services” button where you can link your EVgo account.

If you don’t have a GM vehicle, you need to finish your enrollment at a fast charging station. When you plug your vehicle into the charging station, it communicates its own identity to EVgo, after which it connects itself to your EVgo account. You’re now ready to go! That means whenever you connect your car to the EVgo network, it will begin automatically using the unique ID.

What About Fraud?

One thing I saw come up on social media was that some people are concerned about the feature being used to rob them somehow.

To avoid fraud, EVgo says it has set up several security processes. For example, if the time, location, and state of charge (SoC) are impossible or improbable, the session will be stopped. Customers will then receive a notification about potential fraud and they’ll have to confirm before Autocharge+ can continue. (For instance: If your account is used in California to start a charge and then 10 minutes later it’s used again to start a charge in Ohio , this would be flagged as potential fraud.)

As long as you’re signed up to receive messages from EVgo, you’ll always get notified when an Autocharge+ session starts.

EVgo also recommends you contact the EVgo Charging Crew right away if you suspect a session that pops up in your app wasn’t started by you. You can call 877-494-3833 for 24/7 assistance for this or any other needs.

This Is Fixing To Be A Much Bigger Deal Than It Is Today

While there are many EVgo stations, EVgo’s recent deal with GM and Pilot/Flying J truck stops means that they’re going to be an even bigger player, especially for highway travelers. Having plug & charge capabilities for all CCS EVs makes them a lot more convenient to use, which is great for drivers.

But, this is only one area where the industry is finally catching up to Tesla. There’s a lot more to do.

The electric vehicle manufacturer told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) it would perform an over-the-air software update of the automatic window reversal system. The recall covers some 2017-2022 Model 3, 2020-2021 Model Y, and 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles.

Tesla said it was not aware of any warranty claims, field reports, crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the recall.

NHTSA said a closing window without the proper automatic reversing system may exert excessive force by pinching a driver or passenger before retracting, increasing the risk of injury.

NHTSA said the vehicles failed to comply with the requirements of a federal motor vehicle safety standard on power windows.

Tesla said during product testing in August employees identified window automatic reversal system performance that had “greater than expected variations in response to pinch detection.”

After extensive additional testing, Tesla determined the vehicles pinch detection and retraction performance in the test results did not meet automatic reversal systems requirements.

Tesla said starting Sept. 13, vehicles in production and in pre-delivery received a software update that sets power operated window operation to the requirements.

Thursday 22 September 2022

PUBLICATION OF RESULTS FOR THE 1st HALF OF 2022

AKWEL (FR0000053027, AKW, PEA-eligible), the automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer, published its 2022 half-yearly results, as approved by the executive board, on 19 September 2022. Audit reports are in the process of being issued.

Consolidated data - in € millions 30.06.2022 30.06.2021 Var. in % Revenue 491.0 487.6 0.7% EBITDA 42.3 64.7 (34.6)% Current operating income 17.7 50.0 (64.6)% Current operating margin 3.6% 10.3% -6.7 pts Operating income 17.2 50.7 (66.1)% Financial income (10.0) (0.6) - Net result (group share) 1.9 38.0 (95.0)% Net margin 0.4% 7.8% -7.4 pts

INCREASING ACTIVITY IN AN AUTOMOTIVE MARKET THAT REMAINS TURBULENT

In the first half of 2022, AKWEL posted a consolidated turnover of €491.0 m, stable compared to the first half of 2021, but up by 5% on a like-for-like basis, while global vehicle production has remained down over the period (-1.8%1). For the first time, the posted turnover includes the application of the IAS 29 standard (“financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies”) impacting the Turkish subsidiaries, generating a readjustment of +€2.9 m compared to the figure posted in July. In a market that remains widely disrupted by supply limitations, the Group has achieved strong growth in North America (+18.4%).

A MARKED DECREASE IN HALF-YEAR RESULTS

As noted by the Group when publishing its half-year turnover, the half-year results have seen a significant drop. They have been affected by the significant price inflation undergone by raw materials, components, energy, transport, and labour. For AKWEL, these substantial rises represent a cost increase of €31.6 m over the half year and are partially and gradually reflected in sales prices in line with negotiation periods and conditions.

In this context, gross operating surplus was down 34.6% to €42.3 m, and current operating income fell by 64.6% to €17.7 m, i.e. a current operating margin of 3.6% of turnover, down by 6.7 points. Financial income fell by €9.4 m as a result of the application of the IAS 29 standard mentioned above. Tax charges accounted for €5.1 m compared to €12.2 m in the first half of 2021, leading to a net income Group share of €1.9 m (net margin of 0.4%).

Story continues

Free cash-flow generation was €16.9 m compared to €44.4 m in the first half of 2021. After payment of the dividend and loan repayments totalling €22.1 m, the Group’s net cash position (including debts on lease obligations) at 30 June 2022 was €105.7 m, compared with €98.2 m at 31 December 2021.

CREATION OF A THIRD AREA OF EXPERTISE

Among its priorities, the Group has set itself the target of accelerating the development of its product potential in 2022 as part of the transition to new electric- or hydrogen-powered vehicles while also continuing its existing development of the TAMIC brake particle recovery solution. In addition to fluid management and mechanisms, AKWEL also develops structural components for electric vehicles, with examples including electronic modules, battery pack interiors, EV flaps, service battery casings, and cable ducts. As such, the Group will be able to seize the many opportunities linked to the rapid roll-out of electric vehicles while building on its existing technological expertise and resources, resulting in easier management of product and industrial risks.

OUTLOOKS FOR THE 2022 FINANCIAL YEAR

In a global automotive market that continues to be very turbulent, AKWEL confirms its forecast of moderate turnover growth for the 2022 financial year, with the third quarter expected to bring good performance. Against the backdrop of inflation and the continued impact of supply difficulties on manufacturers’ activities, the Group nonetheless remains cautious about forecasts for the sector, despite the fact that the first effects of sales price increases should be seen in the second half of the year.





Next press release: turnover for the third quarter of 2022, 10 November 2022, after markets close.



An independent, family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange, AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management, mechanisms, and structural components for electric vehicles. The Group achieves this by relying on state-of-the-art industrial and technological expertise in applying and processing materials (plastics, rubber, metal) and mechatronic integration.



Operating in 20 countries across every continent, AKWEL employs 9,700 people worldwide.

480,QOTD: Should We Get A Vote On ICE Ban?,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kia-EV-battery-storage-system-DB-Encore-00003.jpg,22/09/2022,Italy’s former deputy prime minister is calling for referendum on EU’s 2035 ICE Ban.,https://www.carscoops.com/2022/09/qotd-should-we-get-a-vote-on-ice-ban/,"It will be illegal to sell a new combustion-powered vehicle in the EU or California come 2035, and several other American states are expected to adopt California’s lead. Things are moving even faster in the UK, which has pledged to kill new ICE sales off by 2030.

The thing these decisions have in common, besides being taken in an attempt to save the planet from catastrophic climate change, is that they were made without asking the hundreds of millions of people that will be affected by the outcome: us.

Italy’s Salvini Wants A Referendum

Italy’s former deputy prime minister believes that’s wrong. He thinks Italian citizens should get a say over the EU’s decision to ban combustion cars from 2035. Matteo Salvini is demanding a referendum on the ruling that requires all new car to emit no tailpipe emissions by the middle of the next decade, which effectively outlaws petrol and diesel vehicles.

“Let the workers of the Mirafiori plant and from all over Italy decide if it’s fair to fire people in Italy and give China an advantage,” he said in comments reported by Bloomberg.

Related: Ferrari, McLaren And Other Supercar Firms Get Extra Time To Meet CO2 Target

The automotive industry is a major employer in Italy and cars are among its key exports. The Mirafirori plant Salvini mentions is a former Fiat factory located in Turin that is now owned by Stellantis. It is the headquarters for Fiat, currently builds multiple models including the Fiat 500, and employs around 18,000 people.

Salvini, who once described Vladimir Putin as “the best politician and statesman in the world” is well known for his anti-EU stance and conservative, neo-nationalist views, so it’s not a huge surprise that he’s come out against the 2035 zero-emissions ruling.

But does he have a point? Should our leaders, whether at state or national level, give regular people a say before making major decisions like outlawing ICE vehicle sales? Or should we trust the politicians that we voted in to draw on all the expert guidance available to them and do what’s best for us?",electric vehicles,carscoops

Worried about denting your car when backing into a spot? Install the finest parking sensors of 2022 and stay stress-free while parking. There are a lot of potential hazards that threaten your car during an average ride. The hardest part often comes at the end, though, when you have to park it in reverse. It doesn’t even matter if it’s your garage or a random public parking lot, the pressure is real, and it can get to your head. Reversing car cameras work to an extent, but accurately judging distance from a small screen is almost impossible. We think the best solution to this problem is picking up one of the top-rated parking sensors of 2022.

These parking sensors measure the distance between your car and all objects behind it, and if they sense something is getting close they provide a signal, often preventing an accident. You’ll only get an accurate measurement from high-quality parking sensors, though, and we’ve spent a while looking for the top ones. Check them out below:

Here are the top parking sensors of 2022

STKR Adjustable Parking Sensor: Recommended

The parking sensor’s light will turn green when you start approaching it before turning yellow to signal you to slow down. Once you’re just the right distance from the sensor, it will turn red and signal you to stop. A great thing about this sensor is its versatility. You can mount it on anything from a regular garage wall to a fridge door, and even better is that it's easy to understand. Everyone who drives a car knows what green, yellow and red mean, and this parking sensor's easy-to-use nature makes it stand out from the rest.

Buying guide: parking sensors

Cars are expensive machines, especially when it comes to repairs. A simple door ding can set you back hundreds of dollars, while a proper body dent repair can cost as much as a couple thousand. You can try to prevent car damage altogether by driving carefully and staying aware of your surroundings when parking, but good driving is not always enough on its own to help avoid accidents.

What if you have a tiny garage that barely fits your car? What if you share your garage with a less experienced driver? Scenarios like these call for the use of parking sensors. Here’s a guide with everything you need to know about them to find a great parking sensor in 2022:

What are parking sensors?

Parking sensors are proximity devices used to measure the distance between your car’s bumper and various everyday objects. Their main job is to alert the driver as soon as something enters this space to prevent accidents. Parking sensors are also the authority when it comes to reverse parking in tight spaces. Reverse parking cameras (different from parking sensors) can be quite useful when backing in, but there’s no real way to accurately judge the distance between objects from a small screen on the dashboard. Reverse car cameras are also completely useless in the dark, but parking sensors work fine without light.

How effective are parking sensors?

Parking sensors are incredible devices that are great for parking and close-quarters driving. They can help you drive stress-free in parking lots, and weaving in and out of stand-still traffic becomes a lot easier as well. You’ll also be able to confidently back into your garage with one.

What are the limitations of parking sensors?

Parking sensors are pretty much useless when driving normally. The eight-foot range of high-quality parking sensors will not matter when you’re driving at 40 mph or more, so don’t think of these sensors as a replacement for attentive driving, as that can hurt you — and others — on the road. When driving with sensors, focus ahead like you normally would without any sensors on your car.

What are the different types of parking sensors?

There are three main types of parking sensors, each with its own pros and cons. Take a look:

Garage proximity lights

These garage parking sensors act as a traffic light for parking in your garage. Simply attach them to any surface opposite the garage door and you’ll be good to go. The sensor will light up green as soon as you start entering the garage, and the light will then turn yellow to signal a necessary slowdown. When you’re close enough to the wall, the light will turn red, signaling that it’s time to park.

These parking sensors are incredibly easy to use, as every driver knows what these colored lights mean. They’re also pretty easy to install, and you won’t even need a single tool. Just stick the sensor on a surface, plug in the power cable and it will start working. The only issue with these is their lack of customizability, and you aren’t able to change the distance from the wall at which the light turns red.

Garage laser assist

Laser parking sensors are a middle ground between the garage proximity light and fully-fledged car parking sensors. These sensors work by shining a powerful laser in a specific spot that you can then use to align your car. The thing that makes these a step up from the basic proximity light is that the laser position is completely customizable. You can arrange your ideal parking spot near a garage wall or right in the middle — it’s all up to you.

The only major issue with using these is that they require quite a lot of work to install and adjust to the right locations, but they’re mighty useful for marking parking spaces in homes with more than one car.

Car parking sensors

Proper car parking sensors are like a mini radar for your car. These consist of four or eight small ultrasonic sensors installed on your bumper, and the sensors constantly measure the distance of various points around the car. If any of these sensors detect something close, it will immediately alert the driver, prompting them to stop and investigate. Many of these parking sensors will only tell you whether something is close or not, but a few advanced versions can show you the exact position of the nearby object.

You don’t have to worry about your car’s looks either — other than a few color-matched circles on your bumper, all of the electronics required for these parking sensors are inside the car.

The only hurdle between you and these parking sensors is a difficult and time-consuming installation. Many sets include all of the manuals, tools and wires you’ll need for the project, but effectively using these resources is the hard part. Even the first step of drilling precise holes in your bumper is beyond most people's skill level, but thankfully you can get professional help. These sensors usually only take a day to install but keep in mind that professional service can be quite expensive.

Which type of parking sensor should you get?

If your garage is the only tricky parking spot in your day-to-day routine, then spending less on a garage proximity light is the way to go.

Garage laser parking sensors are ideal for garages with more than one car or vehicle in general.

Full ultra-sonic car parking sensors, on the other hand, are a must-have for pretty much anyone that can afford them.

Parking Sensor FAQ's

Q: Are car parking sensors legal?

Yes, car parking sensors are completely legal, and many new vehicles come with car parking sensors installed straight out of the factory. Self-driving electric cars also come with more advanced versions of these sensors.

Q: Is it safe to install car parking sensors on my own?

You should have no problems installing a car parking sensor yourself as long as you carefully follow the manual. Pay special attention to the connecting wires, as messing these up can lead to issues like ghost alerts or one of the sensors not working.

Q: Can I add parking sensors to my old car?

Yes, you can add parking sensors to any car. All the electronics required for the sensor to function come with the set, and third-party parking sensors have zero connection to your car’s computer system. This means that the age of your car doesn’t matter at all, as long as it has enough bumper space for sensor installation.",electric vehicles,autoblog

(Reuters) -U.S. chip designer Qualcomm Inc on Thursday said its automotive business ""pipeline"" increased to $30 billion, up more than $10 billion since its third quarter results were announced in late July.

The jump in future business was thanks to its Snapdragon Digital Chassis product used by car makers and their suppliers, Qualcomm said at its Automotive Investor Day. The Snapdragon Digital Chassis can provide assisted and autonomous driving technology, as well as in-car infotainment and cloud connectivity.

With electric vehicles and increasing autonomous features in cars, the number of chips used by automakers is surging and the automotive market has been a key growth area for chipmakers.

""When you think about a per car basis, a lower tier car, we have an opportunity of approximately $200 stretching all the way to $3,000 at the high tier,"" said Akash Palkhiwala, Qualcomm's CFO.

""Going forward the mix will continue to shift towards the high end so the opportunity will keep expanding.""

Qualcomm said the automotive market size it is targeting could grow to as large as $100 billion by 2030.

In fiscal year 2022, it estimates its automotive business revenue will be about $1.3 billion, from $975 million the previous year. By fiscal year 2026, it estimates that to rise to over $4 billion and in fiscal year 2031 to over $9 billion.

Qualcomm also announced an expanded partnership with Mercedes Benz Group AG which will be using the Snapdragon Cockpit for its in-car infotainment system from 2023.

Qualcomm also has many automotive customers in China. Asked about the impact of broader U.S. export regulations, CEO Cristiano Amon said ""strong win-win partnerships between the U.S. enterprises and the China enterprises will always be a force of stability"".

""But we'll see what the future holds,"" he added.

Earlier this week, chipmaker Nvidia Corp unveiled a new automotive central computer called DRIVE Thor to provide autonomous and assisted driving as well as in-car digital entertainment and services.

Specifically:

Doug Field is named chief advanced product development and technology officer. In this expanded role, Field will continue to oversee EV products, software and digital systems development, and advanced driver assistance, while also taking on design and vehicle hardware engineering

Lisa Drake, vice president, EV industrialization, will now also be responsible for manufacturing engineering as Ford scales to a run rate of 2 million EVs per year by the end of 2026

Chuck Gray, who has been vice president, EV technology, is named vice president, vehicle hardware engineering

Both Drake and Gray report to Field, as does Anthony Lo, Ford’s chief design officer.

“As we enter an intense period of execution for Ford Model e and our $50 billion investment in breakthrough electric and digital vehicles, Doug, Lisa and Chuck are taking on larger roles and building out very capable teams,” said Jim Farley, Ford president and CEO. “Developing and scaling the next generation of electric and software-defined vehicles requires a different focus and mix of talent from the accomplished Ford team and many exciting new colleagues joining our company.”

Among those new colleagues are four leaders with Silicon Valley credentials who will strengthen Ford’s push to develop fully connected, software-defined vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. Roz Ho is appointed chief connected vehicle software officer. Ho joins Ford next month from HP, where she was vice president and global head of software. Previously, she served in several leadership roles during her 22-year tenure at Microsoft. Ho will work closely with Jae Park, who recently joined Ford as vice president, digital product design, after successful stints at Google and Amazon. They join Sammy Omari, executive director of advanced driver assist technologies (formerly of Motional, a joint venture of Hyundai and Aptiv) and Rob Bedichek, executive director of platform architecture (formerly of Intel and Apple). This leadership team, supporting outstanding talent at Ford, is setting the direction on technology platforms for Ford’s next-generation products.

As Ford continues to build out a portfolio of both EVs from Ford Model e and iconic Ford Blue internal combustion vehicles, Jim Baumbick is taking on additional responsibility as well. He is appointed vice president, product development operations, cycle planning and internal combustion engine programs. Jim will oversee the development of all Ford Blue products, as well as lead cycle planning, vehicle development engineering and product development operations for all of Ford. He will report to Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford Blue, and partner closely with Doug Field and his team on the broader development of all products at Ford.

“Jim Baumbick has been a driving force behind our incredible Ford Blue lineup built around icons like F-Series, Mustang, Ranger and Bronco, and new hits like Maverick that have driven significant demand and market share gains,” Farley said. “We’re building on this rock-solid foundation with exciting new vehicles and derivatives that customers across the world will love.”

At the same time, Ford is transforming its global supply chain management capability to support efficient and reliable sourcing of components, internal development of key technologies and capabilities, and world-class cost and quality execution. John Lawler, Ford’s chief financial officer, will lead Ford’s global supply chain organization on an interim basis until a chief supply chain officer is selected. Jonathan Jennings, vice president, supply chain, will also take additional responsibility for supplier technical assistance and quality. He will report to Lawler.

As previously announced, Hau Thai-Tang, chief industrial platform officer, will retire Oct. 1 after a more-than-34-year career with Ford. Ford also announced that Dave Filipe, vice president, vehicle hardware modules, will retire effective Dec. 1 after 30 years with Ford.

“We’re grateful for Hau’s and Dave’s significant contributions to Ford and our Ford+ plan, which helped set the stage for our exciting future,” Farley said.

Uber is expanding its EV options to more cities across the U.S., and is setting a deadline for drivers to transition to electric cars by 2030. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tells CBS that drivers who haven’t made the switch to an EV by then won’t be allowed back on its platform.

The latest expansion to Uber’s Comfort Electric service is a part of its goal to phase out gas-burning cars from its platform within the next few years. The Comfort Electric option is different from Uber Green in terms of vehicle eligibility; Uber Green includes hybrid and fully-electric models, but Comfort Electric requires drivers to operate fully-electric cars, exclusively.

It’s supposed to be a premium option, according to Car and Driver, providing rides in EVs from Tesla, Polestar and the Ford Mustang Mach-E. When Comfort Electric launched in May of 2022, it was available in select California cities and Dubai, but it’s now available throughout the U.S. and Canada in these cities:

Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore-Maryland, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Connecticut, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New Jersey, NYC Suburbs, Philadelphia, Portland, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, St Louis, Vancouver (Canada), Washington D.C.

Now that Uber has expanded Comfort Electric and committed to phasing out gas-burning cars, multiple outlets say the ride-hailing service is transitioning to a fully-electric fleet, but that’s a misnomer; Uber doesn’t have a fleet.

If it did, that would mean Uber has employees to pilot its so-called fleet, but Uber doesn’t have employees. Uber hosts “users” on its platform, which connects people driving their own cars with people who need a ride.

That’s how Uber has evaded the responsibilities of a traditional employer, and, now, that’ll to apply to the “fleet’s” EV transition, too. Uber won’t foot the bill for drivers to switch from ICE-equipped cars to EVs; instead, it’ll be offering incentives to convince drivers to go electric, per CBS:

Uber is trying to slash its carbon footprint by incentivising its drivers to switch to EVs. But they are not cheap. Electric vehicles cost an average of $US60,000 ($83,292). Uber plans to spend $US800 ($1,111) million to help offset the cost for its drivers. The company is also paying drivers a dollar for every EV trip they make and providing discounts on charging. Uber is partnering with Hertz to allow drivers to have the option of renting Teslas on a weekly or monthly basis.

At best, Uber will provide a Hertz rental for drivers to continue picking up fares after the 2030 EV deadline, and a few other incentives. Admittedly, these have made a difference, with one driver citing a $US200 ($278) increase in fares per week.

But then again, the price of these Hertz EV rentals ranges from $US299 ($415) to $US334 ($464) per week, so what’s the net gain? What’s worse, with the price of EVs not going down any time soon, I wonder if the extra money Uber drivers make will ever actually be enough to afford the same EV they’ll depend on, and become just another business — sorry, personal expense.",electric vehicles,gizmodo australia
488,A Nikola Pickup Without Any Nikola Parts: GM Engineer Testifies,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/C7XUAwvlaT4CluthR2Fdmg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/f6ec3575911e03f020eb5c3355b0af03,22/09/2022,(Bloomberg) -- Nikola Corp. founder Trevor Milton wasn’t truthful when he claimed his company was responsible for most of the components in a planned pickup ...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikola-pickup-without-nikola-parts-182525808.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Nikola Corp.’s founder cost a San Diego man about $160,000 trading the company’s hyped shares, he told the jury in Trevor Milton’s criminal fraud trial.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Joseph Ryan was called to the witness stand Thursday by federal prosecutors, who allege that Milton misled investors by exaggerating the electric truck maker’s progress toward introducing vehicles for sale and by lying about Nikola’s technology and partnerships.

Ryan told the jurors he bought shares based on public statements by Milton that the company had succeeded in slashing the cost of hydrogen fuel from $16 a kilogram to less than $4. He told the panel it would have affected his investment decisions if he had known Nikola was actually buying hydrogen at $14 a kilogram rather than producing it.

He testified that he also invested based on Milton’s claims that Nikola was moving toward commercial production of the Badger pickup, and that he was misled by a video that appeared to show a Nikola semi truck prototype traveling under its own power, when in fact it was rolling downhill thanks to gravity.

Risky Trading

Ryan, who said he had done some day trading, told the jurors Milton’s interviews and videos convinced him to hold Nikola stock for the long term.

“It sounded like they were making great progress in every aspect of what they were targeting, whether it be hydrogen production, the truck or the consumer truck, the Badger,” he said.

On cross-examination, Ryan agreed that Securities and Exchange Commission filings are a more reliable source of company information than press interviews, as Milton lawyer Marc Mukasey suggested that day trading is risky. The defense argues Milton was just following the company’s marketing plan and never said anything he didn’t believe to be true.

Story continues

The trial comes two years after Milton abruptly resigned from the company’s board, following scrutiny once Nikola listed its shares in June 2020. The stock’s initial surge turned small investments by hedge funds and others into stakes worth billions of dollars at the time, reflecting optimism that Nikola could become a Tesla-like disruptor.

All GM

Individual investors, too, piled into the stock, which collapsed in the wake of a short-seller’s report and which is down 24.3% from its close before opening arguments began on Sept. 13.

Milton, 40, is charged with securities and wire fraud and faces a maximum prison term of 25 years if convicted of the most serious charge. The defense has cited “a distortion of Trevor Milton’s words, a distortion of Trevor Milton’s meanings, a distortion of Trevor Milton’s intentions.”

Read More: Nikola Founder Milton Went Rogue on Social Media, Jury Is Told

The prosecution witness before Ryan was Scott Damman, a senior manager at General Motors Co. whom GM sent to work with Nikola. Damman testified that Milton had falsely claimed Nikola was responsible for most of the parts in the planned Badger pickup truck GM was to build for the EV maker.

“There were no components coming from Nikola,” Damman told the jury in federal court in Manhattan. “They owned the creative design, what the vehicle looked like and felt like, but all of the parts were to come from General Motors.”

‘70% Nikola’

Damman’s testimony came in response to questioning about a video interview Milton gave in 2020.

“It’s probably 70% Nikola, 30% GM, when it comes to the parts that are really important to us,” Milton said in the interview that September, the same month the Detroit car maker announced it would build and provide technology for the Badger in return for payments and an 11% equity stake.

Read More: Nikola Saw ‘Massive’ Badger Losses But Backed Milton Anyway

The relationship between Nikola and GM was to be brief. The short-seller’s report came just days after the partnership was announced that month, accusing Milton and Nikola of deception. By November, GM had scaled back its commitment and dropped its plans for the stake. The Badger was scrapped.

Nikola took $5,000 down payments for Badger reservations in June 2020, when it had no prototype or plan to manufacture the pickup. Public discussion of the truck bolstered the stock, with promises a prototype would be revealed at an event later that year. That unveiling, too, was canceled.

Ryan told the court he continues to hold his Nikola shares. He said he may offset the gains he’s made on other investments with his Nikola losses, or just hope to profit if the company is acquired.

The case is US v. Milton, 21-cr-478, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

PHS Automotive Malaysia, official distributor of Audi vehicles in Malaysia, has added the Audi RS Q8 into its line up. The first full-sized Audi SUV with an RS badge starts from RM1,699,990, and is offered with a five-year unlimited mileage warranty, five years of roadside assistance and three years of free maintenance. The standard Q8 S-Line re-introduced in July this year is about half the price at RM867k.

Under the hood of the RS Q8 rests a 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 delivering 600 PS at 6,000 rpm, and 800 Nm of torque between 2,200 to 4,500 rpm. The 0-100 km/h sprint is completed in 3.8 seconds – making it the first Audi SUV to break the four second mark – with a top speed of 305 km/h. For some perspective, the RS Q8’s cousin, the Lamborghini Urus, is only a tad quicker from 0-100 km/h at 3.6 seconds.

The V8 engine is assisted by a 48-volt mild hybrid system featuring a belt alternator-starter that’s connected to the crankshaft. Up to 12 kW of power can be recovered from deceleration and braking, and is stored in a compact lithium-ion battery. The system enables coasting for up to 40 seconds with the engine shut off, saving up to 0.8 L/100 km.

If you happen to want a twin-turbo V8 RS Q8 but is also somehow concerned about emissions and consumption figures, you’d be glad to know that the engine features Audi’s cylinder on demand (COD) system. At low speeds, cylinders 2, 3, 5, and 8 are shut off for better fuel efficiency. The cylinders are reactivated when the driver presses the accelerator.

Aurally enhanced by an RS sports exhaust, the V8 engine is paired to an eight-speed automatic to drive all four wheels via Audi’s quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. A locking centre differential sends power primarily to the rear wheels (40:60). If slip is detected, up to 70% of its power can sent to the front wheels.

A quattro sport differential with active torque vectoring splits power between the rear wheels, while an active roll stabilisation system helps reduce body roll when cornering at high speeds. The RS Q8 is fitted with adaptive air suspension that lowers the ride height by 90 mm compared to the standard Q8, and all-wheel steering is also fitted as standard.

Click to enlarge.

As you can tell, the RS Q8 looks nothing like the standard Q8. It’s dressed with more aggressive front and rear bumpers, a Singleframe front grille with RS-specific honeycomb inserts, larger intakes, a rear diffuser and a set of massive 23-inch Y-spoke wheels. The wheels are wrapped in 295/35 profile Pirelli P Zero tyres – the largest ever fitted to an Audi production car.

Tucked behind them are 10-pot calipers in red with 420 mm carbon ceramic discs (front) and 370 mm (rear). Aside from the tinted Matrix LED headlights, the RS Q8 also comes with an RS rear spoiler. The Matrix LED headlights come with sequential turn signals, and they alap project RS-specific animations upon locking and unlocking.

Unique body cladding widens the body by 10 mm in the front and 5 mm at the rear. The Audi RS Q8 is available in nine colours, including the gorgeous Java Green metallic you see here and 11 Audi Exclusive colours.

Moving inside, the RS Q8 is furnished with RS displays on the Audi virtual cockpit and MMI touch response infotainment display, a head-up display also with RS graphics, and RS sports seats in Valcona leather. Drivers can monitor parameters such as tyre pressure, lap times, G-forces on the virtual cockpit, with an integrated gear shift indicator.

Eight drive modes are available including comfort, auto, dynamic, efficiency, allroad, offroad, and two individually-configurable RS modes – RS1 and RS2. Going through the drive modes on the Audi drive select system allows drivers to control engine and transmission response, air suspension and all-wheel steering settings while also changing the sound of the exhaust.

The seats come with ventilation and massage functions, while other RS influences include grey contrast stitching on the knee pads, steering wheel, floor mats, Nappa leather-wrapped shift knob and seat belts.

Nappa leather is also applied on the door arm rests, while Alcantara is plastered across the headlining. Notable onboard features include a panoramic sunroof, a Bang & Olufsen sound system, electric sunshades for the rear windows and 12-way electric front seats with lumbar support and memory function for the driver.

For safety and driver assistance, the RS Q8 offers eight airbags, adaptive cruise control, lane change warning, lane departure warning, intersection assist, front cross traffic assist, and a 360 degree surround view monitor.",electric vehicles,paul tan's automotive news

According to Experian’s Automotive Consumer Trends Report: Q2 2022 there are more than 1.7 million EVs in operation in the US today (compared with more than 400,000 EVs in Q2 2018). This number may seem small compared to the 284 million vehicles on the road, but data shows it is growing exponentially. Additionally, new EV registrations continue to ramp up, comprising 5.7% of all new vehicle registrations in Q2 2022, up from 1.5% in Q2 2018.

In addition to the growth of new EV registrations over the past five years, the data also shows the types of EVs consumers prefer is shifting, partly due to more models being introduced. For example, SUVs comprised just 17.84% of new EV registrations in Q2 2018, with sedans making up 81.89%. However, in Q2 2022 SUVs made up 59%, followed by sedans at 35.77% and sports cars at 3.28%.

“ The types of electric vehicles consumers are gravitating towards mirrors that of the larger automotive industry, with the obvious exception of pick-ups due to limited availability. We can attribute part of the allure of electric vehicles to the newer variety of makes and models available,” said John Howard, Experian’s director of product management for automotive. “ Leveraging this kind of data and trends can help all auto industry players understand the landscape and make informed decisions as we move to a more electric market.”

Multiple markets see significant EV growth

California still makes up the largest share of retail EV registrations at 36.6%, but there are other markets beginning to show significant growth. For example, Tucson, Arizona shows a growth rate of more than 82% year-over-year as of Q2 20221. Other markets with notable year-over-year growth rates include Orlando, Florida at 77%, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, at 75% growth.

As growth continues in various markets, it is helpful to understand which consumers are most likely to purchase an EV. One way is to identify what kinds of vehicles consumers drive directly before purchasing an EV—their “transition” vehicle. The data shows consumers who drive a plug-in hybrid are more likely to transition to an EV, with 23.5% of plug-in hybrid owners selecting an EV as their next vehicle. In contrast, only 3.2% of gasoline vehicle drivers and 8.8% of gas hybrid drivers opted for EVs as their next vehicle.

“ EVs are beginning to defy the stereotypes, because registrations aren’t just happening on the coasts, it’s expanding nationwide,” Howard continued. “ Leveraging data that highlights trends like plug-in hybrids serving as a transitional vehicle will be essential knowledge for OEMs and dealers as more models are introduced and the automotive landscape continues to change.”

(NASDAQ: EVGO), the nation’s largest public fast charging network for electric vehicles (EVs), and WinCo Foods, a family of 138 employee-owned grocery stores, today announced the opening of the first EVgo public fast charging station for the grocery store chain in the State of Nevada. The new charging station, located at 6101 N Decatur Blvd, Las Vegas, NV, features 350kW and 100kW fast chargers, serving four stalls in total. This announcement builds on EVgo’s commitment to installing charging infrastructure in convenient locations for drivers.

“WinCo is happy to play our part in the reduction of carbon emissions in our operating areas,” said Noah Fleisher, corporate spokesperson at WinCo Foods. “We hope the charging station at our Las Vegas store becomes a destination for EV users and can help encourage others to make the change.”

WinCo joins the ranks of EVgo’s retail locations across the country, and EVgo will add fast charging stalls to WinCo Foods locations in California, Texas, Arizona, Washington, Oregon and Utah. Since the Las Vegas station opening, EVgo has added fast charging stations to two additional WinCo Food locations in California. By adding EVgo fast chargers to its properties, WinCo Foods pairs its renowned shopper experience with EVgo’s first-class customer service to extend hospitality from inside the store to the parking lot. EVgo’s current footprint in the Las Vegas market spans 18 locations.

“Las Vegas is a fast-growing market for electric vehicles, and we know that accelerating EV adoption there and across the country requires driver confidence in reliable and convenient public fast charging infrastructure,” said Jonathan Levy, Chief Commercial Officer at EVgo. “WinCo and EVgo recognize that adding EVgo fast chargers to WinCo’s Las Vegas store is a win-win-win for all of us, including drivers and shoppers. We look forward to growing our footprint with WinCo Foods in key markets across the West.”

Controlling the spin of electrons opens up future scenarios for applications in spin-based electronics (spintronics), for example in data processing. It also presents new opportunities for controlling the selectivity and efficiency of chemical reactions. Researchers recently presented first successes with the example of water splitting for producing ""green"" hydrogen and oxygen. A joint project involving working groups from the Center for Soft Nanoscience at the University of Münster (Germany) and from the Institute of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania; Prof. David Waldeck) now has the task of advancing the systematic development of spin-selective catalyst materials.

To this end, the researchers relate the catalytic activity of various inorganic spin-polarizing materials to direct measurements of the spin selectivity. The focus is on oxide materials which were purposely grown with a chiral structure. In addition, the researchers also want to investigate the origin of spin polarization in these chiral materials. The results of an initial study of chiral copper oxide layers have now been published in the ACS Nano journal.

The results in brief

The team of German and American researchers first examined chiral oxide catalysts—consisting in this case of thin, chiral copper oxide layers on a thin film of gold. The data measured show that the spin polarization of the electrons depends on which of these layers the electrons come from. The team considers two effects to be responsible for this: the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect and the magnetic arrangement in the chiral layers. The results are to help in the future production of spin-selective catalytic oxide materials, thus improving the efficiency of chemical reactions.

The example of fuel cells: Unwanted electron spin reduces efficiency

In fuel cells, hydrogen and oxygen react with each other and form water, with electrical energy being released in the process. The hydrogen may have been previously produced through the reverse process, breaking down water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The energy required for this can be provided through electrical power from regenerative sources of energy or directly through sunlight, so that, in future, hydrogen could serve as a source of energy in an energy cycle designed to be CO 2 -neutral.

What is holding back any large-scale commercialization of the concept—for example, in electric vehicles running on fuel cells—is, among other things, the low efficiency. A lot of energy has to be used to break down the water molecules, which means that at present it is less expensive to use this energy directly for recharging a car battery. This lower efficiency in breaking down water molecules is a consequence not only of the high overvoltage needed for developing oxygen at the anode of the electrolysis cell, but also of the production of unwanted by-products such as hydrogen peroxide and electronically excited oxygen. Due to their high reactivity, these by-products can also attack the electrode material. Both by-products occur in a so-called singlet state, in which the spins of the electrons involved in the molecular bonds are aligned in antiparallel mode to one another. In the product wanted from the reaction—oxygen in the electronic ground state—this is not the case because it forms a triplet state with spins aligned in parallel, and thus generating only one spin direction helps to arrive at this wanted state of oxygen.

New approach: Oxide catalyst produces the desired electron spin

This is a new approach because it involves the spins of the radicals adsorbed on the surfaces of the catalysts, from which the by-products are formed, being aligned in parallel. Such a parallel alignment of the electron spins can be achieved by using a chiral material. In this case, the transfer of electrons through the electrodes as a consequence of the CISS effect, or through the structural change in the oxide, can be spin-selective. In consequence, the formation of molecules in the unwanted singlet state is suppressed and the hydrogen yield is increased.

While researchers successfully demonstrated the spin-selective catalysis, there is still no complete understanding of the origin of the CISS effect. The spin-selective transmission of electrons through helical—and, therefore, also chiral—molecules has been demonstrated. However, more recent studies show that spin-selective transmission also occurs in inorganic, non-molecular chiral materials. Inorganic, spin-filtering surfaces are more stable, chemically, than chiral molecular layers and permit greater current densities in the context of spin-selective catalysis.

The current study in detail

In the study now published, lead author Paul Möllers, a Ph.D. student at Münster University, examined chiral copper oxide films with a thickness of just a few nanometers which had previously been electrochemically deposited in a chiral form onto thin gold substrates by researchers from Pittsburgh. UV laser pulses were used to stimulate photoelectrons from the samples and their mean spin polarization was measured (in a spin polarimeter based on ""Mott scattering""). Depending on whether the samples were hit from the oxide-covered front side or from the reverse side, in the process electrons with different energies were emitted from the gold substrate or from the oxide films themselves, in different proportions. By correlating the energy distribution with the spin polarization values measured, the Münster researchers showed that the electrons from both layers are polarized to different extents.

The electrons from the gold substrate are filtered, as regards their spin, by the CISS effect as they pass through the chiral layer. The electrons from the chiral copper oxide display an opposite spin polarization, and in the case of films with a thickness of more than 40 nanometers, there is a preponderance of these copper oxide electrons. Additional measurements carried out by the working group led by Prof. Heiko Wende at the Department of Physics at the University of Duisburg-Essen suggest that this reflects a magnetic arrangement in the chiral layers which is not observed in non-chiral oxide films with the same composition.

In order to follow up this hypothesis, the experimental set-up in Münster will be extended by having the possibility of measuring the spin polarization in electrons depending directly on their energy. Further measurements on chiral copper and cobalt oxide films will enable not only a clear differentiation to be made between both polarization mechanisms, but also chiral inorganic spin-selective catalyst materials to be designed specifically.

Read why I continue to be bullish on VALE stock.,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4542538-vale-trading-at-2-71x-evebitda-and-returning-capital-aggressively,"Andressa Anholete/Getty Images News

Iron ore price hit a two-week low yesterday ahead of a widely expected interest rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve. We got the interest hike, and the market is now taking the idea that Powell will keep raising rates to combat inflation through a slowdown more seriously. As bad as that sounds, keep in mind that iron ore rarely ever got to current ""lows"" between 2015 and 2019:

iron ore prices historical (Trading Economics)

Brazilian presidential elections are coming up next month, and Lula looks like he has a ~70% chance of taking it down (I'm deriving these odds from betting sites so take it for what it's worth). He's floated some creative mining royalty ideas on the campaign trail which may have put some pressure on Vale (NYSE:VALE) as well.

In terms of valuation, Vale S.A. still looks very cheap to me. I readily acknowledge the recession risk on continued rate increases. I agree that could bring down iron ore prices and EBITDA/earnings to a magnified extent due to operating leverage. Yet, 3.63x forward earnings or 2.71x EV/EBITDA remains quite attractive. Peers like BHP Group Limited (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RIO) are subject to the same risk but trade at slightly higher multiples (arguably low multiples as I argue here).

Vale valuations (Seekingalpha.com)

Meanwhile, Vale bought back 100 million+ shares in the last two months and they have an aggressive policy in place. Per the CEO on the most recent earnings call:

Last quarter, we announced the third buyback program for up to 500 million shares. We executed close to 22% of this program in a little more than two months. After the completion of the third buyback program, you will have repurchased almost 20% of the company’s outstanding shares. This means that we are concentrating future earnings on a per share basis by 25%. We view this as a form of growth without pressuring the supply side and carrying a lower execution risk.

The company is also committed to paying a dividend equal to 50% of cash flow. Commodities are under pressure on recession fears. I get that recession will materialize if the Fed keeps it up. At the same time, I'm not fully convinced a recession translates into deep commodity slumps as we've seen after the GFC and recent slowdowns.

I do acknowledge China won't be growing as explosively. Yet even modest growth on what's now a huge economy (2nd largest GDP in the world) still requires massive absolute growth in commodity supply.

Mature economies like the U.S. and the combined Euro area are on a multi-decade path to transition from fossil-fueled economies to renewable-fueled economies. This transition requires massive amounts of commodities to supply materials required to adapt grids and manufacture windmills, solar panels, electric vehicles, and hydrogen installations. In general, renewable power sources and electric vehicles require much more copper than their fossil-fueled predecessors. The infrastructure build-out means a frontloading of material investment with the payoff following as emissions-free energy is generated over the decades afterward.

Vale management believes it is valued as a mature low, growth iron ore business. But it sees quite a bit of potential in its base metal properties that are valuable to the energy transition. Nickel is a metal that's particularly useful to EV-makers in batteries. Elon Musk has been more or less begging miners to up their nickel investments. Tesla (TSLA) recently signed a supply deal with Vale for Nickel from its Canadian operations.

There's even some talk of separating the future-oriented base metals business from the iron ore operations but I believe it is very unlikely Vale will pull the trigger on that. The President of Finance and Investor Relations answered as follows to a question about an IPO of the metals division:

...So, on the potential transaction, we haven't decided that as Eduardo said if it's an IPO, non-IPO, but I think fundamentally what we are trying to achieve here is a more dedicated governance for base metals which we see a lot of merits for. We also want to make sure we create occurrence for growth. This business is very different from iron ore. We have a lot of growth in iron ore by resuming our capacity with limited CapEx. But as I think you pointed out, we are cash story. Today, we appreciate that. And we are happy with that, and we continue to pursue that strategy. But base metals is different, it's a growth business. There's tremendous amount of momentum for EV transition, for electrification of the world, so all of that calls for different strategy. And we believe it would make sense to have occurrence that could support an accelerated growth strategy there. The final format we'll see, but that's how we are thinking about, and that's what we should expect us to pursue. Certainly the market today is not appreciative of a transaction, but we'll continue to look into that and bring that to you guys once we feel good about it. On the divestment MRN is the one we've said publicly. And it's quite frankly the last one. So we could continue to look for ways to optimize the portfolio on the margin. But I think we can certainly say we've done most of the reshaping that we wanted to do at this point.

This suggests there is a non-zero chance of IPO'ing or spinning-off a base metals segment. The CEO then kind of threw cold water on that prospect (emphasis mine):

And just to compliment your points. It's like a growth call and a youth call, but probably never going to let go the base metal business. Okay. If we want to bring partners, even its private, even if we go public, it's going to be a Vale’s and it's going to be a growth goal, raise currency, nobody has this front end commodities like we do. It's a matter of, because we believe better governance, we believe better partners would help us grow, but we don't want to lose our growth, of course, there's a huge amount of opportunities in the electric world, the transition – the energy transition world.

In my view, the market is punishing some metals businesses way too hard for a potential recession. Vale's share price may already (partially) bake in a Lula victory while any detrimental policies are still far away. In addition, these policies also tend to dissuade competition. I agree it will likely come, but the backdrop is different, and Vale is in very good shape with $8 billion in net debt (about double on a gross basis) and $24 billion of EBITDA. The multiples will likely expand as what's likely a peak-EBITDA contracts some. However, the business is throwing off cash and aggressively buying back shares. I explained how I'm trying to benefit from the large buyback program in my previous Vale article although that hasn't worked out so far. I continue to be long Vale believing its longer-term prospects aren't reflected in the current share price.",electric vehicles,seeking alpha

497,Inside Seoul Robotics’s contrarian approach to autonomous vehicle tech - TechCrunch,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Pg5_SENSR-S.png?resize=1200,605",22/09/2022,Seoul Robotics raised $25 million in venture funding for its unique approach to automated driving technology that BMW is already piloting.,https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/22/seoul-robotics-aims-to-automate-vehicles-movement-via-its-3d-sensor-platform-closes-25m-funding/,"Seoul Robotics has taken a divergent path on the road to commercializing autonomous vehicles. Instead of developing and embedding the entire self-driving system, including sensors into a vehicle, Seoul is turning to surrounding infrastructure to do some of the heavy lifting.

And its contrarian approach has attracted a new group of investors and $25 million in venture funding. The Series B funding was led by KB Investment, according to Seoul Robotics.

“Instead of outfitting the vehicles themselves with sensors, we’re outfitting the surrounding infrastructure with sensors,” vice president of product and solutions at Seoul Robotics Jerone Floor said in August when the company partnered with Nvidia.

The company’s autonomous-vehicle infrastructure platform, called Level 5 Control Tower (or LV5 CTRL TWR), along with its branded Sensr software, collects information from sensors like cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging radar) as well as other data stored in the cloud and then sends that to vehicles.

According to Seoul Robotics CEO Hanbin Lee, the LV5 CTRL TWR uses advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and connectivity built into vehicles to maneuver them autonomously without requiring hardware.

Seoul Robotics claims its LV5 CTRL TWR helps provide information on the surrounding environment and chooses the safest path for the vehicle.

The infrastructure platform manages a car’s functions such as lane-keeping and brake assistance via its technology, called “autonomy through infrastructure (ATI),” and a V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communication system, which sends information from a vehicle to any surrounding infrastructure and other vehicles.

“[With the autonomy through infrastructure (ATI), users can automate millions of cars passing through a parking lot with only a few hundred sensors,” Lee said.

Seoul Robotics deployed its technology with BMW to test the German car’s pilot program with the new BMW 7 Series and the fully electric BMW i7 in July 2022.

Founded in 2017 by four co-founders, Seoul Robotics now works with global manufacturers (OEMs) like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Qualcomm and LG Uplus to diversify the use of its system.

“We are in discussions with about nine more global OEMs now for partnerships,” Lee said.

Lee also said that one of its most unique features is that its Sensr software, launched in 2018, allows users to choose a sensor, or multiple sensors, that best fit their needs, meaning that customers can select services based on their requirements and budgets.

“While Sensr is very much still the backbone of our product offerings, including LV5 CTRL TWR, the types of solutions we offer are far more sophisticated compared to 2018,” Lee told TechCrunch. “We now offer three plug-and-play lidar development kits that include all the components necessary for any organization to get set up with a 3D system.” Additionally, it provides solutions tailored to a specific application, such as pedestrian safety, railroad obstacle detection and Level 5 autonomy, Lee continued.

Lee explained that the earliest lidar-based perception software was all developed by sensor manufacturers, and the software had to be tied to the hardware. “With that approach, the challenge was that each sensor have different strengths and weaknesses; some have a wide field of view but short range, others have a narrow field of view and long-range,” Lee said. “It is also not possible to mix and match sensor, which is where we come in.”

Last week, the company launched a feature that uses lidar and its Sensr software to detect and alert instances of wrong-way driving. Seoul Robotics says the wrong-way detection feature is being deployed on freeways and highways in California, Florida and Tennessee, as well as in Europe and Asia.

With the latest funding, the startup plans to grow its team and expand applications of Sensr to bring its automated vehicle technology to other potential partners across industries like logistics (rental car fleets, trucking yards and automated valet parking systems), smart cities and security, Lee said. Other investors include Noh and Partners, Future Play, Korean Development Bank, Artesian and Access Ventures also participated in the Series B.

The company, headquartered in Seoul, with offices in Munich, California, and Raleigh, raised $6 million in a Series A in 2020.

The Sprott Energy Transition Materials ETF does not yet have a ticker or expense ratio. However, it will track an index provided by Nasdaq. Generally, the term “energy transition materials” for the purposes of the fund refers to uranium, copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, manganese, rare earths and silver, according to the prospectus.

The index’s methodology includes caps on individual companies and commodity groups, the document notes.

Earlier this year, Invesco launched the Invesco Electric Vehicle Metals Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (EVMT), which has a similar focus but holds commodity futures on cobalt, nickel, iron ore, aluminum, copper, zinc and silver. The fund rolled out in April, but has been slow to gather assets; EVMT currently only has about $20 million in assets under management.

Unlike the proposed Sprott fund, EVMT is actively managed.

“By 2025, it's estimated that plug-in vehicles will represent 23% of new passenger vehicle sales globally. We were just under 10% in 2021,” said Kathy Kriskey, head of commodity and alternative ETF products at Invesco, who further notes that nickel, which is the largest commodity in the fund, at 39% of the portfolio, faces a shortage by 2024.
