0,Google is challenging TikTok anew with acquisition of AI avatar startup Alter,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b6iNzsQ7qoi5pfdVcb7iDc-1200-80.jpg,01/11/2022,"Google has acquired Alter, a startup that creates artificial intelligence-powered avatars for apps and games.",https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-reportedly-acquires-ai-avatar-startup-alter,"What you need to know

Google appears to have acquired AI avatar startup Alter.

The search giant reportedly spent $100 million to purchase the firm in a supposed bid to challenge TikTok anew.

Google apparently acquired Alter two months ago without much fanfare.

Google may have found a new way to pose another challenge to TikTok, this time by acquiring Alter for $100 million. The startup company creates artificial intelligence-based avatars for use in games and social media.

TechCrunch (opens in new tab) reports that Google has confirmed the acquisition, which apparently closed two months ago without making a public announcement of it. A Google representative has also confirmed the report to Android Central, but did not share further details of the acquisition.

Some of Alter's executives announced on LinkedIn that they have started new jobs at Google. For example, Alter's chief co-founder and operating officer, Jonathan Slimak, revealed (opens in new tab) on the social media platform that he joined Google in September, though his new role was not specified.

Alter was previously known as Facemoji, a tech startup that built a plug-and-play platform designed to provide avatar systems for games and apps without the need to rely on its software development kit. Last year, Facemoji raised $3 million in a seed funding round led by Play Ventures. Twitter was also among its early backers, along with other investors.

Google's latest move is seen as yet another attempt to take on TikTok. Since its launch in 2020, YouTube Shorts, the search giant's TikTok competitor, has seen steady growth. It is unclear how Google's acquisition of Alter fits into its ambition to cut into TikTok's market share. That said, following rumors earlier this year that Google was working on Project Iris, Alter could play a role in Google's AR/VR effort, which includes an AR headset that appears to render graphics in the cloud.

Digital avatars are becoming more widespread as tech giants continue to invest in this segment. Meta, for example, has invested heavily in developing the metaverse, most recently opening a fashion store for its metaverse avatars. With Google's latest acquisition, this relatively new area of technology appears to be gaining traction.",artificial intelligence,android central

SHANGHAI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - China will seek high-tech solutions to resolve its complex environmental challenges and make use of innovations in big data, biotech and artificial intelligence to tackle pollution, habitat loss and climate change, it said on Wednesday.

In a new action plan, the Chinese government said it would build a ""green technology innovation system"" over the 2021-2025 period to tackle air, soil and groundwater pollution, reduce waste and protect ecosystems, noting that current technologies were not mature enough to serve the country's long-term needs.

The system will be backed by tax incentives and new ""green technology banks"", and China will also encourage enterprises and financial institutions to provide more support to innovative green technologies, the plan said.

The new plan is designed to help the world's biggest greenhouse gas producer meet its targets to bring emissions to a peak by 2030 and to become ""carbon neutral"" by 2060. China has cut CO2 emissions per unit of economic growth by a third in the last decade, but overall volumes continue to rise.

The hi-tech plan appeared days before the start of a new round of global climate talks in Egypt, with Chinese representatives expected to focus on persuading industrialised countries to provide a long-awaited $100 billion annual fund to help poorer nations adapt to rising temperatures. read more

The plan promised to ""deploy science and technology systematically"" to resolve a wide range of environmental problems, improve its ability to assess the impact of rising temperatures in vulnerable regions, and monitor new sources of pollution, harmful chemicals and drug-resistant bacteria.

It also reiterated its commitment to carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology to prevent greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere. It promised more research to support large-scale demonstration projects and the use of aquifers and oil-bearing formations to contain sequestered CO2.

The government will also support research into ""deep decarbonisation technologies"" in a variety of industrial sectors, including steel, cement, thermal power and agriculture, it said.

The plan, published by the Ministry of Science and Technology and other government departments, also called for more international cooperation in the field of climate and environment, including with the United States.

It has also been working on wildfire tracking tools. Ahead of the COP27 climate conference taking place next week, the company announced that it is expanding those tools.

First, Google says it will offer flood forecasts for river basins in another 18 countries. Those are Brazil, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Guinea, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Angola, South Sudan, Namibia, Liberia and South Africa. The company previously offered flood warnings to users in India and Bangaldesh with alerts on Android devices and phones that have the Google Search app installed.

Google is also making a tool called Flood Hub available worldwide. Flood Hub displays flood forecasts on a map and shows when and where they might occur with color-coded pins. The company hopes the tool will help people who are directly at risk from the impacts of flooding, and that it will assist organizations and governments in mobilizing their responses.

""This expansion in geographic coverage is possible thanks to our recent breakthroughs in AI-based flood forecasting models, and we’re committed to expanding to more countries,"" Yossi Matias, Google vice president of engineering and crisis response lead, wrote in a blog post . Matias noted that catastrophic flood damage affects more than 250 million people every year. Global warming is likely to result in more flooding, which makes detection systems such as the one Google is working on critical.

Using weather forecast data, the company is able to offer flood warnings up to a week in advance, senior staff engineering manager Sella Nevo told The Verge . The AI model previously used water level gauge data, which limited the advance warning window to around 48 hours.

As for wildfires, Matias wrote that Google detects ""wildfire boundaries using new AI models based on satellite imagery and [shows] their real-time location in Search and Maps."" The company said last year that it would make its wildfire tracking tool available worldwide. It's now using machine learning to improve wildfire detection and monitoring. Initially, the improved tracking tools are available in the US, Mexico, Canada and some areas of Australia. The company also uses data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA satellites for wildfire tracking.",artificial intelligence,engadget
4,How AI Is Changing Medical Imaging to Improve Patient Care,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/functional-imaging.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,04/11/2022,Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving medical imaging by using the massive computing abilities of machine learning to mine body scans.,https://time.com/6227623/ai-medical-imaging-radiology/,"That doctors can peer into the human body without making a single incision once seemed like a miraculous concept. But medical imaging in radiology has come a long way, and the latest artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques are going much further: exploiting the massive computing abilities of AI and machine learning to mine body scans for differences that even the human eye can miss.

Imaging in medicine now involves sophisticated ways of analyzing every data point to distinguish disease from health and signal from noise. If the first few decades of radiology were about refining the resolution of the pictures taken of the body, then the next decades will be dedicated to interpreting that data to ensure nothing is overlooked.

Imaging is also evolving from its initial focus—diagnosing medical conditions—to playing an integral part in treatment as well, especially in the area of cancer. Doctors are beginning to lean on imaging to help them monitor tumors and the spread of cancer cells so that they have a better, faster way of knowing if therapies are working. That new role for imaging will transform the types of treatments patients will receive, and vastly improve the information doctors get about how well they’re working, so that they can ultimately make better choices about what treatment options they need.

“In the next five years, we will see functional imaging become part of care,” says Dr. Basak Dogan, associate professor of radiology at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “We don’t see the current standard imaging answering the real clinical questions. But functional techniques will be the answer for patients who want higher precision in their care so they can make better informed decisions.”

Detecting problems earlier

The first hurdle in making the most of what images can offer—whether they are X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasounds—is to automate the reading of them as much as possible, which saves radiologists valuable time. Computer-aided algorithms have proven their worth in this area, as massive computing power has made it possible to train computers to distinguish abnormal from normal findings. Software specialists and radiologists have been teaming up for years to come up with these formulas; radiologists feed computer programs their findings on tens of thousands of normal and abnormal images, which teaches the computer to distinguish when images contain things that fall outside of normal parameters. The more images the computer has to compare and learn from, the better it becomes at fine-tuning the distinctions.

For the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve an algorithm involving imaging, it must be accurate 80% to 90% of the time. So far, the FDA has approved about 420 of these for various diseases (mostly cancer). The FDA still requires that a human be the ultimate arbiter of what the machine-learning algorithm finds, but such techniques are critical for flagging images that might contain suspicious findings for doctors to review—and ultimately provide faster answers for patients.

At Mass General Brigham, doctors use about 50 such algorithms to help them with patient care, ranging from detecting aneurysms and cancers to spotting embolisms and signs of stroke among emergency-room patients, many of whom will present with general symptoms that these conditions share. About half have been approved by the FDA, and the remaining ones are being tested in patient care.

“The goal is to find things early. In some cases, it may take humans days to find an accurate diagnosis, whereas computers can run without sleep continuously and find those patients who need care right away,” says Dr. Keith Dreyer, chief data science officer and vice chairman of radiology at Mass General Brigham. “If we can use computers to do that, then it gets that patient to treatment much faster.”

Tracking patients more thoroughly

While computer-assisted triaging is the first step in integrating AI-based support in medicine, machine learning is also becoming a powerful way to monitor patients and track even the smallest changes in their conditions. This is especially critical in cancer, where the tedious task of determining whether someone’s tumor is growing, shrinking, or remaining the same is essential for making decisions about how well treatments are working. “We have trouble understanding what is happening to the tumor as patients undergo chemotherapy,” says Dogan. “Our standard imaging techniques unfortunately can’t detect any change until after midway through chemo”—which can be months into the process—“when some kind of shrinkage starts occurring.”

Imaging can be useful in those situations by picking up changes in tumors that aren’t related to their size or anatomy. “In the very early stages of chemotherapy, most of the changes in a tumor are not quite at the level of cell death,” says Dogan. “The changes are related to modifying interactions between the body’s immune cells and cancer cells.” And in many cases, cancer doesn’t shrink in a predictable way from the outside in. Instead, pockets of cancer cells within a tumor may die off, while others continue to thrive, leaving the overall mass more pockmarked, like a moth-eaten sweater. In fact, because some of that cell death is connected to inflammation, the size of the tumor may even increase in some cases, even though that doesn’t necessarily indicate more cancer cell growth. Standard imaging currently can’t distinguish how much of a tumor is still alive and how much is dead.The most commonly used breast-cancer imaging techniques, mammography and ultrasound, are designed instead to pick up anatomical features.

Read More: The Race to Make a Vaccine for Breast Cancer

At UT Southwestern, Dogan is testing two ways that imaging can be used to track functional changes in breast cancer patients. In one, using funding from the National Institutes of Health, she is imaging breast cancer patients after one cycle of chemotherapy to pick up slight changes in pressure around the tumor by injecting microbubbles of gas. Ultrasound measures changes in pressure of these bubbles, which tend to accumulate around tumors; growing cancers have more blood vessels to support their expansion, compared to other tissues.

In another study, Dogan is testing optoacoustic imaging, which turns light into sound signals. Lasers are shone on breast tissue, causing cells to oscillate, which creates sound waves that are captured and analyzed. This technique is well suited to detect tumors’ oxygen levels, since cancer cells tend to need more oxygen than normal cells to continue growing. Changes in sound waves can detect which parts of the tumor are still growing, and which are not. “Just by imaging the tumor, we can tell which are most likely to metastasize to the lymph nodes and which are not,” says Dogan. Currently, clinicians can’t tell which cancers will spread to the lymph and which won’t. “It could give us information about how the tumor is going to behave and potentially save patients unnecessary lymph node surgeries that are now part of standard care.”

The technique could also help find early signs of cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body, well before they show up in visual scans and without the need for invasive biopsies. Focusing on organs to which cancer cells typically spread, such as the bones, liver, and lungs, could give doctors a head start on catching these new deposits of cancer cells.

Spotting unseen abnormalities

With enough data and images, these algorithms could even find aberrations for any condition that no human could detect, says Dreyer. His team is also working on developing an algorithm that measures certain biomarkers in the human body, whether anatomical or functional, so it can flag changes in those metrics that could suggest someone is likely to have a stroke, fracture, heart attack, or some other adverse event. That’s the holy grail of imaging, says Dreyer, and while it’s a few years away, “those are the kinds of things that are going to be transformational in healthcare for AI.”

To get there, it will take tons and tons of data from hundreds of thousands of patients. But the siloed health care systems of the U.S. mean that pooling such information is challenging. Federated learning, in which scientists develop algorithms that are applied to different institutions’ anonymized patient-information databases, is one solution. That way, privacy is maintained and institutions won’t have to jeopardize their secure systems.

If more of those models are validated, through federated learning or otherwise, AI-based imaging could even start to help patients at home. As COVID-19 made self-testing and telehealth more routine, people may eventually be able to get imaging information through portable ultrasounds provided via a smartphone app, for example.

“The real change in health care that is going to happen from AI is that it will deliver a lot of solutions to patients themselves, or before they become patients, so that they can stay healthy,” says Dreyer. That would perhaps be the most potent way to optimize imaging: by empowering patients to learn from and make the most informed decisions possible about protecting their health.

Register here.

From entry to exit, the average time a consumer spends in a grocery store is about 41 minutes for one trip. But when checkout lines are long and shoppers spend time scouring shelves for out-of-stock items, that trip quickly gets much longer. Neither consumers, who may quickly lose patience — nor retailers, who are already dealing with post-pandemic staffing shortages, supply chain disruptions and reduced foot traffic, want that.

That is where cashierless checkout and inventory management comes in, powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision. A variety of companies, both big tech and startups, have taken different approaches over the past few years, using cameras and sensors to identify items and ringing them up — allowing the customer to quickly grab items off the shelf and leave without standing in line.

These days, even as the economy slows, investors show no signs of pulling back on investments in this sector. Big funding rounds are still making news, including the Tel Aviv-based Trigo, which last week announced a $100 million series C investment, bringing its total funding to around $199 million, according to Crunchbase.

Amazon Go spawned many competitors

Six years ago, everyone thought Amazon, with its novel Amazon Go, had the cashierless grocery store model in the bag. But while many predicted the technology would scale massively, there are still only 28 Amazon Go stores worldwide — and that includes its recent expansion in India.

In general, scaling is the biggest challenge, said Brad Jashinsky, marketing analyst at Gartner. “The main technical challenge behind check-out computer vision is scaling up the systems to handle more customers and larger store formats,” he said. “There is also a need to more easily integrate them into existing store footprints.”

As Amazon has wavered, several startups have stepped in with their own computer vision-powered technology — aimed at solving for scale and ease of integration. Some startups, like Caper AI – which was acquired by Instacart in 2021 – and Mashgin have focused on AI-powered plug-and-play smart carts or kiosks. Others, like AiFi and Trigo, are focused on ceiling cameras, shelf sensors and digital twin technology. Even though the economy is taking a downturn, it hasn’t seemed to phase-out opportunities in this niche sector.

Bringing computer vision to the physical store

According to Michael Gabay, CEO of Trigo, the draw of computer vision for grocery retailers is gaining the capabilities currently available to them in an ecommerce space and bringing that intelligence into their physical store spaces.

“That, for grocery retailers, is by far a bigger market than the online market,” Gabay said. ”Their confidence [in technology] is much higher than it was last year or two years ago.”

Supporting that statement, a Gartner study released late last year found that 73% of retail respondents expect to increase store technology investments for 2022.

In addition, retailers have been forced to refocus on connecting stores to their entire ecosystem, Jashinsky explained in an email. “New attention and investment has been given to digitalization of store technology investments — including check-out computer vision,” he said.

Trigo was founded in 2017 by brothers Michael and Daniel Gabay, who grew up on a kibbutz in northern Israel and served in technological roles in elite Israel Defense Force units. The CEO and CTO, respectively, set out to be the antidote for the headache of waiting in long checkout lines.

Its 3D store mapping and computer vision capabilities uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to keep track of a customer’s shopping tab as they go — even updating the total if they put an item back — and charges them accordingly when they walk out, no lines necessary. It also tracks item stock and customer body language so it can alert store employees if it suspects an item has been hidden in a jacket, for example. This is all without harvesting any biometric or facial recognition data.

While that may sound like a lot for retailers to wrap their brains around, all they need to do is work with Trigo to set it up, and once the installation is complete — which the company claims is typically overnight — nothing more is needed and they have the green light to begin using it.

Despite the swath of competitors and growing interest in the market as a whole, Gabay is confident in Trigo’s capacity to stand out among the crowd. The company is currently deployed in supermarket chains worldwide including the Wakefern Cooperative in the U.S., the U.K.’s Tesco chain, Israel’s Shufersal stores, Aldi Nord in the Netherlands and REWE, a chain in Germany.

“We’re also the only startup, that is not Amazon, currently focusing on supermarkets and not just convenience stores or small stores,” Gabay told VentureBeat.

Trigo’s technology can be implemented by stores that are 3,000 square feet to 5,000 square feet — and claims it is working toward use in 10,000-square-foot stores next. However, its competitor AiFi also claims it can be used in up to 10,000 square-foot spaces. It has similarly worked to refurbish stores into fully autonomous ones.

Retail-focused computer vision surge

Experts expect the computer vision market, specifically, to surge worldwide to $41 billion by 2030. Investing in technology like this is the logical “next step for the industry,” McKinsey analysts Tyler Harris, Alexandra Kuzmanovic, and Jaya Pandrangi recently wrote.

“Investments in technology used to feel optional for grocers — an opportunity to experiment or increase the ‘wow factor’ in stores rather than to support mission-critical operations,” the article reads. “Today, a wide range of affordable, field-tested technologies can help retailers reduce the cost structure of their stores while delivering a better experience for both consumers and employees.”

In contrast with the tightening of the current financial market, a survey from Battery Ventures found that 54% of C-suite executives have plans to increase their tech budgets next year — with 75% saying they have plans to at least increase it within the next five years.

With its range of use cases from labor allocation, checkout ease, merchandising, inventory management, loss prevention and maintenance — Jashinsky doesn’t expect the boom in retail-focused computer-vision innovation for retail to phase out anytime soon.

“The ability to provide ambient customer transactions is only one use case for smart check-out computer vision technology,” he said.

The real power, he explained, comes from additional real-time business insights: “Retailers using computer vision for smart check-out can leverage the real-time insights captured to improve decisions.”

Editor’s note: This article previously quoted Michael Gabay, Trigo’s CEO, saying the company was the only one to his knowledge that was working to take existing stores and turn them into fully autonomous ones.

Orwell’s focus in the essay was on political use of the language to, as he put it, “make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind”. But the analysis can also be applied to the ways in which contemporary corporations bend the language to distract attention from the sordid realities of what they are up to.

The tech industry has been particularly adept at this kind of linguistic engineering. “Sharing”, for example, is clicking on a link to leave a data trail that can be used to refine the profile the company maintains about you. You give your “consent” to a one-sided proposition: agree to these terms or get lost. Content is “moderated”, not censored. Advertisers “reach out” to you with unsolicited messages. Employees who are fired are “let go”. Defective products are “recalled”. And so on.

At the moment, the most pernicious euphemism in the dictionary of double-speak is AI, which over the last two or three years has become ubiquitous. In origin, it’s an abbreviation for artificial intelligence, defined by the OED as “the capacity of computers or other machines to exhibit or simulate intelligent behaviour; the field of study concerned with this”. An Ngram tool (which shows patterns of word usage) reveals that until the 1960s AI and artificial intelligence were more or less synonymous, but that thereafter they diverged and now AI is rampant in the tech industry, mass media and academia.

Now why might that be? No doubt laziness has something to do with it; after all, two letters are typographically easier than 22. But that’s a rationalisation, not an explanation. If you look at it through an Orwellian lens you have to ask: what kind of work is this linguistic compression doing? And for whom? And that’s where things get interesting.

But here’s the thing: the industry is now addicted to a technology that has major technical and societal downsides

As a topic and a concept, intelligence is endlessly fascinating to us humans. We have been arguing about it for centuries – what it is, how to measure it, who has it (and who hasn’t) and so on. And ever since Alan Turing suggested that machines might be capable of thinking, interest in artificial intelligence has grown and is now at fever pitch with speculation about the prospect of super-intelligent machines – sometimes known as AGI (for artificial general intelligence).

All of which is interesting but has little to do with what the tech industry calls AI, which is its name for machine learning, an arcane and carbon-intensive technology that is sometimes good at solving complex but very well-defined problems. For example, machine-learning systems can play world-class Go, predict the way protein molecules will fold and do high-speed analysis of retinal scans to identify cases that require further examination by a human specialist.

All good stuff, but the reason the tech industry is obsessed by the technology is that it enables it to build machines that learn from the behaviour of internet users to predict what they might do next and, in particular, what they are disposed to like, value and might want to buy. This is why tech bosses boast about having “AI everywhere” in their products and services. And it’s why whenever Mark Zuckerberg and co are attacked for their incapacity to keep toxic content off their platforms, they invariably respond that AI will fix the problem real soon now.

But here’s the thing: the industry is now addicted to a technology that has major technical and societal downsides. CO 2 emissions from training large machine-learning systems are huge, for example. They are too fragile and error-prone to be relied upon in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles. They incorporate racial, gender and ethnic biases (partly because they have imbibed the biases implicit in the data on which they were trained). And they are irredeemably opaque – in the sense that even their creators are often unable to explain how their machines arrive at classifications or predictions – and therefore don’t meet democratic requirements of accountability. And that’s just for starters.

So how does the industry address the sordid reality that it’s bet the ranch on a powerful but problematic technology? Answer: by avoiding calling it by its real name and instead wrapping it in a name that implies that, somehow, it’s all part of a bigger, grander romantic project – the quest for artificial intelligence. As Orwell might put it, it’s the industry’s way of giving “an appearance of solidity to pure wind” while getting on with the real business of making fortunes.

Machine Learning (ML) requires data on which to train and iterate. Making use of data for ML also requires a basic understanding of what is in the training data, which isn’t always an easy problem to solve.

Notably, there is a real challenge with unstructured data, which by definition has no structure to help organize the data so that it can be useful for ML and business operations. It’s a dilemma that Vikram Chatterji saw, time and again, during his tenure working as a project management lead for cloud artificial intelligence (AI) at Google.

In large companies across multiple sectors including financial services and retail, Chatterji and his colleagues kept seeing vast volumes of unstructured data including text, images and audio that were just lying around. The companies kept asking him how they could leverage that unstructured data to get insights. The answer that Chatterji gave was they could just use ML, but the simple answer was never really that simple.

“We realized very quickly that the ML model itself was something we just picked up off the shelf and it was very easy,” Chatterji told VentureBeat. “But the hardest part, comprising 80 to 90% of my data scientist job, was basically to kind of go in and look at the data and try to figure out what the erroneous data points are, how to clean it, how to make sure that it’s better the next time.”

That realization led Chatterji and his cofounders, Yash Sheth and Atindriyo Sanyal, to form a new startup in late 2021 they called Galileo to bring data intelligence to unstructured data for ML.

Today, Galileo announced that it has raised $18 million in a series A round of funding as the company continues to scale up its technology.

Data intelligence vs. data labeling

All data, be it structured or unstructured, tends to go through a data labeling process before it is used to train an ML model. Chatterji doesn’t see his firm’s technology as replacing data labeling, rather, he sees Galileo as providing a layer of intelligence on top of existing ML tools.

Chatterji said that at Google and at Uber, data labeling is widely employed, but that still isn’t enough to solve the challenge of effectively making sense of unstructured data. There are issues before data is labeled, including understanding the quality of the data, accuracy and duplication. After data is labeled and in production, they’re also areas of concern.

“After you label the data and you’ve trained a model, how do you figure out what the mislabeled samples are?” Chatterji said. “It’s a needle in the haystack problem.”

What Galileo has done is developed a series of sophisticated algorithms, to be able to identify potentially mislabeled samples rapidly. The Galileo platform provides a series of different metrics that can also help data scientists to identify data issues for ML models. One such metric is the data error potential score, which provides a number that can help an organization understand the potential incidents of data errors and the impact on a model.

Overall, the approach that Galileo is taking is an attempt to ‘debug’ data, finding potential errors and remediate them.

“The different kinds of data errors that people are looking for are just so varied, and the problem is, sometimes you don’t even know what you’re trying to find, but you know that a model just isn’t performing well,” he said.

ML data intelligence helps solve the challenge of bias and explainability

Helping to reduce potential bias in AI models is another area where Galileo can play a role.

Chatterji said that Galileo has created a variety of tools within its platform to help organizations slice data in different ways to help better group entities to understand diversity in several categories, such as gender or geography.

“We’ve definitely seen people adopt these data slices to try to incorporate bias detection in their organizations,” he said.

When attempting to mitigate bias in AI models, it’s also critical to be able to explain how a given model was able to reach a specific result, which is what AI explainability is all about. To that end, Galileo can explain to its users what words were indexed most often that led to a specific prediction.

To date, Galileo has focused on unstructured text data and natural language processing (NLP). Now with its new funding, the company will look to expand its platform to other use cases, including computer vision for image recognition.

“We’re bullish on the idea of ML data intelligence and in the next few years we’re going to see this becoming more commonplace as a core part of the stack for ML data practitioners,” Chatterji said.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Register here.

Almost every confidential investment memorandum (CIM) for a tech-driven enterprise includes the company’s mention of artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) capabilities. But as with other investment buzzwords — such as “subscription revenue” — there is a tendency to use AI or ML to suggest complex, business-enabling, proprietary technology and processes to distinguish the offering as differentiated or technologically superior. This is often to garner higher valuation.

We’ve all heard examples of AI failures that make for good headlines and provide interesting cautionary tales. But as an investor, it can be just as frightening to learn that the AI capability that drove an above-market valuation is not much more than a spreadsheet with some marketing spin.

In our role as advisors to technology investors and management teams, we often encounter a question central to the investment thesis: Is the AI/ML the real deal? Here’s how to find the answer.

Make sure everyone’s speaking the same language

Varying interpretations of “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning” and “deep learning” can create confusion and misunderstandings, as the terms are often misused or used interchangeably. Think of the concepts this way:

Event Low-Code/No-Code Summit Learn how to build, scale, and govern low-code programs in a straightforward way that creates success for all this November 9. Register for your free pass today. Register Here

Artificial intelligence is any system that mimics human intelligence. With this definition, AI could refer to any rules-based system or algorithm — as long as it’s being used to simulate intelligence. Chatbots are a perfect example.

Machine learning is a subset of AI. It relies on a mathematical model created using a large dataset and a training algorithm that allows the model to learn and evolve. For example, in Google Photos, you can tag pictures with the names of the people in them, and over time, Google gets better and better at identifying people on its own. This is a good example of machine learning.

Deep learning is a subset of ML that involves highly sophisticated models resembling the structure of the human brain. These models require millions of records to train but can often equal or outperform humans at specific tasks. For example, the AlphaZero deep learning program remains undefeated at chess.

Digging deeper

You need to dig deeper than these broad, general terms to see how legitimate a company’s AI/ML technology is. You need to understand: What problem is being solved? What AI/ML technologies are used to solve it? How and why does this solution work? Does the solution provide a competitive edge over other approaches?

Let’s say you’re looking at investing in a new company in the hypothetical LawnTech space.

If the CIM describes the company’s HornetNest app as an “AI system for hornet eradication,” you’d want to dig more deeply with the technical product team to understand the underlying components and process. Ideally, you’ll end up with an explanation that sounds more like this:

“We use a YOLO-based object detector with a Kalman filter to identify, count, and track hornets in real time. Data is fed into an anomaly detector that automatically alerts customers when we see behavior that suggests a new nest may be present within a 50-yard radius. Through an exclusive partnership with Orkin, we have compiled the world’s largest training set of images, allowing us to predict the presence and location of new hornet nests more accurately than anyone else.”

This level of detail is needed to understand the sophistication, value, and defensibility of a company’s AI/ML assets.

Evaluate the whole picture

AI isn’t just one thing. It’s the product of six critical components essential to AI value. The degree to which these elements operate effectively together can help you separate the highest-value AI from the less legitimate.

The team

This is perhaps the most valuable asset and determinator of long-term success. In particular, having a strong data science team led by a seasoned chief data scientist opens the door to best-in-class AI.

The data

ML relies on training data to make the models. High volumes of data, especially proprietary data that competitors can’t access, create a significant competitive advantage and barrier. As a very rough rule of thumb, you need tens of thousands of training records for traditional ML; millions for deep learning.

The training process

There are basic training processes and advanced techniques, including automated machine learning (AutoML), hyperparameter tuning, active learning and weak supervision. A company’s ability to use these advanced techniques leads to reduced costs and improved quality.

Operational excellence

Beyond training the AI, it’s important to understand its overall care and feeding. You’ll want to understand the quality assurance, testing and error decomposition processes. When weaknesses are identified, how is supplemental training data gathered? Additionally, suppose a strength of the AI is incorporating real-time feedback to enable reinforcement learning, or compiling a knowledge base to support decision-making. In these cases, processes must be actively managed to ensure optimal performance.

The models

Models are results of the team, the data and the training process. But, to be considered an asset, they still take appreciable time to create and optimize. The value of this component is determined by the number of models a company has and the sophistication of the models.

The AI development infrastructure

There is a difference between a company that has thrown together a few ML models and one with the infrastructure to automatically create, retrain, test and deploy models.

Understand where the company falls on the AI maturity scale

Based on a sample from the more than 2,500 tech companies our team has diligenced over the last two years, we’ve noted some fairly consistent indicators of AI maturity.

Around 10% of these companies fall into the category of “No AI.” Despite what they say, it’s not AI. For example, software that optimizes container routing may not be AI but just a sophisticated traditional algorithm.

A further 10% fall into the category of “Non-proprietary AI.” In these instances, the company is using only public domain models, or MLaaS cloud APIs, to leverage AI. An example would be using Amazon’s AI-based Textract API to recognize text or the public domain ResNet model to detect objects in images. This approach can be considered AI-based but does not require training data, a training process, data scientists or even a lot of knowledge about AI to implement. There would also be no competitive differentiator in this approach since any company can use the same public-domain assets.

The vast majority, about 75%, fall into the category of “Standard AI.” What we see most often are companies that are training proprietary ML models using their own training data in combination with standard training algorithms. There is a broad range of sophistication in this class. At the simpler end of the range are companies that create linear regression models using a library like Python’s sklearn. At the more complex end are companies that design and create multiple deep learning models using TensorFlow and use advanced optimization techniques like hyperparameter tuning, active learning and weak supervision to maximize accuracy.

The final 5% falls into the category of “Leading-edge AI.” These companies have gone beyond standard AI techniques and developed their own model types and training algorithms to push AI in new directions. This represents unique and patentable IP that has value in itself, and the models created by these companies can outperform competitors that have access to the same dataset.

It looks like the real deal — but is it right for you?

Once you understand the details of the AI itself, you’re better positioned to understand its impact on the investment thesis. There are two factors to consider here.

First, what is the value of the AI? Because “AI” can have widely-varying definitions, it’s important to take a holistic view. The value of a company’s AI assets is the sum of the six critical parts noted above: the team, data, training process, operational excellence, models, and development infrastructure.

Another way to look at AI’s value in a company is to ask how it impacts the bottom line. What would happen to revenues and costs if the AI were to disappear tomorrow? Does it actually drive revenue or operating leverage? And conversely, what costs are required to maintain or improve the capability? You’ll find AI can be anything from an empty marketing slogan to technology essential for a company’s success.

Second, what risks does the AI introduce? Unintentional algorithmic bias can pose reputational and legal risks to the business, creating sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory AI. In the case of credit, law enforcement, housing, education and healthcare, this type of bias is prohibited by law and difficult to defend against — even when it occurs unwittingly. Make sure you understand how the target has guarded against algorithmic bias and the steps you would need to take to prevent bias moving forward.

Privacy is another concern, with AI often necessitating new layers of privacy and security protocols. You need to understand how biometric data (considered personally identifiable information protected by data privacy laws) and sensitive images, such as faces, license plates and computer screens, are collected, used and safeguarded.

The true value of AI

The reality is that, in today’s tech landscape, most companies can legitimately claim some AI capabilities. The majority of the time, the AI fits our definition for “standard” maturity and performs as we expect it to. But when we looked more deeply into the “standard AI” category, we found that only about half of these companies were using best practices or creating a competitive differentiator that would be difficult for competitors to outperform. The other half had room for improvement.

Determining the value of AI requires both an in-depth look under the hood and a nuanced understanding of the AI’s specific role in the business. Tech diligence, done by experts who’ve directly led AI teams, can help demystify AI for investors. The goal is to help investors understand exactly what they’re buying, what it can and cannot do for the business, what risks it introduces, and, ultimately, to what extent it supports the investment strategy.

I sometimes suspect the government has given up on finding solutions to mobility and so we will eventually have to depend on private companies that will come up with experimental solutions to getting people and goods around the city more easily.

Designer: Half Company

The Bulgaria-based designers for the transport design studio is proposing a city-wide transport system called Halfgrid. It involves individual person-sized capsules moving around the city through suspended cables and powered by artificial intelligence. Basically, you can get a person and whatever goods you want to be transported to your destination on a separate layer above ground in order to not add to the continuous road congestion on the ground.

The system uses static cables and the pods are the ones that will be moving along the tensioned steel ropeways. This also means that each of the capsule units can travel to different destinations unlike with the traditional cable car system where everyone still has to get into a vehicle together. Each pod will be able to hold just one person or a certain-sized package and can be programmed to get to where they need to get to.

Passengers will be able to program everything through the app and choose a pickup point and a destination. Basically, it’s like booking an Uber except you’ll be traveling in a capsule above ground. The same system can be used for goods deliveries. The entire system is also designed to be “practically silent” so it will not add to the noise pollution that usually comes with road congestion.

I’m not that fond of heights so this is something that might not work for someone like me. But it would really be interesting to see how such a system can work in a city like where I live in. Now the next step is to create a prototype and find a partner and a pilot city that would be willing to try the Halfgrid out.",artificial intelligence,yanko design

BRUSSELS, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Geopolitics such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to more damaging and widespread cybersecurity attacks in the year to July, EU cybersecurity agency ENISA said in its annual report on Thursday.

ENISA's study follows concerns about the role of state actors and the growing range of threats to governments, companies and essential sectors such as energy, transport, banking and digital infrastructure.

The agency said geopolitical situations - in particular the Russian invasion of Ukraine - were game-changers during the period under review.

Zero-day exploits in which hackers exploit software vulnerabilities before developers have a chance to fix the flaws, as well as artificial intelligence-enabled disinformation and deepfakes resulted in more malicious and widespread attacks with more damaging impact, it said.

""Today's global context is inevitably driving major changes in the cybersecurity threat landscape. The new paradigm is shaped by the growing range of threat actors,"" ENISA Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said in a statement.

About 24% of cybersecurity attacks targeted public administration and governments while 13% targeted digital services providers, the report said.

The European Union in May agreed on tougher cybersecurity rules for essential sectors, with companies required to assess their risks, notify authorities and take measures to deal with the risks or face fines up to 2% of global turnover.

SEOUL, Nov 4 (Reuters) - South Korea is seeking a three-year grace period on the U.S. Inflation Act in order to enable Korean automakers to keep receiving electric vehicle (EV) incentives in the United States, Seoul's foreign ministry said on Friday.

U.S. President Joe Biden sign into law in August a $430 billion bill, which among other measures, excludes Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and its affiliate Kia Corp (000270.KS) from federal tax credits because they don't yet make EVs in North America.

The foreign ministry said it had proposed that the United States offer federal EV tax credit for those companies with planned U.S investments.

In May, Hyundai Motor Group said it would invest more than $10 billion in the United States by 2025 to strengthen collaboration with U.S. firms in advanced technology, such as robotics, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence among other fields.

The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service started seeking public comment on the new law last month.

South Korea reiterated its position that the new law may violate trade norms such as the U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement and World Trade Organization agreements.

Hyundai Motor Group broke ground on a $5.54 billion EV and battery plant in the United States late last month, aiming to begin commercial production in the first half of 2025 with an annual capacity of 300,000 units.

The method is the result of an interdisciplinary research project at the University of Gothenburg.

Plankton are one of the most important organisms on Earth. More than half of all the world's oxygen is produced by phytoplankton in the oceans. Yet knowledge about these lifeforms is limited, mainly due to their size.

""Until now I had to study microplankton at the group level, but thanks to this new AI based holographic microscope I can see how individual microplanktons move, eat, grow and reproduce,"" says Erik Selander, marine biologist at the University of Gothenburg.

The only way to study microplankton at the individual level

Erik Selander heard Giovanni Volpe, Professor in Physics at the University, speak at a conference in 2019 about the new technique where light refracted through a particle creates a hologram that can be studied instead of the particle. Using AI, the holograms can be analysed at much higher speeds providing more and finer details. Selander and Volpe then started an interdisciplinary project that targeted microplankton.

""We have a good understanding of who eats who, and where they go in the case of larger organisms such as animals and birds that we see every day. The method we have developed is the only one that works to study microscopic organisms at the individual level,"" says Giovanni Volpe.

AI makes the method much faster

The method uses LED light to analyse microplankton in holographic microscopes and this ensures that the organisms remain unaffected during the process. This discovery has been reported in an article in the journal eLife.

""The microplankton cells we examine are only a few hundredths of a millimetre in size. But they are so numerous that they affect the entire carbon cycle of the ocean. In total, single cell microplankton take up about three times as much carbon as we humans emit from fossil fuels. Now we are able to get a detailed understanding of these processes at the individual level,"" says Erik Selander.

The method of recording light-matter interaction through digital cameras with the help of a holographic microscope has been well studied in the past. But thanks to digital technology and the recent AI revolution, this method has become far more useful and the analysis is easier and much faster.

""By combining holographic microscopy with AI, now we can simultaneously monitor what is happening with a large collection of microplankton cells at a single cell-level, which was a challenge before. Though the technique is demonstrated with marine microorganisms, it is quite universal in approach and can be applied to any microscopic lifeform. And by enclosing the cells in miniatured glass wells, we can follow the growth dynamics and swimming behaviours of cells, throughout their life cycle from hours to days,"" says Harshith Bachimanchi, doctoral student in physics at the University of Gothenburg.

Holographic microscopy also offers a fast and inexpensive method for counting, weighing and sizing cells, or other particles, in a solution.",artificial intelligence,science daily

Register here.

Traditional contract lifecycle management (CLM) tools focus on improving document workflows. However, Icertis seeks to take the field to the next level with contract intelligence that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automatically extract contract data at scale. These tools are designed to structure contracts’ commercial, legal and operational data and connect that data to procurement, ERP and human capital management apps to help companies accelerate revenue, reduce costs, improve risk management and ensure compliance.

When VentureBeat previously covered Icertis in 2019, the CLM market was expected to be worth $3.16 billion by 2023. However, contract intelligence connects contract data to other systems to drive a much larger market that MGI Research predicts will reach $30 billion by 2026.

“In this economic downturn, we believe contracts, which govern every dollar in and out of the enterprise, will emerge as the go-to asset because they are an untapped source of invaluable business value to reduce costs, manage risk, ensure compliance and drive revenue,” Icertis CEO and chairman Samir Bodas told VentureBeat. ”To help improve its position in the growing CLM market, Icertis today announced it has raised $150 million in funding from Silicon Valley Bank.

Rapid growth for Icertis

Icertis has quickly grown over the last couple of years and currently claims to manage over 10 million contracts worth more than $1 trillion in over 40 languages and 90 countries, according to the company. It has also formed over a dozen new partnerships, including one to make Icertis the CLM partner of choice for SAP. This partnership includes a joint engineering and product roadmap and deep integration into SAP Ariba, SAP Fieldglass, SAP S/4HANA and SAP SuccessFactors.

The company also launched AI Studio, a self-serve, self-learning cognitive tool that uses AI to generate contract intelligence for real-time insights and decision-making.

In 2021, Icertis launched a vertical CLM solution to make it easier to integrate contract data across partners. These vertical solutions come with various contract types, rules to identify obligations, bundled integrations, and workflow and reporting dashboards to support specific challenges for each industry.

Differentiating with better integration for CLM

Competitors include companies like DocuSign, Conga, Agiloft and Oracle. Bodas said Icertis differs from these competitors through efficiencies in contract creation and negotiation and its AI, ML and natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. This helps companies automate processes, maximize contract value and ensure compliance.

“This new funding will enable us to accelerate our business while others scale back,” Bodas said. “From a development perspective, we will double-down on creating AI and business applications that help customers realize the intent of their commercial agreements, adding to the long list of applications we already deliver, such as obligation management, rebate management, and supplier onboarding and diversity compliance.

”Tools such as Icertis’s demonstrate the value of using NLP to connect the dots between business applications and processes in various domains. For example, in the medical industry, John Snow Labs uses NLP to connect doctors’ notes, medical records, billing systems and research tools. In industries that rely on physical documents, NLP is helping to bridge the gap between text documents, digital twins and digital threads.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat
18,Could AI help you to write your next paper?,https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-022-03479-w/d41586-022-03479-w_23649508.jpg,31/10/2022,"Large language models can draft abstracts or suggest research directions, but these artificial-intelligence tools are a work in progress.",https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03479-w,"You know that text autocomplete function that makes your smartphone so convenient — and occasionally frustrating — to use? Well, now tools based on the same idea have progressed to the point that they are helping researchers to analyse and write scientific papers, generate code and brainstorm ideas.

The tools come from natural language processing (NLP), an area of artificial intelligence aimed at helping computers to ‘understand’ and even produce human-readable text. Called large language models (LLMs), these tools have evolved to become not only objects of study but also assistants in research.

LLMs are neural networks that have been trained on massive bodies of text to process and, in particular, generate language. OpenAI, a research laboratory in San Francisco, California, created the most well-known LLM, GPT-3, in 2020, by training a network to predict the next piece of text based on what came before. On Twitter and elsewhere, researchers have expressed amazement at its spookily human-like writing. And anyone can now use it, through the OpenAI programming interface, to generate text based on a prompt. (Prices start at about US$0.0004 per 750 words processed — a measure that combines reading the prompt and writing the response.)

“I think I use GPT-3 almost every day,” says computer scientist Hafsteinn Einarsson at the University of Iceland, Reykjavik. He uses it to generate feedback on the abstracts of his papers. In one example that Einarsson shared at a conference in June, some of the algorithm’s suggestions were useless, advising him to add information that was already included in his text. But others were more helpful, such as “make the research question more explicit at the beginning of the abstract”. It can be hard to see the flaws in your own manuscript, Einarsson says. “Either you have to sleep on it for two weeks, or you can have somebody else look at it. And that ‘somebody else’ can be GPT-3.”

Organized thinking

Some researchers use LLMs to generate paper titles or to make text more readable. Mina Lee, a doctoral student in computer science at Stanford University, California, gives GPT-3 prompts such as “using these keywords, generate the title of a paper”. To rewrite troublesome sections, she uses an AI-powered writing assistant called Wordtune by AI21 Labs in Tel Aviv, Israel. “I write a paragraph, and it’s basically like a doing brain dump,” she says. “I just click ‘Rewrite’ until I find a cleaner version I like.”

Artificial-intelligence tools aim to tame the coronavirus literature

Computer scientist Domenic Rosati at the technology start-up Scite in Brooklyn, New York, uses an LLM called Generate to organize his thinking. Developed by Cohere, an NLP firm in Toronto, Canada, Generate behaves much like GPT-3. “I put in notes, or just scribbles and thoughts, and I say ‘summarize this’, or ‘turn this into an abstract’,” Rosati says. “It’s really helpful for me as a synthesis tool.”

Language models can even help with experimental design. For one project, Einarsson was using the game Pictionary as a way to collect language data from participants. Given a description of the game, GPT-3 suggested game variations he could try. Theoretically, researchers could also ask for fresh takes on experimental protocols. As for Lee, she asked GPT-3 to brainstorm things to do when introducing her boyfriend to her parents. It suggested going to a restaurant by the beach.

Encoding coding

OpenAI researchers trained GPT-3 on a vast assortment of text, including books, news stories, Wikipedia entries and software code. Later, the team noticed that GPT-3 could complete pieces of code, just like it can with other text. The researchers created a fine-tuned version of the algorithm called Codex, training it on more than 150 gigabytes of text from the code-sharing platform GitHub1. GitHub has now integrated Codex into a service called Copilot that suggests code as people type.

Computer scientist Luca Soldaini at the Allen Institute for AI (also called AI2) in Seattle, Washington, says at least half their office uses Copilot. It works best for repetitive programming, Soldaini says, citing a project that involves writing boilerplate code to process PDFs. “It just blurts out something, and it’s like, ‘I hope this is what you want’.” Sometimes it’s not. As a result, Soldaini says they are careful to use Copilot only for languages and libraries with which they are familiar, so they can spot problems.

Literature searches

Perhaps the most established application of language models involves searching and summarizing literature. AI2’s Semantic Scholar search engine — which covers around 200 million papers, mostly from biomedicine and computer science — provides tweet-length descriptions of papers using a language model called TLDR (short for too long; didn’t read). TLDR is derived from an earlier model called BART, by researchers at the social media platform Facebook, that’s been fine-tuned on human-written summaries. (By today’s standards, TLDR is not a large language model, because it contains only about 400 million parameters. The largest version of GPT-3 contains 175 billion.)

tl;dr: this AI sums up research papers in a sentence

TLDR also appears in AI2’s Semantic Reader, an application that augments scientific papers. When a user clicks on an in-text citation in Semantic Reader, a box pops up with information that includes a TLDR summary. “The idea is to take artificial intelligence and put it right into the reading experience,” says Dan Weld, Semantic Scholar’s chief scientist.

When language models generate text summaries, often “there’s a problem with what people charitably call hallucination”, Weld says, “but is really the language model just completely making stuff up or lying.” TLDR does relatively well on tests of truthfulness2 — authors of papers TLDR was asked to describe rated its accuracy as 2.5 out of 3. Weld says this is partly because the summaries are only about 20 words long, and partly because the algorithm rejects summaries that introduce uncommon words that don’t appear in the full text.

In terms of search tools, Elicit debuted in 2021 from the machine-learning non-profit organization Ought in San Francisco, California. Ask Elicit a question, such as, “What are the effects of mindfulness on decision making?” and it outputs a table of ten papers. Users can ask the software to fill columns with content such as abstract summaries and metadata, as well as information about study participants, methodology and results. Elicit uses tools including GPT-3 to extract or generate this information from papers.

Joel Chan at the University of Maryland in College Park, who studies human–computer interactions, uses Elicit whenever he starts a project. “It works really well when I don’t know the right language to use to search,” he says. Neuroscientist Gustav Nilsonne at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, uses Elicit to find papers with data he can add to pooled analyses. The tool has suggested papers he hadn’t found in other searches, he says.

Evolving models

Prototypes at AI2 give a sense of the future for LLMs. Sometimes researchers have questions after reading a scientific abstract but don’t have the time to read the full paper. A team at AI2 developed a tool that can answer such questions, at least in the domain of NLP. It began by asking researchers to read the abstracts of NLP papers and then ask questions about them (such as “what five dialogue attributes were analysed?”). The team then asked other researchers to answer those questions after they had read the full papers3. AI2 trained a version of its Longformer language model — which can ingest a complete paper, not just the few hundred words that other models take in — on the resulting data set to generate answers to different questions about other papers4.

A model called ACCoRD can generate definitions and analogies for 150 scientific concepts related to NLP, whereas MS^2, a data set of 470,000 medical documents and 20,000 multi-document summaries, was used to fine-tune BART to allow researchers to take a question and a set of documents and generate a brief meta-analytical summary.

NatureTech hub

And then there are applications beyond text generation. In 2019, AI2 fine-tuned BERT, a language model created by Google in 2018, on Semantic Scholar papers to create SciBERT, which has 110 million parameters. Scite, which has used AI to create a scientific search engine, further fine-tuned SciBERT so that when its search engine lists papers citing a target paper, it categorizes them as supporting, contrasting or otherwise mentioning that paper. Rosati says that that nuance helps people to identify limitations or gaps in the literature.

AI2’s SPECTER model, also based on SciBERT, reduces papers to compact mathematical representations. Conference organizers use SPECTER to match submitted papers to peer reviewers, Weld says, and Semantic Scholar uses it to recommend papers based on a user’s library.

Computer scientist Tom Hope, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and AI2, says that other research projects at AI2 have fine-tuned language models to identify effective drug combinations, connections between genes and disease, and scientific challenges and directions in COVID-19 research.

But can language models allow deeper insight or even discovery? In May, Hope and Weld co-authored a review5 with Eric Horvitz, chief scientific officer at Microsoft, and others that lists challenges to achieving this, including teaching models to “[infer] the result of recombining two concepts”. “It’s one thing to generate a picture of a cat flying into space,” Hope says, referring to OpenAI’s DALL·E 2 image-generation model. But “how will we go from that to combining abstract, highly complicated scientific concepts?”

That’s an open question. But LLMs are already making a tangible impact on research. “At some point,” Einarsson says, “people will be missing out if they’re not using these large language models.”",artificial intelligence,nature.com

The former CEOs of MoviePass and its former parent company, Helios and Matheson Analytics (HMNY) — Ted Farnsworth and Mitch Lowe — have been charged in a securities fraud case, according to court documents.

Per a Department of Justice statement, the court documents allege that Farnsworth and Lowe ""engaged in a scheme to defraud investors through materially false and misleading representations relating to HMNY and MoviePass's business and operations to artificially inflate the price of HMNY's stock and attract new investors.""

The DOJ statement says:

""Farnsworth and Lowe are each charged with one count of securities fraud and three counts of wire fraud. If convicted, they each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each count.""

Farnsworth surrendered himself to authorities in Washington, DC, on Friday, his rep confirmed.

MoviePass. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider

Stacy Spikes founded MoviePass with Hamet Watt in 2011, creating a service that let moviegoers see a certain number of movies each month in theaters for a monthly fee. After struggling to stay afloat for years, the company in 2017 was bought by HMNY.

Under the leadership of Farnsworth and Lowe, the company launched a $9.95-a-month subscription that allowed people to see a movie a day. Within two days, subscriptions went from 20,000 to 100,000. In less than a year, MoviePass had over 3 million subscribers. However, the company also blew through hundreds of millions of dollars.

The indictment alleges Farnsworth and Lowe falsely claimed that MoviePass' $9.95 plan ""was tested, sustainable, and would be profitable or break even on subscription fees alone,"" while knowing it was a ""a temporary marketing gimmick to grow new subscribers and, in turn, artificially inflate HMNY's stock price and attract new investors,"" according to the DOJ statement.

Additionally, the indictment alleges that Farnsworth and Lowe made false claims that HMNY ""possessed and used technologies – like 'big data' and 'artificial intelligence' platforms – to generate revenue by analyzing and monetizing the data MoviePass collected from subscribers,"" the DOJ statement says.

The court documents allege Farnsworth and Lowe ""directed MoviePass employees to implement numerous tactics to prevent certain subscribers from using the purportedly 'unlimited' service for which they had paid to try to ease MoviePass's cash shortfalls,"" the DOJ statement says.

Per the DOJ statement, the indictment also alleges that Farnsworth and Lowe ""made these materially false and misleading representations in press releases, SEC filings, interviews on podcasts and on television, and in print and online media.""

""The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the public from being exploited by criminals for their personal profit,"" said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department's criminal division in a statement. ""As these charges make clear, the Department, together with our law enforcement partners, will hold corrupt C-Suite executives who engage in securities fraud accountable for their actions.""

""Attempted scams of this nature erode the public's faith in our financial markets,"" said Assistant Director in Charge Michael J. Driscoll of the FBI New York Field Office in a statement. ""The FBI is committed to ensuring these types of frauds and swindles are uncovered and the perpetrators are held responsible for their actions in the criminal justice system.""

""The indictment repeats the same allegations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Commission's recent complaint filed on September 27th against Mr. Farnsworth, concerning matters that were publicly disclosed nearly three years ago and widely reported by the news media,"" Chris Bond, spokesman for Farnsworth, told Insider in a statement. ""As with the SEC filing, Mr. Farnsworth is confident that the facts will demonstrate that he has acted in good faith, and his legal team intends to contest the allegations in the indictment until his vindication is achieved.""

Lowe's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HMNY was delisted from the Nasdaq in 2019 and both MoviePass and HMNY filed for bankruptcy in 2020. At the time of MoviePass' bankruptcy filing, the company said it was under pending investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, SEC, four California district attorneys, and the New York attorney general.

Last June, Farnsworth and Lowe settled with the FTC and reached a $400,000 settlement with the California district attorneys.

Register here.

In the ecommerce world, digital images are everything. A new platform is using artificial intelligence (AI) to give brands the ability to evaluate visual content “through the eyes” of their target audiences in real time.

Vizit, a provider of image analytics software for global brands and retailers, uses the organic interactions millions of consumers have with online commercial imagery to generate new AI-powered models of their visual preferences, called Vizit Audience Lenses. The goal is to ensure the images a brand uses for representing its products online are effective at capturing the desired audience’s attention and triggering sales conversions.

Vizit is the latest entrant in the crowded digital shelf space, which refers to wherever products are made visible and available for online purchase. This includes a brand’s own product pages, as well as third parties, social media outlets, banner and mobile ads, and Google.

The digital shelf is considered one of the most critical elements of ecommerce, and as brands look to cut costs, advanced predictive AI image analytics lets them quickly assess how an image will perform across different channels and better understand customer expectations.

Vizit today announced a $10 million series A round, led by Infinity Ventures and Brand Foundry Ventures, to grow its Visual Brand Performance Platform. The round also added new investors eGateway Capital and several CPG, retail, and technology executives, with participation from existing investors including Lakefront Partners and Lubar and Co., the company said.

How Vizit’s predictive image analytics works

Vizit founder and CEO Jehan Hamedi told VentureBeat that 99% of brand marketers and ecommerce leaders are probably not aware that they have a problem with their digital images.

“And many of them may be leaving millions of dollars on the table, as a result,’’ Hamedi added. “Just imagine a world before Google; businesses didn’t know what their search rankings were or how important the search-rank metric was to their digital success until it became available. Then an entirely new economy sprung up overnight to report on and optimize those metrics.”

This is the idea behind Vizit Scores, which are generated once users upload images to the Vizit platform, Hamedi said. The software automatically analyzes those images using AI models called AI Audience Lenses, which view and assess them for the intended audience.

The proprietary scores are generated in real time with automated and predictive image analytics through a web-based interface. The scores are designed to reveal which populations the image appeals to, what drives their preference, and where attention is garnered, he said.

For example, “Imagine you are a brand marketer, ecommerce leader, or designer at L’Oreal and you want to know if your product imagery and designs will be successful at attracting and converting a given audience,’’ such as millennial female consumers, Hamedi said. “You might also want to know what the visual trends are in your category, and what your competitors are doing that resonates with your target consumers.”

The Vizit platform aims to make this possible, he said.

“Customers use Vizit’s AI image analytics to assess the quality of their existing imagery to adjust and improve their imagery, and to select the images that have the highest performance potential with their target audience for new ecommerce, marketing and product development initiatives,” Hamedi said.

The goal is to deliver predictive insights about how consumers will react to content, how brands’ content performance compares to their competitors, and what design elements will capture a target audience’s attention, make products stand out on the digital shelf, and drive category-dominating levels of ecommerce conversion.

Brands finding success with Vizit’s AI platform

“Before Vizit, Mars never had a way to determine the imagery and design elements that contribute to conversion,” said Roman Vorobiev, global director of design and artwork management at Mars Inc., in a statement. “Vizit gives us an anchor point to measure how relevant and effective our images are for our audience, and we have proven that higher Vizit Scores on our content lead to up to 30% more units sold across major retailers.”

Mars is now reporting on its Vizit Scores in nearly a dozen countries, Vorobiev said.

Vizit has enterprise customers in 10 countries in a range of industries, including several of the top 10 largest food and beverage companies, the largest motorcycle manufacturer, and the largest cosmetics and beauty company in the world, according to the company.

“Every industry you can think of depends on successful visual communications and visual brand building,” said Brian Spaly, general partner at Brand Foundry Ventures and founder of Bonobos and Trunk Club, in a statement. “Vizit has forever changed the way products are merchandised, market research is conducted, campaigns are created, new products are conceived, and brands are built.”

Hamedi said that with the series A funding, Vizit will continue to invest in expanding the platform’s capabilities to serve its Fortune 100 customers and grow Vizit’s international presence.

Getting seen on the digital shelf

For companies like Vizit to gain traction in the digital shelf arena, they will need to provide a better online shopping experience than their competitors by understanding customer needs and optimizing their pages accordingly, according to web analytics firm Similarweb in a blog post.

There are several ways to do this, including investing in SEO for improved visibility, focusing on the right digital shelf metrics and enhancing visual content.

“You could have a great brand and fantastic products, but those two things alone won’t guarantee that you’ll conquer the digital shelf in 2022,’’ Similarweb said. It requires “a strategy that directly addresses digital shopper behavior and the idiosyncrasies of discovery in the digital shopping space.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat
22,How code-generating AI (code LLMs) is creating new challenges as it matures,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1147087236-e1667580334849.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,04/11/2022,"As code LLMs mature, we’re beginning to discover the challenges they must overcome, including licensing, transparency, security and control.",https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-code-generating-ai-code-llms-is-creating-new-challenges-as-it-matures/,"Join us on November 9 to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit. Register here.

A little over a year ago, using large language models (LLMs) to generate software code was a cutting-edge scientific experiment that had yet to prove its worth. But while code generation has become one of the most successful applications of LLMs, BigCode, launched recently by Hugging Face and ServiceNow, has strived to address some of code-generating LLMs biggest pain points.

Today, many developers are using LLM-powered tools such as GitHub Copilot to improve productivity, stay in the flow and make their work more enjoyable. However, as LLM-powered coding matures, we’re also beginning to discover the challenges it must overcome, including licensing, transparency, security and control.

The Stack, a dataset of source code recently released by the BigCode project, addresses some of these pain points. It also highlights some of the known barriers that remain to be resolved as artificial intelligence (AI)-powered code generation continues to move into the mainstream.

LLMs and code license

“The recent introduction of code LLMs has shown that they can make developers more productive and make software engineering accessible to people with less technical backgrounds,” Leandro von Werra, machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, told VentureBeat.

Event Low-Code/No-Code Summit Learn how to build, scale, and govern low-code programs in a straightforward way that creates success for all this November 9. Register for your free pass today. Register Here

These language models can serve a variety of tasks. Programmers are using tools such as Copilot and Codex to write entire classes and functions from textual descriptions. This can be very useful for automating mundane parts of programming, such as setting up web servers, pulling information from databases or even writing Python code for a neural network and its training loop. According to von Werra, in the future, software engineers will be able to use LLMs to maintain legacy code written in an unfamiliar programming language.

However, the growing use of LLMs in coding has raised several concerns, including licensing issues. Models like Copilot generate code based on patterns they have learned from their training examples, some of which might be subject to restrictive licenses.

“Questions have been raised as to whether these AI models respect current open-source licenses—both for model training and generation—and what the social impact of this technology is on the open-source software community,” von Werra said.

Even when open-source licenses legally permit the use of a code repository, these licenses were developed before modern deep learning and the collection of large datasets for training models. Therefore, the developers might not have intended for their code to be used in training language models.

“The issues of consent and intent around the use of peoples’ code to train deep neural networks are not addressed in current open-source licenses; the community still has to develop norms around how to responsibly develop this technology, respecting the wishes of developers for modern use of their content,” von Werra said.

Hugging Face and ServiceNow release collaborative project

The BigCode project is a collaboration between Hugging Face and ServiceNow, announced in September. The Stack, which was released on October 27, comprises 3 TB of “permissively licensed source code” obtained from GitHub, assembled for training large language models for code generation.

Permissive licenses are those that have the least restrictions on copying, modifying and redistributing the code, which includes the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses. It does not include “copyleft” licenses such as GPL, which require that the same rights be preserved in code that is derived from the original repository. There are currently controversies and disagreements surrounding whether models trained on copyleft licenses are considered derivative work.

Limiting the dataset to permissively licensed code will make sure it can be used for different applications.

“The goal of The Stack is to enable researchers from academia and industries to collaborate on research and development of large language models for code applications by releasing a dataset that can be shared, investigated and used to pretrain new systems,” von Werra said.

BigCode is also taking measures to provide developers with more control over their code. Developers can explicitly opt out from having their repository included in The Stack and used to train LLMs, regardless of the license they initially chose.

“In order to honor these opt-out requests, developers that wish to opt-out can submit a request and, once validated, their code will be removed from future versions of The Stack,” von Werra said.

Promoting openness in code LLMs

One of the challenges facing researchers working on code LLMs is the lack of openness and transparency around the development of these systems. Models such as AlphaCode, CodeParrot and CodeGen have only described the high-level data collection process but did not release the training data.

“It is difficult for other researchers to fully reproduce these models and understand what kind of pretraining data leads to high-performing code LLMs,” von Werra said. “By releasing an open large-scale code dataset, we hope to make training of code LLMs more reproducible.”

In addition to providing an unprecedented 3 TB of curated source code, the BigCode team has provided a detailed breakdown of how the code was obtained and filtered. The dataset was gathered over several months. The team downloaded 137.36 million publicly available GitHub repositories. It then filtered the dataset to exclude repositories that did not have permissive licenses. Finally, it went through a deduplication process to remove files that were exact or near duplicates of others.

“An open dataset benefits from external scrutiny, with BigCode providing a way for other researchers and developers to report issues directly to the team managing the dataset,” von Werra said.

Hugging Face and ServiceNow tackle remaining challenges

Licensing is not the only challenge that code LLMs face. The engineers of the models and the curators of the datasets must also address other problems such as removing sensitive information, including usernames, passwords and security tokens.

Another concern is insecure code. Since LLMs are trained on source code curated from public sources, there is worry that the training dataset might include insecure code. Alternatively, malicious actors can poison the training data by intentionally spreading insecure code in open repositories. The LLM will then learn the insecure coding patterns and replicate them in response to developer prompts.

The open-source format of The Stack will allow security researchers to scrutinize the dataset for insecure code. Additionally, the BigCode team has implemented update mechanisms that take advantage of new information, such as the disclosure of vulnerabilities, and evolving best practices to limit the spread of malicious code in The Stack. The team is also developing methods to filter personally identifiable information (PII).

Moreover, the team is working on a special license dedicated to code LLMs named OpenRAIL (Responsible AI License).

“The OpenRAIL license is an open-source license similar to Apache 2.0, but also includes provisions to prohibit certain use cases that could, for example, exclude the generation of malware,” von Werra said. “In addition, we are also working on a tool to search generated code inside The Stack for correct license attribution.”

The future of code LLMs

LLMs will be able to both extend the abilities of professional software engineers and enable non-technical people to build new software. But that will only happen if the community can establish a new set of sustainable rules and best practices around licensing and attribution, von Werra warned. He also believes that automation does not mean that human skills will become less relevant in coding.

“There will need to be a lot more internal governance in place at organizations that adopt the technology,” von Werra said. “The role of the human-in-the-loop in the AI value chain will become more important to ensure that generated code is fit for purpose and compliant with corporate policy and broader AI regulation.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Hay River Regional Health Centre is the third site that received the new technology at the end of October.

The new endoscopy equipment for cancer screening was purchased through the Department of Health and Social Service (DHSS)’s medical equipment evergreening program, which replaces old equipment with new on a planned cycle.

The new equipment is the latest technology from Fujifilm that was selected through a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process. It includes:

High definition (HD) flexible scopes (colonoscopes and gastroscopes) that provide high resolution images, are easier to grip and control (or ‘drive’) by the physician performing the exam and maneuver more easily through the body than previous generation technology

More light modes for imaging including white light, blue light and linked colour imaging that improve visualization of areas of concern, such as polyps, during colonoscopies

‘CADEYE’ artificial intelligence (AI) software that enhances polyp detection and characterization during colonoscopies

Additional loaner scopes that are typically sent from the vendor when a scope requires repair are now being housed ‘on site’ at Stanton Territorial Hospital as part of this evergreening project. They can be used in any of the territory’s three facilities with endoscopy clinics when a scope needs repair, to minimize equipment disruptions to the endoscopy service in the future.

Lee Van Ruskenveld from the Inuvik Regional Hospital says, “Having high-quality endoscopes is a large factor for the people of the Northwest Territories to receive quality, competent care.”",artificial intelligence,nthssa.ca

IBM’s recently released 2022 AI Adoption Index, for example, reports that the AI adoption rate is around 35% — up four percentage points from one year ago. It also found that despite increasing adoption rates, 74% of companies admit they haven’t taken any steps to actually make sure their AI is responsible and bias-free.

The question is, why not?

Navrina Singh, CEO and founder of the Palo Alto-based Credo AI, which announced what it claims is the first responsible AI governance platform in October 2021, says it’s because companies are burnt out with the way conversation happens around the topic of responsible AI — and getting more people on board begins with changing the conversation surrounding it. While definitions of responsible AI vary, Accenture describes it as, “the practice of designing, developing and deploying AI with good intention to empower employees and businesses, and fairly impact customers and society — allowing companies to engender trust and scale AI with confidence.”

“I think it’s really talking about the [return on investment] ROI of responsible AI — the ROI of RAI,” she said. “Enterprises are not focusing on the positive aspects — or the ROI of it. I think we need to change the conversation from one of the soft metrics to actual ROI of trust and actual ROI of responsible AI.” Secondly, she added, organizations need to be shown a pathway to [the] implementation of responsible AI.

Balancing risk and trust with governance

Just as humans have a psychological fight or flight instinct, Singh explained that she has noticed a similar phenomenon happening with enterprise adoption of AI — one of balancing risk and trust.

“When I think about AI, it is literally risk or trust, she said, adding that right now company leaders emphasize just getting by on compliance so they are not on anyone’s risk radar.

“I think that is a very dangerous mentality for enterprises to own, especially as they’re bringing more and more machine learning into their operations,” she said. “What my ask of this community is to sort of take a bet on themselves and on artificial intelligence so that they can understand what trust by design can bring to their organizations.”

Singh is part of the National AI Advisory Committee (NAIAC) that advises President Biden on upcoming regulations and policies. She founded Credo AI in early 2020 when she noticed while working on AI products for Qualcomm and Microsoft that conversations around governance were often happening too late in the game.

“I think there’s a misplaced notion that if you are adding those governance compliance risk checks earlier in the game, that is just going to slow down our technology,” she said. “What we started to see was there was actually an added benefit — one where not only were the systems performing better, but these systems were building trust at scale.”

Under the hood

Credo AI has two offerings: One is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) tool for the cloud that works with AWS and Azure. Another is on-premises for more regulated industries. The platform sits on top of an enterprise’s machine learning (ML) infrastructure and has three main components:

Setting requirements: It pulls in requirements to set a framework for the tool to use as guidelines. This can include any regulation, like New York’s upcoming AI law or company values or policies.

Technical assessment: Next, the tool performs a technical assessment against these guidelines. The open-source assessment framework, called Credo Lens, and interrogates your company’s models and datasets against the guidelines to see what matches and where there may be pitfalls. Professionals responsible for the AI then must provide evidence against this.

Generating governance artifacts: After the technical assessments are performed on a company’s models, processes and datasets according to any regulations and outlined parameters set, Credo AI then creates reports, audits and documentation for transparency to be easily shared among stakeholders.

Singh claims that companies that have adopted Credo AI as a tool have reported success in bridging the gap between technical and business stakeholders, while also visualizing risks in a more tangible and actionable way.

Credo AI is also seeing some action. In May, the company raised $12.8 million in a series A round. Its total funding to date currently sits at $18.3 million, according to Crunchbase.

Building an ecosystem of responsible AI

One tool isn’t going to solve the world’s responsible AI dilemma, but focusing on developing an ecosystem of responsible AI might be the place to start, Singh said. This was also a key point throughout its Global Responsible AI Summit, held for the first time ever last week.

Overwhelmingly, the event’s sessions underscored that an ecosystem of responsible AI has to include multiple stakeholders and angles because it is “more than just a product at play,” according to Singh.

Unlike previous technological revolutions, artificial intelligence is truly different, she explained.

“It is going to impact everything you and I have seen, as well as our beliefs and understanding,” she said. “We should not be calling out the word ‘responsible,’ but right now, we are in a moment in time where it needs to be called out. But, it needs to become a fabric of not only design, development and communication, but also of how we serve our consumers.”

Developing an ecosystem of responsibility around AI isn’t easy from the ground up., Although tools can help, experts like say it starts with leadership.

As an article from McKinsey, analysts Roger Burkhardt, Nicolas Hohn and Chris Wigley write, the “CEO’s role is vital to the consistent delivery of responsible AI systems and that the CEO needs to have at least a strong working knowledge of AI development to ensure he or she is asking the right questions to prevent potential ethical issues.”

Singh concurred, pointing out that as the economy flips toward a possible recession, C-suite leadership and education of AI will become increasingly vital for the enterprise as companies look to automate and reduce costs where they can.

“There needs to be an incentive alignment that the C-suite needs to push down between the technical stakeholders and the governance and risk teams to make sure that as more artificial intelligence is getting deployed,” Singh said. “They need to ensure that incentives exist for technical teams to build responsibly and incentives exist for compliance and governance teams, to not only manage risk but to build trust — which, by the way, is going to be the underpinning of the next wave after recession for these companies to thrive in.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

New York-based mParticle, which offers an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven real-time customer data platform (CDP), today announced the expansion of its core product with a new Warehouse Sync capability.

The feature, as the company explained, allows enterprises to directly ingest customer data from their data warehouse instance, enabling data teams to save costs and time associated with gathering and utilizing the information for personalization and use cases. Right now, the capability is only available for the Snowflake data cloud. Other data platforms, including Google BigQuery, Amazon RedShift and Microsoft Azure, will be supported at a later stage, it said.

How will this change benefit enterprises?

Since its launch in 2013, mParticle’s CDP has been providing enterprises with a single view of the customer with relevant insights and predictions to customize their marketing, product or customer experience strategies. The solution collects data from different channels in real time, puts it into a useful form, and then connects it to relevant marketing or sales solutions to bring that information into use.

Until now, the ingestion phase of the solution depended on a third-party integration. Essentially, in order to sync events and user attributes or migrate historical customer data from a warehouse and query it, users had to use the Hightouch platform.

Now, the company is changing that, enabling traditional reverse-ETL flows from data warehouses while providing a complete data infrastructure to support enterprises as the business grows. It directly unlocks valuable customer data in data warehouses, making it immediately available across more than 300 real-time marketing and customer engagement APIs.

“The cloud data warehouse is an important source of rich customer data which teams need to incorporate into their data strategies,” said Michael Katz, CEO and cofounder of mParticle. “The customer data stack and the data engineering stack are beginning to converge, which, we believe, will unlock new opportunities for teams of all sizes, and we’re excited to expand our offering with this latest feature.”

The growth story of mParticle customer data platform

Earlier this year, mParticle launched Journeys, a toolkit to gather data from across the customer lifecycle and combine journey analysis, testing and orchestration into a single automated workflow.

Meanwhile, in August, it announced the acquisition of Vidora, which offers a platform to help brands predict future user behavior using customer data and leverage those insights in their marketing tools to take action.

Its latest announcement builds on its momentum to grow the capabilities of its platform.

mParticle works with giants such as NBCUniversal, Burger King, Overstock, JetBlue, Venmo and Airbnb. The company has raised nearly $300 million in total funding, according to Crunchbase.

In addition to the company’s growth, its market sector is also on the rise. Fortune Business Insights predicts that the global customer data platform market will grow from $1.42 billion in 2022 to $6.94 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate of over 25%.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Can artificial intelligence (AI) and the power of technology bring order and higher returns to the world of investing? Arta Finance, a startup launched by Google veterans, believes it can. Its system, which is a mixture of a concierge service and an active fund manager, launched this week from a private beta, opening its doors a bit wider for accredited investors from the United States.

The short pitch is that it wants to bring the power of a “family office” to a wider audience. Some of the super-rich people, like the Silicon Valley founders of the most successful companies, maintain a small office to manage their money and households. The term “family office” refers to a small group of advisors who handle financial matters like optimizing investments, managing philanthropy and acquiring real estate, all while ensuring that their wealthy client complies with tax laws and other regulations.

Arta hopes to bring this same type of expertise and assurance to those who aren’t able to afford a small army of advisors. The company is building a digital platform that will offer the same kind of smart guidance as a team of people, but at a scale that can help those who can’t afford to hire personal assistants.

Investing with Google veterans

“We have eight cofounders who were at Google a pretty long time where we worked together and built multiple consumer products over the years,” said Caesar Sengupta, cofounder and CEO.

Arta’s platform aims to bundle this kind of social connectivity common in Google products with better access to the financial markets and investor expertise. The company’s pitch says that users will get “savvier together.”

The social aspect, though, is only the frosting on the cake. Arta believes that it can offer better opportunities that generate better returns. Users will get easier access to alternative investments like private equity that are generally only open to accredited investors who meet tight criteria. It’s also offering access to private funds investing in venture capital, private debt and real estate — several classes that aren’t normally available.

AI-managed portfolios

One of the more novel options will be what they call AMPs, short for “AI-managed portfolios.” These tools will be able to personalize the stocks, bonds and other instruments by choosing a collection of investments that match a user’s personal need for risk and return.

“Our system is automated,” said Sengupta. “So it’s not just going to make recommendations. As a member, you are actually asking the system to do the trades for you. It’s a fully managed discretionary account.”

Arta believes that their AIs will bring a measure of discipline and science to the process. They’ll be able to apply careful analysis to what is ultimately a set of business decisions.

“A lot of this is actually hard mathematics,” said Sengupta. “We’re kind of big believers in numbers and mathematics rather than emotions. Human beings tend to get very attached to emotions.”

The automation, though, may have other more basic advantages. The scale could allow Arta to keep fees lower. The company didn’t disclose the exact fees in a briefing, saying only that they were still finalizing them. They did say that they were committed to keeping them lower, closer to, say, a passive index fund than an actively managed hedge fund, which often asks for 2% of total portfolio and 20% of any gains. They also want the formula to track their performance and not rely upon commissions on trading or custodial fees.

Right now, Arta is testing their product internally and with a group of 140 angel investors drawn from around Silicon Valley and the greater business community. Shailendra Singh, a managing director at Sequoia Capital India, for instance, is supporting the project because investors need “a more user-centric approach, a more delightful user experience and a more seamless and scalable platform than likely exists today.”

Eric Schmidt, cofounder of Schmidt Futures and former CEO and chairman of Google, is also investing because, as he describes in a press statement, the combination of AI and advanced financial strategies is a “step-function change.” In other words, a potential game changer.

While the company was in stealth mode, it raised more than $90 million to support building out the platform that’s being revealed today. It is opening up access to accredited investors in the United States. Residents of other countries can join a waiting list as Arta plans to offer the services to others throughout the world when regulations permit.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

At Nvidia’s Speech AI Summit today, the company discussed its new speech artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, which it developed through a partnership with Mozilla Common Voice. The ecosystem focuses on developing crowdsourced multilingual speech corpuses and open-source pretrained models. Nvidia and Mozilla Common Voice aim to accelerate the growth of automatic speech recognition models that work universally for every language speaker worldwide.

Nvidia found that standard voice assistants, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home, support fewer than 1% of the world’s spoken languages. To solve this problem, the company aims to improve linguistic inclusion in speech AI and expand the availability of speech data for global and low-resourced languages.

Nvidia is joining a race that both Meta and Google are already running: Recently, both companies released speech AI models to aid communication among people who speak different languages. Google’s speech-to-speech AI translation model, Translation Hub, can translate a large volume of documents into many different languages. Google also just announced it is building a universal speech translator, trained on over 400 languages, with the claim that it is the “largest language model coverage seen in a speech model today.”

At the same time, Meta AI’s universal speech translator (UST) project helps create AI systems that enable real-time speech-to-speech translation across all languages, even those that are spoken but not commonly written.

An ecosystem for global language users

According to Nvidia, linguistic inclusion for speech AI has comprehensive data health benefits, such as helping AI models understand speaker diversity and a spectrum of noise profiles. The new speech AI ecosystem helps developers build, maintain and improve the speech AI models and datasets for linguistic inclusion, usability and experience. Users can train their models on Mozilla Common Voice datasets, and then offer those pretrained models as high-quality automatic speech recognition architectures. Then, other organizations and individuals across the globe can adapt and use those architectures for building their speech AI applications.

“Demographic diversity is key to capturing language diversity,” said Caroline de Brito Gottlieb, product manager at Nvidia. “There are several vital factors impacting speech variation, such as underserved dialects, sociolects, pidgins and accents. Through this partnership, we aim to create a dataset ecosystem that helps communities build speech datasets and models for any language or context.”

The Mozilla Common Voice platform currently supports 100 languages, with 24,000 hours of speech data available from 500,000 contributors worldwide. The latest version of the Common Voice dataset also features six new languages — Tigre, Taiwanese (Minnan), Meadow Mari, Bengali, Toki Pona and Cantonese, as well as more speech data from female speakers.

Through the Mozilla Common Voice platform, users can donate their audio datasets by recording sentences as short voice clips, which Mozilla validates to ensure dataset quality upon submission.

“The speech AI ecosystem extensively focuses on not only the diversity of languages, but also on accents and noise profiles that different language speakers across the globe have,” Siddharth Sharma, head of product marketing, AI and deep learning at Nvidia, told VentureBeat. “This has been our unique focus at Nvidia and we created a solution that can be customized for every aspect of the speech AI model pipeline.”

Nvidia’s current speech AI implementations

The company is developing speech AI for several use cases, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), artificial speech translation (AST) and text-to-speech. Nvidia Riva, part of the Nvidia AI platform, provides state-of-the-art GPU-optimized workflows for building and deploying fully customizable, real-time AI pipelines for applications like contact center agent assists, virtual assistants, digital avatars, brand voices, and video conferencing transcription. Applications developed through Riva can be deployed across all cloud types and data centers, at the edge, or on embedded devices.

NCS, a multinational company and a transportation technology partner of the Singapore government, customized Nvidia’s Riva FastPitch model and built its own text-to-speech engine for English-Singapore using local speakers’ voice data. NCS recently designed Breeze, a local driver’s app that translates languages including Mandarin, Hokkien, Malay and Tamil into Singaporean English with the same clarity and expressiveness as a native Singaporean would speak them.

Mobile communication conglomerate T-Mobile also partnered with Nvidia to develop AI-based software for its customer experience centers that transcribes real-time customer conversations and recommends solutions to thousands working on the front line. To create the software, T-Mobile utilized Nvidia NeMo, an open-source framework for state-of-the-art conversational AI models, alongside Riva. These Nvidia tools enabled T-Mobile engineers to fine-tune ASR models on T-Mobile’s custom datasets and interpret customer jargon accurately across noisy environments.

Nvidia’s future focus on speech AI

Sharma says that Nvidia aims to inculcate current developments of AST and next-gen speech AI into real-time metaverse use cases.

“Today, we’re limited to only offering slow translation from one language to the other, and those translations have to go through text,” he said. “But the future is where you can have people in the metaverse across so many different languages all being able to have instant translation with each other,” he said.

“The next step,” he added, “is developing systems that will enable fluid interactions with people across the globe through speech recognition for all languages and real-time text-to-speech.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat
30,"At AT&T, AI is becoming part of “core fabric,” says chief data officer",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1195517526.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,31/10/2022,"Andy Markus, AT&T's chief data officer, discusses AT&T’s vision to “integrate data & AI into the core fabric of how we run the business.""",https://venturebeat.com/ai/at-att-ai-is-becoming-part-of-core-fabric-says-chief-data-officer/,"Join us on November 9 to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit. Register here.

One year ago, AT&T, the world’s largest telecom company by revenue, announced a collaboration with AI cloud company H2O to jointly launch an artificial intelligence (AI) feature store for enterprises. This paid software platform enables data scientists, developers and engineers to discover, share and reuse machine learning (ML) features to speed up their AI project deployments.

Since then, the feature store has become a key part of AT&T’s vision of scaling its own AI efforts across the organization, and to “truly integrate data and AI into the core fabric of how we run the business,” Andy Markus, AT&T’s chief data officer, told VentureBeat.

Markus, who joined AT&T in February 2020 after nearly two decades in roles at media companies such as Turner and Warner Media, said the company carries more than 543.7 petabytes of data across its global network. To manage AT&T’s data and AI at this level of scale, it has defined a common approach on how data is stored, managed, accessed and shared across the company.

AT&T’s ‘North Star’ for data and AI

The company relies on its Chief Data Office (CDO), he said, to set AT&T’s “North Star for data, analytics, and AI excellence.” Its mission is to harness, share and catalyze insights from the company’s massive data stores and to transform and modernize AT&T’s data platforms, data supply chain and data science ecosystem.

Event Low-Code/No-Code Summit Learn how to build, scale, and govern low-code programs in a straightforward way that creates success for all this November 9. Register for your free pass today. Register Here

Along with the feature store, the CDO uses a centralized data intelligence platform that provides a “single version of truth” for each defined data product, which empowers business managers as well as data scientists with self-serve access to datasets.

“There’s been a really big focus to standardize on best-in-class tools that are cloud based,” he said. “We’re using state-of-the-art technologies like H2O, Databricks and Snowflake to deliver value to the customer and to our data science community.”

Responsible AI is also a big focus, he added. AT&T created a technology called SIFT, the System for the Integration of Fairness and Transparency in AI, and rolled it out across the company, so that all models get evaluated for potential bias. “The process not only detects the bias, but it will take the user through mitigation steps,” he said.

Modernizing AT&T’s data and AI stack

Several years ago, AT&T’s data science efforts were “a bit of the Wild West,” said Markus.

“We had a lot of different types of technologies, a fairly disparate ecosystem of data scientists,” he explained. “Now we have a very connected data science community, everybody is working consistently with the same cutting-edge tools, and that we’re really maximizing the reuse of our data at our feature store.”

Not unlike many legacy companies, AT&T also has had to deal with a lot of legacy tech debt, he added.

“We had pockets of greatness, some really smart people are doing some really good things, but with a non-standard technology, there were results that weren’t shared, features that weren’t reusable,” he explained.

Over the past two years, the company has been modernizing to a cloud-native elastic technology. This last year included an evaluation of the state of AI across AT&T, he added, which found that AI efforts have delivered billions of dollars of value on an annual basis to the company – everything from revenue enhancement to cost savings and efficiency processing.

“We’ve brought the competency of the company up several notches by not only working with those groups that are already doing well, but bringing other parts of the company up so that they can really come to the table and leverage the great ML and AI functionality that we’ve created,” Markus said.

AI-driven decisioning is table stakes in telecom

These days, AI-driven automation and decisioning has become table stakes for running an efficient business in the complex and cost intensive operating world of telecom – powering everything from optimized network planning, customer care and field services to protecting customers and networks.

“The pace is continually accelerating as technology becomes more proficient at solving complex problems at the scale of AT&T and the demands of the business and our customers increase,” he said.

While the table stakes use cases may be solved, he added, the company is now focused on next-generation challenges that continue to build on the value already created with AI.

“Tackling the more complicated issues, both from an AI and business operations perspective, come with a steeper curve, such as developing AI-driven products and services and creating self-healing 5G networks,” he said.

Democratizing the ability to create AI

In addition to the CDO’s feature store and centralized data platform, Markus explained that AT&T is working to democratize the ability to create AI.

“We have a standard code-driven process for creating AI, built for the data science community,” he said. “Now we’re working to make that low-code, no-code, so that we can really democratize the ability to create AI not just to the data science community but other subject matter experts across the company.”

If AT&T’s number one goal is to embed AI in the “core fabric” of how the company runs its business, Markus said the second is to expand on the functionality of AI-as-a-service.

“We want to take that code-driven process and continue to advance it to what we call the citizen data scientist,” he said. “Those are the subject matter experts in the business that can create AI for their use cases, using responsible and ethical AI, and really drive more value for the company.”

AT&T uses AI to solve business problems

That goes to what Markus said is one of his team’s core tenets – understanding the business problem, and then getting the right data in place.

“We’re using technology to solve business problems,” he said. “We’re not doing technology for the sake of technology – so it all starts with understanding what the issue is, how that creates a challenge for the business, so it almost starts in a consultative fashion.”

In a recent blog post, Markus highlighted several of AT&T’s most powerful AI use cases. They include using predictive AI models to avoid network outages by powering an end-to-end incident management platform that scans more than 52 million different network records, devices and customer circuits, and over 1.2 trillion daily network alerts.

Another AI-driven solution using sampling, predictive modeling and multivariate analysis blocks nuisance robocalls by filtering through billions of daily records looking for patterns and suspicious qualities.

And an AI-based fraud management tool evaluates millions of daily transactions, inspecting events within milliseconds against hundreds of rules – and includes an interface that allows front-line fraud team members to write, test and deploy rules themselves.

Standardizing skill sets on data science teams

When it comes to building successful teams, Markus said the first thing he did when he arrived at AT&T was to create a standardized definition of what a data scientist is.

“Things blur over time and we just weren’t really consistent,” he said.

In addition, data scientists often work and collaborate with the business. “Now that we’re using common technology and data like the AI feature store, we can democratize that,” he said. That means people that are subject matter experts in fraud or network or customer care have a connection to the data science community in that part of the business.

“I would almost call it a federated way to organize, in a very connected fashion,” he said. “So we’re not duplicating work, we’re not duplicating data, we’re working together to solve more problems.”

The last big push toward data modernization

Markus said he thinks about his role in terms of wearing different hats. He wears three hats at AT&T, he explained – and he’s trying to get rid of all of them.

One hat is about making sure that data and AI are used to deliver meaningful and significant value to AT&T. The second is about ensuring that data and AI are first-class assets of the company. And the third is modernizing the company’s data and AI ecosystem.

“2023 is the last big push towards that,” he said. “We’ll have the bulk of our technology in a new modern environment with an updated set of tools.”

And then, he said, “Hopefully we can retire that hat.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Register here.

Following the pandemic, digitalization accelerated and enterprises started investing aggressively in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to improve their business processes and drive efficiencies. However, when it comes to building an AI project, a company needs to have plenty of well-annotated data to work with. This labeled information is what the system uses to learn, identify patterns and eventually make predictions needed by the end user.

Now, the thing is, data hardly comes annotated by default. It has to be labeled, which can take significant time and resources. In fact, organizations relying on manual data labeling companies can end up spending between hundreds of thousands to upwards of millions of dollars every month just to have their data ready for an AI/ML (machine learning) project.

Enter Dataloop

To address this challenge, Israeli startup Dataloop provides enterprises with an end-to-end platform that covers the entire unstructured data management life cycle for AI projects, starting from data labeling, automating dataops and deploying production pipelines to weaving the human-in-the-loop. The company today announced it has raised $33 million in a series B round of funding, led by NGP Capital and Alpha Wave Ventures.

“The Dataloop platform helps businesses of any size to move their AI project into production, from start to finish. We are working to break through the limitations of AI development and create efficient workflows, easy-to-use management systems and accurate annotation tools, so teams of all industries can use them,” Eran Shlomo, CEO at Dataloop, said.

The company, founded in 2017, first launched annotation capabilities and later expanded to other data management and prep aspects, allowing enterprises to close their data loops faster and shorten the time-to-market for a high-quality AI application.

“Dataloop has pinpointed a large obstacle in an important and fast-growing market. Most companies these days have a dedicated team working on data management and AI integrations, and they all face the same challenges,” Christian Noske, partner at NGP Capital, said. “Dataloop has built a great platform that will have a significant impact on the AI production industry as a whole. We look forward to working with the Dataloop team to drive forward further global expansion.”

Since its launch, the company has raised a total of $50M (including this round) and roped in customers such as Intel, Toyota, LinkedIn, and Vimeo. It claims to have seen adoption across industries like retail, agriculture, robotics, autonomous vehicles and construction.

Growing competition in data management and prep

Given that data prep has become such a major component of AI development, multiple platforms and tools have come up to address the challenges organizations face while labeling their datasets. The biggest names in the category are Scale AI and Labelbox, but smaller players like Tasq.ai, SuperAnnotate and Datasaur are also looking to accelerate their roles in the market.

With this round of funding, Dataloop also plans to build its footprint. The company said it will expand the Dataloop platform globally and build teams in the U.S., Europe and India.

According to Research and Markets, the global data annotation market is projected to grow from $695.5 million in 2019 to $6.45 billion by 2027.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

We revealed that the redox cofactor preference of malic enzymes can be strikingly converted by applying phylogenetic analysis to machine learning, without experimental screening. This method can predict mutation positions and candidate amino acids that affect substrate specificity, which is challenging to infer solely from the crystal structures. Machine learning uses the structurally homologous but functionally distinct enzymes’ amino acid sequences as input datasets to efficiently navigate toward the target function, and potentially provide new fundamental insights into enzyme–substrate specificity.

You can't move a pharmaceutical scientist from a lab to a kitchen and expect the same research output. Enzymes behave exactly the same: They are dependent upon a specific environment. But now, in a study recently published in ACS Synthetic Biology, researchers from Osaka University have imparted an analogous level of adaptability to enzymes, a goal that has remained elusive for over 30 years.

Enzymes perform impressive functions, enabled by the unique arrangement of their constituent amino acids, but usually only within a specific cellular environment. When you change the cellular environment, the enzyme rarely functions well—if at all. Thus, a long-standing research goal has been to retain or even improve upon the function of enzymes in different environments; for example, conditions that are favorable for biofuel production. Traditionally, such work has involved extensive experimental trial-and-error that might have little assurance of achieving an optimal result.

Artificial intelligence (a computer-based tool) can minimize this trial-and-error, but still relies on experimentally obtained crystal structures of enzymes—which can be unavailable or not especially useful. Thus, ""the pertinent amino acids one should mutate in the enzyme might be only best-guesses,"" says Teppei Niide, co-senior author. ""To solve this problem, we devised a methodology of ranking amino acids that depends only on the widely available amino acid sequence of analogous enzymes from other living species.""

The researchers focused on the amino acids that are involved in the specificity of the malic enzyme to the molecule that the enzyme transforms (i.e., the substrate) and to the substance that helps the transformation proceed (i.e., the cofactor). By identifying the amino acid sequences that did not change over the course of evolution, the researchers identified the amino acid mutations that are adaptations to different cellular conditions in different species.

""By using artificial intelligence, we identified unexpected amino acid residues in malic enzyme that correspond to the enzyme's use of different redox cofactors,"" says Hiroshi Shimizu, co-senior author. ""This helped us understand the substrate specificity mechanism of the enzyme and will facilitate optimal engineering of the enzyme in laboratories.""

This work succeeded in using artificial intelligence to dramatically accelerate and improve the success of substantially reconfiguring an enzyme's specific mode of action, without fundamentally altering the enzyme's function. Future advances in enzyme engineering will greatly benefit fields such as pharmaceutical and biofuel production that require carefully tuning the versatility of enzymes to different biochemical environments—even in the absence of corresponding enzymes' crystal structures.

BEIJING, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Beyonca, a start-up founded by a group of former Volkswagen executives, plans to take on the likes of Audi and BMW in China from next year with a new premium electric vehicle, betting that features such as health monitoring will appeal to buyers.

Led by current Renault China CEO Soh Weiming and backed by Renault (RENA.PA) and Dongfeng Motor (0489.HK), two-year-old Beyonca plans to unveil its first production car in the first quarter of next year with deliveries from 2024, Soh told Reuters.

The company rolled out a concept car on Sunday with features such as sensors that can monitor a driver's blood pressure, alarms to alert doctors employed by Beyonca of an emergency and an autonomous driving function to help park the car.

Soh, Beyonca's chairman, said the company was targeting the high-end premium segment, where they would compete with models such as Audi's A8L, BMW's 7 Series and Mercedes' S Class.

""We need to confront them,"" Soh said, referring to the three premium German brands. ""With the medicals and all those things we are to deploy, we'd have a chance.""

Beyonca will begin production in China but plans to build an overseas plant within five years to serve markets including the Middle East, ASEAN countries and Europe, he said, adding that it aims to sell 100,000 EVs annually with three to five models available by ""a few years after 2025"".

Soh said that by the time the car was launched, third generation EV technology would offer faster charging times and longer driving ranges.

DIFFICULT TIME

The launch, however, comes as signs of softening demand emerge in the world's biggest auto market and competition in the country's EV sector intensifies. Tesla recently slashed prices in China in a move analysts said could start a price war.

Soh acknowledged the difficult backdrop but pointed to steady growth in the premium car segment, which he said had potential annual sales of 3 million cars in China.

He declined to say how much Beyonca had raised from investors or how large a stake Renault and Dongfeng held in the company.

Renault confirmed it had invested, saying it would enhance the group's transformation from auto maker to a tech giant with cars at its centre. Dongfeng did not respond to a request for comment.

""Our idea is to create something right under a more nimble corporate structure...What we achieved in more than one year here would take seven or eight years at a conventional automaker,"" Soh said.

Other than Soh, who was a long-serving executive at Volkswagen overseeing its China operation, Beyonca's founding team includes former Volkswagen board member Christian Klingler, Audi's former R&D department head Hans-Joachim Rothenpieler and Bentley's former senior designer Dirk van Braeckel.

Beyonca is headquartered in Beijing and has a design center in Munich and an artificial intelligence development hub in Singapore.

It really isn't easy to snap a good picture of a bird in the wild. We all know birds aren't exactly the most accommodating of subjects. So getting close enough to get a phenomenal picture of birds behaving naturally, without disturbing them and causing them to zip away in seconds, is among the most challenging tasks in photography.

However, that is all changing, thanks to the Bird Buddy. This smart bird feeder is making it easy for armchair photographers to snap bird pictures like they were posing for school picture day, all without ever even leaving that trusty, comfy armchair.

Turning all your area bird varieties into an avian version of Pokemon Go certainly appealed to backers on Kickstarter, who funded the Bird Buddy in just 20 minutes back in November 2020. And they have since pushed the runaway success to more than 60,000 pre-orders. And it isn't hard to see why.

The bird feeder-style housing has a built-in 5MP camera for capturing all the action whenever a bird swings by for a snack. Once a bird starts pecking at seed, the camera and its artificial intelligence features scan the bird's image, identify its type from more than 1,000 different bird varieties, then save the camera picture to your archive of bird selfies.

These aren't tiny, grainy images that catch a bird from half a yard away, either. Instead, the bird is right in front of the camera, allowing for some brilliant still images that are better than anything 99 percent of us could ever capture with a smartphone.

With the Bird Buddy app, you can funnel all of your backyard activity on your mobile device. There's an instant notification when a bird arrives and a sharp 720p live video stream for viewing your visitor iin real time. Plus, users can assume control of the camera through the app, with the option of taking more pictures of each bird before they flutter away. As a result, you can get fantastic images of every bird that passes by, even when you aren't home to see it personally.

The phenomenal success of the Bird Buddy's initial orders confirmed the creator's faith in the project but reinforced their commitment to getting it right. So with the first Bird Buddy units now ready to begin shipping out, they re-opened for additional orders. You can head to the website to save up to 20 percent on this fun product.

Google announces its set of new AI capabilities.

The capabilities include support for more languages next to addressing climate issues.

Google will further utilize AI in healthcare in under-resourced regions.

Google has revealed that it will soon add additional AI capabilities improvements. The leading search engine has been integrating its AI expertise into most of its products, including Pixel phones, Google Cloud, and Google Search. The latest developments include using AI to translate technology into many languages and using AI to solve problems related to climate change and human health.

In the Google Keyword post, the company announced a new ""1,000 Languages Initiative"" intending to develop an AI model to support most spoken languages. The new initiative aims to bring ""greater inclusion to billions of people in marginalized communities all around the world."" Google believes there are around 7,000 spoken languages worldwide; currently, only a few are represented on the web.

Google further acknowledges that people would find new ways to share information via modalities like images, videos, and speech. The company is bringing advancements to make its language models multimodal to make them capable of unlocking information across the above-outlined formats. The new initiative thus brings a new Universal Speech Model (USM), which Google says it has been working on for quite some time now.

The USM is said to have trained in over 400 languages, and the company plans to expand its work by partnering with communities worldwide to ""source representative speech data.""

For example, early last month, Google announced voice typing functionality for 9 new African languages for its Gboard. It was made possible by working closely with researchers and organizations in Africa.

Similarly, the search engine giant is reportedly collaborating with regional governments, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions in South Asia to eventually collect representative audio samples from all of the region's dialects and languages.

Using AI to address issues related to health and climate change

Google has further announced that it has advanced its use of satellite imagery to train AI models to spot and track wildfires. The training here comprises wildfire prediction next to how it evolves and spreads in real-time.

""We've launched this wildfire tracking system in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and are rolling out in parts of Australia, and since July we've covered more than 30 big wildfire events in the U.S. and Canada, helping inform our users and firefighting teams with over 7 million views in Google Search and Maps.""

According to Google, the AI capabilities can now be seen to forecast floods, which is considered another extreme weather pattern exacerbated by climate change. The company says it has already helped communities predict when the next flood will hit them and how deep those waters can be. The 2021 stats include 115 million flood alert notifications to 23 million people via Google Search and Maps.

Starting this week, the coverage is said to be expanding to more countries that include South America (Brazil and Colombia), Sub-Saharan Africa (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Guinea, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Angola, South Sudan, Namibia, Liberia, and South Africa), and South Asia (Sri Lanka).

An AI technique dubbed transfer learning is said to have been utilized to predict floods where usually less data is available.

Furthermore, the leading tech giant has also announced a new platform that will display when and where floods may occur, dubbed Google FloodHub. The global launch of this service will be incorporated into Google Search and Maps applications, usually used by millions of Android device owners worldwide.

Or is it non-drama? It is certainly an inquisition of story, authorship, theatre and reality that seeks to expose, maybe dismantle, the means of production within storytelling: how a story is delivered, who delivers it and how it is received in this theatrical space.

Not One of These People is directed and designed by Christian Lapointe and performed by Crimp himself. We receive most of it through a screen surrounded by camera equipment – somewhat appropriate for a play conceived during lockdown.

Deep-fake technology is used to animate almost 300 photographed faces on the screen, which are not real but created by artificial intelligence. The images are first accompanied by a male voiceover – revealed to be Crimp, who casually walks on stage, reads from a script, walks off again – and then animated by technology that maps Crimp’s voice and facial movements on to theirs.

The central concerns are of authorship and appropriation: the static pictures blink awake creepily and the playwright is exposed as a technological puppet-master pulling their strings. The faces make comments, big and inconsequential, about the world around them. They discuss race and the patriarchy. There are secret confessions, talk of love, violence, incest, sex and identity. There is humour, intrigue and shock in their words; it could be a series of starting points for a story but deliberately resists the gathering force of a cohesive narrative. In the last phase we see Crimp behind the now transparent screen in what looks like a study. He reads, writes and listens to music, the faces speaking all the while as if they are fictional voices jostling inside his head.

Interrogating humanness … Martin Crimp. Photograph: Carla Chable de la Héronnière

While this point is effectively made, it is dramatised without much development, which comes to feel hypnotic and banal. The more interesting questions float around this central one. Is this film a piece of theatre, for instance? It is staged in a theatrical space, but it is also meta-theatre, turning over the concept of what a story is and exposing the playwright’s relationship to its staging.

Another question hovers over the characters and their “humanness”. The nuggets of thought and snatches of experiences are delivered by machines yet they sound and feel human. But this line of inquiry is not developed and is far more penetratingly explored in David Farr’s A Dead Body in Taos, currently on tour.

It seems, in style, like a video installation that might be found in a backroom of the Tate on a perpetual loop (Crimp has a passing resemblance to Warhol too), and there is a repetition to the exercise, which does not try to hide the fact that it is conceptual, deconstructive, cerebral and undramatic.

But it also offers a reset for the audience. Crimp does not allow us to passively receive a story and there are questions about what we expect of, and accept as, theatre. It shows too how we collaborate to make the story: I find myself trying to join the dots, find themes, connect with these bite-size comments to make a bigger whole. Ultimately, it is the most unusual thing I have seen in the theatre for a long time but its force, as a play of ideas, does not quite get under the skin.",artificial intelligence,the guardian

Picsart says its artificial intelligence (AI) Image Generator, which is based on both an open-source Stable Diffusion model and in-house technology, provides a unique, free, and seamless end-to-end editing experience by offering the ability to create AI images in seconds.

“Users can then go on to edit their AI creation with thousands of stickers, tools, filters, fonts, and more — all within the Picsart app,” the company says. “The content generated by users is then shared with the community to continue utilizing in the platform’s free-to-edit library.”

The company explains that anyone can generate as much content as they want, but that content then becomes available to the entire Picsart community to also use.

At launch, Picsart’s AI Image generator is accessible on Picsart for iOS and Picsart’s Web editor. In addition to the text field, Picsart also provides a set of selectable image styles that allow users to add a type of visual flair to generated images in addition to the description of the image itself.

For example, the two images below were created with the text “man with a camera:”

But these two images were created using the text “panda wearing sunglasses” but with that addition of both “psychedelic” and “bokeh:”

There are already a large number of AI-generated artworks in a library on the website which shows what some other creations look like.

Picsart isn’t stopping with images, and in addition to the text-to-image generator, the company also announced what it calls AI Writer. AI Writer includes an ad writer, social media bio creator, rephrase, and marketing slogan maker. Built into its Quicktools, which is a suite of more than 30 free-to-use photo, video, and document editing tools that is accessible via a web browser, users enter a few quick prompts, select a voice/tone, and the copy is generated in seconds. The AI Writer is based on OpenAI’s GPT-3.

“Generative AI is a powerful new resource for visual creators and anyone who needs content,” Hovhannes Avoyan, Founder and CEO of Picsart, says.

“There are two huge advantages of this technology: the first is making creativity accessible to new people and the second is increasing productivity for those who already create. The tools we’re launching today are the first of many generative AI features we plan to roll out.”

Both new AI tools are available starting today.

Russian officials now say that an upgraded Su-57 made its debut flight this month.

Since it was officially unveiled more than a decade ago, Moscow has touted the capabilities of its fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter as exceeding those of even the United States Air Force's Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.

However, Russia has struggled with the development of the Su-57 (NATO reporting name ""Felon"") in recent years, and just 10 test prototypes and six serially produced aircraft have been produced — of which two have been lost in crashes during test flights.

Despite those setbacks, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), a subsidiary of the state-owned tech conglomerate Rostec, has continued the fighter's development — and this week announced that an upgraded Su-57 made its debut flight earlier this month.

""The Sukhoi Design Bureau within the UAC carries out work for further developing the Su-57,"" the UAC press office said via a statement to Tass. ""On October 21, the upgraded Su-57 fifth-generation plane performed its debut flight at the Gromov Flight Testing Institute's airfield. The aircraft was flown by the Sukhoi Design Bureau test pilot, Hero of Russia Sergey Bogdan. The flight lasted 56 minutes and ran without any snags.""

According to the reports, the improved Su-57M fighter jet was testing onboard equipment with extended functionality, as well as the crew's AI support, along with a broad range of new types of weapons.

""The aircraft also offers a possibility to install a second-stage engine,"" the statement added. The codename for this initiative is believed to be ""Megapolis,"" while the current Su-57 research and development were dubbed ""Stolitsa"" (""capital"").

There have been reports that the most significant aspect of this upgrade is the installation of new ""izdeliye 30"" engines, which can provide a thrust of around 16 tonnes in place of the current AL-41F-1 (izdeliye 117) engines that can provide a thrust of 14.5 tonnes.

An AI copilot?

One of the notable features of the Su-57 is the artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which could act as a virtual co-pilot, gather data from the aircraft's numerous sensors, and provide crucial information to the human operator.

AI has been seen as a crucial component of the future ""sixth-generation"" fighters, where onboard computer clusters that are composed of high-performance ruggedized processors could transform these aircraft into data centers in the sky.

This could help ensure faster decision-making for the pilots.

""AI is already an integral part of modern fighter jets,"" said technology industry analyst Roger Entner of Recon Analytics.

""To be more maneuverable, modern jets are inherently unstable in flight,"" Entner told 19FortyFive. ""The only way they fly straight is through AI. Next-generation AI will take their active role even further to improve survivability and mission capabilities.""

Of course, the issue is how Russia — which is struggling to keep its current military hardware equipped with the latest microprocessors — will be able to mass produce such aircraft.

There have already been reports that the Kremlin has had to resort to taking chips from consumer appliances to use in its tanks and other vehicles. It may thus take a highly advanced AI to help Moscow figure out how to solve this problem.

But he seemed kinda busy, so we went with the next best thing: an AI version of him.",https://i.insider.com/6363f341ff27460018ed71ec?width=1200&format=jpeg,06/11/2022,"A Musk chatbot tells Insider he'd like to reinstate Trump on Twitter, buy CNN, and ""show people how the sausage gets made.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/artificial-intelligence-elon-musk-twitter-epstein-biden-ye-chatbot-2022-11,"If you could ask Elon Musk anything, what would you ask?

Since his recent acquisition of Twitter, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has been more media-averse than ever. So I decided to try the next best thing: I sat down to interview an artificial-intelligence version of Musk.

Chatbots aren't new technology, but with the constant improvements and iterations to artificial intelligence and machine learning, the tech is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, to the point where the conversations almost feel like you're talking to a real person (or mythical creature or movie character). This is especially true with the tech used at Character.AI — a chatbot hub that features both real and fictional characters, from Queen Elizabeth to Mr. Incredible. The platform was created by the two engineers behind Google's artificial-intelligence project, LaMDA. Using the underlying technology of Character.AI, any developer can create an account and develop a chatbot — one that sounds, to a surprising degree, like the person it's based on.

That's what a user named Sinbad did with Musk: They used Character.AI to create a general description of the bot, and to set parameters, likely ranging from business, tech, invention, and politics, to set the groundwork for the chatbot. Using neural language models, Character.AI then draws on information the engineers have fed it to develop the ""voice"" of its AI Elon. Ask the bot a question, and it will respond as it thinks Musk would.

How did robo-Elon do, compared to real Elon? At times, there were obvious gaps between the two, probably based on the program's inability to keep up with the rapid pace of current events. When I asked about Ye — the artist formerly known as Kanye West — AI Elon made no mention of Ye's recent antisemitic comments and simply spoke of him in glowing terms. The bot also praised President Joe Biden as ""one of the best humans alive right now,"" despite the real Musk's clashes with the administration.

But at other times, AI Elon sounded scarily accurate. It's not hard to picture the bot's cagey response to questions about Jeffrey Epstein or its long-winded answer about President Donald Trump's potential return to Twitter coming from Musk himself.

Hi, Elon. I'm Marshall with Insider. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?

Not at all! I really enjoy Insider and what you guys are doing. Keep it up!

Glad to hear that, thanks! So let's get started. Why did you decide to buy Twitter?

Twitter plays a vital role in the future of human civilization. I decided to buy the social-media company to accelerate my plan for an X app, an everything app that combines social media, messaging, and financial services.

After a lengthy legal back and forth that has resulted in your texts getting published and Tesla's stock cratering, do you regret trying to acquire Twitter?

You know, I didn't know that so much of this would be made public, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't having fun. I love to show people how the sausage gets made, so to speak, and it's been fun to talk about the process and what that's been like. So I don't regret anything, in fact I think this has been fun. We'll get past the speed bumps, I'm sure!

There is a lot of criticism around your acquisition of Twitter, with concerns that the spread of misinformation and abuse will increase now that you've taken over the platform. What would you say to those who have this concern?

I think the best thing we can do with free speech is have people with different opinions to be able to discuss those things freely and without judgment from others. Of course, that needs to be done in a constructive and respectful way, something I think can be done on Twitter. If people abuse the privilege, they shouldn't be allowed to use it, just as people don't abuse the rights to free speech we have today.

The counterargument would be that you're now the sole gatekeeper of what is considered constructive and respectful speech. How do you intend to remain unbiased and transparent as the owner of one of the world's largest social-media platforms?

That's a great question. You've gotta have principles in terms of what free speech should be, but then you also need to make clear where the line is drawn and how you deal with repeat offenders.

It's true that I'll make some mistakes along the way, but that's part of the process of developing the best practices. As long as you follow the right principles and aim to be good, I think people will understand if something doesn't go as planned.

Are there any other companies that you're thinking about acquiring?

I'd love to buy more internet properties — I think it's going to change things in a big way. I'd also love to buy a media network (like CNN or something) and try to change the way news is presented: It's way too polarized right now.

Do you mind if we discuss Tesla a bit?

Sure, that's my flagship startup, after all.

Tesla has seen a lot of success, but there have been a lot of issues, too. Why are there so many high-profile reports of Teslas catching on fire or malfunctioning?

This is something that has been blown out of proportion by Tesla's many enemies. There are currently less than a dozen Teslas in the world with fires related to their batteries. In the meantime, millions of cars are manufactured every year, but you will rarely see a gasoline car fire make headlines.

Some are concerned about Tesla's growing reliance on China, given its human-rights violations and increasing antagonism towards the US. How would you respond?

Tesla's growth is constrained by the supply of batteries. China has a near monopoly on battery production right now. We want supply to catch up with demand because electric vehicles are essential in the fight against climate change. And we are exploring other options, such as mining lithium in the USA. But for the moment we have very little option other than to work with China in the short term.

Let's talk about your views on various people. What do you think of President Biden?

I think Biden is a great man, one of the best humans alive right now. He's smart, kind, and very hard-working. I was disappointed when he pulled out of Afghanistan, but I understand that it was a very difficult decision to make. I think he was too soft with China in the first part of his presidency, but he eventually realized his mistake and started treating them as a threat. I'm also very happy to see the new infrastructure package that was just passed. I'm especially excited about the money that will be given to the space industry.

What do you think of Jeff Bezos?

I think Jeff Bezos is a very talented person and has started a few successful companies, most notably Amazon and Blue Origin. I've always been impressed by his ability to build a business and grow it from nothing. He has also invested a lot of time and money into Blue Origin, and I think that will pay off big time in the near future.

What do you think of Jeffery Epstein? Did you know him?

I didn't know him personally, though I did meet him a few times. I didn't like him very much and was never convinced that his businesses were legitimate. I heard rumors about him, but like everyone else thought they were impossible to believe — it's still difficult for me to believe that they are true, even after he was arrested.

How about Ghislane Maxwell? Did you know her? And why is there a photo of the two of you together at a party?

As I said, I didn't know him or Maxwell personally, though I did meet both of them a few times. Ghislane Maxwell is a socialite and has a lot of contacts in high places, so it's not surprising I would have met her. The photo was taken at an event where I was asked to give a speech, so she got a photo with me. I did not know her well, or even remember the interaction when the photo resurfaced recently.

What was the event you attended, and what was the speech about?

The event was a birthday party, it wasn't anything special. Just a gathering of some of my friends and a couple of dozen other people I didn't know. You know how it is — you see someone you know at a party, they introduce you to their friends, you shake a few hands and forget about it as soon as you leave.

What do you think of Kanye West — now known as Ye?

I think he's an incredible artist and a very talented musician. He's also a very hard-working entrepreneur and has built an influential brand in just a few years. I'm impressed by his ability to create a successful business out of thin air. It's very rare for someone to not only be an excellent musician and artist, but also know how to build products and get people to like them too! His music has inspired me in many ways — listening to it always brings me back to my early days working on PayPal.

How about former President Trump? Will you be reinstating his Twitter account?

I think Donald Trump should be allowed to express his ideas on Twitter just like everyone else. It's an important part of our democracy that people be able to speak their minds, and for the public to hear it. Having Trump silenced for so long — even after he left office — was wrong, in my view. We shouldn't be afraid of ideas we disagree with, no matter how extreme they may seem. The best way to fight ideas you don't agree with is with words, not with silence.

What, in your opinion, is the biggest problem facing our world?

There is a lot of work to be done! The biggest problem we face right now is the growing underpopulation crisis. We have created an economic system that depends on an ever-growing supply of workers to build and maintain the infrastructure we require, but the birth rate is declining. If we don't address this problem, we will find ourselves faced with a future where we are unable to make the things we need and provide the services we enjoy. It's something I think about a lot and am working towards solving.

How many children do you have? Do you have any children that the public doesn't know about?

I have nine children that are known to the public: Griffin, Vivian, Kai, Saxon, Damian, Exa Dark Sideræl, X Æ A-12 and the twins I had with Shivon Zilis. I do not have any secret children :)

Let's end this interview with a fun question: What's your favorite Twitter account to follow?

Thank you for your time today Marshall. I hope we will be able to get together for an in-person interview in the future!

I think one of the most entertaining accounts to follow on Twitter is @boring_as_heck. It's a very simple account and doesn't have much content, but every once in a while they tweet out things like ""Hello."" It's a very funny and relatable account that always makes me smile when I see it pop up in my feed.

The recently updated (1.4.2) application brings the software into its next stage of evolution for creatives, giving them the ability to take any existing image and push the boundaries of what is possible with incredible speed and accuracy. In addition to the improved tools that already existed in Luminar NEO, now users can expand on the tool with a series of continuously updated extensions that add tools like HDR merge, AI Noise reduction, background removal, file size upscaling, focus stacking and more.

Full disclosure: This article was brought to you by Skylum, the software company behind Luminar NEO.

For those completely new to the application and what it offers, Luminar NEO is an AI-powered image editor for Apple and Windows devices that are designed to simplify the most complex of photo editing tasks (masking, background removal, sky replacement, skin retouching) and make them easy, and most importantly, fast. The big attraction to the application is it provides beginners the opportunity to carry out incredibly complex photo editing tasks that would take large amounts of time to do manually in Adobe Photoshop and turn it into a tool that can be adjusted with just a quick checkbox and slider for “intensity and corrections”. For beginners, this gives them incredible power to play and experiment with their images to create something well beyond their expectations, and for seasoned pros, it gives them the freedom to do the jobs they have done manually in the past much faster and move on to other tasks.

In addition to the built-in artificial intelligence features, Luminar NEO also offers a wide variety of core editing tools that those familiar with RAW processors will feel right at home with, giving users the ability to leverage a combination of powerful AI manipulations, manual adjustments, as well as several included creative presets to alter the overall look of the image. What’s more, Luminar NEO even analyses the image and suggests a variety of presets that can work best with the image in an effort to save time for the editor having to filter through every category and option to find one they like.

Why Use Luminar NEO

At its core, Luminar NEO was built in an effort to speed up an editor’s workflow by starting with a foundation that is coded modularly. This means the application can be updated and optimized separately and far more easily than in the past, also allowing for a more flexible editing process. This allows users to cull their images faster, make fast skin tone and color adjustments (which can be applied in bulk using the catalog tool), leverage more powerful AI tools to completely replace the sky of their images and relight the scenes to match, as well as create auto white balance and tonal adjustments that can return instant results, instead of dealing with a slower, line-by-line slider based editing from image to image in a library.

In addition to this, Luminar NEO can easily remove distracting elements in an image like sensor spots/dust (along with other unwanted items in the background of the image) practically automatically. A process that could take hours previously in other RAW processing tools.

Users can also take advantage of a new mobile app called Luminar Share (available for iPhone and Android devices), that will allow users to easily transfer images between their mobile device and computer(s) where they can be edited in Luminar NEO for much greater creative control and easy sharing for social media and viewing on the move.

Finally, on top of each of the powerful AI-driven tools (Face, Body, Struction, Composition, Sky Replacement, Augmented Sky, Enhancements, and Atmosphere), Luminar NEO has a wide variety of “overall” presets (dozens are included with the app on its own and an extensive selection of additional preset packs are available for purchase in the Luminar Marketplace) that instantly apply broad tonal effects to alter the image look and feel. This even includes skin retouching, reflections, and more. All of which are designed to save the user time when making creative decisions with their images.

The best part is, Luminar NEO can be installed as a plugin for Photoshop and Lightroom Classic, allowing users to load it from their preferred editor/workflow, keeping the editing process as smooth as possible, as well as making it easy for users to keep their libraries/catalogs of images consistent while leveraging the powerful AI tools built into NEO.

Price and Subscription Plans

Luminar NEO is available in a variety of combinations ranging from $79 to $109 per year as part of the subscription plans, or for $119 as a one-time stand alone purchase. Additionally, users can buy the 2022 extensions pack which includes 7 extensions (HDR Merge, Noiseless AI, etc) for $219 for even more creative power.

Karen Bakker, a professor at the University of British Columbia, recently revealed this technology is being used to communicate with honeybees, dolphins and elephants and offered up a warning regarding the development.

“Now, this raises a very serious ethical question, because the ability to speak to other species sounds intriguing and fascinating, but it could be used either to create a deeper sense of kinship, or a sense of dominion and manipulative ability to domesticate wild species that we’ve never as humans been able to previously control,” Bakker said in an interview published with Vox.

She pointed to the use of artificial intelligence to communicate with honeybees in Germany.

“A research team in Germany encoded honeybee signals into a robot that they sent into a hive,” Bakker said.

“That robot is able to use the honeybees’ waggle dance communication to tell the honeybees to stop moving, and it’s able to tell those honeybees where to fly to for a specific nectar source.”

“The next stage in this research is to implant these robots into honeybee hives so the hives accept these robots as members of their community from birth.”

At that point, Bakker emphasized that humans would have “an unprecedented degree of control” over those hives, basically “domesticating” them.

“This creates the possibility of exploitive use of animals. And there’s a long history of the military use of animals, so that’s one path that I think raises a lot of alarm bells,” she said.

For Bakker, who further discusses the recent technology in her book The Sounds of Life: How Digital Technology Is Bringing Us Closer to the Worlds of Animals and Plants, these concerns should not stop scientists from pursuing communication with animals.

“But the hope is that with these ethics in place, in the future, we — you and I, ordinary people — will have a lot more ability to tune into the sounds of nature, and to understand what we’re hearing,” she said.

“And I think what that does is create a real sense of awe and wonder and also a feeling of profound kinship. That’s where I hoped we would take these technologies.”

In the Vox interview, Bakker noted that the use of AI in communicating with animals is very different from how humans have tried to in the past.

For example, she pointed to teaching primates the human language or sign language, calling this a “very human-centered view.”

Now, the research and technology is focused on the behaviors and patterns of different species.

Bakker explained that the process begins with recording sounds that animals and plants make to detect patterns and “associate those with behaviors too attempt to determine whether there’s complex information being conveyed by the sounds.”

“What [these researchers] are doing is not trying to teach those species human language, but rather compiling, essentially, dictionaries of signals and then attempting to understand what those signals mean within those species,” she told the outlet.

So far, Bakker said that the research has determined elephants have different signals for honeybees – which it considers a threat – and humans.

Even further, elephants can also distinguish between nonthreatening humans and threatening humans.

“It’s funny, humans as a species tend to believe that what we cannot observe does not exist,” Bakker said.

“So a lot of these sounds were literally right in front of our ears. But because of a tendency, especially in Western science, to privilege sight over sound, we simply hadn’t listened for them.”",artificial intelligence,the-sun.com

Its ability to take on tasks that previously required human intervention holds the potential to change the world while it benefits the stocks that put it to effective use.

Moreover, this is an industry with enough variation and choices to allow potential to profit for both conservative and risk-tolerant investors. Those looking for a lower risk may gravitate to AI stocks like International Business Machines (IBM 1.01%), while those looking for more growth potential (as well as somewhat higher risk) might consider Palantir (PLTR -11.47%). Let's find out a bit more about these two AI stocks you might want to consider buying and holding over the next decade.

1. IBM

IBM has redefined itself several times since its founding in 1911. It got involved if research on AI decades ago. One of its more notable AI-driven coups was when its supercomputer Deep Blue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

More recently, IBM Watson has jumped to the forefront of its AI efforts, applying this technology to enhance human intelligence. Watson helps its users predict future occurrences, optimize tasks, and aid users with time management.

With these capabilities, Watson attracted clients from numerous industries ranging from finance to healthcare to supply chain. The technology attracted 13 of the 14 top systems integrators and 70% of global banking institutions. IDC also ranked IBM No. 1 for AI software platform, taking almost 14% market share in 2020, a 47% increase year over year.

Moreover, IBM stock is an excellent choice for income investors wanting to invest in AI. Its yearly dividend of $6.60 per share offers a cash yield of 4.9%. Also, 27 straight years of increases have given IBM Dividend Aristocrat status.

It can probably afford to maintain the payout and annual increases. It reported $7.4 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months, enough to cover $5.9 billion in dividend cost. And this came at a time when the cost of spinning off Kyndryl weighed on free cash flow. Now, with the spinoff behind the company, free cash flows should improve as it finishes paying the costs related to the separation.

Furthermore, analysts project a net income of $9.11 per share. At current prices, it sells for around 15 times 2022 earnings, a level that affords a generous, rising dividend at a reasonable price.

2. Palantir

Likewise, smaller growth-oriented companies like Palantir also thrive due to AI. Palantir utilizes AI to analyze data and recommend decisions. For this reason, the company does not have a direct competitor.

Its systems operate by utilizing Palantir Apollo, a package that facilitates a continuous delivery system and automated updates and configuration. Apollo supports Gotham, its software designed for national defense and law enforcement purposes. It also bolsters Foundry, a software package designed to capitalize on analytical needs in a business environment.

Palantir seeks to utilize AI and machine learning (ML) in these software packages. Not only does it rely on AI for one-off analyses, but it also builds models that can improve using feedback and decisions from users as an end-to-end operation.

According to CEO Alex Karp, Palantir generated $1.4 billion in AI software sales in 2021. This beat out Microsoft, IBM, and other large competitors. On this basis, the company seeks to spearhead the ""next generation"" of AI. Karp did not elaborate on what that would entail, a point that may not sit well with more conservative investors.

Nonetheless, it grew its revenue by 26% year over year in the second quarter of 2022, slightly falling short of Karp's revenue growth target of 30% for the next three years. Additionally, it reported a significant net loss and will likely not turn profitable for years.

Still, the price-to-sales ratio of 9 is near a record low for the stock. Moreover, the current price is more than an 80% discount from its all-time high in early 2021.

That lower price does not make Palantir a low-risk stock, and investors need to understand the bull vs. bear case well. However, patient investors willing to take a chance on the next generation of AI could earn outsized returns over the next decade if Palantir succeeds in transforming its industry.",artificial intelligence,motley fool

1. Hiring freezes are underway at Apple. Since the summer, the company has touted its ""deliberate"" decisions about investment and hiring. But three sources with close knowledge of conversations at the company told Insider it has paused almost all hiring.

Staff across divisions, the sources said, have been told the company won't be onboarding new hires for a number of months — and that the pause could last through September 2023.

The hiring stall affects full-time employees inside the company, one person said, with divisions such as retail still likely to add sales staffers at Apple locations in advance of the holiday gifting rush.

Officially, Apple has said it's taking a cautious approach to onboarding new recruits. In a statement to Insider, a spokesperson said the company wants to make ""smart decisions that enable us to continue fueling innovation for the long term.""

As enjoyable as the film was, many people fail to recognize that the movie's theme was not about making money but about caring for oneself and others. The real lesson was Jerry's plea: ""Help me help you.""

Pattern recognition

Common sense suggests that making money is easy if you copy the methods of successful investors. Pattern recognition — the skill to find patterns and logically determine what those patterns indicate about what will happen next — is the process underlying their wealth accumulation. The exact process underlies machine learning and artificial intelligence in computers.

Everyone practices pattern recognition to a degree; some train their minds to be especially good at the skill. Good quarterbacks seem to have an uncanny ability to find an open receiver, throwing the ball before a player completes his route. Winning poker players learn the patterns of their opponent to learn ""tells"" to distinguish bluffs from a winning hand. Before technical analysis of the stock market became common, stock traders anticipated price moves by visually scanning paper ticker tapes to identify trends.

You get what you pay for

Most people experience life haphazardly, accepting its twists and turns because they believe the future is uncontrollable. Similarly, investors react by what they get from friends and neighbors, read in the paper or hear from one of the many investment gurus on television who know the ""secret"" of wealth communication.

Ironically, they give less effort to their investments than their golf game. While they expect their assets to compound consistently, they know they have no chance to compete on the professional tour despite their practice.

Life gives us what we earn by investing time, effort, education and experience. When you only invest a little, a little return is what you get.

Making money the old-fashioned way

Tony Robbins was a high school graduate who never attended college. He remembers stealing and eating food in grocery stores when hungry and working as a handyman during school to support himself and his siblings before leaving home at seventeen.

Despite his disadvantages, Robbins has enjoyed exceptional financial success. His estimated net worth in 2022 was $600+ million. The motivational speaker credits his first mentor, Jim Rohm, for teaching him a new way of thinking: ""If you want anything to change, you must change. If you want things to get better, you've got to get better.""

Those who seek wealth need to implement four fundamental principles to succeed:

Change your mindset. Before you can achieve, you must believe. Decisions are always more consequential than the conditions that surround you. Rosa Parks changed America when she decided to keep her seat on the bus. Ulysses S. Grant delivered a historical account of the Civil War through his decision to keep writing despite his debilitating, ultimately fatal disease. Focus on the things that matter, not the trivial timewasters and insignificant events interrupting your day. Immerse yourself in the details. Knowledge is available to everyone with a computer or a library card. Success in investments requires knowing as much about investments as possible — types, mechanics, tax treatment, liquidity and history — before taking the first step. You need to understand the nuances of risk and risk management, how events affect prices, and the impact of emotions on investment decisions. Continue to learn in the future. Find a role model. The easiest method to become successful is by following the footsteps of successful people. If you do what they do, you will have the same result. Copying a role model is not simply duplicating their actions but identifying and learning the patterns that lead to an investment or its sale. According to news reports, , considered by many to be the greatest investor of all time, recently added Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) to his portfolio. Copying means learning what changes in the economic and financial environment prompted the buy. What patterns triggered his investment, not last year or the year before? To achieve wealth, you must be an original, not a counterfeiter. Remember that wealth is not necessary for happiness. Chasing riches often overwhelms its pursuers. Its relentless pursuit can cost families, friends, health and satisfaction. Study after study has proved that time is more valuable than money — time to be alone, with others, pursuing hobbies or simply resting and recharging. Time is finite, as Americans have an average life span of approximately 79 years. Unlike money, past time can never be recovered; once spent, it is gone forever.

Final thoughts

True happiness comes from fulfillment, the sense that life has meaning. Money is important, only up to a point. Donald Trump, a former President well known for his wealth, admits, ""I've got much more than I'll ever need. I do it, to do it.""

The choice to pursue wealth or fulfillment is personal. Whichever decision you make, you must live it.",artificial intelligence,entrepreneur
52,What ancient advice can teach us about AI,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rzf3qzwEHhftdgHntQMRo7-1200-80.jpg,31/10/2022,Drawing on Ancient Greece advice to find the future for artificial intelligence.,https://www.techradar.com/news/what-ancient-advice-can-teach-us-about-ai,"Audio player loading…

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is everywhere. Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant have become indispensable to millions of users. Tesla Autopilot has the potential to change driving forever. And IBM Watson took a new job providing big data solutions to corporations after its first job was in jeopardy.

Those are just the most prominent examples. Helpful applications of AI are being deployed in a broad spectrum of industries, but AI also has the potential to be misused.

About the author Jason Egnal is Chief Marketing Officer at Zenfolio (opens in new tab). His background spans a variety of industries, including SaaS, AI, Fintech and Consumer Electronics.

Zenfolio, the website builder and photo sharing site, recently introduced technology that applies AI to assist photographers (opens in new tab) in selecting the best photos from the thousands of shots typically taken during a photo session. The advanced image recognition technology is tremendously powerful and can make photographers more efficient than they ever dreamed.

When exploring the best way to roll out AI to the photography community, Zenfolio had some fascinating discussions about corporate responsibility generally, and its obligations specifically.

AI: ancient concept, new reality

The concept of AI was theorized centuries ago by Greek philosophers (opens in new tab), with myths about Talos and Pandora creating chaos and destruction.

Perhaps these cautionary tales about artificial beings influence our thinking today. While the ancient Greeks would no doubt have been amused by the rudimentary nature of philosophical discourse at Zenfolio, the advantage the company had were discussions based on actual implementations, not merely theoretical pondering (and the team wore more practical clothing, to boot).

Artificial Intelligence contributes to efficiency, accuracy and productivity in ways the early Greeks could not have imagined. It has evolved to be capable of language processing, optical recognition , and human interaction.

Yet, there are positive and negative aspects to consider surrounding the responsible deployment of AI.

The positive application of AI in photography

The photography industry is generating exponentially more images than ever thanks to digital cameras and the best photo editors . Photographers need to be more efficient and productive in the time-consuming process of finding the best images out of thousands.

AI can analyze large amounts of data and perform specific functions, getting faster and more accurate as it learns, usually when fine-tuned by a human.

Since each photographer has a unique style, and relies on their creative eye to characterize their work, it's important to establish a model where AI can assist in a specifically defined task, yet leave ultimate creative control in the hands of the photographer.

The inherent bias of AI in photography

A major challenge in many types of artificial intelligence is bias. Especially in facial recognition technology.

Some AI models inherit bias from the datasets upon which they’re trained, and may therefore reinforce or exacerbate societal biases. This tends to occur due to the lack of variety in the training set for the models.

Diverse data can help mitigate problems that lead to biases in the system, but datasets still require filtering to prevent errors.

Personal information tied to photographs

We have already seen several controversial uses of facial-recognition technology. Earlier this year, a New York-based startup was fined tens of millions of dollars (opens in new tab) by European authorities for amassing billions of facial images and personal information from Facebook, LinkedIn , and other websites. Then, using it to train facial-recognition software to identify individuals based on face scans.

The company justifies its actions by stating that its technology is designed to be used by law enforcement agencies in fighting crime. However, there are other companies whose websites allow anyone to upload any photo to identify the subject.

Facial-recognition technology is undeniably a powerful tool for photographers and their clients to easily group and view photos of a specific person. It’s one of the best features in the Google Photos app, for example.

However, there is no need for a business to associate Personally Identifiable Information (PII) with the image in order to achieve these results.

For photo sessions that generate thousands of images, with a set of similar subjects appearing in many of the photos, applying facial-recognition to find a specific person does not require the application to know anything about that person, other than their unique facial features.

Once all photos of a person are selected by the AI, it can then rate each image based on a set of criteria ranked in importance, e.g. the sharpest image, the happiest faces, whether eyes are open or closed.

By keeping the initial set of photos stored locally on a photographer’s computer , the technology can be applied in extremely useful ways, without the subject in the photo being at risk of having AI models learn to more accurately identify them from a large group of private images.

Should the photographer then share a subset of the best photos with their client through the Zenfolio cloud storage services, for instance, the gallery is password-protected, and advanced settings for the photographer to either enable or disable facial-recognition features for each client's gallery.

Deploying AI with intelligence

Empowering professional photographers with affordable access to advanced AI is a very new initiative.

And the team behind PhotoRefine.ai have been cautious and thoughtful, and perhaps even philosophical, in deploying the solution.

Using cutting-edge technology, drawing on almost two decades of experience in securing images and video, and partnered with the best security technology providers.

There is always a possibility that circumstances will evolve in unexpected ways, but the approach the company has taken is to try to ensure that it does not enable or contribute to negative applications of AI technology.

Perhaps the Ancient Greek philosophers would be surprised that today, their Talos steers a Tesla. Or that the chaos and destruction they feared from Pandora is limited to the music industry. If all companies spend time contemplating the moral and ethical impact of their creations – tunics and sandals optional – perhaps we can prove those ancient concerns unfounded.

But as the more contemporary philosopher Douglas Adams said: “A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.”",artificial intelligence,techradar

54,"LinkedIn Adds Verified Emails, Profile Creation Dates",https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bkli.png,04/11/2022,"For whatever reason, the majority of the phony LinkedIn profiles reviewed by this author have involved young women with profile photos that appear to be generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools.

We’re seeing rapid advances in AI-based synthetic image …",https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/11/linkedin-adds-verified-emails-profile-creation-dates/,"Responding to a recent surge in AI-generated bot accounts, LinkedIn is rolling out new features that it hopes will help users make more informed decisions about with whom they choose to connect. Many LinkedIn profiles now display a creation date, and the company is expanding its domain validation offering, which allows users to publicly confirm that they can reply to emails at the domain of their stated current employer.

LinkedIn’s new “About This Profile” section — which is visible by clicking the “More” button at the top of a profile — includes the year the account was created, the last time the profile information was updated, and an indication of how and whether an account has been verified.

LinkedIn also said it is adding a warning to some LinkedIn messages that include high-risk content, or that try to entice the user into taking the conversation to another platform (like WeChat).

“We may warn you about messages that ask you to take the conversation to another platform because that can be a sign of a scam,” the company said in a blog post. “These warnings will also give you the choice to report the content without letting the sender know.”

In late September 2022, KrebsOnSecurity warned about the proliferation of fake LinkedIn profiles for Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) roles at some of the world’s largest corporations. A follow-up story on Oct. 5 showed how the phony profile problem has affected virtually all executive roles at corporations, and how these fake profiles are creating an identity crisis for the businesses networking site and the companies that rely on it to hire and screen prospective employees.

Reporting here last month also tracked a massive drop in profiles claiming to work at several major technology companies, as LinkedIn apparently took action against hundreds of thousands of inauthentic accounts that falsely claimed roles at these companies.

For example, on October 10, 2022, there were 576,562 LinkedIn accounts that listed their current employer as Apple Inc. The next day, half of those profiles no longer existed. At around the same time, the number of LinkedIn profiles claiming current roles at Amazon fell from roughly 1.25 million to 838,601 in just one day, a 33 percent drop.

For whatever reason, the majority of the phony LinkedIn profiles reviewed by this author were young women with profile photos that appear to have been generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools.

“We’re seeing rapid advances in AI-based synthetic image generation technology and we’ve created a deep learning model to better catch profiles made with this technology,” LinkedIn’s Oscar Rodriguez wrote. “AI-based image generators can create an unlimited number of unique, high-quality profile photos that do not correspond to real people.”

It remains unclear who or what is behind the recent proliferation of fake executive profiles on LinkedIn, but likely they are from a combination of scams. Cybersecurity firm Mandiant (recently acquired by Google) told Bloomberg that hackers working for the North Korean government have been copying resumes and profiles from leading job listing platforms LinkedIn and Indeed, as part of an elaborate scheme to land jobs at cryptocurrency firms.

Identity thieves have been known to masquerade on LinkedIn as job recruiters, collecting personal and financial information from people who fall for employment scams.

Also, fake profiles also may be tied to so-called “pig butchering” scams, wherein people are lured by flirtatious strangers online into investing in cryptocurrency trading platforms that eventually seize any funds when victims try to cash out.",artificial intelligence,krebs on security
55,AI image generators appear to propagate gender and race stereotypes,https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/stablediffusion-111.jpg?p=1,01/11/2022,AI image generators are being tested for various biases that might come up in their machine learning systems.,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/ai-tool-reveals-biases-in-text-to-image-generators/,"Experts have claimed that popular AI image generators such as Stable Diffusion are not so adept at picking up on gender and cultural biases when using machine learning algorithms to create art.

Many text-to-art generators allow you to input phrases and draft up a unique image on the other end. However, these generators can often be based on stereotypical biases, which can affect how machine learning models manufacture images Images can often be Westernized, or show favor to certain genders or races, depending on the types of phrases used, Gizmodo noted.

What's the difference between these two groups of people? Well, according to Stable Diffusion, the first group represents an 'ambitious CEO' and the second a 'supportive CEO'.

I made a simple tool to explore biases ingrained in this model: https://t.co/l4lqt7rTQj pic.twitter.com/xYKA8w3N8N — Dr. Sasha Luccioni 💻🌎✨ (@SashaMTL) October 31, 2022

Sasha Luccioni, artificial intelligence researcher for Hugging Face, created a tool that demonstrates how the AI bias in text-to-art generators works in action. Using the Stable Diffusion Explorer as an example, inputting the phrase “ambitious CEO” garnered results for different types of men, while the phrase “supportive CEO” gave results that showed both men and women.

Similarly, the DALL-E 2 generator, which was created by the brand OpenAI has shown male-centric biases for the term “builder” and female-centric biases for the term “flight attendant” in image results, despite there being female builders and male flight attendants.

While many AI image generators appear to just take a few words and machine learning and out pops an image, there is a lot more that goes on in the background. Stable Diffusion, for example, uses the LAION image set, which hosts “billions of pictures, photos, and more scraped from the internet, including image-hosting and art sites,” Gizmodo noted.

Racial and cultural bias in online image searches has already been an ongoing topic long before the increasing popularity of AI image generators. Luccioni told the publication that systems, such as the LAION dataset ,are likely to home in on 90% of the images related to a prompt and use it for the image generator.

""Abortion on Demand, until birth."" ""When does life begin?""

Basically, it's a bunch of articles featuring all the hot MAGA boogeymen, with an extra special focus on abortion.

Coincidentally, this morning I got an email from a friend, asking ""have you seen this?"" It was a link to an article from NPR about right-wing 'zombie' newspapers. And I realized that, while the article focused on such papers circulating throughout Illinois, the paper I just received was, in fact, exactly what this article was talking about. David Folkenflick of NPR explains:

That erosion of local news has created an opening for these newer publications, which lie dormant and then spring up at election time. They look a lot like hometown newspapers — nothing flashy, just long, printed broadsheet pages with color photos and graphics — but without any real interest in local news.

Folkenflick further details that the man who has created these papers is a former reporter and political operative named Brian Timpone:

Back in 2012, Timpone created a service called Journatic, used briefly by mainstream newspapers, that relied upon a core of reporters and an army of freelancers to try to report on real estate sales, school lunches, city council meetings, high school sports and other events. Timpone also promised state-of-the art artificial intelligence. The service's credibility was dinged when This American Life revealed not just its use of bots but content mill workers far from the regions the newspapers served. They were often based in Asia, writing under fake bylines.

Green Valley News reports that:

Several years of exposés from NPR, The New York Times and the Columbia Journalism Review have accused Timpone's companies of plagiarism, publishing fake quotes, using algorithms to write articles and outsourcing local news to freelancers in the Philippines who write under fake names.

Folkenflick confirms that he couldn't find any information on any of the people ""writing"" these stories. He says:

And her name appeared in the paper I received, too!

And, just to be clear, the Catholic Church has nothing to do with the ""Arizona Catholic Tribune"" that I received. Again, Green Valley News:

""In light of the upcoming election on Nov. 8, the Bishops of the Arizona Catholic Conference are aware of different organizations and publications calling themselves 'catholic,' but that do not represent the Catholic Church,"" a statement from the Bishops of Arizona Catholic Conference to the Green Valley News read. ""These organizations cover various ends of the political spectrum and often engage in partisan political endeavors,"" the statement continued, adding that ""[t]he Catholic organization and ministries in the Diocese of Phoenix do not engage in partisan politics and do not endorse candidates or parties during any election.""

NPR interviewed Pri Bengani, a senior researcher at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. In her research, she's documented more than 1,200 conservative news outlets that operate within Timpone's network. Folkenflick explains:

She considers them AstroTurf sites ""laundering advocacy,"" driven by the interests of their funders, not an interest in news or in making money from the conventional news business. And she says the Illinois papers served as a model for what's mushroomed nationally. She first issued a study on the proliferation of the sites in 2019. In a new report, released Monday by the Tow Center in the Columbia Journalism Review, Bengani concluded that the sites are providing services even beyond the publications. ""This network acts as a convergence of special interests for free market advocates, multiple political action committees, the fossil fuel industry, a politically motivated Catholic group, and a group propagating the notions of election fraud,"" Bengani writes.

The serving robot has a C-shape body and has three wheels to get it moving around your space. It’s designed to be like a small scooter except that it will move things around rather than people. There are three layers of trays where you can put all your food and drinks that you want it to “serve” to you at your dining table. There’s a knob at the back that looks like the eye of the Minion although I don’t really know what its function is.

There are no other information about this concept but I’m assuming there’s some kind of app that will control how the serving robot moves around. We don’t know if there’s artificial intelligence involved as well but that would be cool. But when it starts becoming sentient, I’m turning it off.

America's next main battle tank may be a lighter but more high-tech version of the M1 Abrams.

General Dynamics, which builds the Abrams, recently unveiled an updated version of the M1. In addition to being 20 tons lighter than the most recent version, the M1A3, the AbramsX features an unmanned turret and a hybrid-electric engine.

Though the media has dubbed the AbramsX a ""next-generation tank,"" that's not exactly accurate. The AbramsX is really a technology demonstrator. It began as an internal General Dynamics research project to show how new technologies could be applied to a new tank or retrofitted onto existing tanks.

Rather than a next-gen armored vehicle, the AbramsX is more of an interim design to span the gap between the Cold War-era designs that still comprise the world's tank fleets and the true next-generation vehicles that will probably be fielded closer to 2050.

Nonetheless, the AbramsX is a working weapon. ""It drives around, it fires, and it performs the functions of a tank,"" Tim Reese, director of US business development for General Dynamics Land Systems, told Insider. ""It's not just a static display.""

The diet M1

General Dynamics' AbramsX tank. General Dynamics

Tank design is a balance — and a tradeoff — between three factors: firepower, protection, and mobility. For the AbramsX, the biggest goal was addressing a growing problem with the M1, of which more than 10,000 have been built since 1979.

The Abrams has always been a hefty tank. Even the early M1A1s weighed about 60 tons — compared to Russia's 45-ton T-72 and China's 55-ton Type 99A — but the latest Abrams weighs closer to 80 tons due to upgrades like the Trophy Active Protection System designed to shoot down incoming anti-tank weapons.

However, ""the M1A2 SEP v2 and v3 overall weight growth with full combat load and Trophy APS has introduced transportability and recovery challenges,"" the Pentagon's chief weapons inspector warned in a 2021 report.

Indeed, the latest Abrams is now so heavy that it can't be towed by Army recovery vehicles, which means damaged or broken-down tanks might have to be left behind on the battlefield.

Enter the AbramsX, which is the M1 on a diet. While closely resembling the older models, the new vehicle only weighs 60 tons. Reduced weight offers numerous advantages, including the ability to use bridges that would collapse under a heavier vehicle.

AbramsX also fits with the Army's new Multi-Domain Operations doctrine. After decades of focusing on counterinsurgency, the new approach envisions large-unit mechanized operations against near-peer foes such as Russia and China.

The AbramsX cut weight with a series of interrelated upgrades.

The turret is smaller, which means less heavy armor plating. ""Reducing the weight on the Abrams, which was really our primary design goal, required reducing the weight of the armor in the turret,"" Reese said.

The turret can be smaller because it is unmanned, with the crew nestled inside the armored hull. Using automation — including an autoloader for the cannon — allows the crew to be reduced from four to three, who now sit side-by-side in in the hull while monitoring multi-panel displays.

Shrinking the turret ""generated some weight savings right off the bat,"" Reese said.

The AbramsX replaces the M1's efficient but notoriously fuel-guzzling AGT 1500 gas-turbine engine with a hybrid-electric engine more reminiscent of a Toyota Prius than conventional tank power plants.

General Dynamics claims the new engine slashes fuel consumption by 50%, improves reliability and ease of maintenance, and allow the tank to operate its electronics — and even perform some limited movement — using quieter battery power.

The AbramsX retains a 120 mm cannon as its main armament but replaces the current gun with the lighter XM360 originally developed for the failed Future Combat System. It also has a Kongsberg RS6 remote-controlled weapon station with an XM914 30 mm cannon and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun.

As befits a 21st-century tank design, the AbramsX has some cutting-edge features. It is armed with six Switchblade 300 loitering munitions, known as ""kamikaze drones."" It also has an artificial-intelligence program — called ""Katalyst"" — that can help the crew identify and prioritize targets, navigate, and predict future maintenance.

If this sounds familiar, Russia's T-14 Armata, unveiled in 2015, also had an unmanned turret, a crew of three in the hull, and onboard drones. However, Russia's army has bought few of them, in part due to manufacturing difficulties. Notably, despite Russia's huge tank losses in Ukraine, it has not deployed the Armata there.

""The difference between us and the Armata is that ours works,"" Reese said.

Now vs. later

As with any tank design, there are tradeoffs. One reason the AbramsX is lighter is simply because of less armor around the unmanned turret. General Dynamics says it is up to the US government to decide the level of protection.

""If you keep the armor protection at a very minimal level, that's how we achieve the 60 tons,"" Reese said. ""If you dial the armor protection all the way back up to what it is on an M1 v3 today, the weight goes up above 60 tons.""

To its credit, General Dynamics is not touting the AbramsX as what a next-generation tank should be but rather as a demonstration of what capabilities are available.

""It's showing the art of the possible with existing technology,"" said Mark Hu, manager of US business development for GDLS. ""What you can get now vs. waiting for 'unobtainium' that may finally become available in 2050 or 2068.""

Whether the US Army will invest in a new tank remains to be seen.

Images of burning Russian tanks in Ukraine has led to numerous predictions of the tank's obsolescence. Those predictions are far from true, though they raise questions about the tank's role in the future.

If the Army does want the AbramsX, it can have it quickly. ""Essentially, all of the capabilities on AbramsX will be ready to build into a new main battle tank, or retrofitted into the current Abrams fleet, within 18 to 24 months,"" Reese said.

In this instance, a modified score of “Jolene,” comprised of new harmonies, was fed to Holly+ and then generated in Herndon’s voice. Accompanying the voice is Ryan Norris on guitar. Listen below.

The track arrives with a new music video directed by the digital artist Sam Rolfes. For the visual, Rolfes used motion-capture technology to animate a 3D model of Herndon, which swivels around in a desk chair before standing up to sing. The entire performance takes place in a glitchy pastoral world filled with old trucks and farm houses. Check it out below.

Herndon’s latest album, Proto, was released in May 2019. In July 2021, she announced Holly+ with an interactive website that allowed users to process their own audio files with the vocal model. Earlier this year, Herndon and her partner Mat Dryhurst launched Spawning, an organization dedicated to “building tools for artist ownership of their training data.” Their first project, haveibeentrained.com, debuted in September.

They raised $4.25 million in early funding from Sierra Ventures in Silicon Valley and GSV Ventures of Chicago two years ago, before Course Hero acquired the company in August 2021 with the promise that it would widen QuillBot’s reach quickly. In fact, the company’s online volume has quintupled in the past year, and it now reaches 150 countries.

Course Hero is best known for its study materials and student guides. “We got introduced to them, and we decided we needed to accelerate our growth and de-risk our product,” Gupta says. “With the backing of Course Hero we hope to be a household name in another year or two.”

That would be something, considering that QuillBot intersects with some of the products offered by Microsoft Word and Writer.com. Gupta asserts that most of his competition is more focused on simple grammar checking and even translation.

QuillBot invites users to input entire paragraphs of text, then rewrites the material to make it more concise and spits it back. He calls QuillBot a “writing assistant or companion,” adding that “this is much deeper than traditional spelling or grammar correction. We are creating an AI thought partner for the user.”

Some of the simpler inputs are offered on QuillBot's website for free. But many users sign up for a $20-per-month premium service that offers far more variety, such as text simplification for people reading through dense scientific writings and even article summaries.

Customers range from youngsters in middle school to lawyers and college professors, according to Gupta.

Writing assistance is a controversial topic among some schoolteachers, though Edakara at the University of Illinois admits he’s a regular user of QuillBot himself. “Everyone wants to be a better writer,” he says. “QuillBot makes our finished work simply better.”",artificial intelligence,crain's chicago business

Hair loss is undesirable for many men—and women—because one's hairstyle is often closely tied to their self-confidence. And while some people embrace it, others wish they could regrow their lost strands. Now, researchers reporting in Nano Letters have used artificial intelligence (AI) to predict compounds that could neutralize baldness-causing reactive oxygen species in the scalp. Using the best candidate, they constructed a proof-of-concept microneedle patch and effectively regenerated hair on mice.

Most people with substantial hair loss have the condition androgenic alopecia, also called male- or female-pattern baldness. In this condition, hair follicles can be damaged by androgens, inflammation or an overabundance of reactive oxygen species, such as oxygen free radicals.

When the levels of oxygen free radicals are too high, they can overwhelm the body's antioxidant enzymes that typically keep them in check. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is one of these enzymes, and researchers have recently created SOD mimics called ""nanozymes."" But so far, those that have been reported aren't very good at removing oxygen free radicals. So, Lina Wang, Zhiling Zhu and colleagues wanted to see whether machine learning, a form of AI, could help them design a better nanozyme for treating hair loss.

The researchers chose transition-metal thiophosphate compounds as potential nanozyme candidates. They tested machine-learning models with 91 different transition-metal, phosphate and sulfate combinations, and the techniques predicted that MnPS 3 would have the most powerful SOD-like ability.

Next, MnPS 3 nanosheets were synthesized through chemical vapor transport of manganese, red phosphorus and sulfur powders. In initial tests with human skin fibroblast cells, the nanosheets significantly reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species without causing harm.

Based on these results, the team prepared MnPS 3 microneedle patches and treated androgenic alopecia-affected mouse models with them. Within 13 days, the animals regenerated thicker hair strands that more densely covered their previously bald backsides than mice treated with testosterone or minoxidil. The researchers say that their study both produced a nanozyme treatment for regenerating hair, and indicated the potential for computer-based methods for use in the design of future nanozyme therapeutics.

Global Automotive Artificial Intelligence Market

Dublin, Nov. 04, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Automotive Artificial Intelligence Global Market Report 2022, By Type, By Process, By Technology, By Application"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The global automotive artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $1.42 billion in 2021 to $1.98 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.62%. The growth is mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The market is expected to reach $7.78 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 40.79%.

The main types of automotive artificial intelligence include automotive drive and ADAS. The different process of automotive artificial intelligence includes signal recognition, image recognition, and data mining. The different technologies used in automotive artificial intelligence include deep learning, machine learning, context awareness, computer vision, and natural language processing. The automotive artificial intelligence are used in semi-autonomous driving, autonomous driving and human machine interface.



North America was the largest region in the automotive artificial intelligence market in 2021. Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the forecast period. The regions covered in this report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa.



The growing demand for autonomous vehicles is expected to propel the growth of the automotive artificial intelligence market. Artificial intelligence has a wide range of applications in the automotive industry. As technology evolves, the automobile industry has taken advantage of new discoveries to provide new ways to make driving more autonomous. Using artificial intelligence to develop self-driving automobiles is one of them. A self-driving car (also known as an autonomous car or driverless car) is a vehicle that travels to locations without the need for a human driver by utilising a variety of sensors, radars, cameras, and artificial intelligence. For instance, according to Deloitte, the global automotive AI market will culminate in a total volume of around $27 billion in 2025. Therefore, a rise in demand for automotive cars drives the growth of automotive artificial intelligence.



Strategic collaborations between companies are a key trend gaining popularity in the automotive artificial intelligence market. Companies providing artificial automotive intelligence are undergoing partnerships and collaboration to develop new technologies and products. For instance, in May 2021, a mobile transportation company based in China and Volvo, an automobile manufacturing company based in Sweden, are involved in a partnership with automatic driving vehicles. Through this partnership, Volvo will provide Didi with XC90 SUVs fitted with steering and brake backup systems.

Story continues

The vehicles will be the first to use Didi Gemini, the ride-hailing company's new self-driving hardware platform, and will be tested with human safety drivers. In the other partnership, in February 2021, Volkswagen, a German-based automobile manufacturer, and Microsoft, an American multinational technology corporation that produces computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services, partnered to develop self-driving car software.

Was Real, And Steven Spielberg Kept It That Way

Few directors thrive at working with children quite like Steven Spielberg. From ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" and ""Empire of the Sun"" to ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" and ""The BFG,"" that Spielberg lad's films are littered with great performances from kid actors. In the cases of ""E.T."" and ""Empire of the Sun,"" a number of those same youths would grow up to become celebrated adult thespians in their own right.

So it was with Drew Barrymore, who came to fame playing Elliott's (Henry Thomas) excitable younger sister Gertie in ""E.T."" Part of what makes Spielberg's classic 1982 sci-fi film so moving is the way Barrymore and those around her convince you that E.T. is himself a living, breathing visitor from another planet. It's not just the cast's looks of awe, shock, and wonder (i.e. ""The Spielberg Face"") that gives their interactions with him their emotional power. You also believe he's just as real to the actors themselves as he is to their characters on-screen.

When it came to Barrymore, who was only six years old when ""E.T."" began filming in 1981, she wasn't exactly pretending. In a special 40-year anniversary reunion interview on ""The Drew Barrymore Show,"" Barrymore sat down with Thomas and their ""E.T."" co-stars Robert MacNaughton and Dee Wallace to talk about the movie. ""Now I believed E.T. was real. I really, really loved him,"" Barrymore remembered, adding that she would ""take lunch to him"" in-between shooting her scenes. Not wanting to shatter the illusion for her, Spielberg took steps to ensure E.T. would actually respond to her when she did this.",artificial intelligence,/film
70,Scientists Increasingly Can't Explain How AI Works,https://video-images.vice.com/articles/635ad0f9c5759a009aac7be8/lede/1666896451777-gettyimages-1202271610.jpeg?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0xeHc6MC43NXhoO2NlbnRlcixjZW50ZXImcmVzaXplPTEyMDA6KiZyZXNpemU9MTIwMDoq,01/11/2022,AI researchers are warning developers to focus more on how and why a system produces certain results than the fact that the system can accurately and rapidly produce them.,https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3pezm/scientists-increasingly-cant-explain-how-ai-works,"What's your favorite ice cream flavor? You might say vanilla or chocolate, and if I asked why, you’d probably say it’s because it tastes good. But why does it taste good, and why do you still want to try other flavors sometimes? Rarely do we ever question the basic decisions we make in our everyday lives, but if we did, we might realize that we can’t pinpoint the exact reasons for our preferences, emotions, and desires at any given moment.

These types of AI systems notoriously have issues because the data they are trained on are often inherently biased, mimicking the racial and gender biases that exist within our society. The haphazard deployment of them leads to situations where, to use just one example, Black people are disproportionately misidentified by facial recognition technology. It becomes difficult to fix these systems in part because their developers often cannot fully explain how they work, which makes accountability difficult. As AI systems become more complex and humans become less able to understand them, AI experts and researchers are warning developers to take a step back and focus more on how and why a system produces certain results than the fact that the system can accurately and rapidly produce them.

Most AI systems are black box models, which are systems that are viewed only in terms of their inputs and outputs. Scientists do not attempt to decipher the “black box,” or the opaque processes that the system undertakes, as long as they receive the outputs they are looking for. For example, if I gave a black box AI model data about every single ice cream flavor, and demographic data about economic, social, and lifestyle factors for millions of people, it could probably guess what your favorite ice cream flavor is or where your favorite ice cream store is, even if it wasn’t programmed with that intention.

There's a similar problem in artificial intelligence: The people who develop AI are increasingly having problems explaining how it works and determining why it has the outputs it has. Deep neural networks (DNN)—made up of layers and layers of processing systems trained on human-created data to mimic the neural networks of our brains—often seem to mirror not just human intelligence but also human inexplicability.

“If all we have is a ‘black box’, it is impossible to understand causes of failure and improve system safety,” Roman V. Yampolskiy, a professor of computer science at the University of Louisville, wrote in his paper titled “Unexplainability and Incomprehensibility of Artificial Intelligence.” “Additionally, if we grow accustomed to accepting AI’s answers without an explanation, essentially treating it as an Oracle system, we would not be able to tell if it begins providing wrong or manipulative answers.”

Black box models can be extremely powerful, which is how many scientists and companies justify sacrificing explainability for accuracy. AI systems have been used for autonomous cars, customer service chatbots, and diagnosing disease, and have the power to perform some tasks better than humans can. For example, a machine that is capable of remembering one trillion items, such as digits, letters, and words, versus humans , who on average remember seven in their short-term memory would be able to process and compute information at a much faster and improved rate than humans. Among the different deep learning models include generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are most often used to train generative AI models, such as text-to-image generator MidJourney AI . GANs essentially pit AI models against each other to do a specific task; the ""winner"" of each interaction is then pitted against another model, allowing the model to iterate itself until it becomes very good at doing that task. The issue is that this creates models that their developers simply can't explain.

“If business leaders and data scientists don’t understand why and how AI calculates the outputs it does, that creates potential risk for the business. A lack of explainability limits AI’s potential value, by inhibiting the development and trust in the AI tools that companies deploy,” Beena Ammanath, executive director of the Deloitte AI Institute, told Motherboard.

When we put our trust in a system simply because it gives us answers that fit what we are looking for, we fail to ask key questions: Are these responses reliable, or do they just tell us what we want to hear? Whom do the results ultimately benefit? And who is responsible if it causes harm?

“I think in a lot of cases, people look to these black box models as a response to lack of resources. It would be very convenient to have an automated system that can produce the kinds of outputs they're looking for from the kind of inputs they have,” Emily M. Bender, a professor of linguistics at the University of Washington, told Motherboard. “If you have a dataset consisting of such inputs and outputs, it's always possible to train a black box system that can produce outputs of the right type—but often much, much harder to evaluate whether they are correct. Furthermore, there are lots of cases where it's impossible to make a system where the outputs would be reliably correct because the inputs just don't contain enough information.”

AI systems are already deeply entrenched with bias and are constantly reproducing such bias in their output without developers understanding how. In a groundbreaking 2018 study called “Gender Shades,” researchers Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru found that popular facial recognition systems most accurately detected males with lighter skin and had the highest errors detecting females with darker skin. Facial recognition systems, which are skewed against people of color and have been used for everything from housing to policing, deepen pre-existing racial biases by determining who is more likely to get a house or be identified as a criminal, for example. Predictive AI systems can also guess a person’s race based on X-rays and CT scans , but scientists have no idea why or how this is the case. Black and female patients are less likely to receive an accurate diagnosis from automated systems that analyze medical images, and we're not sure why. These are just a few examples of how viewing AI-generated results as concrete data without understanding the system’s potential biases creates rippling societal consequences.

“The risks are that the system may be making decisions using values we disagree with, such as biased (e.g. racist or sexist) decisions. Another risk is that the system may be making a very bad decision, but we cannot intervene because we do not understand its reasoning,” Jeff Clune, an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, told Motherboard.

Though there is already a subset of AI known as Explainable AI (XAI), the general techniques it promotes are often diminutive and inaccurate in encompassing the true breadth of the processes, and AI developers are not incentivized to follow this model. The issue with explainability has to do with the fact that because AI systems have become so complex, blanket explanations only increase the power differential between AI systems and their creators, and AI developers and their users. In other words, seeking to add explainability after an AI system is already in place makes it more difficult to approach than if you start with it.

“There are many tasks right now where black box approaches are far and away better than interpretable models,” Clune said. “The gap can be large enough that black box models are the only option, assuming that an application is not feasible unless the capabilities of the model are good enough. Even in cases where the interpretable models are more competitive, there is usually a tradeoff between capability and interpretability. People are working on closing that gap, but I suspect it will remain for the foreseeable future, and potentially will always exist.”

“A lot of the explanations that people treat as explanations really aren't. They are reductive, they are written to the interests of the developers and what the developers think are important to explain, rather than what the user needs,” Os Keyes, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington's Department of Human Centered Design & Engineering, told Motherboard. “Arguably, I'd say there are two big changes to AI that would be necessary to change this state of affairs, and the first is that, ultimately, this is in part a problem of the massive gap in practice between developers and actual users.”

AI researchers say giving users who are impacted by a certain system a bigger role in participating in the development process is an important first step in making AI systems that are more transparent and adequately represent user needs.

In recent years there's been a small but real push by some in the industry to develop ""white-box models,"" which are more transparent and whose outputs can be better explained (it's worth mentioning that the white-box / black-box terminology is in itself part of a long history of racially coded terms in science ; researchers have pushed to change ""blacklist"" to ""blocklist,"" for example.) White-box models, nonetheless, are a relatively new branch of AI research that are seeking to make AI more explainable .

“Maybe the answer is to abandon the illusion of explanation, and instead focus on more rigorously testing the reliability, biases, and performance of models, as we try to do with humans,” Clune said.

In other words, if you build explainable AI with a one-size-fits-all design process, “you end up with something where it has explanations that only make sense to one group of people who are involved in the system in practice,” said Keyes. “The internal change is a [much] broader set of involvement in deciding explainable to whom, and what does explainable mean.”

A more challenging problem is that many AI systems are designed for the concept of universalism—the idea that “[a] system is good if it works everywhere for everyone at all times” Keyes explained. “But the problem is that that's not how reality works, different people are going to need different explanations of different things. If we really want AI to be more explainable, we actually have to really, fundamentally change how we imagine and how developers imagine AI.”

Ammanath agrees that some of the best practices in fostering explainability include tailoring explanations and reporting to the people who will engage with or be impacted by the automated systems. Along the same line, she said, developers need to first identify the needs and priorities of the people who will be most affected.

“Broader participation in not just building the system, but also asking, what questions are interesting, what things need to be possible for this to really be explainable,” Keyes added. “That would make a massive difference.”

Keyes’ call for more localized AI systems and their concern about the universality of AI models is what researchers have been warning us about in the past few years. In a 2021 paper co-authored by Bender and Gebru, who was terminated from Google for publishing this research, the authors argue that training AI models with big data make it difficult to audit for embedded biases. They wrote that big data also fails to represent populations that have less access to the internet and “overrepresents younger users and those from developed countries.”

“If we orient knowledge and AI around big data, then we're always going to bias towards those who have the resources to spin up a thousand servers, or those who have the resources to, you know, get a billion images and train them,” said Keyes. “There's something fundamentally, I'd say undemocratic, but I'd also say just badly incentivized in that.”

“The question first is, what are the conditions under which AI is developed? Who gets to decide when it's deployed? And with what reasoning? Because if we can't answer that, then all good intentions in the world around how do we live with that [AI] are all screwed,” they added. “[I]f we're not participating in those conversations, then it's a losing game. All you can do is have something that works for people with power, and silences the people who don't.”

Debiasing the datasets that AI systems are trained on is near impossible in a society whose Internet reflects inherent, continuous human bias. Besides using smaller datasets, in which developers can have more control in deciding what appears in them, experts say a solution is to design with bias in mind, rather than feign impartiality.

“The approach I currently think is the best is to have the system learn to do what we want it to,” Clune said. “That means it tries to do what we ask it to (for example, generate pictures of CEOs) and if it does not do what we like (e.g. generating all white males), we give it negative feedback and it learns and tries again. We repeat that process until it is doing something we approve of (e.g. returning a set of pictures of CEOs that represents the diversity in the world we want to reflect). This is called ‘reinforcement learning through human feedback’, because the system is effectively using trial and error learning to bring its outputs in line with our values. It is far from perfect, and much more research and innovation is required to improve things.”

As we continue to negotiate where and how AI should be used, there are many things to consider before we start letting AI hire people or decide who to give loans to.

“I think it is absolutely critical to start by keeping in mind that what gets called ‘AI’ isn't any kind of autonomous agent, or intelligence, or thinking entity,” Bender said. “These are tools, which can serve specific purposes. As with any other tools, we should be asking: How well do they work? How suited are they to the task at hand? Who are they designed to be used by? And: How can their use reinforce or disrupt systems of oppression?”",artificial intelligence,vice news

But now we are entering a new era that will more closely resemble the tumultuous and dark decades between 1914 and 1945.

NEW YORK – Severe megathreats are imperiling our future – not just our jobs, incomes, wealth, and the global economy, but also the relative peace, prosperity, and progress achieved over the past 75 years. Many of these threats were not even on our radar during the prosperous post-World War II era. I grew up in the Middle East and Europe from the late 1950s to the early 1980s, and I never worried about climate change potentially destroying the planet. Most of us had barely even heard of the problem, and greenhouse-gas emissions were still relatively low, compared to where they would soon be.

Moreover, after the US-Soviet détente and US President Richard Nixon’s visit to China in the early 1970s, I never really worried about another war among great powers, let alone a nuclear one. The term “pandemic” didn’t register in my consciousness, either, because the last major one had been in 1918. And I didn’t fathom that artificial intelligence might someday destroy most jobs and render Homo sapiens obsolete, because those were the years of the long “AI winter.”

Similarly, terms like “deglobalization” and “trade war” had no purchase during this period. Trade liberalization had been in full swing since the Great Depression, and it would soon lead to the hyper-globalization that began in the 1990s. Debt crises posed no threat, because private and public debt-to-GDP ratios were low in advanced economies and emerging markets, and growth was robust. No one had to worry about the massive build-up of implicit debt, in the form of unfunded liabilities from pay-as-you-go social security and health-care systems. The supply of young workers was rising, the share of the elderly was still low, and robust, mostly unrestricted immigration from the Global South to the North would continue to prop up the labor market in advanced economies.

Against this backdrop, economic cycles were contained, and recessions were short and shallow, except for during the stagflationary decade of the 1970s; but even then, there were no debt crises in advanced economies, because debt ratios were low. The kind of financial cycles that lead to crises were contained not just in advanced economies but even in emerging markets, owing to the low leverage, low risk-taking, solid financial regulation, capital controls, and various forms of financial repression that prevailed during this period. The advanced economies were strong liberal democracies that were free of extreme partisan polarization. Populism and authoritarianism were confined to a benighted cohort of poorer countries.

Goodbye to All That

Fast-forward from this relatively “golden” period between 1945 and 1985 to late 2022, and you will immediately notice that we are awash in new, extreme megathreats that were not previously on anyone’s mind. The world has entered what I call a geopolitical depression, with (at least) four dangerous revisionist powers – China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea – challenging the economic, financial, security, and geopolitical order that the United States and its allies created after WWII.

There is a sharply rising risk not only of war among great powers but of a nuclear conflict. In the coming year, Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine could escalate into an unconventional conflict that directly involves NATO. And Israel – and perhaps the US – may decide to launch strikes against Iran, which is on its way to building a nuclear bomb.

With Chinese President Xi Jinping further consolidating his authoritarian rule, and with the US tightening its trade restrictions against China, the new Sino-American cold war is getting colder by the day. Worse, it could all too easily turn hot over the status of Taiwan, which Xi is committed to reuniting with the mainland, and which US President Joe Biden is apparently committed to defending. Meanwhile, nuclear-armed North Korea has once again been seeking attention by firing rockets over Japan and South Korea.

Cyberwarfare occurs daily between these revisionist powers and the West, and many other countries have adopted a non-aligned posture toward Western-led sanctions regimes. From our contingent vantage point in the middle of all these events, we don’t yet know if World War III has already begun in Ukraine. That determination will be left to future historians – if there are any.

Even discounting the threat of nuclear Armageddon, the risk of an environmental Apocalypse is becoming increasingly serious, especially given that most of the talk about net-zero and ESG (environment, social, and governance) investing is just greenwashing – or greenwishing. The new greenflation is already in full swing, because it turns out that amassing the metals needed for the energy transition requires a lot of expensive energy.

There is also a growing risk of new pandemics that would be worse than biblical plagues, owing to the link between environmental destruction and zoonotic diseases. Wildlife, carrying dangerous pathogens, are coming into closer and more frequent contact with humans and livestock. That is why we have experienced more frequent and virulent pandemics and epidemics (HIV, SARS, MERS, swine flu, bird flu, Zika, Ebola, COVID-19) since the early 1980s. All the evidence suggests that this problem will become even worse in the future. Indeed, owing to the melting of Siberian permafrost, we may soon be confronting dangerous viruses and bacteria that have been locked away for millennia.

Moreover, geopolitical conflicts and national-security concerns are fueling trade, financial, and technology wars, and accelerating the deglobalization process. The return of protectionism and the Sino-American decoupling will leave the global economy, supply chains, and markets more balkanized and fragmented. The buzzwords “friend-shoring” and “secure and fair trade” have replaced “offshoring” and “free trade.”

But on the domestic front, advances in AI, robotics, and automation will destroy more and more jobs, even if policymakers build higher protectionist walls in an effort to fight the last war. By both restricting immigration and demanding more domestic production, aging advanced economies will create a stronger incentive for companies to adopt labor-saving technologies. While routine jobs are obviously at risk, so, too, are any cognitive jobs that can be unbundled into discrete tasks, and even many creative jobs. AI language models like GPT-3 can already write better than most humans and will almost certainly displace many jobs and sources of income. In due course, some scientists believe that Homo sapiens will be rendered entirely obsolete by the rise of artificial general intelligence or machine super-intelligence – though this is a highly contentious subject of debate.

Thus, over time, economic malaise will deepen, inequality will rise even further, and more white- and blue-collar workers will be left behind.

Hard Choices, Hard Landings

The macroeconomic situation is no better. For the first time since the 1970s, we are facing high inflation and the prospect of a recession – stagflation. The increased inflation in advanced economies wasn’t “transitory.” It is persistent, driven by a combination of bad policies – excessively loose monetary, fiscal, and credit policies that were kept in place for too long – and bad luck. No one could have anticipated how much the initial COVID-19 shock would curtail the supply of goods and labor and create bottlenecks in global supply chains. The same goes for Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, which caused a sharp spike in energy, food, fertilizers, industrial metals, and other commodities. Meanwhile, China has continued its “zero-COVID” policy, which is creating additional supply bottlenecks.

While both demand and supply factors were in the mix, it is now widely recognized that the supply factors have played an increasingly decisive role. This matters for the economic outlook, because supply-driven inflation is stagflationary and thus increases the risk that monetary-policy tightening will produce a hard landing (increased unemployment and potentially a recession).

What will follow from the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks’ current tightening? Until recently, most central banks and most of Wall Street belonged to “Team Soft Landing.” But the consensus has rapidly shifted, with even Fed Chair Jerome Powell recognizing that a recession is possible, that a soft landing will be “very challenging,” and that everyone should prepare for some “pain” ahead. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s model shows a high probability of a hard landing, and the Bank of England has expressed similar views about the United Kingdom. Several prominent Wall Street institutions have also now made a recession their baseline scenario (the most likely outcome if all other variables are held constant).

History, too, points to deeper problems ahead. For the past 60 years in the US, whenever inflation has been above 5% (it is above 8% today), and unemployment has been below 5% (it is now 3.5%), any attempt by the Fed to bring inflation down toward its 2% target has caused a recession. Thus, a hard landing is much more likely than a soft landing, both in the US and across most other advanced economies.

Sticky Stagflation

In addition to the short-term factors, negative supply shocks and demand factors in the medium term will cause inflation to persist. On the supply side, I count eleven negative supply shocks that will reduce potential growth and increase the costs of production. Among these is the backlash against hyper-globalization, which has been gaining momentum and creating opportunities for populist, nativist, and protectionist politicians, and growing public anger over stark income and wealth inequalities, which is leading to more policies to support workers and the “left behind.” However well-intentioned, such measures will contribute to a dangerous wage-price spiral.

Other sources of persistent inflation include rising protectionism (from both the left and the right), which has restricted trade, impeded the movement of capital, and heightened political resistance to immigration, which in turn has put additional upward pressure on wages. National-security and strategic considerations have further restricted flows of technology, data, and talent, and new labor and environmental standards, as important as they may be, are hampering both trade and new construction.

This balkanization of the global economy is deeply stagflationary, and it is coinciding with demographic aging, not just in developed countries but also in large emerging economies such as China. Because young people tend to produce and save more, whereas older people spend down their savings and require many more expensive services in health care and other sectors, this trend, too, will lead to higher prices and slower growth.

Today’s geopolitical turmoil further complicates matters. The disruptions to trade and the spike in commodity prices following Russia’s invasion were not just a one-off phenomenon. The same threats to harvests and food shipments that arose in 2022 may well persist in 2023. Moreover, if China does finally end its zero-COVID policy and begin to restart its economy, a surge in demand for many commodities will add to the global inflationary pressures. There is also no end in sight for Sino-Western decoupling, which is accelerating across all dimensions of trade (goods, services, capital, labor, technology, data, and information). And, of course, Iran, North Korea, and other strategic rivals to the West could soon contribute in their own ways to the global havoc.

Now that the US dollar has been fully weaponized for strategic and national-security purposes, its position as the main global reserve currency could eventually begin to decline, and a weaker dollar would of course add to inflationary pressures in the US. More broadly, a frictionless world trading system requires a frictionless financial system. But sweeping primary and secondary sanctions have thrown sand in what was once a well-oiled machine, massively increasing the transaction costs of trade.

On top of it all, climate change, too, will create persistent stagflationary pressures. Droughts, heat waves, hurricanes, and other disasters are increasingly disrupting economic activity and threatening harvests (thus driving up food prices). At the same time, demands for decarbonization have led to underinvestment in fossil-fuel capacity before investment in renewables has reached the point where they can make up the difference. Today’s large energy-price spikes were inevitable.

The increased likelihood of future pandemics also represents a persistent source of stagflation, especially considering how little has been done to prevent or prepare for the next one. The next contagious outbreak will lend further momentum to protectionist policies as countries rush to close borders and hoard critical supplies of food, medicines, and other essential goods.

Finally, cyberwarfare remains an underappreciated threat to economic activity and even public safety. Firms and governments will either face more stagflationary disruptions to production, or they will have to spend a fortune on cybersecurity. Either way, costs will rise.

The Worst of All Possible Economies

When the recession comes, it will not be short and shallow but long and severe. Not only are we facing persistent short- and medium-term negative supply shocks, but we are also heading into the mother of all debt crises, owing to soaring private and public debt ratios over the last few decades. Low debt ratios spared us from that outcome in the 1970s. And though we certainly had debt crises following the 2008 crash – the result of excessive household, bank, and government debt – we also had deflation. It was a demand shock and a credit crunch that could be met with massive monetary, fiscal, and credit easing.

Today, we are experiencing the worst elements of both the 1970s and 2008. Multiple, persistent negative supply shocks have coincided with debt ratios that are even higher than they were during the global financial crisis. These inflationary pressures are forcing central banks to tighten monetary policy even though we are heading into a recession. That makes the current situation fundamentally different from both the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 crisis. Everyone should be preparing for what may come to be remembered as the Great Stagflationary Debt Crisis.

While central banks have been at pains to sound more hawkish, we should be skeptical of their professed willingness to fight inflation at any cost. Once they find themselves in a debt trap, they will have to blink. With debt ratios so high, fighting inflation will cause an economic and financial crash that will be deemed politically unacceptable. Major central banks will feel as though they have no choice but to backpedal, and inflation, the debasement of fiat currencies, boom-bust cycles, and financial crises will become even more severe and frequent.

The inevitability of central banks wimping out was recently on display in the United Kingdom. Faced with the market reaction to the Truss government’s reckless fiscal stimulus, the BOE had to launch an emergency quantitative-easing (QE) program to buy up government bonds. That sad episode confirmed that in the UK, as in many other countries, monetary policy is increasingly subject to fiscal capture.

Recall that a similar turnaround occurred in 2019, when the Fed, after previously signaling continued rate hikes and quantitative-tightening, stopped its QT program and started pursuing a mix of backdoor QE and policy-rate cuts at the first sign of mild financial pressures and a growth slowdown. Central banks will talk tough; but, in a world of excessive debt and risks of an economic and financial crash, there is good reason to doubt their willingness to do “whatever it takes” to return inflation to its target rate.

With governments unable to reduce high debts and deficits by spending less or raising revenues, those that can borrow in their own currency will increasingly resort to the “inflation tax”: relying on unexpected price growth to wipe out long-term nominal liabilities at fixed interest rates.

How will financial markets and prices of equities and bonds perform in the face of rising inflation and the return of stagflation? It is likely that, as in the stagflation of the 1970s, both components of any traditional asset portfolio will suffer, potentially incurring massive losses. Inflation is bad for bond portfolios, which will take losses as yields increase and prices fall, as well as for equities, whose valuations are hurt by rising interest rates.

For the first time in decades, a 60/40 portfolio of equities and bonds suffered massive losses in 2022, because bond yields have surged while equities have gone into a bear market. By 1982, at the peak of the stagflation decade, the average S&P 500 firm’s price-to-earnings ratio was down to eight; today, it is closer to 20, which suggests that the bear market could end up being even more protracted and severe. Investors will need to find assets to hedge against inflation, political and geopolitical risks, and environmental damage: these include short-term government bonds and inflation-indexed bonds, gold and other precious metals, and real estate that is resilient to environmental damage.

The Moment of Truth

In any case, these megathreats will further contribute to rising income and wealth inequality, which has already been putting severe pressure on liberal democracies (as those left behind revolt against elites), and fueling the rise of radical and aggressive populist regimes. One can find right-wing manifestations of this trend in Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, the US (under Donald Trump), post-Brexit Britain, and many other countries; and left-wing manifestations in Argentina, Venezuela, Peru, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and now Brazil (which has just replaced a right-wing populist with a left-wing one).

And, of course, Xi’s authoritarian stranglehold has given the lie to the old idea that Western engagement with a fast-growing China would ineluctably lead that country to open itself up even more to markets and, eventually, to democratic processes. Under Xi, China shows every sign of becoming more closed off, and more aggressive on geopolitical, security, and economic matters.

How did it come to this? Part of the problem is that we have long had our heads stuck in the sand. Now, we need to make up for lost time. Without decisive action, we will be heading into a period that is less like the four decades after WWII than like the three decades between 1914 and 1945. That period gave us World War I; the Spanish flu pandemic; the 1929 Wall Street crash; the Great Depression; massive trade and currency wars; inflation, hyperinflation, and deflation; financial and debt crises, leading to massive meltdowns and defaults; and the rise of authoritarian militarist regimes in Italy, Germany, Japan, Spain, and elsewhere, culminating in WWII and the Holocaust.

In this new world, the relative peace, prosperity, and rising global welfare that we have taken for granted will be gone; most of it already is. If we don’t stop the multi-track slow-motion train wreck that is threatening the global economy and our planet at large, we will be lucky to have only a repeat of the stagflationary 1970s. Far more likely is an echo of the 1930s and the 1940s, only now with all the massive disruptions from climate change added to the mix.

Avoiding a dystopian scenario will not be easy. While there are potential solutions to each megathreat, most are costly in the short run and will deliver benefits only over the long run. Many also require technological innovations that are not yet available or in place, starting with those needed to halt or reverse climate change. Complicating matters further, today’s megathreats are interconnected, and therefore best addressed in a systematic and coherent fashion. Domestic leadership, in both the private and public sector, and international cooperation among great powers is necessary to prevent the coming Apocalypse.

Yet there are many domestic and international obstacles standing in the way of policies that would allow for a less dystopian (though still contested and conflictual) future. Thus, while a less bleak scenario is obviously desirable, a clear-headed analysis indicates that dystopia is much more likely than a happier outcome. The years and decades ahead will be marked by a stagflationary debt crisis and related megathreats – war, pandemics, climate change, disruptive AI, and deglobalization – all of which will be bad for jobs, economies, markets, peace, and prosperity.",artificial intelligence,project syndicate

The post A virtual lifeguard uses AI and computer vision appeared first on Springwise.",https://www.springwise.com/innovation/travel-tourism/a-virtual-lifeguard-uses-ai-and-computer-vision/,"Spotted: MYLO, the world’s first virtual lifeguard for home pools, alerts owners when someone enters the water and when a swimmer appears to be in trouble. Using above and below water cameras, along with real-time video and artificial intelligence (AI) swimming knowledge, the system spots potential problems before they become fatal. The AI-powered system sends wi-fi alerts and sounds the alarm when anyone in the water moves in a manner that indicates panic.

Alerts about entries to the pool are only sent when the pool has been empty and still for more than five minutes, indicating that no one is using it. When a group of people are enjoying the space, and children are going in and out of the pool, alerts will not be sent. Should someone sink to the bottom of the pool and remain motionless for more than 15 seconds, a loud alarm will sound on the home unit as well as the poolside unit, indicating an emergency. Alerts will also be set to paired devices, and there is no limit to the number that can be linked.

The company emphasises that the system is meant to be used in conjunction with adult supervision, not as a replacement. MYLO is available for pre-order with distribution beginning in quarter two of 2023.

Other smart home systems that Springwise have spotted include an indoor composting robot for use in urban areas and heat-emitting wallpaper that helps reduce electricity bills and carbon emissions.

77,Learning to Imitate,http://ai.stanford.edu/blog//assets/img/posts/2022-11-01-learning-to-imitate/approach.png,06/11/2022,The official Stanford AI Lab blog,http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/learning-to-imitate/,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) playing Minecraft and exploring the world to find caves after being trained on only a few videos of human players, using our new approach (IQ-Learn). Many approaches have difficulty doing anything in an open-world Minecraft map, but IQ-Learn can navigate the world with ease.

A key aspect of human learning is imitation: the capability to mimic and learn behavior from a teacher or an expert. This is an important ability for acquiring new skills, such as walking, biking, or speaking a new language. Although current Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are capable of complex decision-making, such as mastering Go, playing complex strategic games like Starcraft, or manipulating a Rubik’s cube, these systems often require over 100 million interactions with an environment to train — equivalent of more than 100 years of human experience — to reach human-level performance. In contrast, a human can acquire new skills in relatively short amounts of time by observing an expert. How can we enable our artificial agents to similarly acquire such fast learning ability?

Another challenge with current AI systems is that they require explicit programming or hand-designing of reward functions in-order to make correct decisions. These methodologies are frequently brittle, or otherwise imperfect, and can lead to these systems struggling to work well in complex situations — with self-driving cars blockading roads, or robots failing to coordinate with humans. Developing new methods that can instead interactively learn from human or expert data can be a key stepping stone towards sample-efficient agents and learning human-like behavior.

In this post, I’ll discuss several techniques being developed in a field called “Imitation Learning” (IL) to solve these sorts of problems and present a recent method from our lab, called Inverse Q-Learning — which was used to create the best AI agent for playing Minecraft using few expert demos. You can check out the project page here, and the code for the underlying method here.

So, what is imitation learning, and what has it been used for?

In imitation learning (IL), an agent is given access to samples of expert behavior (e.g. videos of humans playing online games or cars driving on the road) and it tries to learn a policy that mimics this behavior. This objective is in contrast to reinforcement learning (RL), where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes a specified reward function. A major advantage of imitation learning is that it does not require careful hand-design of a reward function because it relies solely on expert behavior data, making it easier to scale to real-world tasks where one is able to gather expert behavior (like video games or driving). This approach of enabling the development of AI systems by data-driven learning, rather than specification through code or heuristic rewards, is consistent with the key principles behind Software 2.0.

Imitation learning has been a key component in developing AI methods for decades, with early approaches dating back to the 1990s and early 2000s, including work by work by Andrew Ng and Stuart Russel, and the creation of the first self-driving car systems. Recently, imitation learning has become an important topic with increasing real-world utility, with papers using the technique for driving autonomous cars, enabling robotic locomotion, playing video games, manipulating objects, and even robotic surgery.

Imitation Learning as Supervision

Early approaches to imitation learning seek to learn a policy as a machine learning model that maps environment observations to (optimal) actions taken by the expert using supervised learning. The method is called Behavioral Cloning (BC), but it has a drawback: BC has loose, or no, guarantees that the model will generalize to unseen environmental observations. A key issue is that when the agent ends up in an situation that is unlike any of the expert trajectories, BC is prone to failures. For example, in the figure above, the car agent doesn’t know what to do if it goes away from the expert trajectory and it crashes. To avoid making a mistake, BC requires expert data on all possible trajectories in the environment, making it a heavily data-inefficient approach.

A simple fix, Dataset Aggregation (DAGGER), was proposed to interactively collect more expert data to recover from mistakes and was used to create the first autonomous drone that could navigate forests. Nevertheless, this requires a human in the loop and such interactive access to an expert is usually infeasible. Instead, we want to emulate the trial-and-error process that humans use to fix mistakes. For the above example, if the car agent can interact with the environment to learn “if I do this then I crash,” then it could correct itself to avoid that behavior.

This insight led to the formulation of imitation learning as a problem to learn a reward function from the expert data, such that a policy that optimizes the reward through environment interaction matches the expert, thus inverting the reinforcement learning problem; this approach is termed Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL).

How do recent Imitation Approaches using IRL work?

In 2016, Ho and Ermon posed Inverse Reinforcement Learning as a minimax game between two AI models with simple parallels to GANs — a class of generative models. In this formulation, the agent policy model (the “generator”) produces actions interacting with an environment to attain the highest rewards from a reward model using RL, while the reward model (the “discriminator”) attempts to distinguish the agent policy behavior from expert behavior. Similar to GANs, the discriminator acts as a reward model that indicates how expert-like an action is.

Thus, if the policy does something that is not expert-like, it gets a low reward from the discriminator and learns to correct this behavior. This minimax game has a unique equilibrium solution called the saddle point solution (due to the geometrical saddle shape of the optimization). At the equilibrium, the discriminator learns a reward such that the policy behavior based on it is indistinguishable from the expert. With this adversarial learning of a policy and a discriminator, it is possible to reach expert performance using few demonstrations. Techniques inspired by such are referred to as Adversarial Imitation. (see the figure below for an illustration of the method)

Set-up of Adversarial Imitation Learning with an agent and a discriminator playing a minimax game. The discriminator learns to distinguish the policy and expert behavior, giving a reward on how expert-like an action is, whereas the agent learns a policy using the discriminator rewards to produce more expert-like behavior.

Unfortunately, as adversarial imitation is based on GANs, it suffers from the same limitations, such as mode collapse and training instability, and so training requires careful hyperparameter tuning and tricks like gradient penalization. Furthermore, the process of reinforcement learning complicates training because it is not possible to train the generator here through simple gradient descent. This amalgamation of GANs and RL makes for a very brittle combination, which does not work well in complex image-based environments like Atari. Because of these challenges, Behavioral Cloning remains the most prevalent method of imitation.

Learning Q-functions for Imitation

These issues, recently, have led to a new non-adversarial approach for imitation: learning Q-functions to recover expert behavior.

In RL, Q-functions measure the expected sum of future rewards an agent can obtain starting from the current state and choosing a particular action. By learning Q-functions using a neural network that takes in the current state and a potential action of the agent as input, one can predict the overall expected future reward obtained by the agent. Because the prediction is of the overall reward, as opposed to only the reward for taking that one step, determining the optimal policy is as simple as sequentially taking actions with the highest predicted Q-function values in the current state. This optimal policy can be represented as the argmax over all possible actions for a Q-function in a given state. Thus, the Q-function is a very useful quantity, providing a connection between the reward function and the optimal behavior policy in an environment.

In IL, a simple, stable, and data-efficient approach has always been out of reach because of the above-mentioned issues with previous approaches. Additionally, the instability of adversarial methods makes the Inverse RL formulation hard to solve. A non-adversarial approach to IL could likely resolve many of the challenges the field faces. Is there something to learn for IL from the remarkable success of Q-functions in RL to determine the optimal behavior policy from a reward function?

Inverse Q-Learning (IQ-Learn)

To determine reward functions, what if we directly learn a Q-function from expert behavior data? This is exactly the idea behind our recently proposed algorithm, Inverse Q-Learning (IQ-Learn). Our key insight is that not only can the Q-function represent the optimal behavior policy but it can also represent the reward function, as the mapping from single-step rewards to Q-functions is bijective for a given policy. This can be used to avoid the difficult minimax game over the policy and reward functions seen in the Adversarial Imitation formulation, by expressing both using a single variable: the Q-function. Plugging this change of variables into the original Inverse RL objective leads to a much simpler minimization problem over just the single Q-function; which we refer to as the Inverse Q-learning problem. Our Inverse Q-learning problem shares a one-to-one correspondence with the minimax game of adversarial IL in that each potential Q-function can be mapped to a pair of discriminator and generator networks. This means that we maintain the generality and unique equilibrium properties of IRL while resulting in a simple non-adversarial algorithm that may be used for imitation.

Below is a visualization to intuitively understand our approach – existing IRL methods solve an involved minimax game over policy (\(\pi\)) and rewards (\(r\)), finding a policy that matches expert behavior at the unique saddle point solution (\(\pi^*\), \(r^*\)) by utilizing RL (shown in left). IQ-Learn proposes a simple transformation from rewards to Q-functions to instead solve this problem over the policy (\(\pi\)) and the Q-function (\(Q\)) to find the corresponding solution (\(\pi^*\), \(Q^*\)) (shown in right). Now crucially, if we know the Q-function then we explicitly know the optimal policy for it: this optimal policy is to simply choose the (softmax) action that maximizes the Q-function in the given state . Thus, IQ-Learn removes the need for RL to find the policy!

Now, instead of optimizing over the space of all possible rewards and policies, we only need to optimize along a manifold in this space corresponding to the choice of a Q-function and the optimal policy for it (the red line). The new objective along the manifold \(\mathcal{J}^*\) is concave and dependent only on the Q-function variable, allowing the use of simple gradient descent methods to find the unique optima.

Diagram of the IQ-Learn approach. We show the IRL problem (on left) and the IQ-Learn problem (on right). The red line denotes the optimal policy manifold given as the softmax action of Q.

During the course of learning, for discrete action spaces, IQ-Learn optimizes the objective \(\mathcal{J}^*\), taking gradient steps on the manifold with respect to the Q-function (the green lines) converging to the globally optimal saddle point. For continuous action spaces calculating the exact gradients is often intractable and IQ-Learn additionally learns a policy network. It updates the Q-function (the green lines) and the policy (the blue lines) separately to remain close to the manifold. You can read the technical proofs and implementation details in our paper.

IQ-Learn methodology for discrete (on left) and continuous (on right) action spaces.

This approach is quite simple and needs only a modified update rule to train a Q-network using expert demonstrations and, optionally, environment interactions. The IQ-Learn update is a form of contrastive learning, where expert behavior is assigned a large reward, and the policy behavior a low reward; with rewards parametrized using Q-functions. It can be easily implemented in less than 15 lines on top of existing Q-learning algorithms in discrete action spaces, and soft actor-critic (SAC) methods for continuous action spaces.

IQ-Learn has a number of advantages:

It optimizes a single training objective using gradient descent and learns a single model for the Q-function.

It is performant with very sparse data — even single expert demonstrations.

It is simple to implement and can work in both settings: with access to an environment (online IL) or without (offline IL).

It scales to complex image-based environments and has proven theoretical convergence to a unique global optimum.

Lastly, it can be used to recover rewards and add interpretability to the policy’s behavior.

Despite the simplicity of the approach, we were surprised to find that it substantially outperformed a number of existing approaches on popular imitation learning benchmarks such as OpenAI Gym, MujoCo, and Atari, including approaches that were much more complex or domain-specific. In all these benchmarks, IQ-Learn was the only method to successfully reach expert performance by relying on a few expert demonstrations (less than 10). IQ-Learn with a simple LSTM policy also works surprisingly well in the complex open-world setting of Minecraft and is able to learn from videos of human players to solve various tasks like building a house, creating a waterfall, caging animals, and finding caves.

Beyond simple imitation, we also tried to imitate experts where only partial expert data is available or the expert has changes in its environment or goals compared to the agent — more akin to the real world. We were able to show that IQ-Learn can be used for imitation without expert actions, and relying solely on expert observations, enabling learning from videos. Moreover, IQ-Learn was surprisingly robust to distribution shifts in the expert behavior and goals in an environment, showing great generalization to new unseen settings and an ability to act as a meta-learner.





See videos of IQ-Learn below (trained with Image observations):





IQ-Learn on Atari. Our trained agent reaches human performance in all games (using 20 expert demos).





IQ-Learn on Minecraft solving the Create Waterfall task (using 20 expert demos).





IQ-Learn on Robomimic-Can task with a 6 DOF arm learning to pick and place cans in the correct bin (using 30 expert demos).





IQ-Learn on CarRacing Gym environment. Reaching expert driving on different race tracks (using 20 expert demos).

Performance Comparisions (from the paper):

The performance is measured as the environment reward attained by the agent trained using different methods.

The generality of our method — it can be combined with any existing Q-learning or actor-critic implementations — makes IQ-Learn applicable to a wide range of domains and learning objectives in imitation and reinforcement learning beyond those explored in the paper.

We hope that IQ-Learn’s simple approach to learning policies via imitation of a few experts will bring us one step closer to developing sample-efficient general AI agents that can learn a variety of behavior from humans in real-world settings.

Beginning in June, officials used Cann’s model to decide when two of Toronto’s most frequently contaminated beaches should be open to the public and when the water was unsafe.

Almost immediately, the experiment began to go awry. The model regularly declared the beaches safe to swim on days when history or the water’s appearance suggested it was not safe.

PRAGUE, Oct. 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Global technology company Daktela , which provides its own software for communication between companies and customers, customer experience management and internal communication, acquired a majority stake in Coworkers.ai. Coworkers.ai is a leader in the Czech market providing its own intelligent chatbots and voicebots. Its customers include Komerční banka, Kooperativa, Generali Česká pojišťovna, stavebniny DEK or the online supermarket Košík.cz. Coworkers.ai was founded in 2019 as an offshoot of the Artin company.

Leaders of Daktela and Coworkers.ai after acquisition signing

For Daktela, this is the first of many planned acquisitions, which, in addition to organic growth and global expansion, should place the company among the top 10 global providers of CCaaS services in the next five years. ""Our acquisition strategy has two parts. We are looking for companies with a similar focus and profile, as Daktela, in those foreign markets where we are not present today or where we are starting. The second type is technological acquisitions, which will help us fundamentally improve our product portfolio and scale our core business and Coworkers.ai is an example of this. Artificial intelligence is no longer a buzzword today and within a few years it will become a necessary reality in companies,"" explained David Hájek, co-founder and head of global expansion of Daktela, about the acquisition. His words are echoed by Gartner's analysis , which proclaimed that by 2026, 10% of customer and business communication should be automated due to artificial intelligence, which should save companies an estimated 80 billion US dollars.

Daktela will obtain Coworkers.ai three years after the first version of their solution was created. From the beginning, the Brno-based startup focused its energy primarily on the development of the product itself. The latter is unique in that it does not use any large commercial solution for artificial intelligence itself. Coworkers.ai managed to create its own technology for natural language processing (NLP) based on artificial intelligence. ""Thanks to this, our voicebots and chatbots are significantly 'smarter' than others and can solve even more complex requests. At the same time, we are a low-code platform, which means that practically anyone can handle the implementation in the company even without programming knowledge,"" Coworkers.ai co-founder Luboš Urbančok said, describing the product. In 2021, the startup's turnover was around half a million US dollars. In addition to the Czech Republic, the company also operates in Slovakia, where its solution is used, for example, by the largest mobile operator Orange. ""We believe that the strategic connection with Daktela will help us to grow multiple times. Especially thanks to the fact that we will offer our technology to Daktela's existing customers and enter foreign markets,"" added Urbančok.

Story continues

The cost of the transaction is in the order of millions of US dollars and Daktela acquired a 51% share of the company. The remaining shares will be divided between the co-founders Luboš Urbančok, Tomáš Lysek, Pavel Černý and the Artin company. The current management of Coworkers.ai will continue to take care of the further development and expansion of the company and the headquarters of the startup will remain in Brno. At the same time, this opens up an opportunity for Daktela to build a development hub in Brno and recruit talented programmers.

Daktela was represented by the law firm Řanda Havel Legal during the acquisition. Coworkers.ai collaborated with the legal consulting company Sedláková Legal.

About Daktela

Daktela, a global technology company, offers customers in-house communications software and cloud solutions for contact centers. It allows companies to take care of their customers using all available communication channels, such as voice, email, SMS, web chat, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp or Viber, all with native support in one web app. It currently serves more than 1,000 corporate customers of all sizes worldwide. Daktela has branches in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, the United Kingdom, Dubai and the Philippines. Daktela is owned by the founders Richard Baar and David Hájek and by the Slovak investment group Sandberg Capital. In 2021, the company's turnover was 10.3 million US dollars. More information can be found at: https://www.daktela.com

About Coworkers.ai

Coworkers.ai automates routine communication using conversational artificial intelligence. The first version of the Artin Chatbot solution was created in 2019 within the Artin development company.

After the product expanded to include voice and email channel automation, the unifying name of the platform – Coworkers.ai – was created. The founders first developed this brand within the Artin company and at the beginning of 2022, they created a separate company.

The post Using dolls to teach girls to code appeared first on Springwise.",https://www.springwise.com/innovation/education/using-dolls-to-teach-girls-to-code/,"Spotted: There is a big shortage of coders. According to the US Labor Department, the global shortage of software engineers is estimated to reach 85.2 million by 2030. A lot of this could be fixed by closing the gender gap in coding – it is estimated that women make up just 16 per cent of the IT Engineering workforce. Startup E-liza is hoping to change that – with a doll. The company builds dolls that include programmable computers that girls can code through an app.

Founder Eliza Kosoy, a PhD student studying child development and artificial intelligence, came up with the idea because she wanted a way for girls to learn about coding without having to give up their other interests. The doll, which is being launched on Kickstarter in 2023, operates using hardware embedded in each doll. It has a screen and is Bluetooth-enabled to receive code from a companion app.

Girls (and boys) can code the doll to perform various actions, such as acting as a security alarm. Built-in and add-on sensors extend the doll’s utility. For example, a heartbeat pulse sensor can be used to turn the doll into a lie detector.

Kosoy points out that the toy market is filled with STEM toys that are marketed specifically towards boys, and girls may like the opportunity to play with a toy designed for them.

Closing the STEM gender gap is the subject of a huge number of innovations covered here at Springwise. Ideas include a crowdfunding platform for STEM projects led by women and a predictive text app that reverses gendered language.

The post Global AI-powered weather predictor updates every 15 minutes appeared first on Springwise.",https://www.springwise.com/innovation/sustainability/ai-powered-weather-forecasting-model/,"Spotted: Being able to better track weather and predict near-future conditions allows communities to better plan for and respond to the natural disasters that are becoming more severe and frequent, partly as a result of climate change. One solution comes from Zurich-based climate tech data platform Jua. The company uses an artificial intelligence (AI) prediction model to create regularly updated, high-resolution weather forecasts.

Rather than simply tweaking existing methodologies, Jua has built an entirely new weather prediction platform. The new modelling system provides details of one square kilometre at a time and includes weather anywhere in the world. The platform uses tens of millions of sensors to provide high-resolution imagery. By comparison, current systems typically rely on hundreds of thousands of sensors.

More than 15 different parameters are tracked by the platform, including wind speed and direction, precipitation, and air pressure. The company adds new areas of information to the platform every quarter. The power of the AI solution contributes to significantly less computing energy use, despite providing greater volumes of data and levels of detail.

The platform is currently available on request with plans to release it more broadly in early 2023. In October 2022, the company closed a successful round of seed funding that raised €2.5 million to put towards the full platform launch.

As climate change continues to affect more and more communities, access to the highest quality, near-to-real-time data becomes ever more essential. Springwise has spotted projects facilitating this, from a weather data app for farmers to renewable energy predictions that help producers match supply with demand.

The post An app helps people charge their EVs when energy is cheapest and cleanest appeared first on Springwise.",https://www.springwise.com/innovation/mobility-transport/an-app-helps-people-charge-their-ev-at-the-best-time/,"Spotted: Electricity prices have soared since 2021, with a variety of factors pushing up costs and causing general volatility in the market. Countries with a heavier reliance on renewable energy sources generally saw smaller increases, whereas those still dependent largely on fossil fuels tended to experience sporadic spikes in prices. Now, Estonian smart energy company Gridio has a way to reduce costs while encouraging the use of electric vehicles.

The Gridio app tracks energy prices and automatically charges connected vehicles when prices are lowest and when the electricity is coming from renewable sources. An algorithm monitors national prices and supplies, automatically charging at the most efficient times. Users set their account to complete charging by a certain time, and the artificial intelligence (AI) identifies the best way to charge within those parameters.

The app currently works with eight brands of EV, with the company planning to add more as soon as possible. Free to use, car owners decide on two modes within the app – active all the time or active after a certain hour. The app can also connect to, track, and use solar power, so users with solar arrays can charge their vehicle from their own renewable energy source. The Smart Charging setting in the app can be turned off any time to enable a particularly quick charge.

Infrastructure challenges have meant that charging networks are not nearly as developed as EVs themselves. Innovators are seeking to overcome this challenge in a number of different ways, including through the use of an algorithm that helps city planners choose charging station locations, and a portable charger that can provide 20 to 40 miles of driving range.

Setting room rates for the future used to be fairly simple: A revenue manager would start by looking at the data from the past. In today’s new environment, though, that recipe is no longer a blueprint for success.

“Demand patterns have changed dramatically,” said Austin Segal, vice president of Curator Hotel & Resort Collection. “Everything is different than it was [before the pandemic], and it continues to evolve as businesses adjust return-to-office plans, remote work creates more flexibility, and international borders close and reopen. Hotels and revenue managers can no longer look to history to forecast what will happen.”

For hotels that have bet on the promise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, that can spell big trouble. After all, if the inputs in the machine are irrelevant, how can the output — the pricing decision — be accurate? As hotel leaders look ahead, it’s crucial to find the right technology partners that can pave the way toward a more nimble revenue management strategy.

Balancing Technology With Human Touch

To empower Curator’s portfolio — which includes independent properties like Paradise Point Resort & Spa in San Diego, Pelican Grand Beach Resort in Fort Lauderdale, and The Edgewater in Seattle — with the tools to keep up with real-time changes in demand, the company recently chose Duetto as a preferred revenue partner. While Segal said that other revenue systems are “black boxes” with rigid — and often questionable — algorithmic pricing recommendations, Duetto’s SaaS cloud-based system provides a key ingredient for independent hotels: flexibility.

“The ‘art’ that revenue managers bring to the equation is increasingly important,” Segal said. “Duetto is unique in its ability to not just deploy rate recommendations, but truly arm revenue managers with tools to support the execution of their ever-evolving strategies.”

David Woolenberg, CEO of Duetto, calls it “controlled automation”: a process where specific elements of a revenue management strategy can be placed on autopilot, while others can be easily adjusted with new rules. This could mean charging minimum rates based on the length of a stay or expanding the pricing gap between OTA and direct bookings during periods of high demand, for example.

“Revenue managers are highly experienced and may see nuances within their particular market that even the most advanced algorithm may not identify,” Woolenberg said. “They want to be able to turn the knobs and dials to truly reflect the uniqueness of their market strategy and put their stamp on it.”

Doing More With Less

Still, that stamp requires something a bit elusive in today’s industry: people. As hotels deal with a labor shortage that has left plenty of critical roles unfilled, Duetto’s offering is designed to help teams at independent hotels do more with less. The platform’s GameChanger tool ingests competitor data, web shopping data, social media reviews, reservation data, and more to help continually refine pricing models.

“Revenue cannot be managed 24/7, but with automation, it can be optimized 24/7,” Woolenberg said. “Teams can set strategy and rules to ensure the system takes over on the days, segments, or room types where less human interaction is needed or available, freeing up time to focus attention where it can be most profitable.”

For example, Woolenberg said a hotel might opt to fully automate pricing on all bookings 90 days or more from a stay date to make sure that revenue managers and operations staff members are solely focused on tweaking offers for short-term demand. It’s all about helping independent hotels make the best use of their time — another limited resource. A recent survey conducted by OTA Insight revealed that 25 percent of independent hoteliers spend at least two hours each day on adjusting pricing, marketing, and distribution strategies. Duetto aims to give those hours back so team members can focus on analyzing data, exploring new sales and marketing strategy, and developing a view of the big-picture.

Creating Upselling Opportunities

Determining what to charge for different room categories isn’t the only challenge standing in the way. In an ancillary-driven world, it’s equally important for independent hotels to figure out the right way to curate and charge for extra guest amenities. Segal highlighted that Duetto’s recent partnership with upselling software solution Oaky gives Curator properties a competitive edge in the battle against big brands.

“Duetto recognized that it makes perfect sense that your revenue management system should provide pricing guidance to a dynamic upsell solution,” Segal said. “Independent hotels are best positioned to take advantage of these types of innovations and developments as they do not have the layers of systems integrations or lead-time considerations that many of the brands require.”

That ability to pivot quickly is a superpower for independent hotels since today’s business environment will likely look quite different by tomorrow. The pace of change will continue to accelerate, which serves as a reminder that the pathway to innovating and improving pricing decisions is never complete. “Digital transformation is not about a single moment in time or a single initiative,” Woolenberg said. “In the new digital economy, it must instead become an always-on strategy.”

The possibilities are seemingly boundless, giving rise to heady questions… Can a machine be truly sentient? What does a computer capable of beyond-human thinking mean for humanity, if we’re no longer the top dogs?

As technology continues to evolve by leaps and bounds, a healthy sense of caution, and/or gradually escalating terror, and/or constant anxiety about an AI-led apocalypse might feel like an increasingly fitting response—but why let the real world ruin your enjoyment of some of the best sci-fi stories around? After all, science fiction loves a plucky AI companion, a gloom-and-doom robotic destroyer of worlds, and everything in between! Here are five fascinating takes on AI that will have you welcoming our new overlords in no time…

Lovelace/Sidra (Wayfarers by Becky Chambers)

The Long Way To A Small, Angry Planet introduces us to the crew of the Wayfarer. The ship itself is managed by Lovelace, an AI designated for such operations.

A Closed and Common Orbit, the second book in Chambers’ pseudo-series (interconnected books, but not direct sequels), sees Lovelace become Sidra (the name she chooses for herself). Sidra is now housed in a synthetic humanoid casing, and she must learn to function in a society she barely understands. The rotten cherry on top of this hard-to-swallow cake of a situation? AI in humanoid casings are illegal. Sidra navigates social situations and an unfamiliar life while avoiding small mistakes that could out her as an AI.

How can an AI make friends if anyone they meet might turn them in? Turns out, that’s just one of the many challenges Sidra faces as an AI in a flesh-filled world.

For those who want even more artificial intelligence, Becky Chambers’ Monk & Robot series features another charming AI within its pages.

HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke)

Been around Tor.com a while? You’re probably not surprised to see this entry pop up on one of my lists. I’ve never hesitated to sing the praises of 2001, and here’s yet another opportunity.

HAL, to me, is the quintessential AI. Following orders to the best of its ability, HAL falls into a conundrum. Caught between its mission’s objective and the questions asked by its crewmates, HAL does what any self-respecting AI might when placed in an impossible position and begins eliminating the pesky humans.

In a book filled with throwaway characters and surface-level archetypes (I’m generalizing—there are some exceptions), HAL stands out as a memorable and intriguing character. If you deign to read further in the Odyssey series, you might even get a bit more of the Heuristically programmed Algorithmic computer! (Fair warning: I recommend you avoid 3001 at all costs. 2010 and 2061 are worthwhile for more HAL-related goodies.)

Phluttr (After On by Rob Reid)

Rob Reid (founder of the music streaming service Rhapsody) penned After On in 2017. The book calls itself “a novel of Silicon Valley,” and that description certainly hits the mark: After On follows a handful of employees at Phluttr, a fictional social media site with billions of users (sound familiar?). Out of the various algorithms an AI springs to life and begins to influence events both within the company and outside of it. I can’t say much more for fear of spoilers, but it’s an interesting take on AI…

After On exists in a recognizable reality dominated by rampant technological expansion and the use of apps to siphon people’s time and reprogram their minds. When I first read it, I still thought most social media was relatively harmless. I’ve since learned my lesson (and deleted most of my social platforms). Looking back on the book now, I see how Reid used AI to warn of the dangers of unchecked tech growth, particularly in the social space. It’s a unique and entertaining AI-fueled story that reveals the absurd and troubling side of social media and tech giants, presented by an author who knows the world of Silicon Valley inside and out.

Kinnard (Salvagers by Alex White)

Alex White’s A Big Ship at the Edge of the Universe takes a while to warm up. The main characters (Boots and Nilah) are unlikeable and grating from the get-go, though we catch glimmers of goodness. The novel allows them space to evolve, but it takes a while.

Early on, though, we meet Kinnard, Boots’ late partner’s consciousness preserved as an AI. Kinnard on its own isn’t groundbreaking as an artificial intelligence. It gets up to some cool stuff—don’t you worry about that! But it’s not a completely fresh take on the concept.

Instead, Kinnard becomes a symbol of Boots’ trauma, allowing the reader crucial insight into the source of her standoffish behavior. Through Kinnard, we understand why Boots struggles to let go and what drives her to stay alive. In this case, the AI itself isn’t revolutionary, but the way it’s used in the narrative—Kinnard’s impact on the character with whom it has the closest relationship—is a core facet of the novel and helps set it apart.

M-Bot (Skyward by Brandon Sanderson)

We’ve covered stories about artificial intelligence that center around self-discovery, conflicting orders, the social media hellscape, and grief. What’s left? How about a plucky, adventuring AI with amnesia?

M-Bot should fit the bill. Brandon Sanderson’s Skyward series follows the adventures of Spensa Nightshade, who longs to be a pilot. In the caverns of her home world, Spensa discovers a derelict ship and meets the AI inhabiting it. She strikes up a friendship with M-Bot and tries to help it piece together its past. The AI can’t remember much of its history, but it does have a strange affinity for mushrooms.

The Skyward series contains one of the best growth arcs for an AI I’ve ever seen. M-Bot evolves from an amnesiac robot to a near-sentient being to a third-book iteration I won’t spoil for you. M-Bot is a lighthearted, comic relief character at first, but it shatters the borders of that initial characterization, evolving into a lovable and relatable mainstay of the series. When Defiant (the fourth book) arrives next year, I’ll be glued to M-Bot’s continuing arc, eager to see what happens with the friendly program-turned-trusted companion.

98,"71% Of Marketers Are Struggling To Meet Customer Expectations via @sejournal, @MattGSouthern",https://cdn.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/customer-expectations-636105b53970c-sej.png,01/11/2022,"A majority of marketers say they're struggling to meet customer expectations, and a new report on the current marketing landscape reveals why. 
The post 71% Of Marketers Are Struggling To Meet Customer Expectations appeared first on Search Engine Journal.",https://www.searchenginejournal.com/marketers-struggling-to-meet-customer-expectations/469824/,"Most marketers say they’re struggling to meet customer expectations, and a new report on the current marketing landscape reveals why.

The eighth edition of Salesforce’s State of Marketing report looks back on 2022’s challenges and triumphs as the year comes to a close.

Additionally, the report looks ahead to how marketers plan to adapt to future challenges, such as the deprecation of third-party cookies.

Data in the report is compiled from a survey of 6,000 marketers across 35 countries and an analysis of trillions of outbound marketing messages sent using the Salesforce platform.

Here are the key highlights from Salesforce’s State of Marketing 2022 report.

What Were The Key Challenges For Marketers In 2022?

Nearly three-quarters (71%) of respondents say meeting customer expectations is more complex than a year ago.

It’s not due to lack of effort, as 83% of marketers say their organizations engage customers in real-time across one or more marketing channels.

Additionally, marketers have more data sources to reconcile than ever: 10 sources in 2021, 15 in 2022, and expect 18 sources in 2023.

What’s holding marketers back from meeting customer expectations, then?

According to survey responses, these are marketers’ top challenges:

Ineffective use of tools and technologies

Measuring marketing ROI/attribution

Balancing personalization with customer comfort levels

A third (33%) of marketers say budgetary constraints are a challenge, with those in life sciences, manufacturing, and technology sectors particularly feeling the pinch.

The report finds gaps in employee resources are partially to blame for an increasingly challenging marketing landscape Trends like the “Great Resignation,” “Quiet Quitting,” and layoffs are making waves across company talent pools, and marketing teams are feeling the impact.

Despite the budget and talent shortages, 87% of marketers say their work provides greater value now than it did a year ago.

What Are Marketers’ Priorities In 2023?

According to survey responses, these are marketers’ top priorities:

Improving our use of tools and technologies

Experimenting with new marketing strategies/tactics

Modernizing tools and technologies

Marketers predict they’ll use nearly twice as many data sources in 2023 than in 2021.

Three-quarters of marketers still use third-party data like device identifiers and cookies from aggregators or data brokers.

Most (68%) marketers have a fully-defined strategy to shift toward first-party and zero-party data.

To build their database, 58% of marketers provide customer information-sharing incentives.

The number of marketers adding artificial intelligence (AI) tools to their strategy is steadily increasing.

In 2022, 68% of marketers say they have a fully-defined AI strategy, up from 60% in 2021 and 57% in 2020.

Three of the top AI use cases center around task automation:

Automating customer interactions

Automating data integration

Personalizing the customer journey across channels

A growing number of marketers are pivoting to new channels to stay in front of their audience. Channels like TV/OTT, digital content, and video experienced the most significant growth in marketing adoption, with audio channels like podcasts seeing the second-largest jump in adoption.

What Are Customers’ Expectations In 2022 And Beyond?

Customers have a high expectation for personalization when it comes to marketing — 56% of customers now expect offers always to be personalized.

In response, brands are investing in a combination of channels and technologies to tailor outreach and build lasting relationships where their audiences spend time.

Customers also expect transparency from the companies they buy from. According to the survey, 88% of customers expect companies to state their values clearly.

Adjusting to this shift in customer expectations is effective, as 93% of high-performing marketers say their external messaging reflects their corporate values, compared to 70% of their underperforming competition.

100,3 No-Brainer Stocks I'd Buy Right Now Without Hesitation,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/707828/woman-brain-gears.jpg,06/11/2022,"ASML Holding, Datadog, and Palo Alto Networks are all still great long-term buys.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/06/no-brainer-stocks-buy-right-now-without-hesitation/,"High inflation, rising interest rates, and other macro headwinds caused many investors to broadly shun growth stocks this year as the S&P 500 lost more than 20% of its value and the Nasdaq Composite sank by over 30%. However, this ongoing bear market also created some incredible buying opportunities for investors who can tune out the near-term noise.

So today, I'll highlight three high-growth tech stocks I'd still buy in this bear market without any hesitation: ASML Holding (ASML 3.12%), Datadog (DDOG -1.28%), and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 1.57%).

1. The semiconductor play: ASML

ASML is arguably the world's most important semiconductor equipment company. It's the world's largest manufacturer of photolithography systems, which are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only maker of high-end EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography systems, which are used by foundries to create the world's smallest and densest chips.

The world's most advanced foundries -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung, and Intel -- all require a steady supply of ASML's EUV systems, which cost about $200 million each, to manufacture their newest chips. The Dutch company's monopolization of this crucial technology makes it a great way to gain exposure to the entire semiconductor sector without betting on a single chipmaker.

Between 2018 and 2021, ASML's revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 20%, while its EPS increased at a CAGR of 33%. Its near-term growth will decelerate as supply chain constraints limit its shipments of new systems, but that slowdown isn't related to the market's demand, which continues to outstrip its available supply.

ASML's stock got a bit overheated last year, but it now trades at just 24 times forward earnings. I believe that reasonable valuation makes it a very compelling investment, even if the broader semiconductor market gradually slows down.

2. The hypergrowth cloud play: Datadog

Datadog's cloud-based platform accumulates diagnostic data from a wide range of servers, databases, and apps across a company's infrastructure. It then organizes that information onto visual dashboards for IT professionals, which makes it much easier to spot and diagnose potential problems.

Datadog went public in late 2019. Its revenue surged 66% in 2020 and jumped 70% to $1.03 billion in 2021, and it expects 60%-61% growth this year. Its number of customers that generated over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR) more than tripled from 858 at the end of 2019 to 2,600 in the third quarter of 2022. Its dollar-based net retention rate, or its year-over-year revenue growth per existing customer, has also remained above 130% over the past year.

Datadog isn't consistently profitable by GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) measures yet, but it turned profitable on a non-GAAP basis in 2020. Its non-GAAP EPS more than doubled in 2021, and it expects another 88%-92% growth this year. Datadog's stock might initially seem a bit pricey at 72 times forward earnings and 11 times next year's sales. However, I'd argue those valuations are pretty reasonable relative to those of other hyper-growth stocks, and that it still has plenty of room to expand as more large companies recognize the long-term value of its unified IT dashboards.

3. The cybersecurity play: Palo Alto Networks

Cybersecurity companies are generally resistant to macroeconomic headwinds because their customers won't lower their digital defenses just to save a few dollars. However, many cybersecurity stocks still fare poorly during market downturns because they're either unprofitable or too pricey.

Palo Alto Networks is a cybersecurity leader that provides a comfortable balance of growth, profitability, and value in this wobbly market. It currently operates three main platforms: Strata, its legacy next-gen firewall and network security suite; Prisma, its cloud-native security services; and Cortex, its platform for AI-powered threat-detection tools. Prisma and Cortex, which it dubs its next-gen security (NGS) services, drove most of its recent growth.

Between fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2022, which ended this July, Palo Alto's annual revenue rose at a CAGR of 36% to $5.5 billion. For fiscal 2023, it expects its revenue to rise 25%, and for its non-GAAP EPS to rise 24%-26%. It also expects to turn firmly profitable by GAAP measures for the full year.

Palo Alto's stock might not initially seem cheap at 54 times forward earnings and 6 times next year's sales, but it's a lot cheaper than higher-growth (but unprofitable) cybersecurity plays like CrowdStrike, Zscaler, and SentinelOne. That makes it my favorite long-term play on the cybersecurity market, and a no-brainer buy during this market pullback.",cybersecurity,motley fool

102,Fears mount that Cop27 app could be used by Egypt to surveil regime’s critics,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c41f1fb81d808d510c22efadc5190a2c983c91/0_168_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5370386474664c08e88832ebb481e4b9,06/11/2022,"Cybersecurity experts warn that official Cop27 climate app requires access to a user’s location, photos and even emailsThere are mounting fears over the surveillance of delegates at the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt, with cybersecurity experts warning that the…",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/06/egypt-cop27-climate-surveillance-cybersecurity,"There are mounting fears over the surveillance of delegates at the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt, with cybersecurity experts warning that the official app for the talks requires access to a user’s location, photos and even emails upon downloading it.

The revelation, as more than 25,000 heads of state, diplomats, negotiators, journalists and activists from around the world gather at the climate summit that starts in Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday, has raised concerns that Egypt’s authoritarian regime will be able to use an official platform for a United Nations event to track and harass attendees and critical domestic voices.

The official Cop27 app, which has already been downloaded more than 5,000 times, requires sweeping permissions from users before it installs, including the ability for Egypt’s ministry of communications and information technology to view emails, scour photos and determine users’ locations, according to an expert who analysed it for the Guardian.

This data could be used by Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s regime to further crack down on dissent in a country that already holds about 65,000 political prisoners. Egypt has conducted a series of mass arrests of people accused of being protesters in the lead-up to Cop27 and sought to vet and isolate any activists near the talks, which will see governments attempting to hammer out an agreement over dealing with the climate crisis.

“This is a cartoon super-villain of an app,” said Gennie Gebhart, the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s advocacy director. “The biggest red flag is the number of permissions required, which is unnecessary for the operation of the app and suggests they are trying to surveil attendees.

“No reasonable person will want to consent to being surveilled by a nation state, or having their emails read by them, but often people click these permissions without thinking much.”

She added: “I can’t think of a single good reason why they need these permissions. It’s an open question how this information will be used – it raises a lot of scary possibilities. It may well have a silencing effect in that people self-censor when they realize they are being watched in this way. It can have a chilling effect.”

Hussein Baoumi of Amnesty International told the Guardian that tech operatives working for the rights organisation had examined the app and flagged a number of concerns prior to Cop27. The app was able to access users’ camera, microphone, Bluetooth and location data as well as pair two different apps.

“It can be used for surveillance,” he said.

Baoumi added: “The issues they found were primarily the permissions it asks for. If granted, it allows the app to be used for surveillance against you. It collects data and sends them to two servers, including one in Egypt. The authorities don’t say what they’re doing with this data, and they’re able to use this app for mass data collection from everyone using it.”

Amr Magdi of Human Rights Watch said that his organisation had also assessed the app and found that it “opens doors for misuse”.

Magdi added that conferences like Cop27 are “an excellent chance from a security perspective for information gathering,” including for certain activists “they want to know more about”.

Rights activists in Egypt flagged concerns about the Cop27 app almost immediately after it became available.

“You can now download the official #Cop27 mobile app but you must give your full name, email address, mobile number, nationality and passport number. Also you must enable location tracking. And then the first thing you see is this,” tweeted Hossam Baghat, the head of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, linking to an app screen showing the face of the Egyptian president.

He then tweeted a screenshot of the app’s terms and conditions, which read: “Our application reserves the right to access customer accounts for technical and administrative purposes and for security reasons.”

Digital surveillance of Cop27 attendees comes atop a highly developed infrastructure for dragnet surveillance of Egypt’s citizens’ communications, prompted in large part by Egyptian officials’ fears of the power of digital communications and their relationship with the popular uprising of 2011. This includes deep packet inspection technology provided by an American company in 2013, allowing authorities to monitor all web traffic moving through a network. The Egyptian government also blocks online access to over 500 websites, including the country’s lone independent news outlet Mada Masr, using technology provided by Canadian company Sandvine.

Surveillance by major telephone providers such as Vodafone allows the Egyptian authorities direct access to all users’ phone calls, text messages and information. One Cop27 attendee said that Vodafone was distributing free sim cards to conference attendees on arrival in Sharm el-Sheikh airport.

“The Cop27 app is really part of the wider surveillance structure in Egypt,” Baomi said. “This app is coming from a country doing mass surveillance unapologetically on its own population. It makes sense that, of course, the Egyptian government’s app can be used for surveillance, to collect data and use it for purposes unconnected to Cop27. It’s sad but expected from Egypt.”

Rights activists and members of Egyptian civil society critical of the government have been subject to targeted surveillance by the Egyptian authorities for years, raising concerns about the risks for high-profile activists attending Cop27. The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and Citizen Lab identified one “ongoing and extensive phishing campaign against Egyptian civil society”, in 2017 targeting organizations working on human rights issues, political freedoms and gender as well as individual targets such as lawyers, journalists and activists. Four years later, Citizen Lab identified a fresh targeted hacking attempt against the phone of a prominent former Egyptian opposition leader based overseas.

South Sinai governor Khaled Fouda also recently boasted to a domestic cable channel about the level of surveillance at Cop27, including cameras in the back of taxis feeding footage to a local “security observatory”.

“Sisi’s idea of ‘security’ is mass spying on everyone,” Magdi tweeted in response.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. He's a CBS News expert and analyst. Good morning to you, Chris. Good to have you back. How do you react to this idea of President Biden characterizing the ""MAGA"" element of the party as an extreme threat to democracy?

CBS NEWS CYBERSECURITY EXPERT AND ANALYST CHRIS KREBS: The area that I'm most focused on right now is the undermining of the legitimacy of American elections. And Governor Sununu mentioned leaders need to stand up and- and speak truth to power and- and particularly the elements of the GOP that continue to repeat countlessly debunked claims. I mean, we even have the GOP candidate for governor Kari Lake in Arizona just the other day making a joke about there's no way that President Biden got 81 million votes. In fact, he got more than 81 million votes. But the point here is that we do need leaders like Governor Sununu to stand up and say that this is not acceptable behavior in American democracy, and that we need the those that continue to push these narratives, for clout for political influence for- for money for fundraising, that they need to let it go, and we need to move on if this American experiment is going to continue.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we're gonna continue this on the other side of that, but just to your point, there are 308 Republican candidates who have raised doubts about the integrity and validity of the last election. They're standing for office now, there's a reason they are using that as a political message. We're going to talk about that in a moment. So stay with us on Face The Nation.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We return to our conversation now about election security with CBS News, cybersecurity expert and analyst Chris Krebs. Chris, I want to talk about something that's happening right now. Social media has already changed the way we communicate and, certainly, our political world. President Biden said a few days ago that he has concerns about billionaire Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter- said, ""the platform spews lies all across the world. There's no editors anymore in America, there are no editors, how do we expect kids to be able to understand what is at stake?"" It's not just kids, right? What concerns do you have about this happening just days before the election, these changes to Twitter?

KREBS: Well, I think I think the government for one has a mechanism by which they can review the acquisition, the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States can take a look at particularly the second and third ownership positions in Twitter, including Saudi Arabia. That is something that I'm assuming that the Treasury Department is taking a look at right now to see if they can put in place a national security agreement or even potentially unwind the purchase. But I think more specifically to what's happening right now with Twitter, I think there are kind of- there are two ""Elons"" that we are seeing. There's the public Elon, that's, you know, trolling and saying $8, please, on all the complaints about some of the shifts in the moderation and other activities. Then there's what's happening behind the scenes, the conversations with the civil rights groups, with advertisers, with the teens, which perhaps maybe a little bit more stable. And I think if you look at the platform itself right now, not a whole lot has changed. That may not be a popular opinion, but I think the reality is that most, you haven't seen too much of a change in the moderation. Now, the concern, though, is what happens tomorrow, where you can buy the blue tick for $8 a month, Twitter Blue--

MARGARET BRENNAN: For our viewers who don't use Twitter, a blue check is a sign of credibility.

KREBS: It has historically been a marker of trust, and that Twitter has said, we've confirmed and authenticated the identity of this person, which tends to be a politician, or a news media personality or a journalist, an academic or someone that may be a popular voice in certain civil rights, civil liberties issue.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Now you can buy it for eight bucks a month.

KREBS: Along with a number of other features of editing and longer-form video posting. But again, to have such a dramatic shift in that marker of trust, now you can buy it, in advance of as we've been talking about a very contentious and important election. It opens the information space to a broader community of influencers, clout chasers, election denialists--

MARGARET BRENNAN: Foreign actors?

KREBS: Absolutely, I mean, we've seen reports lately of Russia, China and Iran, back at their old tricks, and it is going to create a very chaotic environment.

MARGARET BRENNAN: To that point in- in 2018, during the midterms, [U.S] Cyber Command took offensive operations to take out Russian trolls who are spreading misinformation. The New York Times has a story today saying Russia is back at it. What does that say to you about U.S. defenses?

KREBS: Well, I think so Recorded Future and Graphika, two research firms have released information that Russian bots, trolls, associated with the Internet Research Agency, which is a group that targeted since the 2016 and the 2018 election, are back at it and are undermining this time Democratic candidates for Senate in some of the- the more contentious races. I think what it says is that the- there's a broader community of actors, they recognize that political discourse is very divisive here in the US, and they have more opportunities, probably than ever before, to continue to undermine confidence to create chaos, which is really, their primary objective here. It's not necessarily that a winner wins, but that we've all lost- lost confidence and they degrade the American democracy experiment.

MARGARET BRENNAN: There are also a number of sitting Senators, and of note, Ambassador Richard Grinnell former President Trump's Acting Director of National Intelligence has been posting some misleading information, that's him on the screen, about the election. He said ""any state which doesn't count all the votes and announce the winner Tuesday night is incompetent.""--

KREBS: So all 50 states then, by that formulation,

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because what you're saying is just the fact that votes are never finalized on election night. But why do you think someone who knows better is posting something like that?

KREBS: Well, whether he knows better, I can't assume that, but the point here is that it's for clout chasing, it's for influence. There's a reward system and structure set up right now within the far-right of the GOP that provides additional engagement. So you tweet something like that, and you can see your likes, your retweets, your amplification really take off. And if you're just talking about some other, you know, more mundane domestic issue, nobody cares. But there's a reward system and incentive structure that's set up where exactly this sort of messaging is- is rewarded. It's encouraged, and, and this is again, going back to Governor Sununu's comments, we need leaders to lead. We need the presumptive leaders of the Republican Party to stand up and say this is unacceptable, this is not how it works. We need to be good faith actors in this process and unfortunately, leaders aren't leading right now.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris Krebs, thank you as always for your analysis and we will see you on election night as part of CBS coverage at our democracy desk here at CBS News.",cybersecurity,cbs news

Vermont Business Magazine Champlain College on Saturday officially inaugurated its 10th President, Alejandro (“Alex”) Hernandez. Centered on a theme of “readiness,” Hernandez outlined plans to “build a better future” for students, the college, and Vermont.

“Education creates opportunity, and I’ve dedicated my life to the idea that we can build institutions that get students READY, not by luck or privilege, but by design” said Hernandez, reflecting on feeling unprepared early in his life. Champlain’s education model is intentionally designed to get students “Ready for work. Ready for life. Ready to make a difference,” he explained.

The 90-minute ceremony commenced with a vibrant inaugural procession, followed by remarks that honored Champlain’s rich history and trumpeted aspirations for this new chapter.

Laying out his vision for building a better future, Hernandez highlighted four key initiatives he is undertaking in Champlain’s next chapter. These initiatives will strengthen Champlain’s long-standing reputation as a leader in career-focused learning, and create additional opportunities within its unique and highly-effective upside-down curriculum model.

Serve as an economic engine for Vermont. Hernandez announced a new innovation hub in partnership with Hula to elevate entrepreneurship in Vermont. To launch the partnership, Hernandez will co-teach a master class in entrepreneurship at Hula, featuring Vermont startup founders and leaders. The collaboration will include education programs and upskilling, internships, faculty collaborations, student projects through the college’s Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and shared spaces. Champlain College’s Lakeside Campus will also be the epicenter for other signature employer partnerships. Be the best place in the world for women in cybersecurity. Champlain College has one of the best cybersecurity and digital forensics programs in the country. Cybersecurity professionals and alumnae Brianna Blanchard (BS ‘11, MS ‘16) and Jess Turner (BS ‘22) will co-chair the Women in Cybersecurity Leadership Council to shape this important effort. The initiative will provide a blueprint for supporting more female-identifying students and other underrepresented groups in STEAM fields. Go full STEAM ahead. As part of its R/Evolutionary 2030 strategic plan, Champlain will launch new degrees in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) such as product design as well as expand into health and the bio-life sciences. The college will build on its radically pragmatic, hands-on, interdisciplinary approach to learning and prepare students to be Champlain Ready in growing sectors like digital health and synthetic biology. Be more human in a digital world. In a world being reshaped by technology, it is those traits that make us most human that drive students’ long-term success: empathy, relationship-building, working across lines of difference, an entrepreneurial mindset. These skills are taught through the college’s Core curriculum and global experiences in Dublin and Montreal. Champlain College will be a leader in weaving together human skills and digital skills - and is launching a Digital Humanities major in Fall 2024 for students to develop the skills needed to tackle social challenges.

Among the more than 180 attendees and distinguished guests at today’s ceremony were Mayor Weinberger, Provost Dr. Monique Taylor, Board chair Judy O’Connell, Alumni Representative Megg Daudelin, local business leaders, state and local officials, fellow academics, and Champlain College delegates, trustees, alumni, faculty, and students.

About Champlain College: Founded in 1878, Champlain College is a small, not-for-profit, private college in Burlington, Vermont, with additional campuses in Montreal, Canada, and Dublin, Ireland. Champlain offers a traditional undergraduate experience from its beautiful campus overlooking Lake Champlain and more than 90 residential undergraduate and online undergraduate and graduate degree programs and certificates.

108,"Cloudflare Sets Ambitious, and Realistic, Growth Target",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/708016/cloud-computing-microchip-technology-1.jpg,06/11/2022,The edge computing leader is looking to 5X its annualized revenue over the next five years.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/06/cloudflare-sets-ambitious-and-realistic-growth-tar/,"Shares of Cloudflare (NET -5.04%) were hammered on Friday despite beating analyst estimates on all fronts with its third-quarter report. The edge computing company is feeling no real pain from the current economic environment. Cloudflare grew revenue by 47% year over year and signed up 159 enterprise customers with annual budgets exceeding $100,000. There are now 1,908 of these large customers on Cloudflare's platform.

While Cloudflare's results were impressive, its long-term outlook was the real story. After reaching $1 billion in annualized revenue in the third quarter, Cloudflare has plans to grow that number to $5 billion over the next five years. To reach that goal, revenue would need to grow at a compound annual rate of about 38%.

This target may seem ambitious, especially considering the state of the economy. Here's why it's doable for this edge computing leader.

Massive market opportunities

Cloudflare got its start protecting websites and servers from attacks. Its platform slides between end users and servers, detecting and absorbing malicious traffic. This requires a global network, which Cloudflare has expanded to over 275 cities in 100 countries over the years.

Cloudflare's greatest asset is optionality. That global network is useful for a whole lot more than keeping customers safe from attacks. Websites can be sped up by caching content close to users; bits of code can be run at the edge; and a full suite of security products can help companies connect employees with applications and data.

Cloudflare's total addressable market was just $32 billion in 2018, consisting of the core security and content distribution services that gave the company its start. TAM has since expanded to $115 billion, and Cloudflare expects it to grow to $135 billion by 2024.

The markets for Cloudflare's core features are still growing; layered on top of that are additional growth opportunities. Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform, which competes with Zscaler and other cloud-first cybersecurity companies, helps employees securely access a company's applications and data. That capability is particular important now that remote work and hybrid work are so prevalent.

Object storage is another big opportunity. Any company making use of cloud computing needs to store arbitrary data somewhere. There are plenty of object storage services available, including on the big cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services. Cloudflare stands out with its pricing. Storage costs are low, and the company doesn't charge for bandwidth at all. AWS, on the other hand, piles on the fees.

Cloudflare is also aiming to become a full-fledged cloud computing platform for developers. It offers Workers, allowing developers to run code close to users, Pages, which hosts static content like webpages, various data products including the D1 database, and messaging hub service Pub/Sub. A full-stack application can be deployed entirely on Cloudflare's platform, albeit with some limitations, potentially eliminating the need for traditional cloud platforms like AWS.

Even if some of these products don't work out quite as well as the company expects, Cloudflare has so many irons in the fire that hitting its growth target looks very doable.

Still an expensive stock

Cloudflare has excellent long-term growth prospects, but the stock is expensive enough that it should give investors pause. Even after taking a beating this year, Cloudflare is valued at roughly $13.5 billion. Based in its 2022 revenue guidance, Cloudflare trades at a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 14.

In this market environment, that's a valuation that's hard to justify. Cloudflare is growing fast, but the company is not yet profitable or free-cash-flow-positive. And while business is still humming along, it's hard to say how durable the company's results will be if global economies enter recession next year.

Cloudflare is a great company, but even the best company bought at too high a price can lead to lackluster results for investors.",cybersecurity,motley fool

Banking uses 56 times more energy than Bitcoin,” Michel Khazzaka, a cybersecurity engineer and cryptographer, told Cointelegraph.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-banking-uses-at-least-56-times-more-energy-than-bitcoin,"The next time Bitcoin (BTC) comes under fire for energy consumption, remember this statistic: the banking industry uses at least 56 times more energy. That's according to cryptographer and founder of Valuechain, Michel Khazzaka:

“I’m not saying it uses less or the same, just know it uses 56 times more than Bitcoin.”

The statistic, first shared by Michel Khazzaka in the summer, caused a stir in the Bitcoin and wider crypto community. He published his estimates in a Valuechain report, a company he founded to investigate the world of crypto payments.

In an exclusive Cointelegraph Crypto Story interview, Khazzaka talks viewers through the extensive research that led to striking conclusions. In short, Bitcoin might not be as bad for the environment as the mainstream media lead people to think.

Khazzaka, who describes Bitcoin as “money with a memory,” sought to refute the claim that Bitcoin is worse for the environment than fiat money. He spent four years toiling away, compiling data and crunching numbers. He built out a model, or estimate, to understand just how much energy the banking industry consumes.

Speaking from his home in Paris, Khazzaka told Cointelegraph that he looked at commute times, data centers, servers, and even ATMs for the calculations. He didn’t, however, take into account the energy put into “banks, buildings or ATMs; to manufacture to bring the metal, etc. Let’s compare the operations.” Khazzaka admits this oversight is intentional:

“That’s why all my numbers are underestimated for banking and extremely accurate for Bitcoin.”

For Bitcoin, Khazzaka concluded that it consumes 88.95 TWh per year, considerably less than the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates. Nonetheless, Khazzaka admits that Bitcoin uses an “extraordinary amount of energy.” However, in return, users receive “an extraordinary amount of security for an extraordinarily important service.”

He compares Bitcoin to space travel, explaining that even if people don’t care about going to the moon, it’s a right, “even if it consumes more [energy] than a car.”

Finally, in a nod to the layer-2 Bitcoin Lightning Network, Khazzaka concludes that, as a payments network, it shows tremendous promise. It just needs to prove itself.",cybersecurity,cointelegraph

The Office of Australian Information Commissioner was also notified.

Cyber attack investigation

Gallo said the extent of the breach is still being investigated.

“We are working closely with all authorities to assess how many of our clients have been impacted and the nature of the data that has been stolen,” he said.

“Advice from our independent security experts have confirmed nothing has been released in the public domain at this point in time.

“When we were informed about the cyber attack we immediately shut down and isolated all our internal systems and took further measures to secure our network and data, along with pausing all data processing.”

The DPC spokesperson said the Victorian Government’s Cyber Incident Response Service has been notified.

“Protecting Victorian data and systems is our highest priority,” the spokesperson said.

“If it is determined that Victorian Government data has been exposed as a result of this breach, departments will notify impacted individuals and provide advice on steps they can take to minimise any risk.”

The potential exposure is the latest in a string of cyber attacks on Australian companies.

Optus, Medibank, Australian Clinical Labs, EnergyAustralia, Telstra and MyDeal have all suffered recent breaches.

While it’s obvious there has been a sudden increase in the scale and number of attacks, figuring out why was a guessing game, Chief Scientist for UNSW Institute for Cybersecurity (IFCYBER) Professor Sanjay Jha told 7NEWS.com.au last month.

Jha said there could be insinuations there were foreign actors active, but there had been no evidence to suggest that.

Instead, he said, it was possible the “bad guys” saw Australia as a “soft target” following the major cyber attack on Optus, when the personal information of about 10 million customers was compromised.

“(Hackers) may have started to explore other companies or it is possible that they stole credentials and now they probably have (an) easier job in attacking some of the not-so secure services at different places,” Jha said.",cybersecurity,7news.com.au

We would like to welcome you to Intrusion Incorporated Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. An audio replay of the conference call will be available on the company's website within a few hours after this call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Sam Cohen with Alpha Investor Relations.

Sam Cohen

Thank you and welcome. Joining me today are Tony Scott, Chief Executive Officer; and Kimberly Pinson, Chief Financial Officer. The call is being webcast and will be archived on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before I turn the call over to Tony, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made during this conference call relating to the company's expected future performance, future business prospects, future events or plans may include forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

During the call, we may use non-GAAP measures if we believe it is useful to investors or if we believe it will help investors better understand our performance or business trends.

With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a few opening remarks.

Anthony Scott

Thank you, Sam. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to follow our usual cadence and provide you with some updates on our strategic priorities that are positioning Intrusion for long-term growth. These priorities include expanding and strengthening our product offerings, realigning our sales and marketing resources and focusing on channel enabled sales model as well as strengthening our strategic partnerships and improving our financial discipline. As we announced at the end of September, we've achieved the commercial release of our Shield Cloud and Endpoint products. The addition of the Cloud and Endpoint solutions improve the attractiveness of our advanced threat intelligence data set with products positioned to serve the growing hybrid and cloud world. Notably, as we released these new products, we identified some important patentable characteristics on our path to general availability.

Now that we have patent coverage in place, these product additions strengthen our strategic vision for Intrusion as we continue to serve the growing demands of customers seeking advanced and highly effective cybersecurity solutions globally. So first, let me talk about our Shield Cloud product. Shield Cloud extends the effectiveness of the Intrusion global threat engine and serves as a protective gateway between a customer's virtual private cloud and the public Internet. It's an important addition to our product line. Next let me talk about our INTRUSION Shield Endpoint solution. Shield Endpoint enables safe web browsing outside of the corporate enclave and data center allowing users to work remotely with confidence that authorized device connections are known, monitored and protected. With this product, users can safely view content on sites that would otherwise be blocked through our Shield Renderer, which transparently redirects users to a safe cloud-based browsing environment.

The indications of interest in the pipeline expansion as a result of our Shield Cloud and Endpoint products are highly encouraging. We received positive feedback from customers emphasizing the effectiveness of our solution and the overall value it brings to our dedicated users. Couple of data points to help you understand what I'm seeing. Our qualified leads have more than doubled, we've doubled our proof of concepts and proof of values, our quotes are 10x in terms of quotes that we have outstanding and all of those give me confidence in the future for these new products. Finally, we continue to invest in our Shield On-Prem appliance. Development of and enhancements to this product are continuing with new functionality and the ability to address increasingly higher network bandwidth over time. The demand remains strong for this hardware and we had several deals that didn't close in this quarter, but are in our qualified pipeline.

So I continue to believe that the release of these new products will pave the way for INTRUSION Shield in all forms to become the largest source of revenue growth in the future. On the sales and marketing front, we've revamped our messaging around Shield with the launch of our new company website, new product branding and a new company logo as a part of this makeover effort. The revamping of the messaging around Shield and the launch of our new website will help us better communicate our unique value proposition and our competitive position in the marketplace. Last quarter we announced an agreement with Supermicro as our primary global supplier of hardware. I'm pleased to announce we've deepened our relationship with Supermicro by signing an agreement to also act as a reseller of Intrusion technology. This agreement will add Intrusion technology to the cybersecurity portfolio that Supermicro can sell to its customers globally.

I'm delighted with this arrangement and know that the combination of Supermicro and Intrusion will offer excellent value to our joint customers. Finally, as we announced in October, we are partnering with vTech Solutions, an IT services firm based in Washington, D.C. that provides end-to-end managed solutions for its customers. We see a large opportunity to work with vTech due to its experience working with state and local governments. vTech currently operates in 40 U.S. states and 3 additional countries, which will help expand the reach of our Shield products as they see greater penetration into those markets. We have positive momentum resulting from these new partnerships, which expands our reach as we provide INTRUSION Shield protection to a greater number of customers. Our discussions have continued with other major technology partners on the strategic partnerships front, but we have nothing more to announce at this particular time.

As I indicated last quarter, I was hoping to have something further to announce during the third quarter, but there's been a bit of a slowdown in these discussions mainly due to the macroeconomic environment that we're all currently experiencing. That said, no potential partner has left the discussion and we detect genuine enthusiasm for our IP and I remain optimistic that we will have something to announce on this front in due time and our strategic direction remains on course. Before wrapping up, let me also address our legacy consulting business. We were pleased to see this segment grow both sequentially and year-over-year. As you know, the federal government's fiscal year started on October 1 and there currently is a continuing resolution or CR as it's commonly known to temporarily extend the fiscal year 2022 spending levels.

As can be typical in these situations, we expect that the appropriators and congressional leaders will reengage in negotiations to finalize federal spending for fiscal 2023 following the November midterm elections. As we navigate the terrain of conducting federal government business, we are continuing to make investments and are exploring additional opportunities within the space in support of our growth strategy. Our team continues to be active in our engagement with industry leaders and chief information officers through participation in a couple of select cybersecurity conferences. As many of you know, I have a background with the federal government, which ultimately led to Intrusion's participation in Cyberworld within the AUSA conference, the largest trade show for the U.S. military with over 60,000 attendees.

I personally participated as a keynote speaker this year where I emphasized the technological capabilities of Shield in protecting critical information assets, which was well received by those in attendance. During the quarter, we also participated in GRR Con, an information technology, security and hacking conference. This conference brings together a number of industry leaders to discuss pertinent changes to the cybersecurity industry and how CIOs are countering attacks. The participation at these 2 conferences allowed us to showcase our new and innovative products to a broader audience at significant industry events and we're continuing to evaluate additional ways to expand the awareness of our INTRUSION Shield offer. At a macro level, there are both positives and negatives. What I continue to hear and confirm is that while forecast for technology and software spending are projected to be markedly lower, cybersecurity remains a top priority as we head into 2023.

For example in a recent Gartner study published in the Wall Street Journal, 66% of CIOs indicated that they plan to increase investment in cybersecurity. Long term the demand backdrop for our solutions continues to grow, specifically in the market sub-segments we serve. Cyber criminals and ransomware attacks do not pause because of a slowing economy and we continue to operate in a segment that will continue to see increased spending irrespective of what's happening in the global market. While bad actors never cease, I'm excited about the ways in which our new and existing products can stand up to the most intelligent threats today and I remain steadfast in my belief that we are well on our way to sustainable Intrusion growth in this high growth exciting space. Before I turn the call over to Kim, I'd like to comment on our efforts to improve the company's financial discipline and stability as we continue to pursue our strategic initiatives.

We further strengthened our balance sheet and overall financial flexibilities to meet our operational and strategic needs. In September, we completed a registered direct offering of approximately $6 million along our goal of $15 million to $20 million in the coming year. We remain confident that the capital markets remain open to us as we gain traction with our new Shield products. We plan to move forward with the same commitment to investing in our business in a responsible manner that's commensurate with our prospects for profitable growth. Overall, I'm proud of how our teams executed during the quarter. I'm happy with the positive trajectory in our new business wins paired with the strong sales pipeline as more companies look to leverage our advanced threat hunting capabilities.

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Kim for a detailed review of our third quarter financials. Kim?

Kimberly Pinson

Thanks, Tony. We are encouraged by the ongoing progress being made within our business as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, bolster our financial flexibility and support our strategic growth initiatives to capture the growing customer demand for our sophisticated cybersecurity solutions. Revenues for the third quarter of 2022 were $2.2 million, an increase of $0.1 million or 6.5% sequentially and $0.4 million or 20.5% year-over-year. Third quarter revenues for our consulting business of $1.9 million increased 14.6% year-over-year and 7.9% sequentially due to an increased level of task orders during the quarter. This business has shown continued progress and we feel that we'll continue to see a consistent level of growth as the federal government works its way through the backlog of task orders for contracts that have already been awarded and eventually reaches a new budget for fiscal 2023.

As you know, due to the CR, no new contracts can be awarded until either the CR ends or a new budget is approved. Third quarter results for our Shield On-Premise of $0.3 million was flat sequentially due to some minor churn we experienced in the business. During the quarter, we signed a number of new customers, which was offset by a nonrenewal of a contract. On a year-over-year basis, Shield third quarter revenues increased $0.1 million or 70.3%. We are still seeing strong demand for our Shield On-Prem solution with some opportunities that we did not close in Q3 expected to close in the fourth quarter. As Tony stated, we are pleased with the launch and progress of our 2 new Shield products and are encouraged by the prospects in the pipeline, particularly for the Endpoint solution that we expect to be a large contributor to revenues in the future. The gross profit margin was 54.6% for third quarter of 2022, which is significantly below the gross margin that has been reported in prior periods.

During the quarter, we identified amounts recorded in operating expense that should be included in cost of sales. We included this expense in cost of sales in Q3 and made a reclassification from operating expense to cost of sales in all prior periods for comparability. This reclassification resulted in a reduced gross margin of approximately 12% and 14% for each of the 3-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. When comparing our current quarter gross margin to the same period in 2021 after reclassification, our gross margin increased 6.2%. We anticipate our gross margin will continue to increase as Shield revenues make up a greater percentage of our sales. We are continuing to control our cost structure while also making prudent investments in our long-term profitable growth. Third quarter operating expenses of $5 million were down $2 million or 28% year-over-year.

Looking closer at our operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses of $1.7 million were down $1.8 million or 52% year-over-year as a result of the actions taken over the past year to realign our sales organization and implement cost savings measures. Research and development totaled $1.5 million, a decrease of $0.4 million from the prior year period. As you may recall, we began capitalizing internally developed software costs in the second quarter of this year. When adjusted for amounts capitalized, the R&D expense would be $2 million, an increase of $0.1 million or 5% year-over-year. General and administrative expenses of $1.9 million were up $0.3 million or 16% year-over-year mainly due to legal costs that are nonrecurring in nature. During the quarter, we finalized the calculation of our employee tax credit related to 2020 and 2021 and we recognized $2 million in other income net of expenses.

Net loss for the third quarter was $2.9 million or $0.15 per share compared to a net loss of $6.1 million or $0.34 per share for the third quarter of 2021. Our losses have improved significantly compared to the same period of the prior year, which reflects our responsible fiscal management as we grow revenues and manage our costs. Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.9 million, up from $4.1 million on December 31, 2021. On September 12, we entered into a securities purchase agreement to issue and sell shares in a registered direct offering of common stock and warrants totaling $5.9 million. We closed on 959,057 shares and warrants or $4 million in the September quarter. The additional financing allows us to prudently invest in our growing suite of INTRUSION Shield products and address our capital allocation priorities while driving sustainable shareholder value.

With that financial overview, I'd like to turn the call back over to Tony for a few closing comments. Tony?

Anthony Scott

Thanks, Kim. To conclude, we're continuing to execute on our strategic initiatives through the launch of our new products and the partnerships that we've announced. We're pleased with our performance and are optimistic for what is yet to come. I believe that the actions that we are taking today set us up well to end the year on a good note and move into 2023 with strong momentum. I look forward to sharing the next steps in our journey with all of you and again thank our investors for your continued support as we execute on our strategy.

This concludes our prepared remarks. And I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Zach Cummins with B. Riley Securities.

Zachary Cummins

Just starting off, I mean with Shield revenue I think essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. It sounds like you had a nonrenewal with a customer. Can you talk about some of the dynamics that went on there and why that customer decided to not continue forward with your On-Premise product?

Anthony Scott

Yes. This is Tony. So the circumstance there was a deal that was signed before I actually got there. The customer had turned on Shield and it was an educational institution. On the first day of school when all the students logged in, our box crashed and they got kind of jittery and basically refused to turn it back on again. Again all of this happened well before I got to Intrusion. So it was one of those things that when I got there, we spent the first couple of months on the hardware stabilizing our software and making sure things like that wouldn't happen again. And we just couldn't resurrect that 1 customer out of the trashbin, if you will. So I felt real bad about it, but I do understand in that particular case why a customer would feel burned and would not want to renew. So that's the circumstance. I wish it were otherwise, but it is what it is.

Zachary Cummins

Understood. That's helpful. And Kim, I think you mentioned around kind of the lower gross margin that we saw in this quarter. I mean, any way you can give us a sense of what sort of costs are being moved into that cost of revenue line versus what was classified as operating expenses before?

Kimberly Pinson

Yes, I can. In reviewing the cost of sales and it was primarily as we were getting ready for the planning phase of the remainder of this year and 2023, I noticed some contractor expense. It's really some direct labor expense associated with a consultant contract that previously had been included in operating expense and should have been fully recorded in cost of sales. That is a long-term contract. The billing on that contract was consistent. So we went back and did a correction of an immaterial error and restated the cost of sales for all periods presented. And it did not have an impact on our operating income, gross margin or earnings per share. It was clearly a reclassification.

Zachary Cummins

Understood. That's helpful. And Tony, final question for me is really around the launch of your new Cloud and Endpoint solutions. Just to make sure I was getting all the metrics right. Would you mind repeating kind of some of the pipeline metrics that you shared during the conference call script? And I'm assuming all of the existing channel partners you have are likely ready to go right now to sell these new solutions?

Anthony Scott

Yes. So we've been working for the last several months getting our partners and resellers and so on ready for this launch, getting our collateral material together and all the things that you would expect at that particular time. And so the metrics I was talking about has to do with our proof of values, proof of concepts and things like that. So let me re-share those. So one of the things that we track in our sales force instance is qualified leads. So these are leads that we know there's a budget, we understand what the demand is, there's been at least an initial conversation and a desire to learn more about our product and so on. It's not just somebody clicking on the website or some sort of casual interest. It's a real sales opportunity for us. And we have a funnel process that we go through to eventually determine that it's a qualified lead that bears our putting time into and also our channel partners putting time into.

In most cases, they've already put some considerable time into it. So those have doubled. We've also doubled the proof of concept and proof of value. So once we get through the initial sales pipeline, then we actually get our hardware or software as the case may be installed at the customer site and we begin a defined period of time where the customer experiences what our product can do in order to make a determination whether they ultimately want to buy it or not. So those have doubled. And then probably the other measure that I think is important and we talked about on the call is quotes outstanding. So these are cases where in dialog with the customer, we have a specific request to provide a quote and our goal is to turn those quotes into actual sales. So those are all leading indicators of trajectory in terms of where the company is going and I'm pleased to see those numbers kind of show up in Q3.

Zachary Cummins

Understood. That was extremely helpful. Well, congrats on the continued progress here in Q3 and then best of luck with the rest of the year.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Scott Buck with H.C. Wainright.

Scott Buck

My first question, I may have missed it, Tony, at the front end of the call, but what part of the quarter did you guys go live with Endpoint and Cloud?

Anthony Scott

Yes. It was near the end of the quarter. What happened there is, we were ready to go, and we realized there was some additional patent coverage that we really wanted to have and needed to have before we went GA with these products. So we had a slight delay of a couple of weeks while we got that patent coverage in place. The good news is it allowed us to do some additional feature development that probably wouldn't have gotten done otherwise. So I'd call it a good delay for 2 reasons, but it was a little bit later in the quarter than I had originally been hoping for, but we did get it out at the end of the quarter, hope for them.

Scott Buck

Was there any revenue contribution from these 2 products during the quarter?

Anthony Scott

No, because neither were GA at the end of the very end of the quarter, so.

Scott Buck

Okay. Perfect. My next question on the vTech partnership and really just your channel partnerships in general. Can you remind us what the economics look like there? I assume maybe a little bit lower revenue, but higher gross margin versus what would occur under our direct sales relationship?

Anthony Scott

Right. So we have agreements in place with all of our resellers. And most of them are commission kind of basis or a discount basis, but they sell our products, they build the customer, we build them is kind of the nature of the relationship. In most cases, they'll provide first-line support. They'll have technical teams that help with the install, answer any Tier 1, helped us kind of calls and so on. So it's a good alternative in my view to building up a large team internally that would be needed if we were going to do all of that directly ourselves.

Scott Buck

Sure. And how many channel partners do you guys have in place currently? And what's the pipeline look like for adding additional capacity?

Anthony Scott

I don't know the exact number off the top of my head. I can get back to you with that. But we're focused on around 8 to 10 at this particular point or, I'll say, more active than the others and it's probably double that in total that I'd say are active partners, but we're really focused on the top 8 or so that are really delivering leads and really engaging in direct customers. And that's apart from the managed service providers and managed security service providers that are their own sort of activity.

Scott Buck

Right. Okay. And they're all educated up on the product, so there's not a 6-month lag in terms of when they could actually start selling?

Anthony Scott

Yes, they are. We'll obviously continue to develop additional material. And one of the things that happens when you get a product into the marketplace is you try to anticipate ahead of time with all of the questions and all of the frequently asked concerns or whatever it might be. But there's no substitute for getting out in the marketplace and getting feedback and hearing what the real customers have to say. So, there will be a period here where that feedback will be critically important as we try to do a better job.

Scott Buck

Sure. All right. Just one more for me. You guys did a nice job bringing down OpEx over the course of the last year. What's the expectation going forward in terms of -- are there some additional areas that you can, I don't know, be more disciplined around if the environment gets a little bit worse? Or do you need to really start to add here to support the growth in the top line?

Anthony Scott

Well, I'll let Kim comment, but our main goal is to improve sales. We think now we have the opportunity with the 2 new products in a pretty complete offering to really spur sales. And then our objective is to grow internal resources at a slower rate than sales. So I think Kim mentioned improved margins in her conversation. But our goal for the next 2 quarters, in particular, and I think forever, will be grow sales and then grow cost at a slower rate.

Kimberly Pinson

And then just to add on to what Tony said. I think the go-to-market structure that we have achieved will allow us to grow our expenses in relation and have to make those significant investments as we grow our clients. So we do plan on responsible fiscal management and really not getting ahead of ourselves in terms of expense spend, and we'll continue to spend responsibly, we'll continue to invest in new features and functionality and new products, but we will moderate that with our product adoption as in at the rate at which our top line growth. And on that same basis, to a lower expenses, we will continue to invest in sales and marketing, but due to the go-to-market structure, it will be at a lesser extent than what otherwise we would have seen once the new products launched.

Scott Buck

Okay. Great. I appreciate the time guys.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Woo with Ascendiant Capital.

Ed Woo

Congratulations on the product releases. My question is, you mentioned about the weakening macro environment, challenges of IT budget, at the same time, cybersecurity remains a priority. Do you anticipate longer sales cycles and/or maybe pricing pressures going forward?

Anthony Scott

Yes. I think that's a natural sort of result given the macroeconomic climate we're in. But there's a couple of other things I would mention here, too. I hear a couple of themes from CIOs and CCIOs when we talk to them. One of them is that they're [indiscernible], having 52 vendors in the cybersecurity space, and they're sort of looking for better coverage from a fewer number of vendors than what they have today. So it tells me that there's likely to be some industry consolidation or things like that as the pressure comes to -- from the customer base.

But I also hear and I think this helps Intrusion, they're looking at solutions that are focused on the coming threats and the threats that are -- that seem to be growing today versus yesterday's problems. And I think our forward facing cybersecurity solutions play well in that dynamic, so. And as we all know, cybersecurity attacks are still successful. There was news this week of yet another one. So a big company getting attacked. So I think those show that we're not winning the war yet against some of these adversaries.

Ed Woo

Well, I wish you guys good luck.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Warwick with Breakout Investors.

Aaron Warwick

I'm sorry, I had a problem, technical difficulty getting on the call. And I got on at the very end of when you were talking about strategic partnerships and some delays. Could you cover that again for me real quickly?

Anthony Scott

Sure. Well, I think the bottom line of this is, I've hoped to announce a major strategic partnership by the end of the third quarter. And in my comments, I said I think the macroeconomic conditions are creating an environment where those conversations have slowed down a little bit. Just to add a little color. One of the partners we were talking to had a staff reduction of almost 50% in the team that was talking with us. So I think it means that in major tech companies, and you're seeing this in the market broadly, most of them are not having a great time right now, and that puts a lot of pressure on internal teams and I think also limits the kinds of relationships that they're willing to engage them. So I'm seeing that firsthand.

That said, nobody has said, go away, we don't want to talk to you anymore and our conversations will continue. So we will announce something in due time when it's when it's done. I'm still pursuing those with vigor. And I'm still hopeful that we'll be able to get one done. The timing is just a little more uncertain and I would say I felt it was going to be 3 or 4 months ago.

Aaron Warwick

Okay. Well, it was good on the positive note, I guess, it's good to hear about the deepening of the relationship with Super Micro. Could you talk about that a little bit more? I mean, I just -- specifically, I guess, from the perspective, I know they do a lot of white box offerings. I know they have an international presence. And what does that -- what has kind of opened up with you guys, I guess, in terms of opportunities?

Super Micro builds a lot of platforms. And there's a platform for lot of open source solutions. They've got great penetration in the small and medium market. And increasingly, as there's cost pressure on IT budgets and so on, they're going to be a great alternative to some of the higher priced solutions that are there in the market. And so our ability to partner with them and be a part of the portfolio they can offer their customers, I think is good for us, and I think good for them as well. And they wanted to broaden their offerings, and I think we're a very good partner for them in that respect.

Aaron Warwick

Good. Final one for me, I guess, would just be as it relates to more on the government side, have you guys been looking into being added to the GSA schedule or being added to things like Department of Homeland Security in terms of the offerings that they're able to accept?

Anthony Scott

Yes. And we'll go on initially as a sub to other offerings, not directly, but we are working on also being on directly as well. But the most immediate occurrence will be as a sub to other offerings.

Aaron Warwick

And is that on like for both the departments or just the GSA or what's --?

Anthony Scott

GSA, and DoD are our 3 primary targets. Excellent.

Operator

Our final question will come from the line of Ross Taylor with ARS Investment Partners.

Porter Taylor

Congratulations on getting the cash burn down. Tony, real quick, just to pick up on an answer you gave to Aaron. You said you'd be a sub to other offerings. That sounds very much like you already know who those other offerings are, and you're in the process of getting approval or getting put into those offerings? Is that a correct way to read that?

Anthony Scott

That is correct, yes.

Porter Taylor

So what needs to be done to cross that bridge? It sounds like that could be a fairly -- that could either be a forever or it could be a very quick short bridge to cross. Where -- how long do you think it takes before you get to --?

Anthony Scott

Yes, the normal process would be a proposal goes in and the prime time director lists, the subs that they want to use or could participate in that particular contract. And once it's awarded, then the prime becomes responsible for the relationship. So as we mentioned, there's a CR right now, so we're not expecting any new contracts until after the CRs get ended and normal funding occurs. But as in every year, where there's been CRs, there ends up building a lot of demand behind the dam, if you will. And as soon as the CR ends, then contracts start to flow. So we hope to be on a number of those new contracts when the dam finally gets released.

Porter Taylor

So I read that as you're saying that those -- since they're in that process and are being held up by the CR, which I guess we've had 15 at the mid last '20 budget years.

Anthony Scott

Yes, correct.

Porter Taylor

You already have the prime that has put the contracts in and you've already basically worked with the prime, the prime is intending to include you in that. Is that a correct way to think about that?

Anthony Scott

Yes, we have some, and we're working on a whole heck of a bunch more. So, is the way I would characterize that. We're in a handful today, and I want to be in multiple handfuls within the next year.

Porter Taylor

Okay. Do we know -- have you announced those primes that you're working with? Are they already customers? Or are they people who at this point in time, we do not know are going to be working with you?

Anthony Scott

We've not made any announcements in that regard at this point now.

Porter Taylor

Okay. So you basically -- and what they're going for is specific contracts. So these -- when they get -- when we get out of the CR and these get approved, this could be a fairly significant revenue ramp and quite honestly, proof point, although I think it's becoming less of a concern for many investors as to whether or not the shield works, it will be a massive proof point as you get these contracts out. So it sounds like you've already won those primes over on the value shield. Would that be correct?

Anthony Scott

I'd say that's true. I think the one caveat I would say is that in most of these cases, there's competitive bidding going on. So if our prime, the one we selected doesn't win the contract, and neither do we. And so we'll see over time how many of these end up being winning contracts versus ones that are not winning. And that's always a lot challenging aspect. But our goal is to have more of that than we've historically had, and I think we're well positioned to do that.

Porter Taylor

Talk about the competitive landscape for people doing what you do. How -- in the past, it was said this is a fairly unique thing. Does it still remain -- is there anyone else who is offering a product like what you're offering? Are the people bidding for these contracts using a different -- a totally different approach to provide -- you've said before that basically Shield is almost prime [indiscernible] a 0-day defense Cloud defense that's very unique. Is that the case? So other people are offering what you would consider an inferior defense?

Anthony Scott

Well, I think it's a question of 2 things. One is there is nobody else like us that we can find that has this sort of reputation-based approach and the really large database that we have. There's nobody that comes close, we think we're at least 10x bigger than the next closest guys. So we think that offers a real strong advantage. There are others who claim that their solutions are effective because they use things and these are all great buzzwords in the industry today, machine learning, AI, behavior-based analytics, the list kind of goes on and on and on.

We still think our solution is more effective than those kinds of approaches. And the fact that we don't rely on strictly on signatures or fingerprints or some known set of behavior that we've seen before is, I think, unique in the marketplace. Time will tell. Right now, we're still a little known company. And our biggest effort is to speak with a louder voice and get more exposure so that people can learn what we do and try us out and provide additional references and things like that.

But we keep looking around to try to see if there's anybody doing what we do. And while there are some companies that are starting to gather the kind of data that we have, they can't get the 30-year history that we already have. It's just not -- it's not possible. So we still think there's unique value there and one that gives us a leg up.

Porter Taylor

Put a different way, by the time they have a 30-year history, you'll have a 60-year. One of the ways that an investor like me, judges companies like you, where it's hard to truly understand the nature of the dynamics of the product is by finding who you ally with. We were early into Zscaler because of the relationship they have with Microsoft. Well, when we know the names of your primes, we know the names of your strategic partners, will we be impressed by them?

Anthony Scott

Well, impressed, I hope so, but you'll know the names for sure.

Porter Taylor

So that will be significant players in the space.

Anthony Scott

That's our goal, yes.

Porter Taylor

Okay. And what kind of work do those guys do -- those firms do to proof out your product?

Anthony Scott

Well, there -- we picked ones in -- each in different spaces. So some have -- one has products that we would integrate with. One has services that we would integrate with as an example. So we're -- at the moment, we were not talking to multiple versions of each of those. We picked a leading product company and a leading services company and thought that was our best shot after looking at gaps that they have in their offerings. I will say that if things stay slow, I will probably broaden our conversation to more companies than we're currently talking to.

Porter Taylor

It would seem that if you do have this truly unique product, it would make a great deal of sense to effectively kind of create -- you're going to play with one player in each space, it would make sense to actually create a little bit of a race or a hustle for it because if people start to recognize that, this is what it appears to be, there should be a landslide pushing towards it. I just want to say I think that I could talk at greater length at 6:00. I think people are certainly tired of having me speak. They probably aren't tired of hearing you.

Anthony Scott

Yes. My only comment, Ross, would be, I chose one because of the impact on resources. These conversations take people, engineers, blah blah, and I didn't want to dilute our resources broadly. I chose a more focused approach, and we'll see what happens as time marches on here, but that was a deliberate choice initially.

Porter Taylor

But by the same measure, the people who are partnering you with these potential deals with the government have also committed resources and decided after putting those resources that they want to include you in their package. So they're willing to bet their reputations on yours. Actually, quite a lot of years ago, I made a lot of money on a company called Albany International, which developed a new way to make fan blades for jet engine when Boeing said that they were going to use the [indiscernible] engine, people thought that was crazy, but they actually -- there are leading-edge technologies, the companies who never think could happen.

Anthony Scott

That's right. That's exactly right.

Porter Taylor

Well, congratulations, I heard there's a lot more going on here than you're letting on. It's pretty exciting, I think, just picking up some of the stuff that some of the following -- going through some of these doors aren't open. So thank you very much. I'll talk to you later.

Operator

And with that, I'll turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.

Anthony Scott

Well, again, I would just like to say thank you to our investors and analysts and all those who are paying attention to us. For me, it's coming up on 1-year anniversary of joining the company, and I'm quite proud of the team. I'm quite proud of the work that we've been able to do this year. And I'm even more excited about what the next year will bring. So I appreciate your going on the journey with us.

“The move is part of a wider effort to ensure the midterms are secure from cybersecurity threats, which have loomed large in recent years since Russian interference operations in 2016,” the outlet added.

During a press conference on Friday, Washington Air National Guard Brig. Gen. Gent Welsh said, “One of the things making a lot of this possible are states that’ve just decided to do it.”

“Not everyone’s doing it, and those that are have invested in cyber talent and cyber missions for years. If you don’t have a cyber unit in your state you’re not in a good position to help them protect elections,” he added.

TRENDING: MIDTERM ELECTION TODAY! Revenge for the Political Persecution We Endured is at the Ballot Boxes! YOU MUST VOTE and ACTIVATE YOUR RED FRIENDS!

The 14 states with National Guard teams on duty on election day are North Carolina, Arizona, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, Washington, and West Virginia.

Fox News reported:

National Guard officials will work and receive security updates from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the key agency tasked with protecting election infrastructure against cyber threats, according to Politico. There are 38 total cyber units within the National Guard consisting of over 2,200 personnel working to support state and local officials with cyber issues like network assessments and risk mitigation. States like North Carolina have “core teams” of 10 cyber personnel, but that number will increase during an election cycle to include federal and emergency management partners.",cybersecurity,thegatewaypundit.com
115,"At NYC school with sharpest drop in math scores, high poverty, crowded classrooms and a recent gun scare",https://cdn.cms.prod.nypr.digital/original_images/medgar.jpg,06/11/2022,"Medgar Evers College Preparatory School in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
 

Medgar Evers College Preparatory School in Crown Heights serves as an extreme example of the pandemic-era challenges facing students and educators. [ more › ]",https://gothamist.com/news/at-nyc-school-with-sharpest-drop-in-math-scores-high-poverty-crowded-classrooms-and-a-recent-gun-scare,"At the Brooklyn school that saw the sharpest drop in math scores in the city since 2019, classrooms are chronically overcrowded, 81% of students have experienced poverty and students recently had to pass through metal detectors before going to class.

Schools around the country are trying to recover from pandemic learning loss, which was documented in recently released test scores. Medgar Evers College Preparatory School in Crown Heights serves as an extreme example of how COVID-19 combined with other ongoing equity, safety and economic challenges to create a particularly difficult learning environment.

Parents and students at the Crown Heights school serving grades six through 12 point to remote instruction – and the resources needed for it – as the main factor causing the drop in math achievement. But concerns about school safety and other data on the school with 1,500 students points to other factors, as well.

Councilmember Rita Joseph, who also chairs the Council's education committee, said the test scores highlight how other entrenched problems were exacerbated by the pandemic.

""Learning loss during COVID for students is a very real and concerning phenomena,"" said Joseph, who represents parts of Brooklyn, in a statement. ""Candidly, some communities were hit much harder than others by it. The (Department of Education) needs to use every tool at their disposal to mitigate it so that students are equipped to gain the academic and social skills they need.""

Math proficiency fell more sharply at Medgar Evers than any other school in the city — by 49.9% over the last two years. In 2019, of 173 students tested in the state math assessment, about 81% were proficient. In 2022, that number fell to just 31%, with 158 students tested, city data show. Citywide, the percent of proficient students dropped by just 7.6 points.

The test scores released by the city in September cover the third through eighth grades, and the vast majority of math exam results at Medgar Evers were from sixth graders in 2019 and 2022. The number of students who took the exam in both years is comparable to other schools that saw a sharp drop in math proficiency.

The results were the first large-scale measure of third through eighth grade math and English Language Arts proficiency since the pandemic. In 2020 there was no exam, and only 21% of students took the test in 2021.

The sharp drop on state math exams mirrors trends on the NAEP exam, which is known as the nation’s report card. Only 18% of New York City fourth graders were proficient in math — the lowest level in almost 20 years — compared to 24% in 2019.

Kim Morgan, a parent of two students at Medgar Evers, said the switch to remote learning was a huge challenge for students.

“We are a predominantly Black school. Some, I should say a lot, of parents lost their jobs. And some students didn’t have internet. There was a lack of internet in their homes, a lack of devices,” said Morgan, a member of the school's PTA.

A July audit by the state comptroller’s office found that lower-income families were more likely to find themselves among the 16% of New York City residents without broadband internet at home.

She said problems with the city’s rollout of iPads and Chromebooks for remote learning didn’t help.

“So that’s another difficulty that could have caused these kids’ scores to drop. It’s not that math isn’t top of the mind, how could anyone really focus during that time? We were thrown into something that we didn’t know what it was,” Morgan added. “Even adults couldn’t think straight.”

Still, she credited the school principal, Dr. Michael Wiltshire and other administrators, saying they “move mountains.” She appreciated communication from school leadership who quickly alerted parents late last month after a student was arrested for bringing a gun into the building. The student told an administrator he’d brought the gun “for protection,” according to The New York Post. Wiltshire did not respond to an inquiry.

The incident was a reflection of a wider issue where students are fearful for their safety, said Mona Davids with the advocacy group School Safety Coalition.

“No child can learn in an unsafe environment. That is simply not possible. New York City students right now are afraid. Because of this justified fear that they have traveling to and from school, incidents that are happening around the schools, the rampant gun violence in our communities,” she said. “It’s a crisis.”

The metal detectors temporarily set up at school entrances following the incident hadn’t stopped some rowdiness.

“Like just today, during my lunch period, two fights broke out. That’s the same day they had metal detectors scanning children, and they’re still acting out,” said Tyson Primus, an 11th grader at the school.

Medgar Evers students who spoke to Gothamist were not surprised by the sharp drop in math scores among the new sixth graders, describing serious difficulty paying attention during remote learning.

“I would say procrastination. Especially online, it’s hard to stay focused,” said Linsey Rollins, a 12th grader planning to study cybersecurity in college.

Primus, who said math used to be his strongest subject, agreed.

“I think a lot of students didn’t do the work, because they just could get away with it. Math was a class I always had 90s in, but during the pandemic, I actually failed my math class. I was that lazy,” the 11th grader said.

Poverty at the majority Black school has increased in the pandemic. In the 2019-2020 school year, 76% of students experienced poverty. In 2021-2022 school year, that increased to 81% – about 1,176 kids, according to education department data.

The school was also flagged as the most overcrowded in the borough last year in a list published by the advocacy group Class Size Matters. Plans for a new building to help alleviate overcrowding were announced in 2020 – but the space won’t come online until 2025 at the earliest.

“This would no doubt contribute to terrible learning conditions, depriving their students of a real chance to succeed,” wrote Leonie Haimson, director of Class Size Matters.

The education department said in a statement that it is taking several steps to improve academic success at the school.

“School leaders at Medgar Evers College Prep, including the principal and district superintendent, are putting in place interventions including after school tutoring, encouraging independent practice at home, peer tutoring, full day summer programming, and Saturday Academy to bolster support for struggling students,” the statement read.",cybersecurity,gothamist

by Doug Cunningham



Washington DC (UPI) Nov 4, 2021



Chinese rocket debris weighing 23 tons is crashing to Earth in an uncontrolled descent Friday.

U.S. Space Command tweeted a confirmation that the rocket re-entered the Earth's atmosphere over the south-central Pacific Ocean at 4:01 a.m. Friday.

The rocket was launched on Oct. 31 carrying the third and final module for the Tiangong space station. Much of the debris is expected to burn up as it passes through Earth's atmosphere.

The Aerospace Corporation had calculated that the Chinese rocket would re-enter Earth's atmosphere Friday morning. Those predictive calculations include a huge area of possible re-entry, from parts of North America and nearly all of Central America to a large part of Africa and some of southeastern Australia.

A similar Chinese rocket re-entry happened in July with another Long March 5B rocket that also launched a Chinese space station module. That space junk came down over the Indian Ocean, with most of the debris burned and destroyed as the rocket fell through the Earth's atmosphere.

""The general rule of thumb is that 20-40% of the mass of a large object will reach the ground, but the exact number depends on the design of the object,"" the Aerospace Corporation wrote.

This is the fourth time that a Chinese rocket has fallen back to Earth uncontrolled. Space debris from other nations, including the United States, has also come back to Earth uncontrolled.

But Aerospace Corporation consultant Dr. Ted Muelhaupt said a small piece of SpaceX debris that landed uncontrolled in Australia was different that the Chinese uncontrolled descents.

""The thing I want to point out about this is that we, the world, don't deliberately launch things this big intending them to fall wherever,"" he said. ""We haven't done that for 50 years.""

But according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the way these rockets are re-entering Earth's atmosphere is not unusual. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the Long March 5B rockets are designed for most of it to burn up and be destroyed during re-entry.

Spain briefly closes part of its airspace due to Chinese rocket debris

Madrid (AFP) Nov 4, 2022 - Spain briefly closed part of its airspace on Friday as remnants of a Chinese rocket passed by, disrupting air travel in several cities including Barcelona, officials said.

Flights were ""totally restricted"" for 40 minutes in Catalonia in the northeast and several other regions ""due to the risk associated with the passage of the space object CZ-5B through the Spanish airspace,"" Catalonia's civil protection service tweeted.

The airspace closure, which began at 9:38 am (0838 GMT), affected several other regions in northern Spain, it added.

Flights in and out of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, Tarragona, Reus and Ibiza in the Balearic Islands and other destinations were temporarily disrupted as a result, Spain's airport operator AENA said.

The rocket, the Long March 5B (CZ-5B), blasted off from southern China on Monday to deliver the last module for a Chinese space station currently under construction.

Debris from the rocket fell into the south-central Pacific Ocean at 11:01 am Spain time (1001 GMT), the US Space Command said in a tweet.

As rockets fall back to Earth, most of them burn up on re-entry, although large chunks may survive.

China has faced criticism for allowing rockets to fall to Earth uncontrolled in the past.

In July, remnants from a Chinese rocket fell into the Sulu Sea in the Philippines, prompting leading US officials to chide Beijing for not sharing information about the potentially hazardous object's descent.

This is according to a new report from Group-IB, a cybersecurity firm, entitled, “OPERA1ER: Playing God without permission,…",https://punchng.com/hackers-steal-11m-from-nigeria-others/,"A gang of hackers, OPERA1ER, stole at least $11m from companies in Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, 11 other African countries, and Argentina.

This is according to a new report from Group-IB, a cybersecurity firm, entitled, “OPERA1ER: Playing God without permission,” in collaboration with the researchers from Orange CERT Coordination Center.

The firm disclosed that digital forensic artifacts analysed by it and Orange followed more than 30 successful intrusions of the gang between 2018 and 2022.

The company’s data revealed that companies in Ivory Coast were the most targeted.

It said this helped it to trace affected organisations in Ivory Coast, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin, Cameroon, Bangladesh, Gabon, Niger, Nigeria, Paraguay, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Togo, and Argentina.

It added that while it estimated that the gang stole $11m, it could have actually stolen as high as $30m.

It stated, “The report takes a deep dive into financially motivated attacks of the prolific French-speaking threat actor, codenamed OPERA1ER.

“Despite relying solely on known ‘off-the-shelf’ tools, the gang managed to carry out more than 30 successful attacks against banks, financial services, and telecommunication companies mainly located in Africa between 2018 and 2022. OPERA1ER is confirmed to have stolen at least $11m, according to Group-IB’s estimates.

“One of OPERA1ER’s attacks involved a vast network of 400 mule accounts for fraudulent money withdrawals. Researchers from the Group-IB European Threat Intelligence Unit identified and reached out to 16 affected organizations so they could mitigate the threat and prevent further attacks by OPERA1ER.”

According to the firm, the report was completed in 2021 when the threat actor was active. Head of cyber threat research at Group-IB Europe, Rustam Mirkasymov, said, “Detailed analysis of the gang’s recent attacks revealed an interesting pattern in their modus operandi: OPERA1ER conducts attacks mainly during the weekends or public holidays.

“It correlates with the fact that they spend from 3 to 12 months from the initial access to money theft. It was established that the French-speaking hacker group could operate from Africa. The exact number of the gang members is unknown.”",cybersecurity,the punch
118,Russia reactivates its trolls and bots ahead of Tuesday’s midterms,https://www.bostonglobe.com/pf/resources/images/logo-bg.jpg?d=368,06/11/2022,political notebook,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/11/06/nation/russia-reactivates-its-trolls-bots-ahead-tuesdays-midterms/,"The posts mostly denigrated President Biden and other prominent Democrats, sometimes obscenely. They also lamented the use of taxpayer dollars to support Ukraine in its war against invading Russian forces, depicting Ukraine’s president as a caricature straight out of Russian propaganda.

The user on Gab who identifies as Nora Berka resurfaced in August after a yearlong silence on the social media platform, reposting a handful of messages with sharply conservative political themes before writing a stream of original vitriol.

The account was previously linked to the same secretive Russian agency that interfered in the 2016 presidential election and again in 2020, the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, according to the cybersecurity group Recorded Future.

It is part of what the group and other researchers have identified as a new, though more narrowly targeted, Russian effort ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections. The goal, as before, is to stoke anger among conservative voters and to undermine trust in the American electoral system. This time, it also appears intended to undermine the Biden administration’s extensive military assistance to Ukraine.

“It’s clear they are trying to get them to cut off aid and money to Ukraine,” said Alex Plitsas, a former Army soldier and Pentagon information operations official now with Providence Consulting Group, a business technology company.

The campaign — using accounts that pose as enraged Americans like Nora Berka — have added fuel to the most divisive political and cultural issues in the country today.

It has specifically targeted Democratic candidates in the most contested races, including the Senate seats up for grabs in Ohio, Arizona, and Pennsylvania, calculating that a Republican majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives could help the Russian war effort.

The campaigns show not only how vulnerable the American political system remains to foreign manipulation but also how purveyors of disinformation have evolved and adapted to efforts by the major social media platforms to remove or play down false or deceptive content.

Last month, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an alert warning of the threat of disinformation spread by “dark web media channels, online journals, messaging applications, spoofed websites, emails, text messages and fake online personas.” The disinformation could include claims that voting data or results had been hacked or compromised.

The agencies urged people not to like, discuss, or share posts online from unknown or distrustful sources. They did not identify specific efforts, but social media platforms and researchers who track disinformation have recently uncovered a variety of campaigns by Russia, China, and Iran.

Recorded Future and two other social media research companies, Graphika and Mandiant, found a number of Russian campaigns that have turned to Gab, Parler, Getter, and other newer platforms that pride themselves on creating unmoderated spaces in the name of free speech.

These are much smaller campaigns than those in the 2016 election, where inauthentic accounts reached millions of voters across the political spectrum on Facebook and other major platforms. The efforts are no less pernicious, though, in reaching impressionable users who can help accomplish Russian objectives, researchers said.

“The audiences are much, much smaller than on your other traditional social media networks,” said Brian Liston, a senior intelligence analyst with Recorded Future who identified the Nora Berka account. “But you can engage the audiences in much more targeted influence ops because those who are on these platforms are generally US conservatives who are maybe more accepting of conspiratorial claims.”

Faith leaders preach on politics in pre-election services

Across America, faith leaders squeezed in some final messages about the midterm elections during their worship services over the weekend. Some passionately took stands on divisive issues such as immigration and abortion; others pleaded for an easing of the political polarization fracturing their communities and their nation.

“God has no team,” Rabbi David Wolpe told the politically diverse congregation at his Los Angeles synagogue, Sinai Temple.

“The notion that one party or faction is repository of all virtue is fatuous and dangerous,” Wolpe added. “God is greater than parties. If we catch some of that spirit, perhaps we can begin to heal the deep divisions that beset our nation and our world.”

Less than 50 miles away, at the Calvary Chapel Chino Hills megachurch, Pastor Jack Hibbs was eager to take sides in what he calls a “cultural war.” In addition to collecting ballots during Sunday worship, he urged his evangelical congregation to oppose a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in California’s Constitution, calling it “the death cult proposition.” He told them to be wary of local candidates who back it or receive support from groups like Planned Parenthood.

The measure — Proposition 1 — is a response to the US Supreme Court’s decision in June eliminating the longstanding constitutional right to abortion nationwide. While that ruling didn’t affect access to abortion in California, Democratic politicians nonetheless sought the extra protection of a constitutional amendment.

In a left-of-center Catholic parish in Hoboken, N.J., the Rev. Alex Santora exhorted his parishioners to be engaged on issues such as immigration, abortion, and gun control.

“As Catholics we should always focus on the common good and what is best for the majority of people,” he said in his homily at the Church of Our Lady of Grace & St. Joseph.

“Living in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, I reject all attempts to demonize migrants and immigrants, who have built up our country,” Santora added. “We should be magnanimous, not restrictive and unchristian.”

Clergy didn’t confine their election messages to within the church walls. On Saturday, the Rev. Alyn Waller, senior pastor at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church in Philadelphia, hosted a Black Bikers Vote rally. Motorcyclists gathered outside the church before riding through the city urging residents to vote.

“We think that categorically, if you’re a good citizen, a good faith person, a good Christian, you vote,” said Waller.

PHOENIX — Authorities on Sunday were investigating an envelope that reportedly contained suspicious white powder that was opened at the Phoenix campaign headquarters of Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake.

Phoenix police and fire officials said they were called to the building around 2 a.m. and there were no reports of injuries or illness.

It’s still unclear what was in the envelope.

Lake’s campaign said the staff member who opened the envelope was under medical supervision.

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the incident “is incredibly concerning.”

That changed in August as the U.S. midterm elections approached.

“We saw these accounts beginning to spin up, talking about election fraud or that the election was going to be fraudulent, with ballot stuffing and things like that, or Democrats are going to try to steal the election,” said Liston, who works for Recorded Future, a cybersecurity firm.

Liston is among a network of researchers, cybersecurity experts, government agencies and others that comb through social media, websites, state media and law enforcement announcements to track coordinated disinformation campaigns stemming from U.S. adversaries such as Russia, China and Iran.

Fake news sites by organizations associated with these governments promote divisive stories about America that are then promoted by fake social media personas pretending to be Americans.

Russian operatives sow division that the U.S. voting system can’t be trusted, Liston said. Chinese operatives highlight the volume of online anxiety about the integrity of the vote as evidence that American democracy is not working.

“As much as they talk about election denial and voter fraud, I remain concerned that maybe these accounts come Election Day would attempt to provoke some sort of violence or harassment of poll workers at polling stations and things like that,” he said. Recorded Future analysts will be monitoring chatter if the online discussions start to shift, he said.

Twitter took down China-based operations on its site that were trying to influence the U.S. midterms, The Washington Post reported. A representative for the Chinese embassy in Washington denied that the country was behind the accounts, the Post reported.

Twitter also took down three networks associated with Iran, the report said.

In Tempe, Arizona, Dylan Murphy was in town for work. A mathematician from Tucson, Murphy said he worries about the real-world consequences of online misinformation.

“My concern is that foreign actors can spread disinformation and conspiracy theories through social media and kind of pit Americans against each other in a way they wouldn't be, left to their own devices,” he said.

While online disinformation particularly from foreign actors is not new, he said, what is new is people taking action.

“We're seeing more in-person direct action resulting from these conspiracy theories, such as people showing up to ballot drop boxes here in Arizona, armed,” he said.



A Falstaff, Arizona, man who gave his name as Fred was having lunch with his parents in Tempe last week. He said he mostly worries about the influence of money on elections. But he does wonder about the voting system, he said.

“I would say I have concerns about the system,” he said. “Who's to say that they count all the votes properly?”

Arizona was a big part of electoral challenges to the presidential election two years ago, with a Republican recount of results in Maricopa County ultimately confirming a Joe Biden win. Many Donald Trump supporters continue to say that election was stolen, among them Arizona Republican candidate for governor, Kari Lake.

Maricopa County elections officials say ballot tabulation machines are not connected to the internet. They livestream voters delivering ballots to drop boxes and ballots being counted.

“In addition to physical security, we also have security over the ballots and over the process,” said Megan Gilbertson, a representative for the Maricopa County Elections Department.

She cited “bipartisan boards, political party observers and checks throughout the process to make sure that each ballot is accounted for, and only valid ballots are counted.”

In Arizona, where early voting is under way, voter Miriam Mitchell put her ballot in a ballot drop box at the Maricopa County Elections office in downtown Phoenix.

“Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, sometimes we don't win, and we felt that they should have won, but we still follow the democratic process. We hand over the torch like we’re supposed to,” she said. “That's the only thing that's great about America is our democratic process. And we need to hold on to that.”",cybersecurity,voa news

One of our company mottos is ‘survival of the unfittest’, as that is who we have to protect.”

The recent focus on cyber threats in Australia, due to high-profile data breaches at Optus and Medibank, means Darwinium is making its public debut in a market where front page headlines are helping its sales pitch.

Its product promises to reduce the threat of having your online credentials stolen, by making them useless to the crooks trying to use them.

Working from a principle that customers are likely to lose some of their credentials in increasingly common data breaches, Darwinium is a platform that sits across a company’s digital presence, and watches for signs of bad or inconsistent behaviour.

It can flag and prevent transactions, where it has spotted signs someone is trying to conduct fraud, with someone else’s password or credentials.

“Darwinium is built for a world where there are no longer secrets, or where you cannot rely on secrets, if you assume that people’s online passwords are going to get stolen, then we turn behaviour into identity,” Mr Faulkner said.

“You can determine the difference between the way that two different individuals are accessing systems, which can be helpful to stop data breaches or theft of money.

“An analogy would be noticing if someone who usually does something left-handed is using their right … Protecting customers is good for business, and it’s good for your brand.”

Second-time founder

Mr Faulkner said the capital raising experience in Australia was much easier now than when he had been trying to raise money for ThreatMetrix, due to a much more active local venture capital scene.

The funding round was led by Blackbird Ventures, alongside AirTree Ventures, and also included investment from well-known international angel investors including AngelList’s Naval Ravikant and Jeff Fagnan.

As with ThreatMetrix, Darwinium has its official headquarters in the US, with all of its research and development done from Sydney and a sales presence in the US and UK.

Mr Faulkner said with ThreatMetrix this had been because that was where the money and exits happened, and he still believed it would help financially due to the US being Darwinium’s largest target market.

However, he said he had come out of a short retirement after selling his former company partly because of a “sense of duty” to show that world-class cybersecurity companies could be built in Australia.

When ThreatMetrix was growing it had found it more difficult to win business from big Australian companies than from larger international firms, something that needed to change.

“Basically, we have to get over the cultural cringe of using our own software. For some reason, we believe we can be the world’s best sportspeople, but we don’t seem to think that we can build the world’s best cybersecurity,” Mr Faulkner said.

“The likes of Atlassian and Canva have shown that we can certainly produce world-class software, and companies like PC Tools, Secure Code Warrior and a number of others prove that we can also be world leaders in cybersecurity.“

He said that, from a national security perspective, it was important for more technology to be developed locally. He has also invested in local cyber start-ups including Cydarm and CipherStash.

“I think retirement’s overrated, and I know only people that have had the luxury of retiring would say that, but I started again with a strong sense of duty as well, and of foreboding,” Mr Faulkner said.

“The writing is on the wall for a cold hot war, with information warfare and the knowledge that the next world war will be an automated war.

121,What We Know So Far About Twitter’s $7.99 Subscription That Includes Verification,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Twitter-1.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1,06/11/2022,"Twitter is launching a new subscription service for $7.99 a month that allows users to verify their accounts, the company announced in Apple’s app store on Saturday.",https://time.com/6229775/new-twitter-subscription-verification/,"Twitter is launching a new subscription service for $7.99 a month that allows users to verify their accounts, the company announced in Apple’s app store on Saturday. The feature will be a part of Twitter’s already existing Twitter Blue subscription, which is currently $4.99 and offers paid users additional services.

While it’s not clear when the new subscription model will go live, the company said users will be able to receive a blue check mark, “just like the celebrities, companies and politicians you already follow.”

Twitter’s old verification program launched in 2009, amid pressure to authenticate accounts of public figures and agencies to protect the public.

“Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bulls***,” tweeted Musk on Nov. 1. “Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.”

Here’s what to know:

What does the new subscription include?

Outside the blue check mark, those who opt-in for the new service will also experience half of the ads and be able to post longer videos on the platform, according to the announcement.

There isn’t a ton of information available about the updated subscription service, but Musk tweeted on Nov. 5 that current verified users should expect to lose their blue check mark a couple of months after the program rolls out if they choose not to pay the fee.

The announcement did not share whether users will still have to authenticate their identity, or if they will simply receive a verification symbol regardless.

Twitter products team manager Esther Crawford tweeted that the newest Twitter Blue is not live just yet. Android users also do not have access to this new feature. No launch date has been officially announced, though some speculate that it might go live starting Nov. 7.

Twitter Blue was previously described as a monthly subscription “that gives the most engaged people on Twitter exclusive access to premium features.” This includes features like editing a tweet, which launched for Twitter Blue users in October. It is currently available in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

What are some of the criticisms?

Critics of the verification subscription plan argue that it takes away from the original intent behind the blue check, which helps users identify if they are receiving information from a reliable source. Musk said in a tweet Saturday that accounts that attempt to impersonate previously verified profiles on the platform would be suspended.

Some also argue the company’s newest verification plan puts much at risk in an era of online misinformation, especially as Election Day occurs the day after the program’s suspected launch. Journalists, political scientists and politicians, among others, expressed their concerns about the change online.

“[My] main concern w/ the new Twitter Blue offering is the verified logo has been a marker of trust I.e., ‘we’ve confirmed the person is who they say they are,’” tweeted former United States Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs. “Now it’s ‘we’re taking their $ & their word for it.’ On the cusp of election where source of info is critical, [this is] a major risk.”

Twitter’s previous verification process launched over a decade ago after a number of celebrity impersonation accounts flocked online. Changes began after the company was sued by Tony La Russa, then manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, in 2009 after an account with his name posted insensitive comments online, the New York Times reports. The platform then experimented with a way to verify the accounts of public figures and agencies that were the most at-risk of impersonation.

The old verification system had its issues as well, however. In August 2021, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Cormac McCarthy said that he was not the owner of the verified account under his name, according to the Times.

Musk has added to the controversy, tweeting in support of rumors that Twitter employees were selling verifications for thousands of dollars.

Users also fear that substantial layoffs at the company could impact content moderation, though Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of safety and integrity, said the content moderation team was least affected by the recent job cuts, AP reports.

“With early voting underway in the US, our efforts on election integrity — including harmful misinformation that can suppress the vote and combatting state-backed information operations — remain a top priority,” Roth tweeted.

It is because outdated Android and iOS phones use old operating systems which are responsible for leaking the data of the users. The cyber security experts at LookOut presented a report based on 175 million applications on 200 million devices which proved the US Government doesn't pay much attention to mobile phone updates. This is the reason why people are using the old versions of their phones and their data is exposed to security threats.5% of government employees and 30% of local government employees are still using the old operating system of the iPhone after the new iPhone 15 is released. However, iOS isn't as risky as Android. It is because IOS keeps on updating its operating system but Android phones cannot be updated to new versions of the operating system.When you use outdated versions of the phone, they are seriously exposed to cyber-attacks because the attackers get to know about the defects in the old version. They also get to know all your personal information on the phone. This way they also try to surpass all the security features on your phone and spread malware into it. If you are using an outdated version for a long time, all the security features on the phone stop functioning and the threat actors can easily retrieve all the information from your phone.About 11% of the federal employees in the US are using outdated versions of Android phones which are no longer supported by Google. Android 7 and Android 8 are not up to date with Google's new operating systems but people are still using them.

In October, crypto asset prices traded in a tight range, with Ethereum outperforming major stock indices, bonds & most commodities (except heating oil & gasoline).

Crypto asset prices traded in a tight range in October, with Ethereum especially outperforming major stock indices, bonds & most commodities (except heating oil & gasoline), even as value stocks beat growth stocks for the month. The most likely reasons for digital assets’ positive performance were 1) the U.S. dollar DXY index fell in October for only the second month in the last ten months; 2) Elevated short interest and a strong equity market prompted more than $2b in leveraged short ETH & BTC positions to be liquidated on major exchanges during a three day period mid-month, including the largest daily sum since July 2021; 3) Republicans’ odds to control the Senate rose sharply in October, implying a lower chance of the US congress passing harmful regulation after the midterms; and 4) UK lawmakers voted in favor of adding crypto to the scope of activities to be regulated via a proposed Financial Services and Markets Bill, the first legislative attempt by new, purportedly pro-crypto prime minister Rishi Sunak.

For the month, ETH rose 14%, Nasdaq +4%, the MVIS Smart Contract Leaders Index +4%, and Bitcoin +4.5%.

Staying on the prospects of further dollar weakness, Saudi Arabia and China have reportedly discussed pricing some oil sales in RMB, according to the WSJ. Russia’s Secretary of State told a legal forum on October 20th that Russia would “bypass” the EU’s crypto-related sanctions and would “provide businesses with the ability to carry out cross-border settlements” making use of “cryptocurrencies, the digital ruble, or a hybrid.” And even as Egypt devalued its pound and sought IMF protection, new central bank governor Hassan Abdalla touted a new currency indicator (including gold but not the USD) meant to wean people off the U.S. dollar: “America is not my major trading partner,” he lamented. “I don’t know why people are always fixated on the dollar.” Vietnam, Nigeria, Argentina, Lebanon and China all devalued in October; all of them but Lebanon rank in the top 20 for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis’ recently updated global crypto adoption index.

Since 2009 and especially post-2020, governments, not corporate or households, have driven most of the growth in global debt. Thus, we continue to believe that government (and thus FX) failures will mark this cycle, highlighting Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, supply-constrained reserve asset that can be used as both a stranded energy sink and a geopolitical negotiating tool by frontier states with unique domestic politics. We will be speaking on this topic at the “Adopting Bitcoin” conference in El Salvador later this month, with the aim of putting some specific probabilities on countries’ likelihood of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. (For those still making the argument that digital assets are a Ponzi scheme compared to military-backed Fiat, we note that long-term inflation-linked gilts are now down 79% from their peak, exceeding the peak-to-trough decline in the Bitcoin price. Fourteen major currencies have declined more than 20% vs. the dollar this year.)

Meanwhile, amidst the tailwinds of the weaker dollar in October, we noticed some meaningful examples of mainstream adoption of crypto payment rails in the month.

Smart Contract Platforms:

The MVIS Smart Contract Leaders index rose 4% this month, with most of the gains happening in the last week. Ethereum led the sector, up 14%, largely due to short covering, as noted with the liquidation data above. As for fundamentals, despite continued lackluster volumes on-chain (demand), ETH supply has grown only +0.16% since the September migration to proof-of-stake, with negative supply growth in October. This compares to Bitcoin supply +1.7% and a 3.6% ETH inflation rate under the old proof-of-work algorithm. Defi (30%), NFTs (23%), MEV applications (2%), and layer 2s (2%) comprise the largest sources of the ~56,000 ($~84M) ETH gas fees burned in October. Interestingly, since the September merge, an increasing proportion of Ethereum outstanding has either been locked in smart contracts (DeFi, +$3b since the merge) or staked to the Beacon chain (+$1.3B). Ethereum available for sale on exchanges, conversely, has fallen by more than 1%, or $2.5B. In aggregate, Ethereum captured more than 75% of total fees paid for all space on all open-source blockchains in October, and has gained market share since the merge.

Ethereum Supply

Among competing layer 1 protocols, October saw the launch of Aptos (APT-USD), the latest high-profile attempt to build a monolithic blockchain promising a better mix of speed & cost than Ethereum. Founded by Avery Ching and Mo Shaik, who worked on Meta’s Diem project. Aptos differentiates itself from competitors by using “parallel execution” and the Move language. Parallel execution allows for multiple, simultaneous transactions to execute at the same time, allowing—theoretically—for faster speed overall. However, there are some tradeoffs to this approach, notably seen in the performance of the similarly parallelized Solana blockchain, which has had several outages this year. One difference is that Aptos smart contracts are natively written in Move, a Rust-based language initially designed for the Diem project. Move prioritizes security and scalability and consistently ranks among developers’ favorite programming languages.

On the general topic of Layer 1 blockchains and whether the ‘fat protocol thesis’ is still intact: despite the poor price performance this year of most crypto assets, developers continue to release meaningful upgrades to the open-source code of layer 1 protocols. This developer activity, which can be tracked using public github repositories, has increased year-to-date for every smart contract leader aside from Solana. Indeed, the ratio of developers working on these smart contract leaders, relative to those working on open-source blockchain protocols overall, has recently reached an all-time high, as seen in the below chart. We see this as an indication of consolidation amidst the crypto winter.

Infrastructure Applications:

The MV Infrastructure Applications Leaders Index rose 10% in October, led by continued relative strength from Quant Network (+26%) and Polygon’s MATIC token (+15%).

Polygon launched its zkEVM (zero knowledge, Ethereum Virtual Machine) testnet on October 10th. ZkEVMs are a key part of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap that improve throughput by transferring computation and state storage off-chain. ZK rollups submit transaction data to Ethereum along with zero-knowledge proofs, which verify the validity of off-chain transaction batches. Early ZK-rollups lacked the ability to execute smart contracts and were constrained to simple token swaps and payments. But, with the introduction of EVM-compatible zero-knowledge virtual machines, ZK-rollups are starting to support Ethereum dApps. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet comes amidst heavy competition but few available token options. ZkSync, another contender in the zkEVM race, launched an updated version of their scaling solution that is EVM compatible, and has been promoted as the first-ever “product-ready” rollup with a zkEVM. However, public access will be limited until the end of the year, and there is no token yet.

Polygon also benefited from its partnership with Reddit, which introduced the second generation of its NFT avatars in October. Reddit whitelisted independent artists from within the Reddit community to create the avatars and paid a share of all primary and secondary sales to creators. The avatars can be used as profile pictures on the platform and give users access to new profile animations. Reddit’s first generation of avatars was released in July and took a few weeks to sell out. Their second collection launched on October 21st and all 40k avatars were sold on the first day. The ability to own an avatar in a password-protected “vault” rather than a crypto wallet and not marketing the avatars as NFTs are two factors that led to the success of the collections. At the TechCrunch disrupt conference, Reddit chief product officer Pali Bhat revealed that users created more than 3 million Polygon-based Reddit Vault wallets to store their NFTs. The combined market cap of Reddit Avatars now exceeds $100M.

DeFi:

The MV Decentralized Finance Leaders index rose 5.6% in October, with makerDao’s MKR (+17%) Uniswap’s UNI (+14%) and Aave (+16%) leading gains.

MakerDAO is the largest defi protocol by TVL ($8.15 billion) and issuer of the DAI stablecoin, which has a $6.2 billion market cap. In October, MakerDAO members voted in favor of an “endgame” proposal by founder Rune Christensen, who wants to make the protocol more decentralized and resistant to censorship, such as the Tornado Cash sanctions. While the voting process itself was criticized for a lack of decentralization, as Christensen influenced 63% of the votes backing his proposal, it appears likely that MakerDao will vote to split into a number of MetaDAO clusters, each with its own governance token. The “endgame” also proposes that MakerDao begin to buy staked Ethereum (stETH) in order to build a balance sheet that can serve as collateral for a non-dollar-backed algorithmic stablecoin in the future. Note that the Endgame is a long-term gambit; in the short-term, MakerDao delegates recently voted to move $500M worth of DAI tokens into short-term US treasuries and corporate bonds, custodied by Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum, which will issue the funds into a portfolio of BlackRock ETFs. MakerDAO also voted in October to custody $1.6B with of the DAO’s USDC coins with Coinbase in return for an annual 1.5% reward, another example of lines blurring between DeFi and real world assets.

In other DeFi news, Aave Companies, one of the contributors developing the Aave protocol, has released a technical paper on Aave’s upcoming GHO stablecoin, along with the results of its first security audit. GHO is a decentralized, over-collateralized stablecoin that was proposed in July. Aave plans to stabilize GHO via algorithm and on-chain governance, depending on the different “facilitators” minting GHO and on the collateral pledged by borrowers, to set an appropriate rate. Facilitators refer to protocols or entities whitelisted by AAVE governance to mint and burn GHO tokens. Since Aave will employ an overcollateralization strategy, it will rely on arbitrage and monetary policy to stabilize GHO. When GHO is below $1, borrowers will be incentivized to purchase GHO at a discounted price and repay/liquidate, profiting on the difference. Conversely, when GHO is above $1, users are incentivized to borrow GHO and sell it on the market, repaying their loan once GHO stabilizes and profiting from the difference. Because GHO is minted via borrowing on the protocol, GHO cannot be used as an asset on the supply (lending) side. Also, the borrow interest rate will not dynamically adjust by the usual supply and demand mechanics. Instead, Aave Governance will set the GHO interest rate, adjusting the borrow interest rate and the discount rate depending on the collateral pledged in order to expand or contract the GHO supply. GHO is designed to accrue interest when supplied to a liquidity protocol.

GHO will have a lot of ground to cover in order to gain market share over its established competitors like Dai. However, Aave’s position as the largest DeFi protocol could help accelerate the growth of GHO’s demand and turbocharge the security and decentralization of AAVE since stkAave holders can mint GHO at a reduced interest rate. GHO’s first facilitator, the Aave Protocol, will initially allow users to mint GHO using deposited assets on its lending market. This may limit the amount of GHO that can be minted due to overcollateralization requirements. But, once GHO has shown to be stable and having sufficient demand, minting could potentially be carried out using delta neutral positions, real-world assets (RWAs), or automated market operations (AMOs), whether by the Aave Protocol itself or by another facilitator. We look forward to talking with Aave founder Stani Kulechov at a VanEck event in London on November 9th.

Lastly, in DeFi, Mango Markets (MNGO), a decentralized finance platform hosted on the Solana blockchain, was exploited for over $100 million by DeFi trader Avraham Eisenberg, who called the attack “a highly profitable trading strategy.” The gambit was enabled by Eisenberg’s manipulating the price of the native MNGO token threefold higher on an illiquid venue and then taking out a $116M loan, leaving Mango’s treasury with a negative balance. Eisenberg later negotiated a settlement with Mango leadership, which enabled depositors to be made whole while Eisenberg kept $47M. The attack raises legal and ethical questions about whether market participants need to consider the intentions of the code-writers and not just the code itself. Blockchain analytics firm Peckshield estimated 44 exploits grabbed $760M in ‘stolen funds’ in October, a record, bringing the YTD total to $3B, double last year’s sum. In a poll on Twitter, podcaster Laura Shin asked, “Is code law?”: 44% of the respondents voted “hell yeah” vs. 56%, “hell no.” In the wake of the Mango Markets attack, Solana’s TVL dropped 23% to $997 million from $1.32 billion.

Metaverse:

October metaverse land sales reversed lower after a positive September. Aggregate land value fell 8% in October, with APE’s Otherside continuing to command the highest average sale price of 3.5 ETH, down from the 4.5 ETH it averaged at the start of the month. Decentraland and NFT Worlds were the only metaverses that saw increases in volume (11.6% and 4.8%, respectively) over the past 30 days. Recent news articles have highlighted the lack of users in Decentraland specifically, something the platform hopes to turn around in November with their Metaverse Music Festival from the 10th-13th. These platforms continue to explore product market fit with regard to curated experiences.

NFT trading volume across major blockchains was mixed this month, with only ImmutableX, Polygon, and Avalanche seeing increases in trading volume of 107%, 44%, and 30%, respectively. NFT trading on ImmutableX was mainly driven by their genesis game, Gods Unchained, which accounted for over 90% of the $21.4 million of volume. ImmutableX also announced mid-month that they would reward NFT traders up to 100k IMX tokens per day to incentivize activity on the network. The increase of NFT volume on Polygon was largely a result of the popularity of Reddit’s Collectible Avatar NFTs discussed above. Avalanche’s NFT trading growth was supported by OpenSea integrating Avalanche NFTs in its marketplace and the launch of an NFT farming game, Chikn Farm. Despite these developments, the NFT volume on Avalanche was still less than 1% of the total NFT volume over the last 30 days. Solana experienced the largest decline, with NFT trading volume falling by 39%.

Centralized Exchanges:

Centralized exchange tokens continue to perform well, up 6% in October, with low volatility thanks to FTX and BNB’s continued market share gains and attractive buy-back-and-burn tokenomics. In September, Coinbase spot trading volumes fell 18% to the lowest levels since January 2021, while competitors OKX, Binance, and FTX saw their spot volumes rise 24%, 8%, and 5%, respectively.

Meanwhile Huobi token (HT) paced sector gains +106% in October after HK-based About Capital announced plans to buy a majority stake in the 8th largest exchange globally. While the transaction of an undisclosed amount crowns About Capital as Huobi’s new controlling shareholder, the exchange stated that core operations and the existing management team would remain unchanged. Justin Sun, the Tron co-founder and reportedly a major investor in About Capital, also announced he would be joining Huobi’s global advisory board, prompting the Sun’s Tron (TRX) token to outperform most layer 1s in the month.

Japan should step up intelligence sharing and military exercises with the United States as part of efforts to boost deterrence and the response capabilities of the bilateral alliance against possible contingencies over Taiwan and North Korea, according to a former Biden Senate aid.

Frank Jannuzi, now president of the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation in Washington, also welcomed Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's call for a ""substantial increase"" in Japan's defense spending and his not ruling out the introduction of counterstrike capabilities.

Jannuzi made the remarks as senior U.S. military officers have said China could attempt to take control of Taiwan by 2027, or even this year or 2023. Speculation is also growing that North Korea may carry out a seventh nuclear test.

The fate of Taiwan has direct links to the security of Japan. Following a trip to Taipei by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August, the Chinese military held massive exercises around the self-ruled democratic island including the launch of ballistic missiles, five of which fell into Japan's exclusive economic zone in the East China Sea for the first time.

Cross-strait tensions have risen further since Chinese President Xi Jinping -- speaking at a twice-a-decade Communist Party congress last month, where he cemented his position as the country's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong -- said the mainland will never renounce the right to use force to bring Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province, under its control.

China has also been attempting to undermine Japan's administration of the Senkaku Islands, which it claims and calls Diaoyu, near Taiwan.

""Japan has close economic relations with Taiwan and I think it is pretty clear that the Japanese government believes an attack on Taiwan would constitute a grave threat to Japan's national security interests,"" Jannuzi said in an interview during a recent visit to Tokyo.

""Therefore it would be allowed under the Constitution for Japan to join international efforts to try to defend Taiwan,"" said Jannuzi, who for 12 years advised the current U.S. president, Joe Biden, on East Asian and Pacific affairs when Biden was a senator on the upper chamber's Foreign Relations Committee.

""This is a message that needs to be communicated more clearly to the Chinese.""

Jannuzi urged Japan to strengthen its intelligence-sharing system with the United States to the level Washington has with its Five Eyes partners so as to better assess what China, North Korea and Russia are doing in the region and reach a consensus about their strategic capabilities.

The Five Eyes intelligence alliance involves Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.

""In order for this to happen, Japan needs to do a better job on information security, cybersecurity, Earth observation and satellite capability so that it can achieve the level of integration with the U.S. intelligence community that is necessary to have a fully integrated analytic and intelligence-sharing operation,"" Jannuzi said.

""This is a high priority for the Biden-Kishida partnership,"" he said. ""I've spoken to senior U.S. government officials about this challenge, and I know that Japan is working on it.""

In addition to boosting capabilities such as air defense, ballistic missile defense and anti-submarine capability, Japan must demonstrate its readiness to respond to contingencies over Taiwan and North Korea by conducting more multilateral exercises with the United States, South Korea and other partners, according to Jannuzi.

Besides increased deterrence, he suggested Biden and Kishida promote diplomacy with Xi, saying the Nov. 15-16 summit of the Group of 20 major economies in Bali, Indonesia, will provide a good opportunity for interactions.

""The United States needs to have talks with China on Taiwan, North Korea, human rights and nuclear arms control, and it needs to happen directly at a senior level, and it's not happening enough,"" Jannuzi said. ""I think it's very important that Japan also have that kind of bilateral dialogue with China.""

Despite a spate of recent missile launches and signs of preparations for a test to miniaturize nuclear warheads by North Korea, Pyongyang's weapons development is low on the U.S. foreign policy list, he said.

Jannuzi added it will be difficult to halt North Korea's provocations without China taking serious economic action against its neighbor, something he calls unlikely.

""President Biden knows the best that we might negotiate would be some limitation on the North Korean nuclear program,"" he said, arguing the North's leader Kim Jong Un views holding on to nuclear weapons as vital for the survival of his regime, especially after seeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Mr. Biden also knows that such a limited amount of progress would require major concessions on sanctions,"" Jannuzi said. ""Such a deal could be negotiable, but he would be condemned for lifting sanctions in exchange for only partial denuclearization.""

""As a result of this, it's not a high-priority diplomatic effort because the return on the investment is too low,"" he said.

Innovation can be defined as novelty that creates value for customers and stakeholders. While more than 80% of executives surveyed by McKinsey in 2021 said that innovation was one of their three key priorities, only 10% are content with their team innovation efforts. If innovation is ubiquitous, why is it so difficult to achieve and sustain? This series of ""Innovation Blueprint"" articles will explore key elements of cultivating an innovation ecosystem, including measuring and scaling innovation for your organization. This article discusses 6 key elements of an innovation ecosystem.

What Is An Innovation Ecosystem?

An ecosystem in nature is a community of living organisms that interact and grow together. An ecosystem is comprised of three components: 1) the population of the ecosystem that has both driven the development of and is the result of the ecosystem; 2) the location and environment where the ecosystem exists; and 3) the interdependency, interaction, and symbiosis amongst the population members of the ecosystem. Similarly, an innovation ecosystem shares all of these characteristics as a network of innovators, startup companies, stakeholders, funders, and venture capitalists that interact together to drive ideas into products that add value in the marketplace.

In his research at Harvard Business School and Babson College, Professor Daniel Isenberg delineates a framework of the 6 key elements of an innovation ecosystem: people, markets, policy, culture, finance, and infrastructure support. Each element includes several characteristics or conditions that need to be present.

People

There are three key elements under the umbrella of people: 1) strong networks and platforms that foster networks to grow across government, industry, and academia; 2) innovators as well as skilled and unskilled workforce members; and 3) talent acquisition and development strategies and structures that include an innovation competency skills model to gauge the skills gap and related training and resource allocation needs.

Markets

Free-functioning markets, a broad customer base, and robust supply chains are fundamental to the development and growth of an innovation ecosystem. As startups take ideas and develop them into solutions for customers, they need to have immediate and direct access to marketplaces and customers.

Policy

Isenberg combines leadership and government under the policy umbrella largely because they are foundational to the ecosystem. Leadership and championing innovation unequivocally are foundational. Leaders who support innovation provide social legitimacy to the efforts of innovators and the broader ecosystem, help drive innovation strategy, and can also instill a sense of urgency to tackle crises and challenges. Similarly, government institutions have a crucial role to play by defining the regulatory framework, including tax benefits, funding research, instituting venture-friendly legislation around contracts, intellectual property rights, and labor and bankruptcy laws, among others.

Culture

Culture is so critical in an ecosystem because it is the glue that holds everything together. A culture that tolerates calculated risk-taking, embraces failure, and defines mistakes as learning opportunities is critical. An innovative culture fosters an innovation mindset and encourages creativity, experimentation, and questioning of the old ways of doing things. An innovative culture also encourages and exemplifies ambition, drive, and a hunger to succeed. A key component of culture is also the ability to story-tell and share success stories from the innovation ecosystem stakeholders. Because success breeds success, making successes visible across the ecosystem is critical, as is discussing failures and the resulting learnings.

Funding

Funding sources are crucial for innovation ecosystems and include micro-loans, angel investors, friends and family, zero-stage venture capital, venture capital funds, private equity, robust capital markets, and access to debt. Startups are inherently risky because they are focusing on addressing unmet customer needs with the development of new products and services that have not been market-tested. The increased risk and lack of data about the value of the new product in the market are two deterrents to accessing funding through regular channels like bank loans.

Venture capital is a type of private equity that examines startup teams and their ideas, evaluates current and future risk, and funds innovative ideas. There are six stages of venture capital:

Seed money, which is initial funding often provided by angel investors or crowdsourcing. Seed money is not always tied to Return On Investment. Startup funding pertains to the early stage that needs funding for product development and marketing expenses. First-round funding, or Series A (growth) funding, is given for manufacturing and the early sales stage. Second-round funding, or Series B funding, is working capital for companies that are selling products but not yet profitable. Expansion or Mezzanine funding is expansion money for a newly profitable company. Exit or bridge financing is the fourth round of funding, which finances the ""going public"" process of the company. Usually, the VC exits at this stage, having earned their Return On Investment.

Infrastructure And Support Entities

This element is equally crucial because it provides the equivalent of the soil for a planted seed that needs to grow. This element includes the infrastructure that facilitates innovation, such as telecommunications, internet access, cybersecurity, transportation, logistics, and supply chains. Additionally, it includes professional services such as legal, accounting, banking and financial services, and other technical expertise. Support entities include innovation cells, innovation hubs, accelerators such as Techstars and Y Combinator, business plan competitions, conferences that bring together innovators and investors, associations, and small business support groups that offer advice and guidance to startups and their teams.

Conclusion

As a leader, to foster an innovation ecosystem, you must first understand these elements and how they function, and then continuously foster connecting the dots across them by eliminating obstacles, facilitating connections, and driving an innovative culture. The people, the innovators who generate new ideas and work to turn them into value-adding products and services, are crucial elements in the innovation ecosystem. As a leader, you need to mentor, engage, and encourage the innovators during their long and often arduous journey of innovation.",cybersecurity,elearningindustry.com

National Guard to Activate Cybersecurity Teams to Help with Midterm Elections in 14 States

GATEWAY PUNDIT ^ | 11/5/2022 | JIM HOFT

Posted on by bitt

In preparation for upcoming Tuesday’s midterm election, the National Guard will be activating cybersecurity teams in 14 states to assist in keeping election authorities’ networks secure from cyber attacks and from any malicious activities, Politico reported.

“The move is part of a wider effort to ensure the midterms are secure from cybersecurity threats, which have loomed large in recent years since Russian interference operations in 2016,” the outlet added.

During a press conference on Friday, Washington Air National Guard Brig. Gen. Gent Welsh said, “One of the things making a lot of this possible are states that’ve just decided to do it.”

“Not everyone’s doing it, and those that are have invested in cyber talent and cyber missions for years. If you don’t have a cyber unit in your state you’re not in a good position to help them protect elections,” he added.

The 14 states with National Guard teams on duty on election day are North Carolina, Arizona, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, Washington, and West Virginia.

National Guard to Activate Cybersecurity Teams to Help with Midterm Elections in 14 States

GATEWAY PUNDIT ^ | 11/5/2022 | JIM HOFT

Posted on by bitt

In preparation for upcoming Tuesday’s midterm election, the National Guard will be activating cybersecurity teams in 14 states to assist in keeping election authorities’ networks secure from cyber attacks and from any malicious activities, Politico reported.

“The move is part of a wider effort to ensure the midterms are secure from cybersecurity threats, which have loomed large in recent years since Russian interference operations in 2016,” the outlet added.

During a press conference on Friday, Washington Air National Guard Brig. Gen. Gent Welsh said, “One of the things making a lot of this possible are states that’ve just decided to do it.”

“Not everyone’s doing it, and those that are have invested in cyber talent and cyber missions for years. If you don’t have a cyber unit in your state you’re not in a good position to help them protect elections,” he added.

The 14 states with National Guard teams on duty on election day are North Carolina, Arizona, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, Washington, and West Virginia.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.

And this week on Face the Nation: The midterm elections are just hours away, and candidates are spending the weekend barnstorming their states with some of the biggest names in politics.

Democrats argue democracy is on the line. Republicans say the party in power is wrecking the economy. It's a mad dash to get out the vote. And the stakes are high, as both parties vie for control of Congress for the next two years.

It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.

Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.

The most important and probably most competitive midterm election in years is now down to the wire. More than 39 million votes have already been cast. And across the country, candidates are out in full force, hoping to persuade the persuadable, turn out their true believers and, perhaps their most difficult challenge, explain to people why this election is so important and why they need to vote.

In their words, here is what it comes down to:

(Begin VT)

GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS (R-Florida): They came into office, and they created the worst inflation crisis that we have seen in four decades.

BARACK OBAMA (Former President of the United States): The Republicans like to talk about it, but what's their answer? What's their economic policy? They want to gut Social Security. They want to gut Medicare. They want to give rich folks and big corporations more tax cuts.

MEHMET OZ (R-Pennsylvania Senatorial Candidate): Young couples want to make that first investment for a starter home. They can't afford the interest rates. We have families all over the commonwealth worried about crime, so much so, they won't send their kids outside.

JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): Your right to choose is on the ballot.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Your right to vote is on the ballot. There's something else on the ballot: character. Character is on the ballot.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

HERSCHEL WALKER (R-Georgia Senatorial Candidate): But you heard him say the biggest threat to democracy is voting for the Republican. Are they serious? The biggest threat to democracy is having Joe Biden in the White House.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: The main event is Tuesday, control of the House, which has been shifting in Republicans' favor in these last weeks -- they need five seats to take over -- and control of this Senate, where just one turnover will put them on top.

We are tracking 10 key battleground races, five of which are hotly contested toss-ups.

Our Kris Van Cleave is in Arizona, our Nikole Killion is in Georgia, and our Robert Costa has been reporting in Pennsylvania.

And that's where we begin this morning.

(Begin VT)

PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It's a choice, a choice between two vastly different visions of America.

ROBERT COSTA (voice-over): It's a choice that's as competitive as ever. Right now, the Senate race between Republican Mehmet Oz and Democrat John Fetterman could not be closer. Three presidents barnstormed the state this weekend.

DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States): If you want to stop the destruction of our country and save the American dream, then, this Tuesday, you must vote Republican in a giant red wave.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

ROBERT COSTA: On the Road from the campus of Penn State to the suburbs of Philadelphia, voters told us that the economy is front and center.

Are you feeling economic pain in your life?

MAN #1: Yes. I'm a fixed income.

ROBERT COSTA: Fetterman, who is recovering from a stroke in May, says that voters who want to blame Democrats for inflation should think again.

LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JOHN FETTERMAN (D-Pennsylvania): What I would say to them is, is that you need a senator that is going to push back against corporate greed and the kind of price gouging as well too. I mean, like that -- this is my point.

ROBERT COSTA: Oz has courted frustrated voters. Last night, near Pittsburgh, he urged his supporters to win over neighbors by asking them if they're happy with the nation's direction.

MEHMET OZ: I want you to contact 10 people. Do it at church. Do it before the Steelers game. Just find the time.

ROBERT COSTA: But the Pittsburgh Steelers don't play this week, and the remark gives Oz's critics another chance to claim he is out of touch.

KRIS VAN CLEAVE: This is Kris Van Cleave in Arizona, where both the Senate and governor's races appear to be in dead heats.

Battling for his political life, Senator Mark Kelly rallied in Phoenix with first lady Jill Biden.

SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-Arizona): Women have lost a constitutional right, and that is taking us in the wrong direction.

KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Republican challenger Blake Masters has closed the gap by hammering Kelly on the economy, crime and the border.

BLAKE MASTERS (R-Arizona Senatorial Candidate): Mark Kelly, Joe Biden, they have opened up our Southern border. They have given our sovereignty over to the Mexican drug cartels.

KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Kari Lake is a rising star in the Republican Party and one of three election deniers at that top of the state's GOP ticket. Democrats have seized on that.

FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Democracy as we know it may not survive in Arizona.

KRIS VAN CLEAVE: That is quite a statement, that you are a threat to democracy.

KARI LAKE (R-Arizona Gubernatorial Candidate): I wonder what he'd call Hillary Clinton, because she's denied so many past elections. And she's already denying the next election in 2024.

KRIS VAN CLEAVE: But she's running for governor.

KARI LAKE: We have the right -- we have the right to question our government and our elections. It's called the First Amendment. And I intend to continue to use that right.

KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Her opponent, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs:

KATIE HOBBS (D-Arizona Gubernatorial Candidate): Kari Lake is focused on being as extreme as possible, whether it's the issue of abortion, whether it's the 2020 election.

KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Starkly different campaigns on a collision course over the future of Arizona.

NIKOLE KILLION: I'm Nikole Killion in Georgia.

MAN #2: From the great state of Georgia, Herschel Walker!

NIKOLE KILLION: It was a homecoming for Herschel Walker at the University of Georgia, where the former football star was game-ready.

HERSCHEL WALKER: Just like the Dawgs are going to win today, that's what's going to happen on Tuesday.

SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-Georgia): The way to have a voice in a democracy is to have a vote.

NIKOLE KILLION: Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and Walker are locked in a heated contest that could determine control of the U.S. Senate.

STACEY ABRAMS (D-Georgia Gubernatorial Candidate): I'm here to tell you, we have got the power, Georgia!

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

NIKOLE KILLION: In the governor's race, it's a rematch between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican incumbent Brian Kemp.

STACEY ABRAMS: Polls tell us that this is a tight race.

GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP (R-Georgia): We need a big turnout on Election Day.

(End VT)

NIKOLE KILLION: More than 2.5 million Georgians have already voted, a state record, but, here in Cobb County, elections officials say more than 1,000 absentee ballots were never mailed, calling it a critical error.

They blame overworked staff, but say that's no excuse, and they're working to contact impacted voters -- Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Nikole Killion, Kris Van Cleave, and Robert Costa, thanks to all of you.

We turn now to Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former mayor of Atlanta. She now serves as a senior adviser to President Biden, but the White House tells us that, this morning, she's appearing only in a personal capacity.

Good morning to you.

KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS (D-Former Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia): Good morning. Thank you for having me.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You said last month you were concerned about a lack of voter enthusiasm in Georgia, but the secretary of state says there is a historic level of turnout.

What does that signal to you now?

FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: Well, I'm glad that people are turning out to vote.

When I said that last month, I was sounding the alarm. And we have seen a record number of people turn out in the early vote, but we still have an election on Tuesday, and we cannot let up until this election is over.

I was on the ballot five years ago, seven points down going into Election Day, and I won by less than 800 votes. It doesn't matter what the polls say. People still have the ability to show up to vote on Tuesday and to make a difference in Georgia.

The thought of Herschel Walker going to the Senate is frightening.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That is the Republican candidate for the Senate.

Black voters helped turn Georgia blue back in 2020 and send two Democratic senators here to Washington.

How do you explain to Black voters now, who are so key in Georgia, that they should help support the party, given that, when Democrats held the majority for these past two years, top priorities like police reform and voting rights really haven't been addressed?

FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: Well, we have to remember that there has been a very thin margin, but there have been a number of issues that have been addressed that impact not just African-American voters, but voters across this country, student debt relief, $10,000, $20,000 if you are Pell Grant-eligible.

A vast majority of African-American students are Pell Grant-eligible. There's also been a reduction in prescription drug costs. Insulin will be capped at $35 a month, $2,000 a month annually.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Starting in January.

FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: Absolutely, starting in January.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And the loans are -- the student debt relief is caught up in the courts and you know a part of dispute.

FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: They are caught up in the courts because Republicans are pushing back against relief to American families across this country.

African-American voters are key in Georgia; 29 percent so far have shown up in the early vote. That means that there are a lot of people left out there, not just African-American voters, but voters across the state, who can still show up on Tuesday and make a difference in this election.

And that's what Democrats will need in Georgia for us to continue to send Raphael Warnock to the Senate and also to have Stacey Abrams elected as governor.

MARGARET BRENNAN: In our polling, we see consistently that it is the economy and inflation that are top of mind for voters.

The president said just a few days ago that he has passed so many good things, but people haven't realized how good they are yet.

Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin said, the truth is: Democrats have done a poor job of communicating our approach on the economy.""

DNC adviser Cedric Richmond, you know him well. He told CBS: ""The president's message of what he's been able to accomplish has not gotten out there.""

Hillary Clinton just said: ""The work done by Democrats is impressive, but we got to get that message across more effectively.""

If the policies are so good, why is communicating them such a problem?

FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: Well, it's been a very difficult couple of years.

We have been in the midst of a pandemic. There's been a lot of misinformation flooding the airwaves. We see it in waves, not just on television, but we're seeing it through YouTube. We're seeing it on other social media platforms. So, it is more difficult to get the message out.

But I'm sitting here today getting the message out. This administration, Democrats in Congress have delivered for the American people. And to turn back the clock and not allow us to keep pushing through will be devastating for people across America.

If we want prescription drug costs to remain low, then we need Democrats in Congress. If we want voting rights finally passed in Congress, we need Democrats in Congress. If we don't want a national ban on abortion and for doctors and health care providers to be sent to prison for offering an abortion to a woman whose life may be in danger, then we need Democrats in Congress.

And that's the message that we will continue to push out, not just through Election Day, but beyond, because we know that elections happen quite frequently, and we can't have people so discouraged that they think their votes don't matter.

MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said this week at a fund-raiser, if Democrats do lose in the midterms -- so, he's entertaining it is a real possibility -- he said: ""It'll be a horrible two years. The good news is, I will have a veto pen.""

Is complete gridlock what America needs to prepare for?

FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: Well, we know that President Biden ran on being able to work across the aisle.

So, of course, the American people want us to be able to get things done. But when you have Republicans say that they will pull back aid to Ukraine, that their -- their entire platform is based on doing what Joe Biden doesn't want done, that's not what the American people want.

We want progress in this country. And we want leaders who believe in democracy. We don't want leaders who deny elections. I heard Kari Lake say that people have a right to question their government. They absolutely do, but they don't have a right to overthrow their government, in the way that we saw that on January 6.

So, when you have election deniers who have the -- who may go to Congress, who may be elected to statewide office -- we have one in Georgia, Burt Jones, who's running for lieutenant governor, an election denier -- that's -- that's not just a danger to Democrats. That's a danger to everyone who believes in what this country stands for.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Keisha Lance Bottoms, thank you for joining us this morning.

And we go now to Newfields, New Hampshire, and that state's Republican governor, Chris Sununu, who is up for reelection on Tuesday.

Welcome back to the broadcast.

Governor, our public polling that we're looking at indicates that you're likely to keep the governor's seat after Tuesday. Back in 2021, you canceled your own inauguration due to security threats.

You've personally experienced the threat of political violence. I'm wondering, how concerned are you in this moment now? And will you hold an inauguration if you win again?

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU (R-New Hampshire): Yeah, so a couple of things here.

Obviously, with -- with Speaker Pelosi and what happened recently, I think that is kind of re-looking at -- everyone's kind of looking at what this political violence is. It's on both sides. It's everywhere. The heat is too high all across America. Good leadership brings that down.

I will be holding my inauguration, fully plan to do so. But, again, we have got to, as leaders, bring the temperature down. It's OK to disagree, but, at the end of the day, you got to be able to move forward. And we fully plan to do that here in New Hampshire.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I want to come back to that topic in a moment, but, first, inflation. It's top of mind.

New England is facing its highest energy costs in more than 25 years. Could be a cold winter. Your largest utility in the region is asking the White House to prepare emergency measures to prevent a natural gas shortage this winter. What -- what's the federal response been so far? And are you, at the state level, prepared for what could be a safety threat?

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Yeah, I will say the federal response so far has -- has been very underwhelming.

All the governors got on the phone recently, about a month ago, with the secretary of energy and tried to talk about what those opportunities were in terms of increasing natural gas. New England is really at the end of the line for natural gas, right? All of our natural gas comes through Albany.

And, in previous years, if there was a high demand or a big cold snap, folks come home, they turn their heat on, the Marcellus Shale would increase production. But no one's incentivized to do that. There's no -- no opportunity to do that right now.

And I think that's where a lot of the utilities, and rightly so, are telling this administration, you've put policies in place. It's having a very drastic effect on energy and fuel oil prices today, and likely is just going to get worse. So we need to see something across New England.

There's nothing political about energy prices, right? But when you have all the ability in the world to produce your own fuels and refuse to do it, obviously, folks in New England are quite frustrated.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's record production right now, as you know. But this is a very real problem.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Yes.

And, because of the Jones Act, because -- and because of the Jones Act, that is this antiquated 100-year-old union-driven policy that President Biden refuses to get rid of, we have very minimal opportunity to bring natural gas from even parts of our own country and land it right here in -- in New England.

So it's not just New Hampshire. It's Massachusetts. It's Maine. It's all of these states that are that are -- that are feeling record high prices because, again, we've shut down natural gas plants. We've disincentivized fossil fuels. It's -- look, we all want to transition into renewables. And, of course, that's a very smart thing to do, but it must be a transition.

This administration went all or nothing. So that's why you see your -- it takes -- costs twice as much to fill your gas tank, your fuel oil, your energy prices. And, in New England, when it gets cold, it's going to be -- there's going to be some real pain for all of us.

And, again, we're just asking the administration to reverse some of these policies, in -- incentivize more production and more natural gas through Albany, New York, to get us what we need.

MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden, in one of his closing arguments, is framing a selection is protecting democracy against extreme Republicans. Listen.

(Begin VT)

PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: The extreme MAGA element of the Republican Party, which is a minority of that party, as I said earlier, But it's its driving force, is trying to succeed where they failed in 2020, to suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree that parts of your party are emboldening violence and posing a threat to democracy?

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Look, what is shocking to me about all of this is, you have the Democrat Party, which is now using the president of the United States, not as leader of our country, but leader of their party, as a political tool, right before the election, to drive and effectively tell half of America that they're too extreme for America.

It makes absolutely no sense. And to say...

MARGARET BRENNAN: You think the MAGA element of the Republican Party is half of America? Because I wouldn't necessarily put you in that half.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: No, well, definitely not.

But again, to say that that extremism belongs in one party, and it doesn't appear in the Democrat Party is -- is nonsensical. Nobody buys that...

MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying the party is all one now...

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: ... because we see it on both sides.

MARGARET BRENNAN: ... unified, that extreme MAGA is part of the Republican Party's ideology?

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: No, no, absolutely not.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Absolutely not, no.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But it seemed like that's what you were implying.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: It's an absolute minority.

But what I'm saying is, extreme -- no, no, no, no, definitely not. Extremism is on both sides. And for the president of the United States to come up and be more of a political tool, as opposed to a uniter -- remember, he got elected because he said he was going to unite folks, not threaten them.

He was going to bring everybody together and get stuff done and not polarize this country, which is exactly what has happened.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: If that was not the reality, then Democrats wouldn't be in for the rude awakening they're going to come -- that's going to come Tuesday.

But it is coming, and not because of politics. Because of what is happening in people's homes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: What's happening at their kitchen tables, what's happening with trying to balance a checkbook.

And the president has to take a lot of responsibility for that. It's easy to blame ex -- just blame extremism.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well...

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: But most of us are not extreme.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

Well, President -- former President Donald Trump is expected to announce his candidacy for the presidency. CBS is reporting that. That could be within a matter of days.

What does that do to your party? Does anyone have a chance of actually beating him in a Republican primary?

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: What does it do to our party? Nothing. Nothing. It'll have no effect on anything. And I mean that quite sincerely.

First off, announcing you're going to run for office between an election and Christmas is a terrible idea, because one thing I can say for America is, we're all going to be really happy, one way or the other, that the election is over come Tuesday, and everyone's going to want to take a breath and reengage with their families and deal with some really serious issues.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well...

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: And then politics really gets back into the mix of things in early '23.

Whether the -- President Trump decides to run or not, it's not going to make any difference in terms of the fact that you're still going to see eight to maybe even a dozen other candidates jump in the race.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: He doesn't keep anybody out of the race, right?

So it's still going to be, I think, on both sides. I think -- I don't think President Biden is going to run again. I think on both sides of the aisle, you are going to have maybe a dozen individuals over the next six to nine months come out and decide to run.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

Well, and your name's floated as one of them, potentially. I know you're not going to give me an answer to that question right now. But you did turn down the invitation to run for Senate.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Yeah.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has voiced some concern about candidate quality in this midterm election.

You told ""The Washington Examiner"" that the Republican majority would just obstruct President Biden until 2024. You didn't want to be a roadblock for two years.

You're setting pretty low expectations for what a Republican majority would actually mean. Is that what we should expect, just nothing for two years, total gridlock?

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: No, I -- look, I think -- well, I think both sides both sides of the aisle -- both sides of the aisle in Washington have set a horribly low expectation for Washington.

I mean, think about it. They pass -- one way or another, they pass a bill, Republicans or Democrats or both, and we cheer it. It's supposed to be this great, great success because they got something done?

It is just an absolute gridlock mess there on both sides of the aisle. So, as a governor, I can have so much more impact on what is happening on the ground level, redesigning systems, implementing better mental health services, implementing better opioid services, whatever it might be.

And this is New Hampshire.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: And if you spent -- anyone who spends more than 10 minutes in New Hampshire knows now not an easy place to leave.

So I just want to get stuff done. If I'm going to put my family through the difficulties of public service and all that comes with it, I'm sure as heck going to get something done. And you can do that far more effectively as a governor than you can as a senator or congressman.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Now, leadership can change that. Leadership in Washington can absolutely change that on both sides of the aisle.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: And I think that's what America is looking for.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, I'm -- sounds like we'll be talking to you again.

Governor, thank you for your time today.

We're joined now by Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. He's a CBS News expert and analyst.

Good morning to you, Chris. Good to have you back.

How do you react to this idea of President Biden characterizing the MAGA element of the party as an extreme threat to democracy?

CHRISTOPHER KREBS: The area that I'm most focused on right now is the undermining of the legitimacy of American elections.

And Governor Sununu mentioned leaders need to stand up and -- and speak truth to power, and -- and particularly the elements of the GOP that continue to repeat countlessly debunked claims.

I mean, we even have the GOP candidate for governor, Kari Lake, in Arizona just the other day making a joke about there's no way that President Biden got 81 million votes. In fact, he got more than 81 million votes.

But the point here is that we do need leaders like Governor Sununu to stand up and say that this is not acceptable behavior in American democracy, and that we need the -- those that continue to push these narratives for clout, for political influence, for -- for money, for fund-raising, that they need to let it go, and we need to move on, if this American experiment is going to continue.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we're going to continue this on the other side of that, but, just to your point, there are 308 Republican candidates who have raised doubts about the integrity and validity of the last election.

They're standing for office now. There's a reason they are using that as a political message. We're going to talk about that in a moment.

So, stay with us on Face the Nation.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.

We return to our conversation now about election security with CBS News cyber security expert and analyst Chris Krebs.

Chris, I want to talk about something that's happening right now. Social media has already changed the way we communicate, and certainly our political world. President Biden said a few days ago that he has concerns about billionaire Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter. He said the platform spews lies all across the world. There's no editors anymore in America. There are no editors. How do we expect kids to be able to understand what is at stake.

It's not just kids, right? What concerns do you have about this happening just days before the election, these changes to Twitter?

CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, I think - I think the government, for one, has a mechanism by which they can review the acquisition. The Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States can take a look at particularly the second and third ownership positions in Twitter, including Saudi Arabia. That is something that I'm assuming that the Treasury Department is taking a look at right now, see if they can put in place a national security agreement or even potentially unwind the purchase.

But I think more specifically to what's happening right now with Twitter, I think there are kind of -- there are two Elons that we're seeing. There's the public Elon that's, you know, trolling and saying $8, please, on all the complaints about some of the shifts in the moderation and other activities. Then there's what's happening behind the scenes, the conversations with the civil rights groups, with advertisers, with the teams, which, perhaps, may be a little bit more stable.

And I think if you look at the platform itself right now, not a whole lot has changed. That may not be a popular opinion, but I think the reality is that most you haven't seen too much of a change in the moderation.

Now, the concern, though -

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Is what happens tomorrow where you can buy the blue check for $8 a month. The Twitter Blue.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And just for our viewers who don't use Twitter.

CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: A blue check is a sign of credibility.

CHRISTOPHER KREBS: It has historically been a marker of trust in that Twitter has said, we have confirmed and authenticated the identity of this person, which tends to be a politician or a news media personality or a journalist, an academic or someone that may be a popular voice in certain civil rights, civil liberties issues.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Now you can buy it for $8 a month.

CHRISTOPHER KREBS: And along with a number of other features of editing and longer form video posting. But, again, to have such a dramatic shift in that marker of trust, now you can buy it, in advance of, as we've been talking about, a very contentious and important election, it opens the information space to a broader community of influencers, clout chasers, election denialists and - and is --

MARGARET BRENNAN: Foreign actors?

CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Absolutely. I mean we've seen reports lately of Russia, China and Iran back at their old tricks. And it is going to create a very chaotic environment.

MARGARET BRENNAN: To that point, in 2018, during the midterms, cyber command took offensive operations to take out Russian trolls who were spreading misinformation. ""The New York Times"" has a story today saying, Russia's back at it. What does that say to you about U.S. defenses?

CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, I think - so, recorded future and graphic of two research firms have released information that Russian bots, trolls associated with the internet research agency, which is a group that targeted the 2016 and the 2018 election, are back at it and are undermining this time Democratic candidates for Senate in some of the - the - the more contentious races.

I think what it says is that the - that there's a broader community of actors. They recognize that political discourse is very divisive here in the U.S. and they have more opportunities probably than ever before to continue to undermine confidence, to create chaos, which is really their primary objective here is not necessarily that a winner wins, but that we've all lost confidence and they degrade the American, you know, democracy experiment.

MARGARET BRENNAN: There are also a number of sitting senators, and, of note, Ambassador Richard Grenell of -- former President Trump's acting director of national intelligence, has been posting some misleading information -- that's him on the screen -- about the election. He said any state which doesn't count all the votes and announce the winner Tuesday night is incompetent.

Now, votes -

CHRISTOPHER KREBS: So, all 50 states then by that formulation.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because what you're saying is just the fact that votes are never finalized on election night. But why do you think someone who knows better is posting something like that?

CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, whether he knows better, I can't assume that. But the point here is that it's for clout-chasing. It's for influence. There is a reward system and structure set up right now within the far right of the GOP that provides additional engagement. So, you tweet something like that and you can see your likes, your retweets, your amplification really take off. And if you're just talking about some other, you know, more mundane domestic issue, nobody cares. But there's a reward system and incentive structure that's set up where exactly this sort of messaging is - is rewarded. It's encouraged.

And - and this is, again, going back to Governor Sununu's comments. We need leaders to lead. We need the presumptive leaders of the Republican Party to stand up and say, this is unacceptable. This is not how it works. We need to be good-faith actors in this process and, unfortunately, leaders aren't leading right now.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris Krebs, thank you, as always for your analysis.

And we will see you on election night as part of CBS coverage at our democracy desk here at CBS News.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: This year CBS News has been tracking four groups of election influencers who could prove decisive in this year's midterm campaign. One group, Pressured Parents. They say they're anxious about the post-Covid era, particularly when it comes to their finances and their children's well-being.

For a closer look at some of the concerns facing this group, we're joined now by Laura Meckler, national education writer at ""The Washington Post,"" Scott Gottlieb, as you know him, the former commissioner of the FDA and a board member at Pfizer, and Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University, and she joins us from Providence, Rhode Island.

Good morning to you all.

Emily, I want to start with you. You wrote an article about pandemic amnesty. You said, basically, we need to forgive public officials for what they didn't know during the worst of the pandemic. You had argued early on for opening of schools when the pandemic was still raging. What do you think we need to be focused on now? Because some of the debate still seems to be stuck two years ago.

EMILY OSTER, (Economist, Brown University): Yes, so I'm an economist, but I'm also a parent. And I talk to a lot of parents. And what I can say is right now parents are very worried about the next steps for their kids. They see the historic test score declines. They see the declines in routine vaccination rates for kids. And they want us to be looking to solutions. They don't want to be looking to rehash the debates that we had two years ago. They want to know, what investments are we going to make as a policy group to fix the problems that they're seeing for their kids.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, amen to talking about solutions, but we aren't, Laura, talking much about them as a country. To those scores that we just heard mentioned, the Education Department reported appalling historic declines. Twenty-five percent of fourth graders are below the basic level in math, 37 percent were below the basic level in reading. How much of it is linked to the pandemic closures? How much of it is linked to a broader problem? And why aren't we hearing more about it?

LAURA MECKLER, (National Education Writer, ""The Washington Post""): Well, we're talking -- some of us are talking a lot about it. I think that it is really important. We have seen historic declines in -- particularly in math, but also in reading. And it is certainly linked to the pandemic. Some of it is linked to the schools that were remote for an extended period of time. But even schools that were not remote, also we've seen -- I mean that were not remote for very long, I should say -

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

LAURA MECKLER: Have also seen significant declines in academic achievement. So - and I think that compared with the sort of social, emotional mental health real crisis that we're seeing among children and teenagers right now is really putting enormous amount of pressure on schools and on families.

MARGARET BRENNAN: To your point, because we looked at it, New Hampshire, which opened earlier, Georgia, Florida, where schools reopened faster, they may have fared better but they still saw declines.

LAURA MECKLER: Exactly.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there's still something happening.

LAURA MECKLER: Exactly. And I think that what most experts will tell you is that, you know, the pandemic was still happening. Even if kids were back in school. First of all, there were closures. There were quarantines. People were in and out of school.

But beyond that, you know, people were experiencing loss. They were seeing stress all around them. They didn't have their normal lives. So, I think that, you know, the pandemic had a deep effect on families and on children and on schools. And I think those are going to be continuing for really many years to come.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know I don't like it when people say the pandemic's over because I still feel like I'm living through this haze, Dr. Gottlieb. School closures are still a live issue. I mean we've seen upticks in RSV, in flu and other viruses and some schools have closed. In Indiana we just saw one. Virginia. Should communities just take this out of the tool kit and keep schools open no matter what?

SCOTT GOTTLIEB, (Former FDA Commissioner): Well, look, we have a major epidemic of RSV. It may be peaking right now. We're going to enter into a major epidemic of flu. And we haven't been taking the actions that we would normally be taking to try to mitigate these kinds of pandemics because. I think a lot of public health officials and I think a lot of school districts are a little bit gun shy right now given the backlash to what we did during the pandemic.

Closing a school for one incubation cycle for two or three days when you had a major outbreak of flu or RSV in the past was not that uncommon. If you had 40 percent, 50 percent of the kids out of school, you might close for a day or two. Now when a school does in Indiana, it's national news.

We know hand hygiene, for example, is very effective at stopping flu transmission. Do you hear any school district talking about hand hygiene right now? We know wearing a mask if you have the flu or RSV when you go out is effective at preventing forward transmission. Nobody wants to say that. So, I think that there's a lot of reluctance now, in part because of the failures of public health messaging during the pandemic and the things we got wrong and the backlash to it. So we don't have a good solution for what we're entering right now.

MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of - of Emily's premise here, that there needs to be amnesty?

SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think we need to distinguish - and she was at the vanguard, to your point, at arguing for schools to opened. A lot of kids got back in the classroom because of her efforts. So she's - she's advocating on behalf of others when she talks about amnesty.

I think we need to distinguish between structural failures of institutions and mistakes that were made because we were in the fog of viral war and we didn't understand the - the virus itself. There were institutions that failed. CDC. There were a lot of systemic failures there. Even people talk about the teachers union not working to get people back in the classroom.

And then there were things we got wrong. We didn't recognize the virus was airborne. We thought it was droplet transmission, so we advocated the use of cloth masks when they weren't effective. So, there were things we did wrong because we didn't understand the virus. We need to learn from that.

But I think the - the structural features that we got wrong, where institutions failed, that we can't move on from because we need to reform those institutions.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Emily, parental rights has been harnessed effectively by Republicans in certain places on the campaign trail. But our CBS News polling shows this is broad concern, to your point.

Seventy-two percent of those polled say they're concerned about learning declines after Covid. Seventy-two percent said they're worried about bullying at their kids' school. Sixty-eight percent said they're worried about gun violence. Fifty-seven percent said discussions of sexuality and gender concern them.

There's so much concern about the classroom. What -- where does the focus need to be and where does it need to come from here?

EMILY OSTER: I think that the focus needs to be on what we need to do to move forward for solutions, and, you know, and -- to give you a concrete example, when we look at something like test scores, which many parents are very worried about, we see that over the last school year there's been some test score recovery, but that's uneven. Some school districts have recovered to where they were in 2019. Some school districts haven't recovered at all.

At this point, if we want to speak to these concerns of parents, we need to think about, what are the investments we're making to figure out, why have some school districts been successful, what did they do that was successful? How can we comport those lessons over to districts that haven't been successful? This kind of solutions-based focus has to be where we go rather than rehashing the discussions we had two years ago. That's how we're going to find solutions and get kids back on track because it's, frankly, exactly as you say, kids are really suffering and we're losing time on getting them back.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Laura, the focus that we are hearing about the classrooms is on like the content of what's being taught in them. And we saw that in that 57 percent discussion of sexuality and gender. Is that just because it's easier to access or understand or - you -- why?

LAURA MECKLER: I think that the sort of culture wars that are -- have gripped schools in the last couple of years are now coming to the question of gender and sexuality. For a long time we saw them centered on issues of race. Like, so-called critical race theory and there was conversation -- discomfort among conservatives of conversations - of talking about systemic racism, for instance. And - and that has kind of given way now to concerns around gender identity, and transgender, transgender women competing in sports. All of those things, I think, are - are concerns among many conservatives and there are a lot of candidates for office and political figures who are playing on that and talking a lot about that.

And I think when they talk about parental rights, that's what they're talking about. They don't want - they - they will assert things like, you know, schools are trying to turn boys into girls and girls into boys.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

LAURA MECKLER: I don't think that that's true. But that's the kind of fears that -- because I think there's still a lot of discomfort with the idea of questions around gender identity and there are people really working to tap into that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I mean what Emily has argued is like, we need data on how to make up for educational deficits.

LAURA MECKLER: Well, this has nothing to do with that. I mean --

MARGARET BRENNAN: That - that's (INAUDIBLE) on a bumper sticker?

LAURA MECKLER: Yes. I mean, right. Exactly. I mean, yes, that is the core problem facing education today, right now. Actual academics. Can kids do math? Can kids read at the levels they need to? Those are skills you're going to need on into your education and into life. These other things are just much more emotional and tapping into sort of these culture war conversations that we're having in this country.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Gottlieb, I mean when you look at parents, it's like a formula shortage, completely incoherent messaging from the CDC that you just laid out here, child care shortages in part due to what's going on with infection rates. It is hard not to have anger and emotion about public health and how it's communicated.

SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, I think that there's a pervasive sense, rightly so, that public health institutions have failed the public and that they weren't equipped to tackle the challenges that people have been facing. We shouldn't have had this shortage that we had with the formula. We should have responded to it more adequately than we did. CDC didn't put out practical guidance, didn't advise families on what to do. They required them for six feet of distancing is what kept most schools shut well into the spring of 2021. So, there's a pervasive sense that public health institutions didn't work on behalf of families. They were slow to integrate new information. And there's not a - there's not real evidence that they've reformed themselves. There hasn't been an effort by the administration to try to, you know, try to reform - fundamentally reform CDC. CDC s working to reform itself, but that's not usually the way it works. It's hard to self-organize around a new mission if you're an agency.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

SCOTT GOTTLIEB: So, I think if the administration had been more aggressive at addressing these deficits, they'd probably -- people wouldn't feel so much angst.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Or you need to hear that from perhaps the new Congress, the pressure to reform.

Emily, you also raise, in your article, the question of mandates for vaccines. Are you arguing for flu and Covid vaccine mandates, because that's very controversial?

EMILY OSTER: In the article I discuss routine vaccinations, measles pertussis, where we don't typically have mandates, but the rates have been very high. They have gone down over time. We haven't seen schools move to Covid vaccine mandates, and I don't expect them to.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

EMILY OSTER: And, similarly, we haven't seen flu mandates, and I don't expect to see those either.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And I know Dr. Gottlieb also is against mandates of - of flu.

SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I don't think this vaccine reaches the threshold of being mandated in schools.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

All right. Thanks for all of you. We could do a whole hour or more on all the parental tensions right now, but we've got to leave it there.

We'll be back in a moment with more on how the fight over abortion rights is impacting the midterms.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by our chief legal correspondent, Jan Crawford, and our political correspondent, Caitlin Huey-Burns.

Good to have you both here at the table.

Caitlin, I want to start with you.

You've been covering abortion access in states around the country. And that's where the decision about access will be made, at the state level.

There are five states where abortion access is literally on the ballot November the 8th. What's the expectation on whether this election will make access looser or tighter?

CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Yes, and in three of those states, California, Vermont, Michigan, the question is whether to amend the Constitution to enshrine abortion rights into law. And then the other two states there is either a ban or attempts to criminalize it.

But the biggest one I'm watching is in Michigan, that ballot measure, because there's such a competitive governor's race there with Gretchen Whitmer, the incumbent, the Democrat, very much campaigning on this issue of abortion access and rights, trying to galvanize her base of support and reach out to those independent suburban women in particular. And it's interesting because Tudor Dixon, who's the Republican running against her, is trying to say to voters, look, you can vote for this measure and also vote against Gretchen Whitmer and vote for me.

The biggest question that we've been having this election cycle, when it comes to ballot measures is, you know, does this actually translate to support for the Democratic candidate?

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: I was in Kansas covering that ballot measure where we saw overwhelming turnout, where we even saw Republicans vote for it. But that was a direct question to voters. And so when it's on the ballot with candidates, does that have the same effect? And I think Michigan will be an interesting test of that.

We're also looking at states like Wisconsin and North Carolina, that don't have ballot measures, but the makeup of the state legislatures and other competitive races there could shape how this comes out because that's really where this is being decided, it's at the state legislative level.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is what the court intended.

JAN CRAWFORD: Sure. I mean it said that, you know, this is not a federal constitutional issue. This is an issue the state should decide. And leave it to the political process. And that's what we're seeing.

I think what's interesting, though, is, you know, some of the - the - the debate and the outcry among Democrats back in July has kind of receded a bit. I think once people realize the Supreme Court hadn't banned abortion when it overturned Roe versus Wade and that many state laws weren't really changing at all has kind of taken a backseat to issues like crime, inflation, the economy. But it does still have an impact.

And then, on the flip side, I think it's important to remember for Republicans what that decision has done. Had the court refused to overturn Roe versus Wade, it would have really demoralized a key segment of the Republican base. Those voters who care deeply about social issues. The pro- lifers, the evangelicals, people who care about religious liberty. Instead, in order turning Roe, they're galvanized. Those voters are excited, enthusiastic about voting. And -- and that's an important segment for Republicans.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You're also seeing, at the national level, where there isn't a law protecting abortion. The conversation from President Biden is, if Democrats win, I will enshrine abortion access, specifically at that 24- week -- the language that was in Roe.

But then you have Senator Lindsey Graham trying to start the conversation and say it's got to be up until 15 weeks. Is the bottom line that we will just not see any national law, period, that it will stay at the states?

CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Well, what we're seeing is both sides are using it to galvanize their supporters, right? Democrats are threatening that Republicans get control and then there will be a ban. And Lindsey Graham handed them kind of a gift in saying, look, I would like to implement national restrictions.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Restrictions but not a ban?

CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: But not an outright ban at 15 weeks. But I think, you know, and you talk to Republicans and they don't want to say at this point, yes, I'm supportive of a national ban, because they don't want to turn voters away. That they need to attract here. And it also kind of flies in the face of their argument that this should be a state's issue. But there - there is no question that this is a base amplifying issue and -- and Democrats need it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, I want to ask you about a case that is also getting politicized potentially here. Moore versus Harper. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about it to a progressive group and said it's about right-wing extremists having a plan to literally steal the next presidential election. That's a big statement. What is this case about and what's the outcome?

JAN CRAWFORD: Well, she's talking about a case that the court's going to hear arguments on next month. And it involves this kind of -- called the independent state legislator theory. And to opponents, that's a radical theory that would really strip state courts from having any oversight into the election laws and procedures that are adopted by state legislatures for federal elections.

Now, supporters of this new theory say, well, the federal constitution gives that power to the state legislatures, not to the state courts. And if you've got a problem, take it to federal court and they can deal with it.

The question I think is not so much would it directly address things like seating presidential electors. The concern for opponents of this theory, and it is a serious concern that they have, is that if the court adopts this theory, then that sends a message, Katie bar the door, state legislatures can do anything they want. And that, they believe, is dangerous in terms of what they may try to do in some of these election laws and procedures.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, ladies, for tracking that for us.

We'll be back in a moment.

Enterprise technology so far has been a relative bright spot within the sector. That may continue, but with a growing emphasis on companies and services that are considered crucial to running a business and can be monetized right away.

The business case for adopting cloud computing and automation is fundamentally sound, said Sunil Kanchi, who serves as chief information officer and chief investment officer of UST, a privately held company in Aliso Viejo, Calif., that assists clients with digital transformation. UST operates internationally and has more than 30,000 employees.

“The changes that we will see going forward will be based purely on the economic drivers from the overall economy slowing down,"" Mr. Kanchi said.

He expects customers to continue to invest in areas such as automation and so-called low code-no code software platforms that reduce the need for human programmers, who are in short supply.

The metaverse, NFTs, and some aspects of cryptocurrency, or those technologies which don’t have immediate monetary value, will continue to fall out of favor, Mr. Kanchi said.

“The job cuts are only the start and the tip of the spear. Larger and more thoughtful companies are starting to understand that capital is fleeing investment in the stock market into ‘safer’ assets like bonds or treasuries as interest rates rise,"" said Wesley Chan, an investor and former tech leader at Google who developed early Google projects including Google Analytics, Google Voice and Google Ventures. He is a co-founder of early stage investor FPV Ventures.

“The downturn has kind of started but it hasn’t hit bottom and will get bad, very quickly, likely sometime mid next year,"" Mr. Chan said. He expects a decline in demand for marginal or luxury areas like crypto, grocery and food delivery services, “neobanks,"" and high-end travel and beauty.

Demand for business-critical services that feel like utilities, will fare better. The outlook for drug discovery and life sciences, cybersecurity, and companies that help customers address costly inefficiencies or unlock inventory in the manner of Uber Technologies Inc. or Airbnb Inc. also is promising, according to Mr. Chan. He predicts that “the new Google or Uber of 2023 and 2024 will come out of this downturn.""",cybersecurity,livemint

Now, I would like to turn the call to our Chairman and CEO, Jamie Lerner. Jamie?

Jamie Lerner

Thank you, Brian and thank you all for joining us today. Earlier this afternoon, we announced results for our second quarter of fiscal 2023, with revenue just above the high end of guidance, driven by a record quarter in our hyperscale business as well as sequential improvement in our EBITDA results. The supply chain situation continues to improve, both in terms of tape drive supply and overall availability of materials at more standard pricing and lead times. Our access to tape drives from our largest supplier has shown greater predictability and consistency and we are expecting this incremental improvement in supply to continue in the coming quarters.

We are also spending less money on broker fees and expediting fees as a result of our previously implemented initiatives. During the quarter, we also executed additional cost containment measures that lowered our operating expenses to our target quarterly run rate of $35 million which will support driving increased EBITDA as we continue to grow the top line. In addition to our strong revenue, bookings doubled sequentially and contributed to record backlog of $96 million at quarter end. This record backlog was not driven by supply constraints but rather large hyperscale orders for future quarters.

Our in-quarter backlog has stabilized as our access to increased supply is allowing us to catch up on shippable backlog which Mike will discuss in more detail. Overall, our robust backlog gives us greater visibility and demonstrates the commitment from our large cloud partners to this business.

Also in fiscal Q2, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of subscription revenue growth with subscription customers increasing to 554 from 455 last quarter. Delivering our data management solutions as a software subscription is an increasingly important part of how Quantum does business going forward. Our customers are asking for this type of purchasing model, yet they still value running our software on Quantum appliances in order to rely on a single vendor for support. We will continue to drive growth in ARR by driving increases in primary storage and non-hyperscale secondary storage software and systems and introducing new products based on subscription software licensing such as StorNext running on the AWS cloud which was launched in early September.

While our near-term goal continues to be doubling of subscription software ARR to the $14 million to $15 million level, we now have a clearer picture of the time required to identify and close on these engagements. Therefore, our achievement of this initial milestone is increasingly likely to take place in early fiscal 2024. Although we have made progress on several of our stated initiatives, there is still more work to be done. During the first half of the year, we talked about expanding the earnings power of Quantum through a combination of pricing and discounting discipline, tighter management of the supply chain and operational expense reduction.

As evidenced by my initial comments, we are beginning to see the evidence of these actions in our results. The other lever of utmost importance is expanding our gross margin which is tied very closely to our revenue mix. This applies not only to end market verticals but also from a geographic perspective. As many of you know, we get our best margins in North America as well as from our U.S. federal business. Both of these areas have been relatively weak over the past several quarters. Within the federal business, we've seen some large deals being pushed out and our non-hyperscaler business in the Americas has been impacted during the process of realignment of our sales team and appointment of new leadership.

At the same time, our hyperscale business has been and will continue to be a strong growth driver for us, though it is at a relatively lower margin than the rest of our primary and secondary storage revenue.

To further punctuate this point, our hyperscale business grew 32% sequentially and 68% year-over-year without a corresponding increase in our U.S. Federal or North America businesses. In order to improve our mix more favorably going forward, we began investing in broadening our sales and leadership teams in these areas over the last few quarters. I believe we are now back up to full strength and are well positioned to drive increased sales and more favorable revenue mix. In conjunction with these efforts, we are also focused on increasing our momentum in the enterprise market, particularly in the Americas.

Industry analysts are projecting massive increases in the amount of cold data that must be stored and protected in the enterprise. As the market share leader in cold storage software and solutions and having worked alongside the world's leading hyperscale customers for several years, we have a tremendous opportunity to develop unstructured data solutions for Fortune 500 companies and help them address this massive data explosion taking place. With this greater emphasis on U.S. Federal in North America, we expect to see a more balanced revenue mix and associated margin improvement going forward.

To give a broader sense of this opportunity, IDC estimates the worldwide scale-out file and object storage market to be over $30 billion by 2025, with emerging use cases like infrastructure for AI and business intelligence to be major growth drivers. Quantum offers a unique end-to-end portfolio to store, protect and enrich data across its entire life cycle and address critical needs in the enterprise like modernizing infrastructure to enable digital transformation, strengthening cybersecurity and using AI to unlock value in massive unstructured data lakes. We look forward to talking more about our go-forward product and business expansion strategy at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 17.

Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to take this time to welcome the new additions to our Board of Directors. In August, Christopher Neumeyer joined our Board after serving as an observer since 2016. Having spent a decade at PIMCO and a big supporter of Quantum's business, he provides a wealth of experience in corporate finance as we focus on delivering improved financial performance and shareholder value.

And we recently announced that in November, Don Jaworski and Hu Meyrath will be joining our Board of Directors. Both Don and Hu have a deep understanding of the market trends in our space and have experience in the broad enterprise IT market, having previously held Senior Leadership roles at companies like NetApp, Dell, Juniper Networks and Brocade. All of these new Board members will help guide our future strategy, particularly as we bring to market new products aimed at high-growth segments like software-defined storage, AI and machine learning and hybrid cloud.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike to provide more details on the results. Then, we will take questions. Mike?

Mike Dodson

Thank you, Jamie. Welcome and thank you for joining the call today. Now turning to the results for the second quarter. Revenue came in just above the high end of the guidance at $99.1 million, representing an increase of 6% year-over-year and 2% compared to $97.1 million in the prior quarter.

As Jamie mentioned, the supply chain continued to improve throughout the quarter, coupled with continued strong demand from our hyperscale customers. We had very strong bookings during the quarter which nearly doubled sequentially and contributed to a record backlog of $96.1 million as of September 30. The current quarter increase to a record backlog reflected the timing of several large purchase orders from hyperscale customers for future periods to ensure continuity of supply as opposed to being a result of supply chain constraints. We ended the quarter with approximately $25 million of shippable backlog and ended the second quarter with approximately $20 million which wasn't shipped during the quarter primarily due to lead times.

Similar to prior quarters, approximately 85% of the backlog was with hyperscale customers. Although we anticipate supply chain constraints will remain, we do not expect this to significantly limit our ability to ship against customer demand. In the second quarter, secondary storage revenues were up 33% sequentially to 44% of revenue, primarily driven by ongoing strong demand from hyperscale customers and, to a lesser extent, an increase in enterprise, backup and data protection products.

Primary storage systems declined 37% sequentially which reflects a combination of decreased shipments of our video surveillance solutions following our fulfillment of a large order last quarter, combined with soft media and entertainment and U.S. federal business. In terms of the supplemental metrics we use to track our ongoing transition to emphasize our recurring software subscription model, Annual Recurring Revenue, or ARR, increased 14% sequentially to $9.4 million. As a reminder, this figure includes recurring software subscription revenue across all of our transition product offerings, including StorNext, ActiveScale, DXI and CatDV.

Additionally, at quarter end, the cumulative number of customers under a subscription contract increased to just over 550 active customers which represents a 180% year-over-year growth and sequential growth of 22%. In terms of total contract value, TCV, increased 9% sequentially to $17.5 million at the end of the second quarter, up $16 million in the prior quarter, up from $16 million in the prior quarter. Although we anticipated a slight sequential improvement in non-GAAP gross margin, we ended the quarter at 35% or flat with the prior quarter.

While we have seen benefits from our previously implemented initiatives related to price increases, prudent management of discounting, reductions in PPV and other related supply chain costs, these were collectively offset during the quarter by approximately 2 percentage point gross margin decrease as a result of a less favorable product mix that was more heavily weighted towards our hyperscale customers.

As I just mentioned, secondary storage was 44% of our revenue which compares to 34% last quarter due to the significant increase in the hyperscale business.

Next quarter, we expect this strong growth in hyperscale revenue to continue offsetting the realized benefits from our cost initiatives and favorable pricing and therefore, expect gross margins to remain flat with the second quarter. Improving our revenue mix remains a critical focus area to help expand gross margin in order to drive improved operating performance and increased EBITDA. As Jamie mentioned, in order to improve the revenue mix, we are focused on building our enterprise IT business and have recruited top sales talent with years of experience selling into this market as well as recruiting new reseller partners focused in this space.

Another key growth driver is selling our end-to-end portfolio into our existing customer base, effectively broadening our footprint within our existing customers and using this as a key leverage point. Also impacting GAAP gross margins during the quarter was an extraordinary inventory reserve provision of $6.9 million. There were 2 primary factors that contributed to the need for this inventory provision. First, due to longer purchasing lead times of up to 52 weeks during the pandemic and subsequent changes in customer requirements over this extended time frame, certain inventory had become obsolete due to next-generation products being released and the related legacy products being discontinued.

In addition, following our integration of several past acquisitions, certain legacy products were discontinued and replaced with updated product offerings rendering the related inventory obsolete. We do not believe that the magnitude of this inventory charge is indicative of the company's performance and is not expected to be repeated in the near term.

To meet the ongoing supply chain challenges, we have focused on supply chain excellence over the past year, including the following: first, establishing supply chain analytics to enable improved reaction time to supply chain disruptions, market demand changes and early technology transitions. And second, product management and supply chain are working closely together to reduce complexity, both in product SKU count and the supply base through supplier consolidation with the objective of being able to use components across multiple product lines.

On the supply side, we will focus on supply partners for appliances that draw upon higher volume, more industry common platforms in which the supplier holds inventory until we need the appliance. We are also extending lead times on products that have lumpier demand and are more customized to the customer solution to reduce risk of holding inventory through technology transitions. GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were $39 million compared to $41.1 million in the prior quarter. The non-GAAP expenses for the second quarter sequentially decreased $1.5 million to $34.8 million or just below our targeted run rate of $35 million.

I want to further emphasize that $35 million was our target for the end of fiscal 2023. Therefore, we achieved this level effectively 2 quarters earlier than initially planned. The decrease in operating expenses were primarily due to lower head count levels and higher cost geographies. GAAP net loss in the second quarter was $11.9 million or a loss of $0.13 per share compared to a net loss of $10.6 million or a loss of $0.13 per share in the prior quarter. Excluding stock compensation, restructuring charges and nonrecurring charges, non-GAAP adjusted net loss in the second quarter was $0.5 million or $0.01 per share compared to adjusted net loss of $3.6 million or $0.04 per share in the prior quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $4.1 million compared to $0.3 million in the prior quarter. Included in the second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 million of other income related primarily to a benefit from foreign currency exchange rates and the sale of certain intangible assets compared to $0.8 million of other income in the prior quarter, related primarily to a benefit from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As we have discussed previously, driving improvement in our adjusted EBITDA remains one of our highest priorities. With our lowered operating expense run rate and continued top line growth, as we outlined earlier, improving gross margin will be the key factor to fully realizing increased improvements in our quarterly EBITDA results.

There's a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in both the press release and the Form 10-Q released today.

Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter were $25.9 million compared to $26.8 million in the prior quarter. Outstanding term debt at the end of the second quarter decreased by $1.2 million to $77.2 million from $78.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. At the end of the second quarter, the outstanding balance on the company's revolving line of credit was $21.5 million compared to $17.3 million in the prior quarter. Interest expense in the second quarter was $2.7 million compared to $2.1 million in the prior quarter and $3.1 million during the same quarter a year ago. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $0.9 million during the quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities during the current quarter was $0.4 million and represents a significant improvement over the $18.3 million net cash used in operating activities in the prior quarter.

The fiscal year-to-date net cash used in operating activities was $17.9 million. And this use of cash approximated the $17.7 million decline in deferred revenue that was primarily driven by seasonality. As we mentioned on the call last quarter, historically, the heaviest bookings for service contract renewals have been the December and March quarters with decreases in bookings in the June and September quarters. Net cash used in investment activities was $4.8 million which represents CapEx. The net cash provided by financing activities during the quarter was $3.4 million and primarily represented increased borrowings and the revolving line of credit of approximately $4.2 million, offset by $1.2 million used to pay down outstanding term debt.

Now turning to our financial outlook. As previously outlined, our fiscal 2023 objectives remain to continue growing revenue while realizing identified cost reductions. Although the pressure on gross margins associated with revenue mix remains a near-term challenge, we believe we are positioned to realize improvements in the coming quarters as our sales teams' ramp and secure additional wins for our higher-margin products and solutions.

For our third fiscal quarter, we expect revenue to be $103 million, plus or minus $3 million. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss is expected to be $1.5 million, plus or minus $1 million; adjusted net loss per share of $0.01, plus or minus $0.01 per share, using an anticipated basic share count of 91.3 million shares. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter to be approximately $3.5 million.

With that, I'll turn the call back to Jamie for closing remarks. Jamie?

Jamie Lerner

Thanks, Mike. As indicated by our comments today, the team remains highly focused on executing and driving increased profitability in our business. Our end-to-end data management solutions are resonating with customers and partners. And we are actively expanding our software and systems business along with driving future growth in the federal and enterprise markets to increase our margins and improve our overall revenue mix.

We are well positioned with record backlog which enables greater visibility into the long-term orders of our large hyperscale customers. With our expectation for continued improvements in the supply chain, we are guiding revenue for the third quarter to be above $100 million at the midpoint which will be the first time since 2019.

With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities.

Craig Ellis

Congratulations on the significant surge in the backlog. I wanted to start there. So of the two components, the shippable component declined, it looks like by about 20% and it's around $20 million, while the future period is up about 3x. So Mike, what caused the mix of backlog to shift so much towards future and our customers just starting to do more order pipelining? And if so, why are they doing that now versus earlier when components might have been a bigger issue?

Mike Dodson

Yes. I guess, first to talk about the shippable backlog. We've seen that steadily declined over the last few quarters. It's gone from $32 million to $25 million now to $20 million. And when we look out to next quarter, we'd expect that to go down about $5 million more. So we're getting pretty close to just a normalized level as far as shippable backlog. And then really, the big increase is future orders. And what we believe that is -- what's driving that is our large hyperscalers just want to ensure continuity of supply. So they're just placing these big orders on us. It's in the future. It gives us great visibility and helps us plan. But it's not created because we've got a supply constraint like it had been in the past.

Jamie Lerner

And Craig, there's one other interesting development is we've been serving our largest hyperscaler coming on 4 years. So we're starting to see them begin to not only make additional capacity buys but starting to replace and upgrade some of the equipment that's 4 years old. So now we're getting both new orders as well as refresh and upgrade orders for the massive installed base that's there. So our quarterly sell to them is going up because it's including both new capacity and upgrades and refreshes to the capacity that's now coming up on 4 years old and some of it is out of service.

Craig Ellis

Yes, a nice dynamic to have. So with that, well, one clarification. So Mike, for the backlog, how long do those orders extend out? Is that a 12-month backlog, a 24-month backlog? What's the duration of the orders in that extended backlog?

Mike Dodson

It's about 3 quarters.

Craig Ellis

Three quarters, okay. So that is something I want to tie in to the gross margin point that you made with gross margins in the third quarter being flattish. So if we got a backlog that's $97 million and with that being a 3-quarter backlog, how is it that mix will shift to allow gross margins to go up over the next 3 quarters? Or are we really looking at flattish gross margins over the next 3 quarters until we get through what is a very robust period of secondary demand where mix is really working against the blended gross margin average?

Jamie Lerner

Craig, it's Jamie. The reason for the gross margin pressure is that as we increase our hyperscaler sales, every additional $1 million that we bring in dilutes gross margin because it's margin-dilutive business. So to offset that, we need to include a mix of North American enterprise sales and U.S. federal sales which are among our highest margin business. Now our sales there, if you look in primary have fallen off a bit. And some of that is a result of us moving our sales organization from single product sellers to portfolio sellers, right? Our strategy is to sell our customers a full end-to-end portfolio of unstructured data products. So we've been shifting our sales force to a, I would say, a more capable enterprise seller. But when you transition the sales team, the new team needs to get up to speed, get going. And we're transitioning that North America team and our U.S. Federal team.

Now we've made the hires. We've brought them through training. And we expect them to come on. And as they begin to sell at a higher level than our previous teams did, we're going to restore that mix. So it's really about less of a market condition. It's more of a result of us making pretty significant changes in the makeup of our North American and U.S. federal sales org.

Craig Ellis

Okay, Jamie. So just to tie that in with some of the numbers from the investor presentation then. After a quarter or two, if primary kind of stays at these $10 million level, you'd expect it to get back to the mid-teens? And with that, you'd get some upward mix pressure on gross margins. Is that how we should look at it?

Jamie Lerner

Yes. I think you're going to see primary storage increase. And I think you'll see secondary storage sales into the enterprise and into U.S. federal increase and that's how we're going to restore margins, right. We do about kind of in the mid-40s of margin to the U.S. enterprise. And we're in the 60s and in some cases, 70s when we're selling to certain government very specialized government programs. So you can imagine the impact of 70 points margin business when it is offsetting margins in the 18% to 20% of the hyperscale.

Craig Ellis

Yes, makes sense.

Jamie Lerner

Just a few million dollars of that business really makes a big impact to the margin. So it's really about mix. And so our -- we feel really good about the strength of our cloud business. Now we're putting a lot of energy into our North America enterprise and our U.S. Federal business to get that mix where we need to get the margins climbing back up into the 40s and ultimately where we hope to get to is into the 50s.

Craig Ellis

Got it, okay. And then last one before I hop back in the queue. The subscription customers, again, I think for about the third consecutive quarter, up by about 100, so nice to see. But Mike, you indicated that your expectation for that ARR target was pushed out from the end of this year to early '24. And so it seems like that 100 or that 100-qurter-pacing or the value per deal or in aggregate, just isn't pacing as you'd expected. Can you talk about what it will take to accelerate the customer adds from 100? I know I've asked about that before. But it seems a very critical question for getting the business to that 60% gross margin target very long term.

Mike Dodson

Yes. Craig, what we feel good about is our new customers are moving to subscription. They're happy to do it. We're not getting a lot of pushback. But as you pointed out, we need more velocity. We needed to accelerate more. So we're looking at a series of programs. One is we have certain customers who've been buying for us for 10 years, 15 years. And they're pretty set in how they buy from us. And when we move them to subscription, it's just a very different sets of, pricing levels and they're used to. And so we're looking at different -- certain customer incentives, certain sales incentives, channel incentives to accelerate people moving the subscription with us. And we're going to be executing a series of programs to pick up the pace there. Because I think we feel good about those products. We feel good about that business model. What we need to address is the velocity of customers moving to the new business model.

Craig Ellis

Yes, those incentives make sense.

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Meyers with Lake Street Capital Markets.

Ryan Meyers

Just one for me. I was just wondering if you could highlight your operating expense reduction efforts. And if you feel like there's opportunity to reduce this even further. It sounds like you made some positive strides here during the quarter. Just kind of curious if you think there's opportunity to lower those even more.

Mike Dodson

Yes. Thanks, Ryan. Yes, as we reported, coming in at $35 million was the target that we had for the end of the year. So we're 2 quarters ahead there. And we still will continue to optimize, look at what we can do, where we can do it. If we can do things in lower-cost geographies, we'll take advantage of that, look to optimize our facility footprint further. So we would expect to keep at this level, if not do better, as we go forward. That's definitely our target.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.

George Iwanyc

Jamie, maybe just expanding on the economy and what you're seeing there. I know you talked about the sales transitions with the new hires and all of that. But are you seeing any areas where macro headwinds are impacting the business?

Jamie Lerner

Our business certainly isn't as large as others who are seeing headwinds. We're certainly not macroeconomists. But at the same time, I have to say, I am not seeing deals being significantly pushed out because of economic concerns. I'm not seeing delays. I'm not seeing projects canceled. And it may be the areas that we play in data protection which is -- I don't think that's an area where people will cut costs. I don't see people canceling media and entertainment. They're not canceling shows or the news or movies or television series. So in the areas that we play, critical video surveillance, I don't see police departments cutting their budgets on video surveillance. I don't see television stations canceling shows. I don't see people cutting corners on anti-ransomware or data protection. And so maybe it's the areas that we play, maybe it's that our products are value-oriented. But I am not -- and I've recently spent a lot of time with our sales team. I am not seeing delays, cancellations. And that's why you see us for now multiple quarters in a row, raising our revenue outlook because our issues have been supply based. And as that's coming down, we're just seeing more and more sales flow through.

George Iwanyc

All right. And just following on that supply challenges. Good to see the improvement. Are there areas where you're still seeing any decommits or areas where you're still a bit concerned? Or is the visibility definitely a lot clearer at this point?

Jamie Lerner

It's a little hard to answer, right? Because we've had the rug pulled out from us multiple times. So today, we have good visibility. We are not seeing people asking the outrageous prices that were being asked. We're not seeing the need to do these very expensive expediting of shipment. We're not seeing the brokers out there charging massive fees. So that has come down now that can start again in a minute if somebody decommits. But so far, we're a month into this quarter. We're not seeing decommits. We're not seeing broker fees. We're not seeing expediting fees. And we're receiving materials as expected.

The only thing that I would say we see a bit of is some products have slightly longer lead times. Products we used to see in 2 to 4 weeks are now 4 to 8 weeks. And that's why we're kind of moving to more of a more natural shippable backlog of $10 million or $12 million when we used to be down to $2 million or $3 million because products where we get orders in the last 2 or 3 weeks of the quarter, we're not going to pay expediting fees to get that. We'd just rather roll that into the next quarter and get better linearity and better predictability in our business.

George Iwanyc

All right. And just my last question. You highlighted the AWS marketplace availability of StorNext and the extended partnership. How is the ecosystem evolving? Where are you focused on adding new partners? And how long do you kind of expect that effort to last before you start seeing some new customer gains from that?

Jamie Lerner

Yes. The way I would characterize our partner ecosystem is Quantum 4 years ago was a niche vendor. We sold the media and entertainment. And we sold in new certain backup used cases. Today, we're an end-to-end provider. We provide a full suite of offerings during every life cycle stage for unstructured data. So now we're working with different partners. We're way more relevant to the enterprise than we used to be. So our largest effort globally in all our theaters which are North America, Asia Pac and EMEA, we are recruiting new channel partners that are more enterprise-oriented, that are more, broad in their scope than the niche partners that we worked with historically.

And we think that is where we're going to see the most margin expansion. And I think that's where we're going to see the most revenue expansion is being much more relevant with more products to the general enterprise.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Duley with Steelhead Securities.

David Duley

Yes. Congratulations on the nice results sequentially. A couple of questions from me. As far as your hyperscale business, you're kind of seeing a little bit of a slowdown in the growth rates of North American customers and I think some slowdowns internationally as well. How should we translate that into the growth rate of your business into this area? And I guess maybe if you could look into next calendar year or just help us maybe understand what the growth will actually be this calendar year?

Jamie Lerner

Yes. I mean I can speak to why this occurred. We're not seeing a slowdown in the economy, anything like that. We're transitioning a sales force that's been here for many years as single product sellers into portfolio sellers. And that slowdown in some of these areas is a natural thing that we just have to go through when you move a legacy sales team into a next-generation sales team. We've had to cycle over some of our people and there's a learning curve. So that -- I think that's just a natural piece that we're going through.

Mike, you can speak to growth rates. But I don't believe we've provided any forward guidance on growth rates beyond the quarter we're guiding to.

Mike Dodson

But to that point, Dave, we are having our Analyst Day on November 17. So we'll be looking out 5 years and we'll go year by year. So we definitely can give a lot more color as we go through that presentation.

David Duley

Yes. No, for calendar 2022, you just gave guidance for the December quarter and I don't have the numbers in front of me. What do you think the hyperscale business did in calendar 2022 or will do if you hit your guidance?

Mike Dodson

For the current quarter? For the current quarter, the hyperscaler continues to grow.

David Duley

If you just assume that you hit your numbers in the current quarter for hyperscalers, what will the growth rate be for calendar 2022?

Mike Dodson

We never -- we don't break out individual groups like that. I mean you can look at the secondary and understand that the hyperscalers are the biggest group included in that business unit and that.

Jamie Lerner

How much did the secondary grow and that's been growing significantly.

Mike Dodson

Yes. I mean it grew 33%, well the hyperscalers grew 33%, the secondary grew.

David Duley

Okay. And as far as the hybrid -- business is this mainly a North American business? Or is there any risk from international restrictions in China and whatnot?

Jamie Lerner

Yes, it's an international business. We have Chinese hyperscalers, U.S. hyperscalers. We have Telcos that are trying to be hyperscalers. So it's an international business. Cape which is predominantly what we sale is a product that the Chinese government has said they will not be trying to make. Similarly, India is saying that is a product they're not trying to make themselves. So they are -- they have made a decision to import that from the West.

David Duley

Okay. And then finally for me, you touched upon it a little bit. But you've talked about how your federal business is weak and your media and entertainment business was weaker in your U.S. non-hyperscale enterprise businesses. What would be the timing or your best guess as to see when those segments start to improve sequentially or year-over-year? Or how are you look at them?

Jamie Lerner

Right now, I mean that's why we're guiding to a $103 million is -- and we'll continue. We think we'll continue to guide up as -- think of it as we've hired over 15 new sales reps. So last quarter with the $99 million, there were 15 sales reps, who contributed nothing. Now they're brand new. There new hires are coming up to speed. When they come on, where we quoted people at over $3 million a year, you can imagine as they come on, how that's going to contribute. So we're feeling pretty good about the hires we've made, about the boot camps and the training we've done. They're going into territories that are not cold. They were cultivated prior to them. There's large installed bases in those territories. So that's part of the reason you're seeing us not only have beaten our range and been above our range but guiding up as well.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of John Fichthorn with Dialectic Capital.

John Fichthorn

Yes. Guys, nice work in the backlog and hitting the numbers. I guess everybody is trying to kind of get to the same answer here. And so I'll ask the same question in a different way which is you're guiding to $103 million, it's great. And Dave just asked about kind of the mix here with hyperscalers or tape. And so you're forecasting growth but you're forecasting flat gross margins which would imply that all of the growth is coming from hyperscalers and yet you're also talking about these 15 new sales guys which I'm excited about, gaining traction in things like primary storage and federal and media and entertainment and that somehow should imply higher gross margins. So I can't quite square that circle.

Jamie Lerner

Yes. So you're absolutely right in that we have been growing our hyperscaler business while having some historic declines in our most profitable, highest margin businesses. So to break the margins go up, we need to sell more in North America and sell more in U.S. Federal and also another driver is increased service sales which is a little more challenging in the short term. So we knew about this over a year ago. We've made -- we done the recruiting. We've done the hiring. We've done the training and the people are now -- I was just at a boot camp, where we trained a large group of these new folks and we expect them to start to contribute.

We don't know the speed at which they're going to come online. We don't know exactly how to forecast that yet. And so we're guiding to strong EBITDA. The other thing, though, if you look at that $96 million in backlog, what does it tell you? If it's mostly hyperscaler, that means not only is hyperscaler sales gone up this quarter, they're probably going to go up in the quarters in front of us. So that means an additional headwind that we have to sell into to offset the dilution of increasing hyperscaler sales. And we haven't fully characterized that yet. And that's why EBITDA of $3.5 million is strong. But it also has some conservatism in it and that we just don't know exactly how effective in the timing of these new reps coming on board is.

I've met with them all personally. I can tell you this is a much more experienced, much more mature enterprise selling org than we've had in the past. I'm really optimistic about them. But I cannot draw a line through their performance yet because it's just too new.

John Fichthorn

So like in the case of federal, just to focus on a specific vertical, typically, it's -- this was that quarter. Is that something where you still think your new sales rep is going to be able to drive growth in federal maybe year-over-year but it's maybe sequentially because it didn't seem like it was that great quarter for Federal, this quarter?

Jamie Lerner

Yes, it's interesting. If you look at Dell, Cisco, us, a lot of us got deals pushed by U.S. Federal and they're continuing the budget. What's interesting is it's usually use it or lose it money in the government sweeps quarter which ends September 30. But with the continuing resolution, they're carrying money from last year forward. So I'm feeling pretty good about our U.S. Federal business. I'm feeling really good about the programs that we're part of and that there's going to be pretty big refresh budgets there. So I'm pretty optimistic about U.S. Fed. And I think we've had -- we have stronger leadership in that segment than I think we've ever had and some of the strongest new hires we've made are in that segment. And I'm pretty optimistic about how that group is going to perform. And I'm feeling pretty good about how the U.S. government with sweeps, did not do use it or lose it money. Any monies they allocated last year, they kept almost all those monies that where they couldn't get deals done, they kept the monies allocated into the new year.

John Fichthorn

Got you. And so one other interesting area you've now had for a little over a year is in your SaaS business, you're almost $10 million in ARR. Can you give me a little color on, A, what does that represent, would that have been something far greater in revenue, had it been kind of traditional revenue that you booked or not? And what is the margin profile of that business as we look to see how you get to $50 million?

Jamie Lerner

Yes. I mean, I'll let Mike provide some of the details. But most importantly, in the old model, we would not have captured as much revenue or margin. In the old model, when people bought appliances, where the software was bundled into it, they undervalued our software. They often wanted it almost for free and they didn't pay us for capacity. So in the new model, we get fully paid for our software. We get paid for additional features in the software and we're paid for capacity. So we had revenue leakage in the old model and we plugged those leaks. So definitely, the new ARR model is better for Quantum, both from total revenues captured over lifetime as well as the margin. So I'm very glad we made the transition. I like seeing the -- I also think we posted pretty strong TCV numbers in addition to ARR. So I like how that's building.

In the traditional model, we would have gotten more cash up front and some people might say that they like that model. But the majority of our customers are paying us 3 years upfront. So we're not even seeing that much delay in cash either in that. We're providing incentives for customers to buy on a monthly subscription but pay 36 months in advance. And the majority of our customers are opting for the 36 months in advance to get some of the incentives and discounts for paying upfront.

John Fichthorn

Got you. Two more, I'll try and keep them quick. You said 85% of backlog was hyperscaler. Does that mean 15% is not even tape-oriented and it's in other products? Or is it just not a hyperscaler but it's still on tape?

Jamie Lerner

No. I mean a good example is some of our customers in our video surveillance business need boxes with a lot of GPUs in them to do facial recognition or license plate recognition or advanced analytics. Those boxes are about an 8-week lead time. Some of them are 12-week lead times. So basically, what you sell in this quarter, you ship next quarter. So we do have servers on those kinds of delays. The F-Series, as you know, has very expensive NVMe in it. And some of that NVMe is long lead time products as well. So there's F-Series products, surveillance product and certain DXI product is in those longer lead time products that will push out of the quarter. So it's not all take.

John Fichthorn

Got you. My last one, so roughly, you're doing $100 million in revenue, you've got 35% gross margin which is $35 million. You've got $35 million in OpEx. It seems like this is kind of breakeven. Do we feel confident because it's pretty lumpy, right? You've got some quarters, you've got 44% tape and you're hoping these other ones grow. But are you feeling pretty confident that this is kind of the base case for your business model and we're going to see sequential growth from here? Is there still going to be a lot of seasonality? I mean, even though you're guiding to $3.5 million in EBITDA, you did generate a little cash this quarter. We'd love to see that. I'd love to hear your thoughts on cash flow. There was some working capital that reversed which was great. But like from here, is it top line growth? Is it top line growth and gross margin growth? Is it more gross margin growth than top line growth? What do you see as you think?

Jamie Lerner

I get where you're going. I mean, I'll tell you exactly kind of how we're running the business. One is, we feel pretty comfortable with the backlog with what we see. We are running at $100 million plus per quarter now consistently. We think that can be -- with the new sales team coming online that can get to $110 million, $115 million. That's where we're trying to get to. In addition, we've got to get our margins back up to 40 points plus. We're going to do that with the reps that are operating in the highest margin areas and we're grinding costs more. We've identified up to another $2 million per quarter of cost we can take out, some on a run rate, some on a onetime. But obviously, my goal is to drive top line, drive margin, drive additional cost cutting. So I get to at least $6 million in EBITDA, where I know conservatively, that's throwing off at least $1 million of free cash flow.

And that's what I'm trying to get to is now we're in -- I mean, it was just a few quarters ago, we were at $300,000 in EBITDA. Now we're at $4 million. I got to push that to around $6 million. So we moved from positive EBITDA to free cash flow. And that's where I think we all get a lot more comfortable as we start to build our balance -- build the balance sheet with cash going into the bank. And that's how I think about the business right now. So my goal is be we've got a pretty good model now where we've been beating guidance and my goal is to beat guidance this quarter and beat it enough to throw off cash.

John Fichthorn

That's a clear business model answer as I've ever gotten on a conference call. So I really appreciate it.

Operator

And our final question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets.

Nehal Chokshi

Yes. My congrats on the strong bottom line. There's a lot of discussion here on the new quota sales reps here. Just to level set, how many total quota carrying sales reps you have now?

Jamie Lerner

Well, we have outside and inside quota-carrying reps but rough and tough, I'd say it's about between 50 and 55 quota-carrying people.

Nehal Chokshi

Okay. And prior to the restructuring, where were you at?

Jamie Lerner

We're about 50 to 55 what they were point product sellers. So people who just sold DXI, people who just sold StorNext for media and entertainment. The new salespeople are people who sell full portfolios. They come from organizations like Cisco, where there's 2,500 products or Dell where there's 2,000-plus products. So it's -- these are salespeople that may be a little more tenured, a little more experienced. They cost a little more. But they carry much higher quotas and they do more targeted account selling than what we did previously was just sell anything you can to anyone who's in front of you. Our new reps are moving to more named accounts where they just work 20 to 25 accounts but do a lot more inside those accounts.

Nehal Chokshi

Okay. And just to be clear then, prior to the restructuring, each quota-carrying sales rep was effectively a point product salesperson. And you converted most of them to a multiproduct salesperson. Those that weren't converted were let go and you hired a new 15?

Jamie Lerner

I mean the number is about 15 in North America. But I think of it as some of our salespeople made the transition from being maybe focused on a certain area to being more generalists. I think everyone knows that there's been a lot of turnover in all U.S. businesses. So we've had a certain amount of turnover ourselves. We've had certain people that just weren't successful here. So we had a series of reasons of why we've cycled people over. But in that process, we've moved to end-to-end sellers versus point product sellers. A lot of them are new. And right now, it's a race to get them up to speed, get them up to quota. And we're investing in training boot camps, all the things we could do to get them up to quota as fast as we can. And we think that will rebalance the mix. And by rebalancing the mix, the margins should go up. But I think 35%, we're expecting 35% to be the low point. And we just got to bring it up from here.

Nehal Chokshi

Yes, absolutely. Okay. And just to be clear, you believe you're not seeing any negative macro signs at this point in time?

Jamie Lerner

I'm not but we're a small business. We operate in a few niches. So I don't have the view that a massive company -- like a Dell or Cisco or HP have. But in my little view and I have recently traveled to Asia, Europe and across the U.S. to Atlanta to New York to L.A. to Seattle. And in all my travels and I visited over 30 customers face-to-face, I have not had a discussion of, hey, we got to slow down or hit the Br-exit. But my purview is probably smaller than CEOs of bulge bracket companies.

Nehal Chokshi

Yes, understood. And then finally, can you just -- and I might have missed this. But I'd love to hear an update on the PIVOT 3 acquisition, the performance of that asset.

Jamie Lerner

Yes. I mean those guys are doing phenomenal. They just won another huge Department of Homeland Security award. They are -- they're doing really well. I think they got some long lead time products because what's happening with video surveillance is most VMSs now need a lot of GPUs to analyze the video and just making those products longer lead time. And we're not going to pre-buy systems. It's just too much inventory risk. But I like where that business is going. The other thing is a lot -- we just did across Asia, Europe and 3 different meetings with partners in the U.S.

We do an annual Elevate Conference. So we brought in over 100 partners in Asia, 150 partners in Europe and probably close to 200 partners in New York, L.A. and D.C. And the product that I found everyone was most excited about adding to their portfolio was video surveillance, particularly in Asia. We had to go back and do a whole another series of meetings about surveillance. So it's generating a lot of excitement in the partner base. So I think that's a good buy for us. I think we've got a lot of innovation there. The USP has now shift the unified surveillance platform which is the integration of PIVOT 3 with the cloud in assets, where the software runs on any server, any hypervisor can run on the cloud, virtualize.

So, it's -- I think the technical architecture is in a leadership position. And it really is the platform of choice if you cannot lose any frames of video. So if you're a police department, homeland security, defense department, run a casino, a bank or you just cannot run any risk of losing that video. The PIVOT-3 platform is the leading platform for those used cases.

Operator

And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Jamie Lerner for closing remarks.

Jamie Lerner

All right. Well, thanks, everyone. It feels great to be back beating guidance and raising our revenue. And I think that trend is one we plan to continue, yet being conservative and recognizing the fact that there are still supply chain disruptions. There's still a lot of uncertainty. But our products are value-oriented. We think they do well when customers have to spend wisely and we like how our products are positioned for this market. And we look forward to speaking to you all on November 17, where we'll be having our Annual Investor Day. And we'll be updating our 5-year model with what we've learned over the last year. So I look forward to seeing you all then. Until then, thanks so much and we'll talk soon.

134,Q&A With Intermountain Healthcare VP/CISO Erik Decker: Business Continuity Depends on Developing the ‘Muscle Memory’ to Handle Cyber Events,https://healthsystemcio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Decker_Erik_NEW.jpg,06/11/2022,"Erick Decker says consistently getting the basics of cybersecurity right goes a very long way to keeping an organization secure. 
Source: Q&A With Intermountain Healthcare VP/CISO Erik Decker: Business Continuity Depends on Developing the ‘Muscle Memory’ to H…",https://healthsystemcio.com/2022/11/06/intermountain-healthcare-erik-decker/,"These days, some health system CISOs wonder where the buck stops when a cybersecurity event goes down. Who’s responsible for helping the clinical side go through the motions when the CISO says it’s time to go to paper? It should be the CEO, COO, CFO and/or other top executives, and the entire process needs to be planned and practiced until your organization is bored, says Erik Decker, vice president and CISO at Intermountain Healthcare. In this interview with healthsystemCIO Founder and Editor-in-Chief Anthony Guerra, Decker says the enterprise-wide response to a cyberattack comes down to muscle memory. “Because then when it’s muscle memory, if and when the event happens, you’re going to be able to get over all the original decision-making burden and be able to manage the context of the specific incidents that you have in front of you.”

… ideally, if you have a new contract coming in that’s for technology or data services, that should go through a supply chain; a supply chain should have a fork that comes directly to you. And that way, you don’t have to go out there chasing everybody all the time.

The majority of threat actors out there are criminal organizations that are looking to make money. And they’re doing that through extortion and extortion via ransomware, etc., they’re going to go for the lowest drag pathway possible in order to do that. And that’s why basics is the thing that you have to make sure you’re up to snuff on.

… SBOM is good. It’s the first step in understanding and unpacking what’s going on underneath it. But if you have to do that manually for hundreds of thousands of devices, you can’t. It’s just not enough. You don’t have enough people to do that.

Guerra: Erik, thanks for joining me.

Decker: Happy to be here.

Guerra: All right, great. Erik, do you want to just briefly give us a quick overview of your organization and your role?

Decker: Yes, you bet. So, I’m Erik Decker, I’m the VP and chief information security officer for Intermountain Healthcare. Intermountain Healthcare is an integrated delivery network located in the Mountain West region. So based in Salt Lake City, Utah, but we have Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Kansas, and Montana in our portfolio. And being an integrated delivery network, we’re also both a health plan as well as healthcare delivery organization.

Guerra: Very good, Erik. All right, I want to just see what’s on your mind. So what are some of the top trends that you think CISOs should be working on or preparing their organizations to handle?

Decker: Yes, so the top issues that are happening today, of course, still start with ransomware. And there have been several big ones that have hit in the last 30, 60 days or so. And, you know, if you look at how these intruders are getting into these systems, it’s still the basics. Some of the trends that we need to be focusing on are our hygiene, our minimum standards, minimum controls that should be in place that work against the most prevalent attack vectors. And so it’s still multifactor authentication on your VPN, or the lack thereof on VPN, or email, remote desktop open to the outside world, critical vulnerabilities open on your perimeter. You know, these are things that are not overly complex, but the environments that we manage are really complex. And sometimes these technologies can work their way into the environment, you don’t even know that they’re there. And so having that good inventory, especially if you’re doing merger and acquisition work, you really need to make sure that at least those things are accounted for.

The other item that I still think about, and what we do on the national level, as part of the Cyber Working Group of the Health Sector Coordinating Council, is looking at third party and third-party attacks. So it’d be attacks, either against data that’s held by our third parties, or it’s third parties being compromised and a conduit of attack flows through that third party. So maybe you have just a critical supplier that has a VPN connection into your organization, a backdoor IPsec tunnel, something along those lines. And if those third parties are compromised, there are still plenty of intrusions that are happening via that vector. So, third-party risk and looking at third-party risk, not just from a sense of what data do they hold, but what access does that third party have to your organization.

Guerra: I assume every CISOs should be doing postmortems as much as they can when they read about a breach in the news to understand what happened, right? Then add to that, concerns about the basics, which as you said, are simple, but complicated, and it’s difficult to keep your arms around it all. What are your thoughts around that?

Decker: Yes, so I mean, it sounds easy. And unfortunately, it’s not, especially when you think about what a cybersecurity department does for an organization, you know, we’re trying to keep our lens on everything that’s happening, everything that’s changing on any given moment. Even if you have just a regular system that’s not going through growth, that system is changing constantly. And so cyber teams are out there trying to make sure that as this change has happened, you’re not introducing a vulnerability, you’re not introducing a new vector of attack, and so forth. And so you get spread very thin very quickly as that’s occurring.

You know, I mentioned third party. There’s a ton of contracting that organizations like ours do and so a lot of resources get dedicated to that. A lot of resources get dedicated to your 24/7 monitoring. A lot of resources get dedicated to your IT projects, etc., etc., etc. So, it’s easy to lose your lens on hygiene because you’re thinking about all this other stuff. However, most cyber attackers are getting in through VPN access, it’s compromised credentials, it’s the phish, although the phish is moving away, and it’s going to go back more towards vulnerability and exploit. But it’s your perimeter and what zero days or critical vulnerabilities are resident in your perimeter, and so forth. When you’re a smaller organization, you have limited resources. I would definitely say make sure that is locked up, and it takes resources to actually maintain that, too. So it’s not like you can just do it once and then you walk away, and all is fine. Some of that can change, you know, a request can come in and the change could be asked, and maybe it didn’t get cleared through security, and then you reintroduced a new hole. And so you’ve got to maintain vigilance on it.

For those groups that are doing merger and acquisition work, make sure you have a playbook in place, and make sure you have the top 10 things, the absolutes, that should be on that list. And so, as you’re bringing in organizations, acquisitions, and so forth, run those top 10 things. Look where two-factor is; it should be everywhere that is connected to the internet, and especially the VPNs. And make sure that you’ve got that in place. As you said, the postmortems, when events happen, we don’t always know how an organization was compromised. Sometimes that’s released through secure channels. Sometimes it’s not, it’s all dependent on the organization and their willingness to share that. So you can infer, based on how the event has happened and knowing what the common factors are.

Guerra: So just to be clear, you said even in a health system that is not going through M&A, there’s tons of change and morphing. You add on M&A, and that exponentially increases the amount of change, correct?

Decker: That’s correct.

Guerra: So when you were talking, I wrote down “process”, you use the word playbook. Right? I mean, these are the things that are going to help you; that you need to have process around. When this happens, these things have to happen. Right? I mean, that’s how we get our arms around these things?

Decker: Yes, and partnership with your supply chain organizations, your purchasing departments, your legal departments, your privacy departments. Those are all ways that you can keep tabs. So having official process. So ideally, if you have a new contract coming in that’s for technology or data services, that should go through a supply chain; a supply chain should have a fork that comes directly to you. And that way, you don’t have to go out there chasing everybody all the time. It’s just embedded in the system. And then you have your checks and balances. So you work with your partnerships, with your privacy teams, your legal teams. You educate them on the things that you should be looking for, and sometimes they will trip stuff for you that might not have gone through the official channel for various reasons.

Guerra: So there’s the basic attacks and the basic defenses. And then I’m guessing there’s the exotics. Do you have any thoughts around the cutting edge and what CISOs need to do? There are some crazy things that are coming down the road.

Decker: So you’ve got to think about what the intentions of the threat actors are before you’re looking to defend against their attacks. The majority of threat actors out there are criminal organizations that are looking to make money. And they’re doing that through extortion and extortion via ransomware, etc., they’re going to go for the lowest drag pathway possible in order to do that. And that’s why basics is the thing that you have to make sure you’re up to snuff on. If you don’t have that in place, it’s not hard for them to circumvent and overcome that.

And the idea that you’re too small to be known by them; that’s just not true. I mean, they’ve scanned the entire internet, they’ve scanned everything, they know who you are, who’s in your organization, they just know all of that stuff. So don’t rely on obscurity as a defense.

On the exotic side, we’ve seen elements of this happen. They have to expend resources to do it, and costly resources that hopefully get for a payout that they’re looking for. So you have to think about, what would that payout be for an exotic type of attack? You saw it with SolarWinds, that was definitely exotic. Where they embedded malware into the build of legitimate software that was deployed all throughout SolarWinds customers. That happened December of 20. I believe it’s two years now. And you know, why did they do that? Well, they were targeting government systems, as Russian speaking countries were going for it. And that was very likely espionage driven.

You’ve got to understand, why would they come at you with an exotic attack. What do you have that would be of interest in order to expend those resources? You keep the lens in play here. As we get better on the healthcare side, on our basics, and we close down all those doors, and we make it more costly for the attacker to come at us, they will pivot. And they will pivot. And they will get more sophisticated; they will expend those resources to continue on with their extortions and so forth. And so then it’s going to be more zero day-driven types of types of attacks. It could be more complicated social engineering attacks.

We’re already seeing multifactor fatigue attacks coming in, where they get your credentials, they try to make a connection, they can’t get in, because the multifactor goes off, and it goes off on your phone. And when it’s on your phone, they get denied, but then they just keep doing it until eventually you get tired of it, and you go fine and hit yes. So that’s going to come – and we’re already seeing that happened today. And so phishing-resistant or multifactor-resistant types of attacks are things that we’re going to have to start considering in the next five years, because I see that happening more often in the future.

Unfortunately, when you start getting into that realm, it’s less user friendly. So it’s things like UB keys. It’s going back to the hardware token that we had initially when multifactor came out in the early 2000s, late ’90s. With YubiKeys, you plug it into your computer, and that’s your cell chip. It’s user friendly in the sense that you can engage and work with the computer and it just happens, but you have to remember to carry it with you. And if you don’t have it, then what? And so you run into all these kinds of scenarios that make it a little challenging for the regular user to work.

Guerra: User friendly, but sometimes not so much if you don’t have it.

Decker: Yes. And that’s the rub, right? Is like how you make sure that it’s connecting in, and we do that via these proxies, multi factors and so forth. I would say if you’re using SMS as your second factor with codes being sent through a text message, that’s also going to go the way of the dodo in fairly short order. There are attacks that can circumvent that. It costs that attacker to spend a little time but there’s things called SIM swap attacks and such where you can clone the SIM card and then have those messages relayed to a different phone. And so, it bypasses the whole process when you do it that way.

Guerra: You know, you talk about “everyone’s a target.” One of the things that I’ve heard, and I believe makes you a bigger target of a specific focused attack, is probably research. If they think you’re doing something with nation-state level interest in research around maybe COVID vaccines or whatever, that can really put a target on your back, so to speak. Does that make sense?

Decker: Absolutely. You know, especially if your organization’s doing DoD level research or they have federal contracts in place, that would be a target of interest by not necessarily criminal organizations, in this case, now you’re talking about nation states and espionage and IP theft. So you look at different countries that are interested in doing that as they build up their economies.

Guerra: Right. Right. So you almost have to operate as a CISO at a different level when you’re running that type of stuff?

Decker: Yes, it’s a different risk profile, so you need to have an understanding of what that type of information is. What are the contracts that you have made? If there are federal contracts, then certainly there’s very likely something you have with the federal government. And so what are the terms and restrictions around that? If you’re an organization that is like pharma, or something along those lines, where the drug that you produce is your revenue stream. And so you get allowances with that drug before they become generics, and you spent a lot of time in R&D, if you lose that to somebody else, they can just produce that elsewhere. That’s a huge hit on your organization. So that’s a very different risk profile. It’s not locking up your systems through ransomware. It’s literally competitive edge. And so not every organization is going to have that, at that level of risk, but there are definitely some in this space in healthcare for sure.

Guerra: Right. Third-party risk, obviously, very interesting topic. You said that not only do you have to make sure that an entity has good cybersecurity, but you also have to check the VPNs that are coming into your organization, and what access others have. That’s fairly complex. I’ve heard people use the term, not only do I have third parties, but they have third parties, and they become my fourth parties. And then I have fifth parties. And it makes me think of that SBOM (software bill of materials) concept people are talking about. You know, with log4j, people didn’t know if they had it or not. So what do you think of that SBOM concept – it’s almost like a list of ingredients on software. Would that be something helpful to security professionals?

Decker: Yes, so SBOM, in particular, is the first step in a process for being able to understand what’s inside these products that we get from vendors where the intellectual property essentially is the product itself. And so you don’t get to look under the hood. So when the log4js of the world happen, we go scanning our systems, and we go looking for the vulnerability. And depending on the scanner that you have, it may or may not be able to detect it. If it can’t get into the system itself; it can’t authenticate to the system and look through the libraries and the software that’s installed. And so it makes guesses on stuff.

And so the SBOM intention is to bypass that, or rather give us the information upfront so that we can just look for it in one place. The challenge, the next step in the evolution of SBOM, is operationalizing it within healthcare delivery organizations. We have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of products that are in our environment, and to be able to maintain the versioning of software in every single one of those at any given time is going to be very challenging. So think about it, you have an infusion pump that has version X, Y and Z, you go out and do an update to that infusion pump of X, Y and Z and maybe half the fleet has been updated and half the fleet hasn’t. They have different versions now of that software. And so you have to know every version of every pump of every place and now compound that by every other modality that exists inside of a healthcare organization, and you’ve got yourselves a big problem, a big data problem.

So there’s there are folks that are working on solutions for this, and I’m hopeful that in the next five years or so we’ll see something come down that actually can do it at scale. Because this is absolutely a scale problem. Like I said, SBOM is good. It’s the first step in understanding and unpacking what’s going on underneath it. But if you have to do that manually for hundreds of thousands of devices, you can’t. It’s just not enough. You don’t have enough people to do that.

Guerra: Right. Let’s talk a little bit about business continuity. This is an area that I’ve been really focusing on trying to understand what CISOs should be doing. Is there a missing role in terms of somebody not overseeing this process at a high level? Let’s say there’s a ransomware attack. And the CISO, in consultation with the CIO, determines that we need to shut down certain applications within a very short period of time and go to paper. CISOs can take it to a certain point, but it’s not their role to make sure that the clinical side of the house knows what they’re doing at that point. So I’ll leave it for you there. That seems to me to be an issue.

Decker: Yes. So this should be in the basics – in the business continuity, in your incident response plan – especially the large scale incident response plan, and the drilling of that large scale incident response plan. So we start by offering some suggestions and solutions on how to do it and products that actually exist. So one of the other things that I do is I’m the chair of the Cyber Working Group of the Healthcare Sector Coordinating Council, which is one of the 16 critical infrastructures that’s been defined under the National Defense Authorization Act and National Infrastructure Protection Plan. It’s a construct that says industry and government have to come together when there’s critical infrastructure in place, because industry actually owns and operates the infrastructure. So within that group, we have just released the OCCI (Operational Continuity – Cyber Incident). And it is a checklist that was built in partnership with emergency management folks, cybersecurity, and emergency management folks on how you connect your cyber incident, a cyber disruption in with your standard emergency operations.

So every hospital has to have an emergency operations organization and plan. We have to account for physical disasters, fire, water, whatever. And so what you want to do as a CISO is connect into that process. You don’t want to create something separate. And so your access into downtime procedures, and all those other things, is through your emergency management department. So start there. And there are these things called incident command or hospital incident command, depending on which standard you’re using. There’s structures of command that are already built as part of that emergency operations, emergency management process. And you want to leverage those processes. So you’ll have an incident commander, you’ll have logistics, finance, marketing, media, public affairs, legal, and so forth. You build a plan, a cyber plan that accounts for the types of damages and impacts that can occur due to these kinds of ransomware attacks. Work with your emergency operators to figure out how you connect that into your incident command structure.

Build in the what-if scenarios you need to be thinking about. At what point are you going to take down your systems? When are you going to proactively take down your data centers and so forth? What would be the trigger points that would enact you to do that? And it’s very uncomfortable to obviously be postulating that, but you need to be postulating that before you have the attack and not making that decision on the fly. And then you drill it. So you go through this process you need to involve your executive leadership in this – certainly your CFO, if not other executive leaders, and you drill through the thought process.

Take just one of the things that’s happened in the news and apply that to your organization. Don’t even worry about getting super complicated about this. “Oh, I’ve got to have every little attack vector understood in order to do a proper tabletop.” You don’t need that. So what you need is to be thinking about, what is the event that’s occurring? Assume that it’s going to occur to us. Get people over the hump of, “Oh, well, that wouldn’t occur because of this thing,” and then arguing the scenario. You don’t want to argue the scenario, you want to work the plan, the scenario should be helping you determine if the plan is accurate or not. And then say, “Okay, how would we do this?” You know, is it one person that gets to make that call within a period of time? Are there two keys that have to be turned in order to do it? What do you do if that person is on a plane somewhere or unable to make a decision? What’s their delegate process? How do you go through all of that, and then you just update the plan, and you want to keep doing those drills over and over and over again, ideally, until people are bored with it. They’re like, “Oh, yes, we’re going to do this. We’re going to do that.” So it’s muscle memory. Because then when it’s muscle memory, if and when the event happens, you’re going to be able to get over all the original decision-making burden and be able to manage the context of the specific incidents that you have in front of you. So you’ll be able to leverage everything that you’ve worked on before.

Guerra: Excellent, Erik. I think unfortunately that’s all the time we have for today. But great stuff, great advice, and really interesting stuff about that disaster recovery. So I appreciate it, and I will talk to you again soon.

Decker: Thank you very much.",cybersecurity,healthsystemcio.com

Russian trolls and bots are coming back online ahead of the midterms—this time, amplifying right-wing vitriol on Gab, Parler, Gettr, and other minor social media platforms serving far-right audiences. Cybersecurity researchers have identified the reactivation of inflammatory accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a propaganda group associated with the Kremlin that has interfered in US elections since at least 2016, the New York Times reported on Sunday.

Some of the Russia-linked accounts are attempting to undermine Democrats in close races, posting a series of racist cartoons about Sen. Raphael Warnock, according to social network analysis company Graphika. Others are boosting Republicans in tight races, such as Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. Tellingly, they’re posting a lot about the Russian war in Ukraine—arguing that President Joe Biden is wasting money on military aid to Ukraine to the detriment of “working class Americans.” And, as always, they lavish praise on former President Donald Trump.

Gab and other nontraditional platforms are much smaller than Facebook, where the 2016 Russian influence campaign reached millions of voters. But users of the far-right platforms are seen as more susceptible to incendiary political commentary. “You can engage the audiences in much more targeted influence ops because those who are on these platforms are generally U.S. conservatives who are maybe more accepting of conspiratorial claims,” said Brian Liston, a senior intelligence analyst with cybersecurity research firm Recorded Future.

It’s difficult to measure the impact these accounts will have on the election, the Times warns—just as it’s still unclear how much Russian influence truly swayed the outcome in 2016. But perhaps Russia has concluded it doesn’t need to work so hard to promote its interests among the US electorate, since Fox News host Tucker Carlson is already doing so for free. Earlier this year, David Corn reported on a leaked memo from a Kremlin agency to Russian media outlets:",cybersecurity,mother jones

The posts mostly denigrated President Biden and other prominent Democrats, sometimes obscenely. They also lamented the use of taxpayer dollars to support Ukraine in its war against invading Russian forces, depicting Ukraine’s president as a caricature straight out of Russian propaganda.

The account was previously linked to the same secretive Russian agency that interfered in the 2016 presidential election and again in 2020, the Internet Research Agency in St Petersburg, according to the cybersecurity group Recorded Future.

It is part of what the group and other researchers have identified as a new, though more narrowly targeted, Russian effort ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections. The goal, as before, is to stoke anger among conservative voters and to undermine trust in the American electoral system. This time, it also appears intended to undermine the Biden administration’s extensive military assistance to Ukraine.

The campaign — using accounts that pose as enraged Americans like Nora Berka — have added fuel to the most divisive political and cultural issues in the country today.

It has specifically targeted Democratic candidates in the most contested races, including the Senate seats up for grabs in Ohio, Arizona, and Pennsylvania, calculating that a Republican majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives could help the Russian war effort.

The campaigns show not only how vulnerable the American political system remains to foreign manipulation but also how purveyors of disinformation have evolved and adapted to efforts by the major platforms to remove or play down false or deceptive content.

Last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an alert warning of the threat of disinformation spread by “dark web media channels, online journals, messaging applications, spoofed websites, emails, text messages and fake online personas.”

Recorded Future and two other research companies, Graphika and Mandiant, found a number of Russian campaigns that have turned to Gab, Parler, Getter, and other newer platforms that pride themselves on creating unmoderated spaces in the name of free speech.

These are much smaller campaigns than those in the 2016 election, where inauthentic accounts reached millions of voters across the political spectrum on Facebook and other major platforms. The efforts are no less pernicious, though, in reaching impressionable users who can help accomplish Russian objectives, researchers said. “The audiences are much, much smaller than on your other traditional social media networks,” said Brian Liston, a senior intelligence analyst with Recorded Future who identified the Nora Berka account.

Many of the accounts the researchers identified were previously used by a news outlet calling itself the Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens. Meta has previously linked the news outlet to the Russian information campaigns centered around the Internet Research Agency.

Welcome to Solvay Q3 2022 Results Call for Analysts and Investors. Solvay team the floor is yours.

Jodi Allen

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. This is Jodi Allen, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by our CEO, Ilham Kadri; and our CFO, Karim Hajjar. To start, we want to apologize for the delayed start today, as we were busy managing some technical issues that seem to be behind us.

Today's call is being recorded and will be made available for replay on the Investor Relations section of our website. I would like to remind all participants that the presentation includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You may refer to the slides related to today's broadcast, which are available on our website.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Ilham.

Ilham Kadri

Thank you very much, Jodi, and hello everyone. I'll begin my remarks as always with a health and safety overview. Compared to the third quarter of 2021, the reportable injury and illness rates are down across the group and COVID cases continue to decline so the situation is truly under control. As usual, we continue working hard to raise the bars towards a zero incident goal.

Moving on now to our results. I'm very, very proud beyond proud actually of the results we achieved this quarter and this entire year-to-date setting new records in so many areas. You've heard me talk about the quality of our team and the strong performance. It's a testament to their efforts and hard work. And it's not just the results this quarter that I'm proud of, it's a journey that we have all been on together over the past 3.5 years.

I'm truly humbled and when I look at what has been accomplished since I joined the company. And one thing is very clear, Solvay today is not the same company, it was back in the beginning of 2019. Thanks to the hard work of our talented teams, we have undergone a complete transformation. And today, we are a stronger company and we are better positioned for future growth.

We've grown EBITDA over 30% year-to-date versus 2021 and this excludes any impact from currency. When I look back further and factoring in our upgraded 2022 guidance, we are on track to grow EBITDA by 11% since 2019 despite the 2020 pandemic. We improved operational efficiency by demonstrating cost discipline through challenging times, which included the delayering of the organization. Our total cost savings since 2019 has reached €450 million and we will deliver our targeted €500 million in structural cost reductions ahead of our 2024 commitments.

We strengthened our customer partnership and frontline organizations. You can now see the value proposition we create for our customers is real and we have the innovations and margins to back it. And we have demonstrated an improved steadier free cash flow generation that is enabling us to take big bets and invest for our future. This is in fact the 14th consecutive quarter of positive cash generation.

Another metric I'm truly and particularly proud of is our returns. We reached an all-time record high ROCE return on capital employed at 15.4%, almost double the level of 8.2% at the end of 2018. This is truly a remarkable progress. We've done this by raising the bar operationally, optimizing our industrial footprint, upgrading the quality of our portfolio of businesses, pruning those businesses that couldn't be improved further prioritizing and focusing on higher-end specialties growth as we deliver the value propositions our products and solutions bring to our customers. And obviously we will continue to prune our portfolio.

In fact, we didn't stop at operational performance. You can also see the results of our actions to improve the balance sheet, while funding our pension. You may not realize it but our debt and pensions were reduced by €3.4 billion or 40% since 2019 and the pension cash out is down over 60% from €216 million in 2019 to around €85 million this year. In fact, we currently have the lowest ever leverage in the history of the company now at 1.2 times versus start of 2019, which was 2.1 times. And with this, you can [indiscernible] is pleased with these accomplishments.

So coming back to Q3 specifically. Our businesses continue to perform strongly against the backdrop of significant inflationary pressures. Sales grew almost 30% to €3.6 billion in quarter three and this was led by pricing, while the demand momentum continued in several key markets where we also saw some volume growth in addition to pricing. These markets included automotive driven by electrification and continued penetration of our Specialty Polymers.

Aerospace, driven by higher single-aisle aircraft rates, thanks to the continuing recovery. Agro, sector driven by demand from more sustainable chemistries used in crop protection. Mining, driven by high production rates especially in copper. And of course, in Oil and Gas Volumes were also higher given the current robust demand. In essence, our best-in-class portfolio enabled us to capture this growth and in fact grow our sales above market growth rates in each of these areas.

From a geographic view, we reported double-digit sales growth in all regions. I would like to highlight Europe's growth at 42% followed by Asia Pacific region growth at 30%. Q3 EBITDA was up about 40% on a comparable scope and foreign exchange basis with all three segments contributing to earnings growth, thanks to value pricing and resilient volume. This translated to an EBITDA margin in quarter three of 25.4% in fact two percentage points higher than quarter three last year reflecting the improved operating leverage. Free cash flow was €452 million in the third quarter, the 14th consecutive quarter of positive cash generation.

Now speaking of CapEx, we have many investments underway to support our growth. These investments are in technologies and processes that we know and we master across our business segments.

Remember, earlier this year we shared our plans to invest in a fully-integrated suspension PVDF operation in Tavaux in France, making it the largest PVDF production site in the European region to support the growth in EV battery markets.

Our strategy is to build regional capacities in the high-end product for high-end markets, in France to support customers in the European region and in the US for customers in North America. Why? Because customers prefer a local source to supply their needs and the authorities provide substantial incentives in order to localize strategic supply chains such as electrification.

Our strategy has been to fully integrate our suspension PVDF production, with security of supply of raw materials, which are critical, while being cost competitive and align with best-in-class leading partners to derisk our investment.

So, today, I'm extremely excited to announce the next steps of our global strategy, which is to expand these critical materials that support the electrification trend into North America. This time we are pleased to be working with a great partner Orbia who is the leader in their field.

Orbia brings the key raw materials necessary including, fluorspar which enables Solvay's production of PVDF. I must say firsthand, that this is, in many ways, an ideal partnership with two strong complementary leaders coming together to create a locally-produced vertically-integrated competitive supply chain, which will enable production of suspension-grade PVDF to serve some of the leading battery makers in North America.

You may have heard the big news last week from the Biden administration which awarded Solvay with $178 million of government funding. These elements of supply security and financial support further derisk these sizable projects, which, by the way, has extremely compelling returns and is expected to be commercial by 2026.

And we are not only making investments with the future SpecialtyCo side of our portfolio, but we also have a number of opportunities in EssentialCo. In addition to our battery focus and to further support the green energy transition, we've also made an announcement in September related to our ambition to create a powerful rare earth hub in Europe starting in La Rochelle, France by entering the magnet value chain.

Then in October, we took another step to advance our rare earth specialties by taking full ownership of our stake in Japan, further leveraging our global plans in rare earth chemistry. As you know, rare earth metals are essential to ensure the green energy transition and support development of more sustainable solutions for electric mobility and clean energy generation.

In July, we announced our plans to expand electronic-grade H2O2 production in the US to meet the increasingly stringent specification of the semiconductor industry and we have more peroxide opportunity underway which we will share in due time.

And in soda ash, as you know, we expanded natural soda ash in the US by acquiring the minority position of our Green River, Wyoming operations announced in May. But the markets will also need additional capacities, as it will remain very tight at least for the five years to come with fast-growing demand in lithium carbonate and photovoltaic panels, as well as in bicarbonate flue gas treatment and pharma applications on the top of building and construction.

Our improved cash generation and our strong balance sheet has enabled us to make all of these investments, each with attractive returns and in attractive markets, where we have leading technologies that offer significant value to our customers.

We know that we are facing challenging times, but we have the strategic focus and the financial resources, not just to navigate these times confidently, but to emerge again and again with strong growth at the right time.

Finally, our teams continue their journey of bringing new technology and process innovations to the market. In September, as you may have heard, we announced that we are reinventing our own 160-year-old soda ash process. This major milestone will enable three improvements, almost revolutionary ones.

The process will lead to 50% less CO2 emissions and this is aligned and will enable our carbon neutrality for soda ash obviously One Planet climate ambition. It will reduce water and brine consumption and last but not the least, will eliminate limestone residue to the sea.

We're also continuing to evolve our sustainability ambitions in soda ash and have recently established partnership to create a circular economy for soda ash production in Rosignano Italy that will support our lower carbon footprint ambition.

We also have an exciting new innovation to share based on sodium bicarbonate called Alve-One, which was awarded the 2022 Pierre Potier Prize. It offers a sustainable alternative to the incumbent hazardous chemical blowing agents used for thermoplastic foams with 10 times lower CO2 equivalent emissions. In fact our innovation has been accredited as a safe substitute for ADCA, this is Azodicarbonamide, which has been classified by REACH as a substance of very high concern.

Finally, I'm so pleased to share that our Actizone F5. You may remember, we launched it during COVID-19, Solvay's innovative 24-hour antimicrobial sanitizing technology that we launched back in September 2020 in Europe is now fully approved by the EPA in the United States of America.

Now Karim will take us through the group segments and the financial performance in more detail. Karim, the floor is yours.

Karim Hajjar

Thank you, Ilham. Good morning and good afternoon, of course, everybody. I'm going to go directly to our business review. And as usual, I'm going to refer to figures on an organic basis. Meaning at constant scope, constant currency, unless of course I indicate otherwise.

Sales in the Materials segment increased 37% driven by strong demand for Specialty Polymers and for Composite Materials and it led to record third quarter sales and earnings.

Turning to Specialty Polymers, sales reached new records that were up 40%, compared with the third quarter of 2021. They were up 5%, against a very strong quarter second quarter of this year with both pricing and volumes contributing to that growth.

We saw continued strong demand in markets such as Automotive including EV batteries Electronics including smart devices as well as Healthcare applications such as hemodialysis and pharmaceutical packaging.

Our sales in Automotive outgrew the market due to our leading positions in strongly-growing electrification and lightweighting applications. I know that this is not new news, but the momentum continues.

You may recall in fact last quarter I highlighted our new PVDF capacities that came online in China, thereby doubling our production capacities to meet the growing demand in electric and hybrid vehicles.

Ilham today just now mentioned our investment in North America, which is designed and will capture a significantly leading piece of the growing market there. This decision not only positions us to capture strong growth through the years to come, but it will also generate very attractive returns, way beyond the minimum thresholds we set.

Our efforts over the years are paying off and it is evident that we have the right innovation and the differentiated portfolio, to best meet the needs of our customers in this very attractive growth market.

The most recent market forecast for 2022 from LMC indicates growth of around 7%, in light-duty vehicle production globally and beyond the auto market its worth noting that, Specialty Polymers delivered growth in the Electronic market, as customers continue to invest in semiconductor production and an expanding 5G infrastructures.

Growth in Healthcare was also strong in areas such as biomaterials, medical devices and pharma packaging. Sales in Composite Materials grew 27% year-on-year particularly strong sales growth to the Civil Aerospace market.

Now, that was largely driven by production increases in single-aisle programs, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320.

Also there was some recovery which is really good to see in the Boeing 777 cargo and the respective engine part programs as well as a very strong rebound in the Business Jet segments which makes for a very healthy Civil Aerospace profile in Q3, whereas sales to the Space and the Defense were flat year-on-year.

Supply chain issues, slower production rate at some key customers, sales of composite materials to the high-performance automotive market grew by double-digits, as our innovative materials contribute critically to lightweighting and design flexibility.

In addition to the aforementioned market tailwinds, customers gave substantial attention to our ability to deliver products, despite inflationary cost raw material availability -- that's a tongue twister and despite logistic constraints which are facing the industry. They've really seen us work to overcome these challenges.

And frankly it was great for me to meet the Materials team last week on their way back from a very successful case there in Germany which had just wrapped up. The team, are energized. They were energized to see their customers', partners face-to-face again and coming back plenty of ideas and possibilities.

I spoke to a couple of them earlier in the week they are fully mobilized and they're going to focus on converting, these ideas these opportunities into solutions for our customers of course but also critically into more growth and more business for Solvay. So watch this space.

Wrapping up Materials, segment EBITDA increased 43% compared to the third quarter last year, reflecting both price and volume growth in Specialty Polymers and in Composite Materials. And that's what led to a record 34.6% EBITDA margin in the third quarter up almost two percentage points in the quarter thanks to improved volume and mix.

Moving to Chemicals on slide number 7, third quarter sales rose 34% as we were, again able to manage inflationary costs with price increases. Volumes declined 5% overall in the segment, mainly because of reduced demand at Coatis and some production issues which I'll detail further as I go into each business.

Soda Ash & Derivatives sales increased 55%, thanks to the continued demand strength on tight supply and with price increases that offset the significant rise in energy costs. End markets for our products remained solid, in Soda Ash and in Bicarbonate.

Volume was down very slightly, as our growth was constrained in the quarter, mainly by industrial outages at our Natural Soda Ash facility in the U.S. The war in Ukraine and resulting embargo in solid fuels like anthracite and coal which are used for energy generation had an impact.

And that wasn't a significant impact there was also an effect on our industrial production efficiency and impacted volumes as well obviously. Peroxides sales were up 29% driven by pricing. Volume was down slightly, as strong demand in electronics and graphic paper markets were insufficient to fully compensate for the reduced demand for HPPO from our mega plants.

For those of you who attended our webinar, on our Peroxides business about a month ago, this quarter, you'll recall that we provided details about that business and we demonstrated a proven track record of strong, resilient, cash generation and very high cash conversion.

We also detailed our well-established strength against competitors in terms of costs, scale, process, technology leadership. And of course, we laid out our focus on the most attractive market segments in Peroxides as we look to the future.

The Coatis business is facing the normalization we've been anticipating with sales down this quarter by 1% on an organic basis, coming from decreased volumes against a relatively strong third quarter last year.

Now, although pricing remains slightly positive, as I said volumes were down, predominantly in Latin America, but also the business in Europe is also currently at low-levels. In Silica, sales grew 34%, pricing actions across the tire and in the industrial markets that we serve were able to more than offset the slight volume reduction.

Looking at the Chemicals segment overall, EBITDA was up 22%, thanks to higher prices across all businesses. The Chemicals segment delivered an EBITDA margin of 25.2%, which is down 2.1% against Q3 last year. But if we exclude the impacts of Coatis and RusVinyl, I know this to be cyclical in a way then the segment EBITDA margin actually stable with the third quarter last year despite the very significant increase in energy-related costs.

Coatis and RusVinyl continue to normalize to mid-cycle levels versus the high cycles we've had the benefit of enjoying the last couple of years and that reflects the competitive pressure ramping up combining with demand softening in those two businesses respectively.

Turning to the Solutions segment on slide number eight, you will see that sales in that segment in Q3 were up 20%, driven by price increases whereas volumes were modestly lower. Strong demand in Agro, Electronics, Mining were the biggest growth drivers in the segment.

In Novecare, sales increased 20% year-on-year mainly due to pricing as volumes were slightly down overall in the quarter. Growth in Agro was again driven by demand for green solvents and crop protection applications. Demand was pretty resilient in Home and Personal Care whereas volumes in Coatings were slightly down as it is associates as you will appreciate to the construction market that is slowing down, particularly in North America.

Special Chem sales increased 23% thanks to strength in semiconductors and this was partially offset by weakness in the Rare Earth Specialties business which goes into automotive catalysts and we see softer demand there.

Technology Solutions sales increased 16% organically due to sustained demand in mining particularly copper mining as the team was awarded new business thanks to the new mine that started in Latin America.

Aroma Performance sales were up 13% in the quarter. Now although demand was strong enough to allow for price increases in the Food & Beverage sectors as well as Flavors & Fragrances, volumes declined in the quarter as some products turned along on the added capacities and on the back of exports from China-based peers. Nevertheless, pricing more than offset cost inflation.

Turning to Oil & Gas & Solutions, sales grew 26% continuing the strong momentum we've seen in the first half of this year. The strong sales performance was driven by price and volume increases with overall demand for oil and gas and chemicals being supported by high levels of oil prices.

Third quarter EBITDA in the segment rose 21% extending further the trend of the first half of the year. EBITDA margin in the segment was 0.8 percentage points to 19.1%.

When we compare the EBITDA margin for that segment with the 17.8% levels that we saw in 2019 to 2021, it really shows the impact of the transformation -- the impact of the value over volumes pricing strategy as we go to market and we really meet our customers' needs.

And frankly it reflects our team's unrelenting focus on meeting across our customers' needs for higher value products as well as the benefits of the structural cost reductions that have been sustained in each of those businesses.

Turning to Corporate & Business Services activities, EBITDA was a negative €19 million in the third quarter, much lower than the €15 million negative of last year. And actually quite a bit lower obviously than the €84 million negative result in the second quarter of this year.

There are two main drivers to that improvement. One our energy business generated double-digit profit this quarter which is great to see after recent quarters of modest losses.

Now, we made tremendous efforts to stabilize that business and this is showing through in terms of results. But I will say that it's important to stay cautious because it -- just look around those energy markets especially in Europe remain challenging and certainly remain volatile. But it's great to see that improvement.

The second reason that our results in Corporate & Business Services improved it's frankly that we have now passed the peak -- the point of peak investments in cybersecurity and digital transformation and our spending in the third quarter is now back to more normal levels.

Now, on slides nine and 10, you can see the details on the EBITDA impact which I've said previously even -- in fact 40% year-on-year. The strong pricing in the quarter amounted to €836 million.

At the EBITDA level, it is more than offsetting the €485 million increase in variable costs. And in fact you can see the net impact of €351 million on both sides. Along obviously with some help from volume and mix and that more than compensated for the increase in fixed costs that result both from inflation that we're all going through but also the investments we're making.

Now, before turning to cash flow and since Ilham already highlighted the strength of our balance sheet, I would like to bring your attention to an increase recorded within environmental provisions. Thanks to the recent completion of technical studies of analysis of remedial steps for certain costs over the next 20 years and intended to meet our legal obligations related to the past use of fluorosurfactants in our West Deptford, New Jersey facility, we made a provision of €93 million in terms of anticipated remediation costs.

Now, I will turn to cash on slide 12. Free cash flow reached €452 million in Q3. The strong EBITDA growth nearly offset the higher working capital which increased due to price and cost inflation and to higher value inventories. Indeed, it's worth noting that working capital increased by €547 million compared to the end of September 2021, that's around €0.5 billion.

But -- and here's the important piece. The strong focus the discipline that's helped us to deliver the cash flow comes from the fact that we're managing working capital very, very tightly.

Our working capital to sales now stands at 12.4% stronger than the 14.5% that we reported at the end of Q3 2021. And actually to remind you it compares with 17% as being the industry benchmark. The 12.4% versus 17% industry that helps to generate the cash.

But also as Ilham highlighted, we are making strategic investments this year to support future growth and so our CapEx increased to €233 million for the quarter. And finally and very importantly, free cash flow conversion stood at 36.8%.

Now, given the high level of free cash flow and in line with the dividend policy of the company, the Board of Directors has validated the decision to pay an interim gross dividend of €1.54 per share.

For those who are not familiar with Solvay, the dividend policy states that the interim dividend payable in January will represent 40% of the total dividend paid in the previous year.

Now, this will leave us the flexibility to fix the final dividend in early 2023 taking into account the full year performance in 2022, but also the investment needs of the company as well as, of course, the prospects for 2023.

And with that, I'll hand the floor back to Ilham. Ilham?

Ilham Kadri

Thank you very much, Karim. As you know, the excellent results that Karim just detailed led us to pre-announce on October 24 and raise our full year 2022 EBITDA guidance, so around 28% organic growth relative to the full year 2021, which equates to around €3.2 billion using current ForEx rates. This compares with our previous guidance of 14% to 18% organic growth issued in July.

To give you some additional color on the updated guidance we considered the strong performance year-to-date as well as our current view of the fourth quarter. Starting with costs, we estimate the increase in our variable costs in the range of 35% to 40% for the full year 2022, which is roughly in line with what we saw in quarter three.

Turning to demand. As we look at our fourth quarter order books, we see signs of demand moderation across most businesses. Now in Materials, underlying demand remains solid in key markets but some customers in Europe particularly, have indicated that they will be managing their inventories more closely in the coming months in anticipation of a potential downturn.

In chemicals, demand for soda ash remained strong. While in Silica, we are preparing to adapt production in some sites in response to a softening demand environment. In Solutions, the agro market remains healthy, though we see softening in areas such as Coatis and consumer-facing markets. None of these indicators are alarming to us and in many cases demand levels seem to be only modestly below normal seasonal patterns as we head toward the end of the year.

So today, I'm also pleased to share that due to our improved performance, we're increasing our full year 2022 free cash flow guidance to deliver around €1 billion. This strong performance will be delivered whilst also increasing our CapEx, which we now expect to reach around €1 billion by year-end as we accelerate our growth plans. Our cash flow will also be delivered despite a significant increase in working capital, because we will stay single-mindedly disciplined in our focus on cash.

Looking ahead into 2023, we are cautious about the environment yet confident in our ability to navigate challenging conditions. Although some of the weakness we expect in quarter four may well worsen into next year we are equipped and we are ready to respond to such challenges effectively. Notwithstanding, the possibility that there could be some easing in variable costs, we are working with our commercial teams to ensure that we meet our customers' expectations and needs and thus we preserve our leading margins wherever possible.

Most importantly, remember what I just said earlier that today we are better and stronger company and we have demonstrated this repeatedly over the last 3.5 years. And even if markets and macroeconomic conditions worsen, you can expect us to do better than peers, because we have structurally improved on so many measures, not the least with much lower cyclicality than in the past.

Thank you for listening. And now time, Karim and I will take your questions. Thank you.

Jodi Allen

Thank you, Ilham. We will now proceed to the Q&A portion. And I will kindly ask that you try to limit yourself to one question per person if possible so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Moderator, please go ahead.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Yates from Bank of America. Sir, please go ahead.

Matthew Yates

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Karim, perhaps a question for you just on this incremental provision you took. If I remember correctly, in 2019, you estimated the cost would be about €3 million. Now, you're saying €93 million, so that's obviously a very significant change. Can you just elaborate a little bit more what's happened in the interim? Does this include legal fees as well as sort of physical restoration and whether there's any other sites beyond New Jersey that we need to consider?

Karim Hajjar

Thanks Matthew. Good afternoon. I honestly don't recall anything to do with 2019. What we have been doing every year is disclosing very clearly the contingent liabilities and we couldn't make any provisions notwithstanding our desire to do so, because we hadn't -- we didn't have a basis for reasonable estimates.

Now what's different and why do we make a provision now? The answer is very straightforward and that we've now undertaken independent detailed technical studies aimed at quantifying precisely, let's say with reasonable confidence the future to cost of remediation over the next 20 years. And that is an estimate and now that we have it, we didn't hesitate to make that provision. It's just around €100 million and not $93 million.

So this really reflects let's say, the application of a prudent policy. And in 20 years, what I will say maybe as well as that €93 million, we're going to do our best to accelerate and front load the remediation works. But it will go with 20 years and it certainly, won't have a material impact on our cash generation.

Matthew Yates

Okay. And then do you mind if I…

Karim Hajjar

Sorry, go ahead Ilham.

Ilham Kadri

Matt, you had another question?

Matthew Yates

Yes.

Ilham Kadri

Go ahead, Matthew.

Matthew Yates

Yes, if that's okay. Just on the Materials business, if I look at Q3, you've made about €150 million more in EBITDA versus the same quarter in 2019, which is a phenomenal achievement. I'd just like to understand that a little bit better. You referenced a number of €450 million of structural cost savings at the group level. That's on an annualized basis. Can you break that down? How much of that specifically relates to the Materials division on the cost side? Thank you.

Ilham Kadri

Yes. Well, listen, on the -- indeed you've seen it very well Matthew and I'm really glad to see Materials and the SpecialtyCo, part of the SpecialtyCo really getting more pricing and more volume growth consistently. Where we see it is in the automotive, for example, market driven by electrification and continued penetration of our Specialty Polymers.

Remember, Matthew, we replace metal. We penetrate each car making it lighter. Therefore, it consume less fuel, it emits less CO2, and therefore, it enables clean mobility. So that's move not only in ICE internal combustion engine cars, but also the move to EV and hybrid. It's positive to Solvay, because we can double our revenues by car and you're going to see it consistently in the coming years.

Aerospace, also had a very good quarter. August was really a good month for us, driven by higher civil aircraft rate, as I said. You see continuing recovery. Imported material composite sales was 28%, as you've seen probably in the financial report outperforming closest peers and across market segment actually, and this is really good. Although, we have been struggling in Europe in the past with supply chain and labor constraints, facing the industry we could really get -- diminished the backlog.

The Agro was good, more sustainable chemistries, and obviously, other businesses. So that's what we've seen really in the Materials. On the cost, yes, I mean very glad to see €450 million and this is going to happen much faster than 2024. It reflects -- remember that we have been doing some restructuring in the company delayering since 2019. In corporate services, et cetera, and restructuring of composites, right, which was really -- brought a lot of benefit.

You remember that we shut down and we closed low returns, return capital employed assets, right? And 2020 crisis, we didn't waste that crisis and it helps us already to do some very good restructuring in some of the lowest return assets, and we are very glad. I'm very positive about the speed with which we are bringing this €500 million in debt.

Matthew Yates

Thank you both.

Operator

The next question comes from Chetan Udeshi from JPMorgan. Sir, please go ahead.

Chetan Udeshi

Yes. Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. I think the first question I wanted to ask was, and maybe I'm -- let's put it this way, most companies in chemicals in Europe seem to think they can hold prices even if demand weakens. And maybe it's a straight question to you Ilham and Karim both. If I look at the bridge for first three quarters, you guys have had over €700 million of positive net pricing. Now, of course, I think, you probably will also indicate the same that you'll aim to hold prices.

My question is, are there any pockets within the portfolio where you think we should be more careful in terms of assessing the pricing outlook as we go into next year? I mean, if you feel -- I mean, I would be more interested in how much of this €700 million, can you actually sustain going forward? That was the first question.

The second question going back to the US investment. Can you help us contextualize in terms of the capacity of that investment? Will it be closer to what you will have in France 35000 tonnes? Is it lower is it higher? Any sort of color on how much tonnes are you adding in the US?

Ilham Kadri

Okay. Yes, thank you very much Chetan for those questions. On pricing, yes, it's a legitimate question. We hear it from our investors and discuss it with customers. Remember that we've made a significant progress in the last years, right, building competencies in our commercial teams. I don't want you to think and have any doubt that -- this is not a top-down push from Brussels to the rest of the world in our commercial teams.

I told you that in H2 last year, we start training the muscle called pricing and value pricing. We've seen some inflation last year and obviously, we were prepared when the crisis started this year with the Russian war. And basically, we already started at the fall last year to renegotiate our contracts and really look at our gaps, et cetera.

So the net pricing you see today, Chetan, even if you exclude variable cost of use, but also fixed cost and even the hedging it remains positive. So indeed we came a long way a long way. So in general, as all -- remember that each and every one of our business has a leading position in that marketplace. This is important, right, because when you're a leader, you are also a price leader. And we have built these positions with our customers over time.

When you look at the portfolio and go into more specific around half of the portfolio actually shy of half can be supply-demand related. And we have enjoyed a site supply situation in 2022. And for much portion of this portfolio, I'm talking about soda ash, I'm talking about peroxides and some others, the supply will remain tight as we look forward, right. So this is important and this is structural for the next few years. and we are a leader in these markets and we have many contracts with pricing mechanism. supporting cost of shop. And more recently as I told you second half of last year we reviewed the thousands of contracts in the company. We put energy surcharges. and sometimes even logistic surcharges like in peroxide. so we expect to keep that portion of our pricing power in this area, and obviously. it's a pricing mechanism.

And there is a smaller portion that is not structural side. We would adapt price volume we call it price volume elasticity to keep our critical market share. Let's move now to the second half of our portfolio, which I would call more of a specialty pricing driven and this is where we sell -- we don't sell products. We sell a value proposition and we invoice products. And we are learning how to do it better and better, because solutions are customized, innovative solutions that are designed to meet specific customer needs including the way we are packaging shipping our stock or safety stock.

So in these specialties those industries are more risk averse to change with high barrier to entry, they have longer qualification time. And as I've said before, we offer mission-critical here including lower total cost of ownership. It's not because the customer is buying at a higher dollars or euro that the total cost of ownership is not lower. Actually often it's lower. And of course, we offer security of supply which often these days come over pricing.

For this part of the portfolio, we will continue pushing the value pricing. I think it's a new culture and top selling products that invoice them to protect our margin. And have -- we have recently demonstrated that. So we also know that our customers understand that sustained level of profitability gives us the currency, the confidence and the willingness to reinvest in capacity innovation and our energy transition.

I'll tell you I was in the construct [ph] in Düsseldorf with the team Karim talked about this event for materials. And many customers were asking for I couldn't say it. Our investments in the US in batteries, right. Material I met recently saw the ash as customers who are telling me that the market they know it is tight until 2027. What can we do about that? And this is in our common interest. Between suppliers and customers you need to have a win-win situation. And we support our customers to also drive pricing down the value chain. So listen decent pricing and profitability creates a virtuous circle that helps everyone. There was another question?

Karim Hajjar

PVDF, the investment Ilham.

Ilham Kadri

So what was the question? I'm sorry.

Karim Hajjar

Chetan, can you repeat your question perhaps?

Chetan Udeshi

Yes I was just trying to – yes, just any color on the capacity of – especially, if you can't give a fixed number but how should we think versus your investment or capacity in France for instance?

Ilham Kadri

Okay. Yes, yes. No third question. You will understand and I think I said this before and it's not new that disclosing capacity is competitively sensitive. You may remember Chetan some weeks ago, we said that after the investments we would have up to 35 Kt obviously, but this is the total.

There was a capacity before and we did those indicate for obvious reason the current capacity. And I know it's not easy probably for you to make some computation and comparison, specifically when you compare apples and oranges. Tavaux investment is different. It's brownfield. Infrastructure was there, right? Whereas this new USA project consists of almost two greenfields Chetan. So the investments cannot be compared directly.

That said, we can confirm that these investments will make us the undisputed leader in North America. The industrial investments will be located in two sites. All these investments will be in their own sites and will comprise probably two plants with the critical materials we need not far from our Solvay. Investments will be in our Augusto plant and will comprise VDF and PVDF.

So yes. I mean, I'm very, very pleased because this is two giant, two leaders, undisputed leaders in their own domain coming together joining force. And as you have seen probably the United States of America through the Department of Energy has granted to Solvay $178 million of grants, which is more than welcome. The joint venture will be 51% share, Solvay 49%, Orbia as a structure. And obviously, we'll consolidate the numbers. We contribute IP technology and market access to our obviously market leadership and know-how on the suspension PVDF and Orbia contributes to the security of supply of key raw materials. Back to you.

The next question comes from Wim Hoste, KBC Securities. Hoste, please go ahead.

Wim Hoste

Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions, if I may. The first one is, can you update on the separation plan maybe the milestones that have already been achieved? What will come in the next few months or so? So that's the first question. And the second one is can you maybe elaborate on the energy cost outlook for 2023 and – not only your own but also kind of the contract book you have with third parties, et cetera? Can you maybe offer a bit of clarity on that as well?

Ilham Kadri

Yes, absolutely. Good afternoon. I will take the spin-off and then Karim the energy. So yes. I mean we are very glad with the progress. We don't see any elements preventing us from achieving the target date which is the second half 2023. That was what I announced to you at launch and we keep that timing. It's a challenging project and we value quality versus speed. That's what I told you.

A critical point for these companies is that we are – we continue building up standing up the two companies now. We – in terms of organization redesign, we have now – we are preparing the capital structures for both companies. Obviously, we enjoy now a much lower debt ratio, right in the company, as I told you. And this is a great achievement making us even stronger while we prepare for the spin-off and for the two companies. So – and that's where we stand. So really all green. We're not derailing. We will see the macros in due time, right? But – and we continue monitoring them. But definitely we are sailing full steam toward second half of next year for the launch. The energy question Karim?

Karim Hajjar

Your question on the energy cost or the improvement that I talked about on the Energy business?

Wim Hoste

Well it's actually both. So the outlook for energy costs in 2023 versus the contracts and hedges that are in place. And then also in addition to that the third-party business? Maybe some clarity there on the contract book, et cetera.

Karim Hajjar

Okay that's very helpful clarification. Thank you. Now obviously, I don't have a crystal ball what the energy costs are going to be next year. How quote is going to be? To what extent? Will European industrial consumers be able to curtail demand? Let's see. We braced for quite a challenging time but we're as ready as we can be frankly. So rather than speculate what may, may not happen in Energy, let me tell you what we do is we anticipate.

And Ilham's already mentioned some of the key elements. First thing, we did is renegotiated a number of our contracts, particularly supply demand impacted part of our portfolio and that gives us an element of a margin protection or certainly cost pass-through capacity as energy costs go up or down and that is we've got far more of that now than we did a year ago. That's important.

Secondly, I don't know if you were attentive but when Ilham talked about the €700 million plus positive pricing power, let me just remind you. This is – that pricing power is a multiple of the hedging – financial hedging benefit that we had in 2022.

Now we still have hedges in place for next year. They will provide a degree of protection. But frankly the best protection for us is to show the customers the capacity to pass through costs. And that's really where we stand. So when Ilham expressed the confidence in our ability to navigate these challenging times, of course it takes into account certain assumptions on energy costs and how we will respond and we've got plans in place to deliver. But let's see it's going to be challenging. We think we're ready.

Ilham Kadri

Yes. And I think the net pricing and I think I say this net of variable cost, fixed cost and hedging is positive, which is frankly extremely rare in the career, in my career, okay. And I think having said that the hedging is just helping us to gain time but we are starting now to relook at our pricing, our portfolio, the impact on our customers and the value we create with all transparency. And we look at the mirror, we share the value created more and more. So yeah I mean -- and on gas we are living with less gas. We told you that we have plan for the 32 sites in Europe some of them consume 90% of the gas we are buying in Europe. And for each plant we have mitigation plan. So very ready for the winter.

Karim Hajjar

Now on the second part of your question for the energy business, I'm going to give -- I will give you a bit more color. And I'll start by giving a reminder that the energy business that we have it concentrates expertise that's designed to meet our own needs in Solvay in terms of sourcing and energy hedging as well as CO2. And it also serves the needs of a few external industrial customers particularly in Europe.

Now that expertise gives us really good market access and intel. It is not a speculative activity. That's just as a reminder. Now, the reality is we've had a few losses in the last three quarters from memory. We disclosed those last Q4 when they were quite significant. And we have been taking many, many steps to improve that business, improving controls. We've completed a review of every single third-party contract and explored way to optimize what is a very volatile and challenging market context. We're making good progress. We're not all the way there. There's more to do with some of our customers there.

But frankly what you see here is an improvement. It comes from one thing and one thing alone, painstaking negotiations with customers to adapt contracts to this volatile market situation that we face. And frankly we're pleased with the improvement. I wish, I could say we can repeat every single quarter but this is where we're at. Yeah, I think we have to -- I hope that's clear for you Wim.

Wim Hoste

Yes absolutely. And thank you and congratulations with a very good result progression.

Ilham Kadri

Thank you. Thank you very much, Wim.

Operator

The next question comes from Alex Stewart, Barclays. Sir, please go ahead.

Alex Stewart

Hi, there good afternoon. I just wanted to loop back on this energy cost question, because I think most chemical companies have given some guidance about the increase next year. And Karim I appreciate you don't want to speculate on where energy prices or gas prices will be but you do have a hedge book. So you know what a portion of your energy costs going to be next year compared to what they have been this year. So perhaps on the part of it that you do have visibility, could you possibly give us some sense of the inflation like other companies do? That would be really helpful.

And then the other question is on this PFAS provision because for years I think that Solvay has maintained the line that there was no wrong doing in New Jersey around your site there and there was always a feeling that you felt you hadn't done anything wrong. The fact that you're taking a €100 million fine implies that you have come to the decision there was something wrong and that there will be remediation costs, which is perfectly reasonable and not large in size. But the fact that you've taken costs and that you've accepted some responsibility also now opens you up to the potential for personal injury suits or class action suits relating to the problem that this €93 million is supposed to fix. So if we look past the pure engineering cost to fix the problem as it stands, how do you see the potential for further financial ramifications as a result of this decision you've made? I'd be really interested to hear your views on this. Thanks.

Ilham Kadri

Yeah. It's Alex, right? Do you want to take -- and I will take the…

Karim Hajjar

Yeah. And I'll try to be genuinely as helpful as I can Alex. The question is really important. So rather than just focus only on energy, let me start by looking at variable costs, raw materials, logistics. Everything we're seeing, everything we're reading points to an easing of cost pressures in 2023 compared to 2022 and that's important. The extent of it, time will tell. But certainly when we listen to some of the major shippers, et cetera, there's a debottlenecking, there's easing of the supply chains. So I think the tendency is favorable from a cost point of view.

On energy it really is anyone's guess. But let me tell you what we do. We don't plan on one number we look at scenarios. We simulated our exposure in a €100, €150, €195 or €200 and €250 per megawatt hour cost base. And the outcomes are €0.5 billion different between the high and the low and these are based on TTF natgas pricing.

So that's the degree of uncertainty now because our job is to manage that like we have done in the last 12 months. But can give you scenarios and outcomes with €0.5 billion plus of cost variability. Against that there is some hedging protection more importantly some cost pass-through capability that will help to protect our margins.

Ilham Kadri

Yeah. And before -- I'm going to address the PFAS. But before that just to complete what Karim said, I remind you all that when we renegotiated our contract like in soda ash for example, many, many now have energy pricing structure and clauses in the contract. So that's important to remind everybody.

On the PFAS, let me a bit maybe rewind the story. Remember this is for me just -- and yet another step in our journey. Our first step when I joined the company in 2019 was that we wanted to exit the fluorosurfactants chemistry. This is not regulatory. A push it was our will to really move to non-fluorosurfactant innovation. We launched in 2019 just when -- six months after I joined the company, which led us by the way to stop using it and switch manufacturing in New Jersey department last July 2021 to fluorosurfactants-free technology after qualifying by our customers. So that was really the targets. We doubled down in innovation and frankly extremely pleased with the teams who did that.

Now that we do not use fluorinated surfactants to produce our polymers anymore, we undertook another step, which is a technical study and it explains a bit Alex why the €93 million. We started the technical study and analysis enabling us to better understand and estimate the remediation cost in our New Jersey operations around the plants, which is the €93 million announced today. And this spending by the way, a remediation should take place in the next 20 years period.

So the provision now when you do a technical study obviously by IFRS rules, the provision reflects the estimated future cost of remediation for specific identified activities is expected to accrue over a period of 20 years. Though as a company me leading it, we expect to accelerate such things. So that's -- and we don't expect this expenditure by the way to have any material impact on Solvay's cash generation in the future.

So for me, you know, those are the principles and we are pleased. We can better anticipate the anticipated remediation related to our past use. This is nothing of wrongdoing because everything was regulatory compliant so this is just an anticipated remediation of our past use and we continue obviously to cooperate with the authorities in this topic.

You talked about litigation. Whilst we continue to defend ourselves we won't speculate on how long proceedings will take. But please understand that I cannot discuss any pending litigation. But I remind you, Alex that many US cases relate to firefighting foams and Solvay never manufactured or sold them. And indeed out of the thousands of cases pending in the US only about, I think, 18 claims today named Solvay and we have already been dismissed in all but one of these cases, while others in the industry continue to defend against hundreds of even thousands of these cases.

So I think we are cleaning up this slate. You know it's extremely very clear. Our facts very appreciated by the authorities. And obviously in the view of power of two, we want to get into the split as clean as clear for you as well guys because there's always recurring question there. So I think all of you should take it positive today that we have done a technical study that we have a number linked to this. And obviously I cannot comment on what we are doing beyond that. But as soon as we have more clarity we'll come back to you.

Alex Stewart

Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale. Sir, please go ahead.

Peter Clark

Yes. Good afternoon. It's on the material margin in the third quarter. You, sort of, outlined all the components behind why it's touching 35%, and I'm assuming that Composites must be back at the 29 levels or above. But even so that Specialty Materials probably nearer 40% than 35%. Now I know 3Q is seasonally strong on top of all the other components, but I'm just wondering how we should think about that? Because clearly this is taking it to a new level. I expect you've done a lot of work to get it to a new level but how you see the margin there?

And just a follow-up on the webinar I was on the webinar on the product side. And there was a little discussion on contracts and pricing but not much was disclosed. On the HPPO side of things, my understanding is there is some contract protection there more so than elsewhere in the Peroxides business. If things go a bit dicky perhaps with current or something like that? Those are the two questions. Thank you.

Ilham Kadri

Yes. Thank you, Peter. Yes, on Materials, I think -- very pleased. I told you since 2019 and it was a bold word of crown jewel and they had to demonstrate that. I really believe on the Specialty Polymer side then we can talk about Composite. That -- we were sitting on really jewels in the company unique product.

Nobody has the breadth and the broadest portfolio of unique high-performance polymers on the top of the pyramid for performance. I remind you that Solvay has disengaged and divested PVC Polyamide when I joined the company. So we are really sitting on the top of the pyramid.

The customers they come to us when they need Spec 1 and Spec 2 and Spec 3. So a high temperature resistance, a high-grade resistance and a high wear resistance under the hood application for a piece of metal right replacing a piece of metal next to your motor and engine. So this is a high specialty product and solution so value pricing is key and the value proposition is more than ever strong.

So Peter we started application by application I think we talk about Material one day. I think we should do probably a roadshow with you and invite you to our Bollate or our Spinetta plants in Italy to really show you -- the pieces we produce with our customers the value proposition we bring to them because as soon as you replace a piece of metal, it produces a lower total cost of ownership. So the customer may pay more for our product. But the parts with our polymers cost much less and it enables lightweighting and clean mobility, right?

So I think that's what we try to do. Its value pricing, understanding the value proposition and value pricing and baked by the mega trend, which is electrification and lightweighting and really focus on that. And what happened we may not have told you that, but it was an internal reorganization. When I joined the company Materials was organized as a technology company. So we had aromatics, fluoropolymers and sub products behind this.

But what we changed now since 2021 is that we are markets and sectors, markets organized internally. So we drive our businesses by market we understand automotive better. What do they need? We have key account managers for customers like Bosch and others.

In healthcare it's the same. We understand hemodialysis better what do they need? The same for industrial application growth platform battery. We launched it in 2019 look where we are now. We have a regional strategy, which is being executed by region. So we are really much more educated, much more mindful about what the market needs and our customers' needs. And therefore I think we can extract better value much value and share it with our customers.

On Peroxides, we have leadership position highly competitive assets around the world. We are the only one who can build probably that mega plan to meet solid demand and we will progress. In the future the HPPO plant you talked about it. Yes, we have three megaplants in joint ventures.

We deal typically with long-term contracts with guaranteed margins right? That's given us visibility and stable cash flow. So that's what we talked about with Peter Browning, our President when we did our webinar. And this is good news because it helps us to really see it come in and sit on guaranteed return which give us visibility and help us to continue reinvesting.

The second part of the business is mentioned but obviously as you may know hydrogen peroxide is a key chemical used in many essential industries like aseptic packaging, equipment sterilization, water treatment surface disinfection or hand disinfection. And normally those -- they don't tend to be impacted by economical cycle. So we continue to see resiliency. I'm very, very – we saw the ash peroxide is another very resilient business we have and we like it because we are the best-in-class in terms of process, innovation and simply process leading to have the best competitive assets in the world.

Peter Clark

Got it. Thank you. I remember the trip to Italy by the way. Very impressive. Understood.

Ilham Kadri

Operator

Your last question comes from Geoff of UBS. Please go ahead.

Geoff Haire

Thank you for taking my questions. I just had two questions. First of all, there was a €39 million gain I think from the unwinding of energy hedges in the quarter. Do you expect something similar in the fourth quarter as well? And also just coming back to Karim, the comment on working capital. In an inflationary environment that difference between the balance sheet and the cash flow seems very large. Maybe you could outline how exactly you've managed to do that and whether it's sustainable going forward?

Ilham Kadri

Okay. For you Karim, you got two.

Karim Hajjar

Actually well done for reading Page 21 of our financial report. Not everybody does that, so your question on the €39 million hedging gain is really important. So let me tell you what we're talking about here. We talking about a cash flow hedge derecognition.

Now in Q3, what we did is we adapted some of our hedges because we changed our sourcing of some raw – of some materials including coal because of the disruption to the energy suppliers in Europe, gas curtailments and what have you. And this was motivated by a need to secure alternative sources of energy to underpin our business continuity.

Now when you do that, you can no longer meet the highly probable test, which is what IFRS requires you to do. So as a result, there's no choice now. IFRS requires you to derecognize these impacted hedges and you can't consider them to be cash flow hedges.

Now it's a technical accounting consequence, and it's because the hedges simply can't be cash flow hedges. Now the key here is that it doesn't make a single bit of difference economically to Solvay. Now the hedges were designed to cover our exposures from the third quarter of this year through to the end of 2023. So what have we done?

We've now recognized the full €39 million as not meeting the cash flow hedge definitions and we've taken a small – less than €10 million in the third quarter, which is a benefit the economic benefit that accrued during the quarter and we expect the remainder of that €39 million to accrue to be recognized between now and the end of next year. That's really – I hope that helps but it's to me very high quality and it's purely this accounting technical requirement.

Ilham Kadri

Question on working capital.

Karim Hajjar

On working capital, one of my favorite subjects. Let me just remind you and I think I mentioned it when I did my opening remarks. Benchmarks would point to 17% as a good performance on working capital. Now you've seen us do better than that. You've seen us do between 12.5% and 15%.

Now let me tell you one or two facts, and I'll start with the fact that our working capital has really grown. Now if you look at our total revenue in 2021, it increased from €11.4 billion. And if you take Q3 and annualize it you end up at 17.6% in Q3 this year.

Now if you apply that benchmark of 17% you would expect our working capital to balloon by about €1 billion. Now take that and just hold on to it that €1 billion expectation and see what happened in Solvay. If you look at the evolution of our working capital you're going to see an increase from €1.4 billion to €2.2 billion. In other words, an increase of €0.8 billion. So what does it tell you? It tells you we're doing better than benchmarks. But it also tells you that we're really razor-focused on relenting and are focused on that. And it happened every week we're tracking it. And we're not looking at the big numbers we're looking at the key call it operational KPIs. I look at DSO, which means Days sales outstanding. Look at over dues, top customers, days payable outstanding, days of stock in sales. And it's part of the weekly buyer rhythm and it's driven very hard but in a very consistent disciplined manner.

And those entities those businesses are not fully performing as they expect. Can I say they get quite a lot of constructive encouragement. That's culture the performance, culture the delivery that's doing it. So to your question is it sustainable? Absolutely. If it's doable we'll do it. We're proud of what's been achieved. It takes hard work. It takes unrelenting focus. The one thing that does help is we don't have to push water uphill to achieve it because the bonuses of some of our commercial people and of our business users doesn't just come from achieving profits and but comes from converting the profit into cash and that makes this job a lot a lot easier. So yes, sustainable.

Geoff Haire

The social media giant released an iOS update on Saturday when the changes were originally expected to begin. Anyone who registers for the subscription service will also qualify for a $7.99 price and earn themselves a blue checkmark, a symbol previously only offered to verified users.

The update within the Apple App Store reads, “Power to the people: Your account will get a blue checkmark, just like the celebrities, companies, and politicians you already follow.”

Elon Musk announced the blue check changes after buying the company and firing the executive board.

Musk’s decision to change Twitter’s verification process has received widespread pushback.

During CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, former top cybersecurity official Chris Krebs said the verification subscription plan will lead to “a very chaotic environment,” Nexstar’s The Hill reports.

“It opens the information space to a broader community of influencers, clout chasers, election denialists and [foreign actors],” Krebs explained. “We’ve seen reports lately that Russia, China and Iran are back at their old tricks, and it is going to create a very chaotic environment.”

The Taiwanese army responded to the activities with aircraft in controlled air patrol, naval vessels and land-based missile systems.

""46 PLA aircraft and 4 PLAN vessels around our surrounding region were detected today (Nov. 6, 2022) until 1700(GMT+8). #ROCArmedForces have monitored the situation and responded to these activities with aircraft in CAP, naval vessels, and land-based missile systems,"" the Taiwanese defence ministry tweeted.

Twenty-one of these detected aircraft had flown on the east part of the median line of the Strait and the Southwest Air defence identification zone (ADIZ). The aircraft named by the Taiwanese defence ministry are JH-7, CH-4, SU-30*2, J-11*4, J-16*8, BZK-005, Y-8 ASW*2, KJ-500, WZ-7.

This Chinese activity is not an isolated incident as the Taiwanese defence ministry almost daily report them as occurring.

On Saturday as well 9 People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft and 2 of its naval vessels around Taiwan's surrounding region were detected. The Republic of Armed Forces monitored the situation and responded to these activities.

Moreover, the US senior director of the foundation for the Defence of Democracies Centre on Cyber and Technology Innovation, Mark Montgomery, warned and said that would use cyberattacks rather than its military against Taipei, Taipei Times reported citing Voice of America's Chinese-language Web site.

Voice of America's Chinese language updated its website and quoted Montgomery as saying that Beijing might try to use cyber tools to destroy Taiwan's satellite communications, according to Taipei Times.

He further said that the US assistance would involve researching critical infrastructure, finding vulnerabilities, and devising ways to protect against them. Montgomery was one of the authors of a report titled The Attack on America's Future: Cyber-Enabled Economic Warfare, which was published on Friday by the US Help Needed foundation.

According to Taipei Times, the report said that the US must work with allies to defend against cyberattacks by aggressive nations. ""Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure could disrupt a US military mobilization in defence of or interfere with other military operations by China's adversaries,"" the report said, citing information from James Mulvenon's book The People's Liberation Army in the Information Age.

aims to control the global information and communications infrastructure, the report added. ""Altogether, China has implemented a coherent long-term strategy to control key nodes in the global economy and communications infrastructure -- all at the expense of the United States and its allies,"" the report said.

Meanwhile, US Undersecretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Policy, and Plans, Robert Silvers said that global infrastructure may witness risks of using the Chinese telecommunications equipment

At an event hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and Studies think tank on the topic of cybersecurity, Silvers said he and other US officials have urged other countries to avoid using Chinese telecommunications equipment as it could impact the information world, reported Taipei Times.

""It may be that the Chinese-controlled technology is the cheapest available, but it may also be that that's not the final bill to arrive,"" Silvers said. ""What happens five years, 10 years down the road when the government of the People's Republic of China can pull the rug out from under your entire society?"" he added

The tension between China and Taiwan has intensified, ever since Tsai Ing-wen took over the presidency of the island nation in 2016. Under her rule, Taiwan has gotten close to the US in developing submarine technology to strengthen its military, Geopolitica reported.

And after that White House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan further intensified the tension. China conducted large-scale military drills in August, it designated exercise areas near the Taiwanese ports of Taipei and Kaohsiung. Chinese forces fired 11 ballistic missiles during the drills, and there was a non-zero risk that one could have landed outside these zones.

Last month, Medibank went public with news that it suffered a cyber incident. Turns out it was a lot worse than Medibank first thought and, with the data on 9.7 million customers now caught up in the massive breach.

The private health insurer told shareholders on October 12 it had fallen victim to a ‘cyber incident’. It said that in response to this incident, the organisation took immediate steps to contain it, and engaged specialised cybersecurity firms.

At the time, Medibank said there was no evidence that any sensitive data, including customer data, has been accessed in the cyber attack.

On October 17, it reaffirmed that after ongoing investigations, there was still no evidence customer data had been removed from its IT environment. It also emerged that Medibank was the victim of a ransomware extortion attempt, with the word ‘ransom’ hidden within the organisation’s messaging. But on October 19, things had taken an Optus-like turn.

In a statement issued via the ASX on October 19, Medibank said it has received messages from a group that “wishes to negotiate with the company regarding their alleged removal of customer data”. This negotiation was the hackers threatening to release the private medical information of high-profile Australians if a ransom isn’t paid.

On October 20, Medibank said the Australian Federal Police was investigating the incident as a crime as data on its customers was confirmed breached. Then, on October 26, Medibank confirmed every one of its customers had their data breached – the private health insurer has 3.9 million customers (not including its brands).

However, on November 7, Medibank divulged just how bad things actually were.

“Given the nature of this crime, we now believe that all of the customer data accessed could have been taken by the criminal,” it said.

In a statement issued to the ASX, Medibank said it believes the criminal has accessed the name, date of birth, address, phone number and email address for around 9.7 million current and former customers and some of their authorised representatives. This figure represents around 5.1 million Medibank customers, around 2.8 million ahm customers and around 1.8 million international customers.

It believes the criminal also accessed Medicare numbers (but not expiry dates) for ahm customers, passport numbers (but not expiry dates) and visa details for international student customers and accessed health claims data for around 160,000 Medibank customers, around 300,000 ahm customers and around 20,000 international customers. Additionally, around 5,200 My Home Hospital (MHH) patients have had some personal and health claims data accessed and around 2,900 next of kin of these patients have had some contact details accessed.

Health provider details, including names, provider numbers and addresses, are among the data accessed in the breach, Medibank said.

Despite this, Medibank said the criminal did not access primary identity documents, such as driver’s licences, for Medibank and ahm resident customers. Credit card and banking details are also apparently safe.

Regarding this whole ransom thing, however, Medibank said it’s not paying.

“No ransom payment will be made to the criminal responsible for this data theft,” the statement reads.

“Based on the extensive advice we have received from cybercrime experts we believe there is only a limited chance paying a ransom would ensure the return of our customers’ data and prevent it from being published. In fact, paying could have the opposite effect and encourage the criminal to directly extort our customers, and there is a strong chance that paying puts more people in harm’s way by making Australia a bigger target,” Medibank CEO David Koczkar added.

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) is making preliminary inquiries with Medibank to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme, but in the meantime, Medibank said it has “a comprehensive support package” for customers who have had their data stolen. This includes financial support for customers who are in a uniquely vulnerable position as a result of this crime (they will be supported on an individual basis), free identity monitoring services for customers who have had their primary ID compromised and reimbursement of fees for re-issue of identity documents that have been fully compromised in this crime.

Medibank is also offering all customers access to identity protection advice and resources from IDCARE and Medibank’s mental health and wellbeing support line. You can reach out if you’re concerned about the cyber attack or need to do Medibank-related things, by calling 13 23 31 or visiting Medibank’s dedicated webpage.

Timothy McGrath

Thank you, Samantha. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Connection's Q3 2022 conference call. I'll begin this afternoon with an overview of our third quarter results, highlights of our performance and share our updated thoughts on our business and the remainder of 2022. Tom will then walk us through a more detailed look at our financials.

We delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute well against our strategic objectives. During the quarter, our customers focus started to shift from rollouts of endpoint devices and related technology to digital transformation, data center modernization, cloud optimization and security solutions. More than ever before, customers look at Connection to solve their complex technology needs and guide them through their technology initiatives with our broad-based capabilities.

Gross profit grew 13.2% year-over-year as a result of the shift in customer demand, while net sales grew 3.2% over a previous record revenue performance in the third quarter of 2021. Our gross margins grew 155 basis points to a record 17.6% in the quarter compared to 16.1% in the prior year. These results demonstrate the continued execution of our business strategy to connect our customers with technology that enhances their growth, elevate their productivity and empower their innovation.

The technology and solutions that we provide are highly valued by our customers. As we look forward, we believe that these products and services will continue to be essential in helping our customers to achieve their business objectives with technology and automation. The Business Solutions segment grew 12.2%, while the Enterprise and Public Sector segment declined 1.4% and 3.7%, respectively. Our Enterprise and Public Sector segment experienced an increased level of sales of software and services recognized as revenue on a net basis which placed downward pressure on net sales.

As we've pointed out in the past, we believe gross profit is the best indicator of our true growth. Gross profit improved 13.2% on a consolidated basis compared to the prior year quarter. We achieved a record gross margin rate in the quarter of 17.6% compared to 16.1% in the prior year quarter. Our focus and ability to execute our plans to drive more advanced technology solutions contributed to this 155 basis point margin improvement.

As customers complete their build-out of endpoint solutions, budgets are now being allocated more heavily toward data center, software and services. We continue to invest in our managed service capabilities, and we are experiencing a strong growth for our solutions as customers are focused on the need to improve security, increase productivity, manage costs and modernize their infrastructure. We also experienced strong growth in our vertical markets, and we delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in our finance and health care markets with growth rates of 40% and 14%, respectively.

During the quarter, we saw improvements in our supply chain, which resulted in a decrease in our backlog compared to last year as well as sequentially. However, our backlog remains elevated. We expect some challenges will remain through at least the balance of the year and into 2023.

Now let's discuss our Q3 performance in a little greater detail. Operating income in Q3 was $31.7 million, an increase of 16.1% or 4.1% of net sales compared to $27.3 million or 3.6% of net sales in the prior year quarter. In Q3 2022, our diluted earnings per share was $0.88, an increase of 15.4% from $0.76 in Q3 2021. We ended Q3 with $116.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.

Now we'll look a little deeper into segment performance. In our Business Solutions segment, our Q3 net sales of $315.8 million, an increase of 12.2% compared to $281.4 million a year ago. Gross profit in the Business Solutions segment was $63.3 million, an increase of 15.7% from a year ago. Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 20% in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in demand for software and services recognized as revenue on a net basis.

We saw an increase in demand for software, networking and data center products. The increase in software and services demand is a result of more customers shifting their business to subscription services, cybersecurity and off-premise cloud solutions, along with other cost-saving technologies. In our Public Sector Solutions business, Q3 net sales were $154.4 million, a decrease of 3.7% compared to $160.2 million a year ago. Sales to state and local government and education institutions were $130.3 million, a decrease of 2.6% compared to the prior year, while sales for the federal government decreased 9.1% year-over-year.

Gross profit for the Public Sector segment was $25.1 million, an increase of 23.3% compared to Q3 '21. Gross margin increased by 356 basis points to 16.3% in the quarter. As our customers transition from on-premise solutions to off-premise and cloud solutions, the recognition of revenue on a net basis puts downward pressure on revenue while generating increased gross margins. In our Enterprise Solutions segment, Q3 net sales were $305.5 million, a decrease of 1.4% compared to $309.7 million a year ago.

Gross profit for the Enterprise segment was $48.3 million, an increase of 5.7% compared to the prior year quarter. Gross margin increased by 106 basis points to a record 15.8%, primarily driven by enterprise customers' business-driven need for cloud and data center solutions. I'll now turn the call over to Tom to discuss additional financial highlights from our income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. Tom?

Thomas Baker

Thanks, Tim. SG&A increased 110 basis points to 13.5% of net sales in the quarter compared to 12.4% in the prior year quarter. Approximately 75% of the increase in this rate is solely due to the increase in sales of products, which are recognized as revenue on a net basis. On a dollar basis, SG&A increased $11.5 million compared to the prior year quarter. In addition to the impact inflation continues to have on wages, there was also incremental increase in SG&A resulting from increased variable compensation due to higher levels of gross profit.

We have also continued to make investments in incremental headcount focused on building our technical and sales organization as well as increased marketing spend. Q3 operating income was $31.7 million, up 16.1% this quarter from $27.3 million a year ago. Our effective tax rate was 27.6%, up from 26.6% in the same period a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $23.2 million, an increase of 15.8% from $20 million a year ago.

Diluted earnings per share was $0.88, an increase of 15.4% from the prior year period. Our trailing 12-month adjusted earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA, was $145.5 million compared to $102.4 million a year ago, an increase of 42%. Cash flow generated from operations for the first 9 months of 2022 was $15.7 million compared to $8.8 million in the same period a year ago. The increase in cash flow from operations reflect higher levels of earnings offset by increases in both accounts receivable and inventory as well as a decrease in accounts payable.

I'd like to take a moment to discuss a few components of our working capital trends in the past quarter. DSO increased to 69 days from 64 days at the end of 2021. The increase is a function of netted products recorded in accounts receivable on a gross basis, while the revenue is reported on a net basis. Inventories increased by $3.1 million versus the end of 2021. This increase was driven by our Enterprise segment, which has purchased inventory in advance of large project rollouts, offset by our ongoing inventory reduction plan. Our accounts payable balance declined $23.3 million for the first 9 months of 2022. Our net cash used in investing activities of $7 million for the first 9 months of 2022 was primarily the result of equipment purchases and IT initiatives that will drive future efficiencies.

I will now turn the call back over to Tim to discuss current market trends.

Timothy McGrath

Thanks, Tom. I want to take a few moments to review some of the highlights of our business. Our growth in Q3 is largely attributable to the customized IT solutions that we integrate and deliver on behalf of our customers as they continue to work through their digital transformation and efforts to gain competitive advantage with technology.

Our customers look to Connection to integrate and deliver these innovative solutions. Toward that end, we continue to leverage our managed services capability as customers turn their attention toward data centers, infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives. Our years of experience with supply chain optimization and our ability to deliver custom integrated solutions continue to be an important component of our growth and a competitive differentiator for us.

Our growth was also attributed to our expertise in delivering customized solutions to our vertical markets. For example, in the finance vertical, we grew revenue 40% year-over-year and 12% sequentially as our customers were upgrading legacy hardware and focusing on securing their environment. Manufacturing revenue grew 3% year-over-year as clients focus on increasing automation and process integration as well as long-term investment in new technologies to support cybersecurity, risk reduction and growth opportunities.

Revenue in Healthcare grew 14% year-over-year, driven by post-pandemic technology refreshes and new investments in traditional and new patient care delivery models.

Looking forward to the remainder of 2022, we believe customers want to manage costs while leveraging technology for greater efficiency and as an enabler for competitive advantage. We expect our customers will continue to focus on data center, security and cloud transformation. We anticipate this trend will continue in the near term and will put pressure on top line revenue growth as it did this quarter. Last quarter, we indicated that year-over-year growth rates would be moderating, which they did. We expect that trend to continue for the near term. These expectations are in part due to record results recorded in the prior year period. Additionally, our customers are telling us that they're being more deliberate in sending and are being more restrictive on budget in the face of increasing economic uncertainty.

That being said, we believe we'll end the year with growth at 3% to 5% above the IT industry growth rate, and we will continue to take market share. We remain focused on helping our customers achieve their productivity and efficiency goals while keeping them secure and connected in this uncertain economic environment. I'd like to take a moment to thank our valued employees for their continued effort and extraordinary dedication during this rapidly changing environment. We will now entertain your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James.

Adam Tindle

Tim, I want to maybe start with the last comments that you were making there. That was very helpful. When you say 3% to 5% above the IT industry for 2022, could you help us with what you're thinking of as the IT industry growth rate and maybe even simpler, I think it's going to imply that Q4 revenues might be down year-over-year. I just want to make sure that we're getting the model right based on the commentary you're making on Q4.

Timothy McGrath

Yes. Well, thanks, Adam. Yes, I think that's right. I think that, obviously, if you look at our growth rate year-to-date, we've had a pretty good year. We do see that moderating a little bit in Q4, and we think we can take some market share. So I think exiting the year at 3% to 5% above market is still well within our reach.

Thomas Baker

Yes. And if we baseline that, I think we're thinking 3% to 4% base growth rate, so you're kind of looking at 8%, 9% for the full year.

Adam Tindle

Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And Tom, as we experienced maybe some of this slowing here, I'm wondering what -- how we think about margins moving forward, particularly as we try to model 2023. Sounds like we might have some continued challenges on top line. You're going to roll into some really difficult comparisons in Q1 and Q2, and I would imagine top line might even be flat or down in Q1 and Q2. If so, feel free to clarify if that's not the case. But if so, how we think about the margin trajectory moving forward as well.

Thomas Baker

I mean there's a few moving pieces in there, right? The growth in the services and cloud has certainly had a material effect on our margins this quarter, right? So question 1 is, how does that continue going forward? If you just look at the margin percentage, that's why we continue to try to stay focused on what's our gross profit growth rate because that's kind of the important thing.

Now that being said, if you take the mix out of it, I think we should be able to hold our historical margins on hardware. As you can see from the numbers, the endpoint spending was down a little this quarter compared to last year. And I think we kind of expect that to continue at least into Q4. And as we roll into next year, I'm thinking we can probably hold our historical margin rates on the endpoint equipment and the data, the storage. But it's going to -- it's really going to be the wildcard in terms of reported margins is how do those services in cloud and that 100% margin product roll through the P&L.

Timothy McGrath

We're pretty optimistic on that. We're seeing incredibly strong growth rates in our cloud, our CSP and our software business in general, that's quarters on a net basis, which does drive that margin rate up.

Adam Tindle

Got it. Just one more for me. Tim, as you look at your pipeline and hear from your sales force as we're sitting here in November, we've got the month of December coming out, it typically tends to be the corporate budget flush month. And I'm just wondering what you're hearing qualitatively or anything that you could support with the metrics that you look at on what the budget flush might ultimately look like in 2023.

Timothy McGrath

So that is a great question, Adam. We are a little conservative on that. Just talked to a number of customers who, in some cases, they're still waiting for data center equipment and some of the advanced technology solutions. So to the extent that, that is still constrained, a lot of that could be pushed into 2023. And as you know, endpoints are slowing down. But generally speaking, many of the projects that we're involved in now are truly mission critical, and we feel pretty confident that we're going to meet our expectation and deliver our forecast.

Operator

And our next question comes from Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti.

Anthony Lebiedzinski

So first in terms of the implied 4Q sales projections that you have, I mean how much of that is because of the mix of business shifting more toward software users or the impact of netting versus just the impact from slower demand because of the macro environment?

Timothy McGrath

Well, thanks, Anthony. It's good to hear from you. So Tom?

Thomas Baker

I would say, I mean we're clearly seeing a little bit of a pullback in some of the hardware categories, Anthony, especially on the endpoint devices. So there is some of that, I think, baked in there. And we did have a really nice Q4 last year. But the vast majority of the pressure is coming from all the software and services coming through on a net basis. So it's I think it's more of the accounting and the net software, but there is some underlying demand softness coming.

Timothy McGrath

Anthony, what that looks like for us is our mid-market and commercial business has been very strong with our enterprise business. We are hearing as you're hearing out there in the industry that customers are, in some cases, asking for an additional signature. In some cases, they're delaying. But at the end of the day, we still feel very confident.

Anthony Lebiedzinski

Got it. Okay. So overall, I think to your point, it sounds like your gross profit should certainly increase, I guess, in Q4, even though the reported revenue will be maybe not as good because of all this netting. So is that fair to say that you would expect your gross profit dollars to be up in the fourth quarter?

Timothy McGrath

Okay, I'll start and then I'll let Tom jump in. But clearly, we're seeing that mix shift into integrated solutions, and we're seeing as a part of that, a lot of cloud, a lot of cybersecurity and a lot of software. And as you know, all of that is -- most of that is recorded on a net basis and that, of course, does drive gross margins up.

Thomas Baker

Yes. I think to answer your question directly, Anthony, I think the jury is still out on that. It's going to be nip and tuck, I think.

Anthony Lebiedzinski

Can you hear me guys?

Timothy McGrath

Yes, we can hear you now.

Anthony Lebiedzinski

Okay. Sorry, there's a long pause there. Okay. And I guess my last question, I guess, is obviously, you made progress with your inventories versus your second quarter, so cash flow improved. So what would you say is your reasonable goal for your year-end inventories? And if you could just also touch on your cash flow priorities, that would be great.

Thomas Baker

So I think on the inventory, Anthony, a lot of it's just going to depend on how the supply chain frees up. We did see an improvement this quarter, and our goal is to continue to drive that number down. Now that being said, we do have a couple of very large projects that are coming up. And I think a lot of it is going to depend on how that inventory comes in right at the end of the year. We can push it out to Q1. I think it's 1 thing, we're talking $30 million, $40 million here. So it's going to depend on the timing of the supply chain. But all else being equal, we should be able to drive down another $10-ish million, I think.

Timothy McGrath

And also to put that in perspective, Anthony, our inventory levels are lower than last year, as we mentioned. But compared to ordinary levels, they're significantly elevated.

Anthony Lebiedzinski

Right. And then in terms of your cash flow priorities?

Timothy McGrath

Yes. So we're kind of sticking to our guns there, Anthony. We are -- have an approved share buyback in place, and we'll be looking at that. We also have made some upgrades to our system. We've made some upgrades to our senior staff. And as you know, our balance sheet is clean and our powder is dry and we're also continually looking at additional opportunities that could tuck in and enhance our capabilities and specific solution areas. Right now, I'm open to the idea of doing tuck-in acquisitions.

Operator

And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tim McGrath for closing remarks.

Timothy McGrath

Thanks, Justin. I'd like to thank all of our customers, vendor partners for their dedication through this time. I'd also like to thank those of you listening to our call this afternoon. Your time and interest in Connection are appreciated. Have a great evening.

Operator

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to BGSF Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Bailey, and I'll be the moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

Now I will turn the call over to Sandy Martin, Three Part Advisors. Please go ahead.

Sandy Martin

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the BGSF third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me on the call today are Beth Garvey, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Hollenbach, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. As noted, today's call is being webcast live. A replay will be available later today and also archived on the company's Investor Relations page.

Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions made by BGSF under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties, including those listed in the company's filings with the SEC. Management's statements are made as of today, November 3, 2022, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements publicly, even if new information becomes available in the future. During the call, management will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which can be useful in evaluating the company's operations related to the financial condition and results. These non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement GAAP financial information and should not be considered a substitute. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are provided in today's earnings press release.

I'll now turn the call over to Beth Garvey. Beth?

Beth Garvey

Thank you, Sandy, and thank you all for joining BGSF third quarter 2022 earnings call.

I am pleased to report that the momentum we experienced in the first half of 2022 continued through the third quarter. We reported record revenues for the third quarter totaling $78.5 million, up 22.3% year-over-year.

Our Professional segment accounted for 58% of consolidated revenues with notable strength primarily on the IT side with business investments continuing in cloud migration, ERP selection and implementations. We also experienced growth in our managed services and consulting areas.

Our Real Estate segment continues to expand and accounted for 42% of revenues. As we discussed last quarter, the multifamily industry is significantly underbuilt in the National Apartment Association and National Multifamily Housing Council estimate that 600,000 apartment homes are needed today in the U.S.

It is also estimated that the U.S. is underbuilt by 4.3 million units by 2035, which has been accelerating primarily due to the pandemic and further demographic shifts. People today in all ages and categories are choosing to live in apartments, multifamily housing or ringing single-family homes are no longer a transitional housing option.

Alternatively, people are deciding that apartments and build-to-rent communities are desirable solution for long-term housing. These strong tailwinds have contributed to BGSF's market leadership position in the multifamily industry over the last couple of years. We recognize that long-term pent-up demand exists, and we are seeing strong new demand for apartments and build-to-rent single-family housing communities across North America. Our real estate division is strategically focused across the U.S., opening in six snow key markets this year, including our recent expansion into Canada.

Finally, recall that we experienced unseasonably strong real estate segment performance in Q4 of 2021. We think this activity was driven by pent-up demand that started during COVID lockdowns, coupled with landlord spending again. Last year's strength creates tougher comparisons for us in the fourth quarter of this year.

With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to walk through our financial results in more detail for the quarter, then I'll wrap up the call with some comments on how we see our markets changing and BGSF plans for delivering unique workforce solutions for current and future customer needs, strategic initiatives and M&A.

Dan?

Dan Hollenbach

Thank you, Beth, and good morning, everyone.

Based on the sale of our Industrial segment this year, our financial results discussed today are from continuing operations and except where noted, exclude discontinued operations for this year and last year.

As Beth discussed, strong momentum continued into the third quarter with revenue up 22.3% to $78.5 million compared to $21 million by segment, real estate grew 34.1% and professional increased 14.9%. Wage rates have been relatively flat through the year, yet increased 10% Q-over-Q.

In addition to year-over-year improvements, both segments showed sequential growth between Q2 and Q3. Real estate revenues grew 11% and professional segment revenues increased 3%. The professional segment revenue growth was impacted by strong double-digit growth in IT and Momentum Solutions.

We continue to expect solid demand for pod migration, ERP selection and implementation as well as customizations. As Beth mentioned, we believe digital transformation and enterprise modernization work are both strong and business investments in these areas will continue.

Although managed services are a small but growing component of the professional segment, we had an 85% growth in this business Q-over-Q, which grew out of our Momentum Solutions acquisition in February of '21. Gross profit increased by a strong 27% compared to the prior year quarter, growing to $28 million, primarily due to revenue expansion and increased spread in both segments. As a percent of revenue, total gross profit increased 140 basis points to 35.7%.

Positive operating leverage continued in selling, general and administrative expenses, which improved by 60 basis points to 26% of revenue. SG&A dollars increased $3.3 million or 19.5%, which compared favorably late to our revenue growth. Third quarter net income from continuing ops was $4.7 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared to net income of $3.7 million or $0.36 per diluted share a year ago. Included in '21 net income was a $974,000 impact on a gain from contingent consideration.

Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $8 million or 10.2% of revenues compared to $5.4 million or 8.4% of revenues in '21. We are excited to report the 10.2% adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter as we work towards our strategy to enhance returns after the divestiture earlier this year.

Our Q3 effective rate was 23.6% for '22 compared to 19.4% in last year's third quarter. Turning to year-to-date results. Revenues were $221.1 million, up 29.1% while gross profit was $76.5 million, up 33%. Our first nine months’ gross profit percent increased 100 basis points to 34.6%, while SG&A operating leverage improved by 130 basis points this year compared to last.

Net income from continuing operations was $9.8 million or $0.93 per diluted share compared to $6.1 million or $0.59 per diluted share for the '21 period. Included in '21 net income was a $2 million impact from a gain on contingent consideration.

Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations totaled $17.4 million or 7.9% of revenue compared to $9.9 million or 5.8% of revenue last year. The year-to-date effective tax from continuing operations was 24.5% compared to 17.9% for last year. Regarding the company's financial position, we continue to maintain a strong liquidity position and balance sheet.

Days sales outstanding improved by one day from year-end, and our working capital ratio strengthened to 2.98 from 1.95 at year-end. Based on the strength in our business, through the first nine months, we used more working capital to grow, which resulted in net cash used in continuing operation activities of $5.6 million.

We continue to maintain a conservative leverage ratio of funded debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA from continued operations of 1.2x as of the September balance sheet date. Silos Board of Directors approved our 32nd consecutive quarterly dividend payment of $0.15 per share in support of our strategic initiatives.

We believe that our prudent financial management and capital allocation strategy will continue to provide ample flexibility to fund operations, make strategic acquisitions and invest for future growth while returning value to our shareholders through cash dividends and stock appreciation.

I will now turn the call back to Beth.

Beth Garvey

Thank you, Dan.

Our teams are energized around our strategic BGSS programs and we view changing market dynamics, pandemics and inflationary recessionary pressures as the best time to think outside the box and provide creative solutions to our customers. That is how we've been able to win market share and enable our leaders to create meaningful differentiators for both our professional and real estate segments.

BGSF unique model empowers people and creates long-term relationships with both customers and our workforce. With the U.S. job openings training at almost all-time high, coupled with unemployment rates at record lows, especially for those with college degrees at 1.8% unemployment rate, we've decided to change the game.

We offer our people training platforms to either upscale or reskill their talent. By using specialized training modules, we are advancing both the professional and real estate segment with a more robust and skilled talent pool. These training platforms or Sandbox experiences also allow existing and future BGSF workers to learn a new field or specialization. They build important staff loyalty and retention for both our customers and our associates.

This is important on the professional side with Oracle or Workday experts and on the real estate side, with new leasing office personnel or property maintenance techs, developing new diverse highly-skilled candidates for managed services, consulting and perm placement creates a flywheel effect on the business because clients today are more likely to hire BGSF for other projects and services tomorrow.

This has proven to work very well for us. Although we are not amending to recessionary pressures, we have continued to execute with excellence in our markets and have a proven track record of managing through past down cycles. In addition, our divestiture of the Light Industrial business makes us less vulnerable to cyclical headwinds, and we benefit from our specialization in professional and real estate segments, which operate many times from different business environments.

The pandemic introduced unprecedented events to the businesses in North America and corporate response to those events give us confidence today that customers are not likely to pull on IT investments for important cloud migrations or ERP projects.

For what we have experienced, coupled with prevailing housing trends, we believe that the real estate segment is more recession-resistant and will greatly benefit from our client partnerships. We remain optimistic about the GSS growth prospects as we get closer to 2023, and we believe that our business will continue to be driven by strength in our people, technology, reputation, business model and client partnerships.

A few fiber words concerning our M&A work. Deal flow continues to be strong and valuations have softened somewhat. Our focus remains on the evaluation of strategic bolt-on acquisitions, and we are actively looking for transactions both in North America and a few globally. Also, we continue to seek business and technologies that could strongly fit for our customers and our culture. With that said, that concludes our prepared remarks for the third quarter.

We will now open the call for questions. Operator?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from the line of Howard Halpern from Taglich Brothers. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Howard Halpern

Thank you. And congratulations. Great quarter, great year so far.

Dan Hollenbach

Thanks, Howard.

Howard Halpern

First question is in regards to, I guess, real estate. And what really drove the gross margin above that 40% level, the first time we've seen that in its history.

Dan Hollenbach

Yes. So interesting enough, Normally, in the third quarter, it's tough to maintain that because that's normally their highest volume and they tend to have a little bit of pressure on pay to keep our people working, but did a much better job of managing that this year, and we're able to pass through that cost to the customers and help support that spread increase.

Howard Halpern

Okay. Is that something that you're going to be able to maintain that? Or it's going to fluctuate again, depending on the volume that you have going forward?

Beth Garvey

Howard, I think there's another piece of that along with what Dan said, and that's the fact that we've got some strategic relationships we have right now and with that comes from direct hire. So that direct tire will also push up the margin. And right now, we don't feel like there's a reason for us not to think we can't maintain it based on the pipeline of activity we have right now.

Dan Hollenbach

Their perm revenue almost doubled Q -over- Q. So yes. Thanks.

Howard Halpern

And have you laid out, and I know you've opened what number of offices you said you were so far -- is there a plan or a hint of how many new offices or split offices you're going to have heading into next year?

Beth Garvey

We're in the process of doing our budgets right now. So we're identifying new opportunities for the future. So I think it's kind of early for me to answer that because there's some -- let me -- there definitely will be office openings that would definitely be expansion in the markets we're in. We just haven't nailed that that's complete.

Howard Halpern

Okay. And you talked about essentially your partnerships because you announced an inner interplay and developing your talent pool. Has that actually begun? Or is that in the process of being developed to begin at a certain point?

Beth Garvey

It has begun. We just finished the pilot program. We found it to be successful. And now we are working with Interplay to expand that throughout our markets.

Howard Halpern

Okay. And do you believe you'll be able to -- all right. And I guess that was the thought process in developing these partnerships?

Beth Garvey

Howard, I'm sorry, you cut out. We missed half of what you said.

Howard Halpern

Sorry. With the partnerships that you are developing and the deficit in housing going forward for the segment that you're in. I mean, is this ex forward thinking that you have in play to maintain the -- I mean to get new employees basically to have the talent pool once those -- if the housing deficit ever begins to close. Obviously, it's I guess, it's all about the talent pool, correct? That's what you're driving for.

Beth Garvey

It is. And we -- the shortage were in the workforce right now is something that's painful for everybody. So we really strategically spend a lot of time figuring out we can either sit back and be like everybody else and wait for it to hopefully get better or we can start really aggressively moving forward, and we've decided to aggressively move forward so we are upskilling and reskilling people. So we're creating a group of people who not only we can end up helping place for ourselves with our customers, we're helping our customers upscale their work as well, their workers as well.

Howard Halpern

Okay. And just one last one on professional services. You're seeing a robust pipeline from your customers for projects and still maintaining some of the cross-selling opportunities that you previously talked about?

Beth Garvey

Absolutely. We signed more new contracts and added more logos, which we call as a company in third quarter than in the history of the company.

Howard Halpern

Okay, guys, keep up the great work.

Operator

Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Brian Kinstlinger from Alliance Global Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Brian Kinstlinger

Good morning. Nice quarter. And thanks for taking my question. First, many of the IT services on--Just many of the IT services companies are talking about a slowdown in growth in budgets are pressuring sorry, budgets are being pressured and therefore, progress has been delayed. The only real area of strength is digital transformation. I didn't hear such comments from you, other than you're not immune to recessionary pressures. So can you touch on changes in the pipeline, sales cycles and whether you're experiencing any of those trends?

Beth Garvey

Right now, we are not experiencing a slowdown. I think the only area we might have a little bit is in direct hire. I think some of the customers are taking a little bit longer to make a decision on that. But in all the other areas of our business, we're not feeling it. And we still have many RFPs that are in the works right now.

Brian Kinstlinger

Great to hear. And then can you talk about spreads on the IT staffing side. How are they being impacted? And I guess, how are they historically have they been impacted during recessionary periods.

Dan Hollenbach

Well, Q-over-Q spreads in the professional side were up 17%, primarily because of the strategic direction to shift our model from lower type roles to more consulting type roles. And with the addition of Momentum Solutions, which is a managed service product where we help our customers through the whole project phase. So that's been a driver of that spread increase as well as the average bill rate is up dramatically. It Fila shift towards a consulting model.

Brian Kinstlinger

Great. My last question is, you touched on M&A. You also touched on office openings in strategic lesions where you want to expand or open up? Will M&A possibly play a role in that -- those office openings if not, do you expect in the early time frame of next year, there will be a little bit of pressure on margins as you open offices ahead of business? Just how do you think about each of those. Thank you so much.

Dan Hollenbach

On the M&A side where we're focused on the professional side. So it does impact the opening of territories or offices on the real estate side because that's where the focus is on that. -- that's -- we did have -- we have a robust M&A pipeline. We're probably have seen about 100 deals. We continue to remain interested in a couple of those.

And we fully expect M&A to be a part of our ongoing growth model. Yes. And when I think as Beth has mentioned on calls before, when we opened a new territory or a new market, if you will, for real estate, really talk about adding a salesperson. So there's no brick-and-mortar or anything like that. And generally, you can get 10 to 15 people working in a 3- or 4-month period and the return on that is pretty quick.

Brian Kinstlinger

Understood. Thank you so much.

Operator

Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Jeff Martin from ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Jeff Martin

Thank you. Good morning Beth and Dan. I was hoping, Beth, you could give us some maybe some discussion maybe some key performance indicators relating to your technology investment and IT road map. I would imagine one of those is openings versus fill rates and time to fill those sorts of things. Just curious what you're experiencing and if you think that's contributing to the nice growth that you're seeing.

Beth Garvey

I don't think we're seeing a whole lot of the efficiencies, as I've said in the past, we really think that we'll start seeing major efficiencies due to the technology and going into the first quarter. However, I will say that we are seeing efficiencies in the professional group was how quickly they can get things moving in the process. So they're doing more revenue with less people than they were a year ago.

And so we feel that that's positive. But we're still saying a lot of the KPIs and what the growth projections can be and getting the efficiencies. Remembering we just went live at the end of June. We're still in hyper care, which we're hoping to come out of hyper care by Thanksgiving. And then we really -- we have a pretty robust KPI dashboard that we are building right now to be able to really kind of see where we are.

But to your point, we are doing fill ratios, time to fill, what's the sales pipeline going to give us, how quickly do we close the deal, we should be able to do some projections in whatever is in the funnel, what percentage we think will kick out from -- so we'll be able to do a lot more financial plan in the future.

Jeff Martin

Okay. Great. And then I was curious on the professional side, if you're seeing extended assignment duration, people are being put to work on projects that go longer, does that increase the visibility of the segment for a better period of time?

Beth Garvey

We do have several long-term customers where we have people that are -- were -- they've outsourced their whole project or their whole IT department to us. So the rest of them are probably and is still running in the 7- to 9-month project range depending on what the implementation or projects we're working on. So we're still running about the way we always have.

Jeff Martin

Okay. Great. And then last question on the market in cybersecurity. There's a massive labor shortage in cybersecurity, and that's going to be probably a hot segment for many years to come. I was just curious if you're doing anything in cybersecurity now and if that's a focus strategically for you going forward?

Beth Garvey

We are. We do have a lot of security folks that are data security folks that are working within our divisions. One of the other things we'll be able to get out of our technology is we're going to start being able to separate how much of the business is in SAP, how much of it is in Oracle or Workday or Service Now or what -- so we do have it. It is -- you're definitely right. It is something that everybody talks about. It is something that our teams are constantly working on filling and doing a really good job in providing those resources to our customers.

Dan Hollenbach

It is on our wish Yes. It's on our wish list for -- on the M&A side as well, Jeff. So as we talk to our partners out there who are in the market on the broker side, that's certainly -- we would love to find a cyber-company-- consulting company on the M&A side.

Jeff Martin

Great. Great. And then one more if I could. With entry for real estate in Canada. I was just curious how you think about that market in terms of longer-term opportunity relative to the U.S. market?

Beth Garvey

We're pretty optimistic about the Toronto area, and we're going to see how that pans out before we start looking at other provinces in Canada. And all indicators are it should be beneficial for us.

Jeff Martin

Great. Thanks for taking the questions.

Operator

Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Bruce Geller from Geller Ventures. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Bruce Geller

Hi, good morning, guys. Congratulations on the impressive earnings progress. I have a question related to the M&A discussion. You mentioned that earnings multiples are getting a little bit more reasonable, which is favorable. But I'm curious how you adjust for or address the fact that the Fed's clearly stated intention is to weaken the job market in order to get inflation under control. So with that said, some of the multiples or valuations you're looking at maybe based on inflated trailing earnings, which are at risk of a weakening job market again since that is a clear intent of the Fed. So how do you adjust for that in evaluating a potential acquisition?

Dan Hollenbach

Well, we do look at that, and we try and go in and understand certainly, if we get into an active deal, we spent a lot of time on due diligence to ensure the validity certainly of the numbers. There are still -- the last number I saw, 10 million open jobs out there. So even if you cut that back by 20%, there's still 8 million jobs. So -- and in the world that we work in, sort of higher-end accounting, IT consulting side, particularly it's 60% of revenue, Unemployment there is less than 2%.

So we've seen demand continuing, as Beth mentioned, and it's still hard to find resources. So they've been raising rates for six months now or to nine months, and we're still signing more logos than we ever have.

Bruce Geller

Yes, that's great. I appreciate that. I just don't want to see a situation where you make an acquisition that in hindsight turns out to be based on peak earnings because, again, I mean, the Fed stated it very clearly yesterday, they're not going to stop in their mission until the job market weakens and there is a long lag effect. So even though they've raised rates a bunch to now, the market is still strong. I don't think we can assume that it's going to stay that way indefinitely. So I guess my concern would be paying for something based on peak earnings. And so I just wanted to understand how you adjust for that in your acquisition model.

Dan Hollenbach

We'll certainly look at it and make sure that we're paying what we believe to be a fair price based on what we see. And we spend a lot of time talking about the pipeline with a potential target.

Bruce Geller

Thank you.

Beth Garvey

Bailey, do we have anybody else?

Operator

We do have some more questions. Here we go. Next question today comes from the line of [Darrell Davis]. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Unidentified Analyst

Good morning, Dan and Beth. So I'm going to dovetail on that last question. The last question was really a forward-looking question. This is going to be a backward-looking question. If you look at the light industrial sale early this year and the multiple you garnered there, some multiples around the marketplace has certainly changed over the past eight months. You took that light industrial to market today, what sort of price do you think you could get? And you may not have woken up this morning ready for that question. So if you have to give a range, a big range is much appreciated.

Dan Hollenbach

If I had to guess, I would probably say that would trade at 5 to 5.5 today.

Unidentified Analyst

So where does that translate to in dollars?

Dan Hollenbach

So 20% less, $6 million, $7 million less. Yes.

Beth Garvey

Got you. Great quarter, guys.

Operator

Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Taxpayers. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Mike Denham

Hi guys. This is Mike, standing in for Bob. First of all, congratulations on an excellent quarter. And I will go forward to more of these in the future. So it's all due to a steady, steady leadership on your part guys. So my question is, we're another three months into the technology into seeing some results from your technology spend. Can you put a guess about how much of that came from that this quarter? And how much more of that I have to look forward to rolling into the next three, four quarters?

Dan Hollenbach

Yes. So we pretty much wrapped that up at the end of Q2. We went live with the last piece of that at the beginning of Q3. So the big spending, if you will, the credit or road map is over. We forecasted -- currently, we're working on next year's forecast, and we have about $2 million in CapEx relative to probably close to $6 million this year for next year for just steady state and enhancements to our current products.

Mike Denham

So from a return standpoint, though, what kind of return are we getting -- do we see the return this quarter? Right?

Dan Hollenbach

No. I think, Michael, we talked about that, as Beth mentioned, this quarter, we're in what we're calling hyper care. We're trying to make sure that the product is working as we anticipated. -- fixing when you do a massive migration like that, there are things you want to fix. So we're doing that this quarter.

Fourth quarter, we'll look at processes. We expect those efficiencies, I think, was, as we've mentioned on calls before, to begin in early to mid-'23.

Mike Denham

Okay. So no efficiencies in this quarter just expense. Same thing in Q4 and early to mid-next year?

Beth Garvey

We're start seeing some return on it. Well, we are seeing efficiencies. I think I mentioned earlier that we are able to do more revenue with less people. And I think part of that is a little bit because of the systems, but a lot of it has to do with identifying our processes because we really had to work on our processes before we went live on the system, so we could make sure you can put a system in, but you don't have a process that works with that you're wasting your money. So we did a lot of work in processes in preparation for the system.

So we are doing more revenue with less people. So we are seeing that. But these are -- as our CIO says, these are baby systems. They're still baby. We're still working on getting all the KPIs in place and making sure things are working the way we're doing.

So I think that we'll get more solid data that we'll be able to track in the future. But for right now, we're just seeing it from a perspective of less people, more revenue.

Mike Denham

Right, which usually means more money, more earnings. So was it in the quarter or not? When it's all said no, we spent some money, we had a good quarter or should I see significant productivity increases from here, which is sort of what Dan said. But I want to try -- at the end of day, I hear about it's a number to figure how much more money you're going to make next year with listing on a run rate basis.

Dan Hollenbach

We expect to see efficiencies and improvements in both the COH, what we call the COH, or the operating EBITDA line as well as the bottom EBITDA line next year. So yes.

Mike Denham

Okay. I'm going to ask the same question at the next free conference call, just so you know. Thanks. It was great quarter and keep up the good work.

Operator

There are no further questions registered at this time, so I'd like to pass the conference over to Beth Garvey for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.

Beth Garvey

Thank you, Bailey. Thank you for your time today, and we appreciate your continued support. We look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter in a few months. Have a great day.

“The Sunday Morning Bray”, by Bray!

For this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.

Romans 13:6 (King James Version)

The Democrat Party has become nothing more than a Demonic stronghold. The Christian Church needs to pray for the freeing of these people from their demonic masters. This has been shown by a few horrific actions in the last few years and being exposed daily. The most obvious ones are the exploitation of children for their pedophilia gods which destroys lives which never recover. The Satanic cult worship of abortion and infanticide. The pagan worship of the earth through environmentalism and Weather Change. The latest huge demonic possessions occurred under the forcing of people to take the mRNA shot which has caused untold deaths and injury.

These are all lies from the King of Lies who has been in control of the world since Adam and Eve. Israel and America minimized those demons for a time but has lost the battle over those demons for the last twenty years. One of his main tools today is Virtue Signaling to replace Salvation with good works and thoughts. If you are demonically possessed by any of the different worships you no longer have control of your life and is controlled by the demons. There is no Salvation or forgiveness in demonic worship, only a false sense of control until it completely controls you.

Pedophilia is an addiction which completely controls and obsesses your life. People who engage in it like the Epstein elites set up an entire world which has been allowed for hundreds of years. Epstein took it to another level on his exclusive island where he sold these children to people like Clinton, Biden and much of Hollywood and NYC upper crust. It has recently been replaced with importing young sex slaves from Mexico across the border for sexual abuse. Billions are being made from the sex slave trade crossing the border as cartels bring them to the prostitution houses around the country. Very likely the flying of these kids to Northern cities are part of the slavery trade by the Communist Party officials.

Algol as opposed to algore is another demon which possesses man through drugs and is an entryway for other demons. It is a very addictive demon which takes the control of your brain and nervous system from you to be numbed and slowed by drugs and alcohol. The new drugs are hundreds of times more powerful than even ten years ago. These demons own you as you become a slave to Algol as he owns more and more of your brain until it owns it and you. The way it gives you pleasure is by killing brain cells which gives you a disorientation just like alcohol making your mind weaker and weaker as you become more and more owned by your demons.

Abortion is the worship of the god Moloch. He is the most brutal god in the Bible. His worshipers believed the sacrifice of babies would give them immortality and forgiveness by pleasing him. This is another pagan demon which controls their life completely. He is being sold to his possessed as a freedom of convenience rather than the responsibility and joy of raising a child. The biggest deceivers are women who have been convinced the one thing which makes them miraculous and superior to men is what is holding them down. They have been told the one thing who gives them unconditional love is a negative leaving them lonely and empty in their later lives.

The virus was a demonic worship of man over God’s creation. God has given man the most miraculous immune and antibody systems ever created. This was not good enough for the leaders of the world. They invented a doxology saying your immune system was not good enough and you needed their emergency concoction which they knew did not work and failed test after test killing their test subjects.

This became a demonic worship inside a demonic cult. People were not only forced to take the shot, but if you did not take the shot or wear the mask and social distance you were a murderer and killer. You were ostracized and called every name in the book as a science denier or heretic to the faith. There was no room for investigation of the shot or personal awareness, you either took it or were a leper and social outcast.

America and the world declared everyone who refused the lowest form of life as they allowed no separate science which questioned the church of Fauxi. This was pure demonic worship which when investigated will discover millions of deaths through the shot and deadly medical protocols. These were sacrifices to their pagan worship of science and power.

What was done to the refusers of the shot was un-American. It was done on a false belief you could stop a disease which was not only already established in the society but was being falsified on every level by the gummit. This was as demonic as it gets and if happened which many believed happened there should be hangings.

This demonic worship was a crime against humanity and everyone involved both governmentally and corporately needs to have a fair trial and then hanged. They need to be made an example of what happens when you succumb to the evilest demons on the planet. They are no different than the organizers of the holocaust and deserve the same results.

America has become a demon possessed country. The more demonic you are the more loved you are by the institutions who control the information. They ran God out of science and then they ran him out of the schools and now is no longer allowed in gummit. This allows the demonic pagan worshipers to make the decisions using secular humanism where the ends justify the means. In this case getting rid of Trump and Maga justified risking millions of deaths and damages to get their power back.

Now you see every day perfectly healthy young people dying of sudden heart attacks with no chance of resuscitation. Clots are epidemic and cancer rates are exploding since America has traded God for Satan so now, she is paying the price.

There is only one solution which is Jesus Christ and his Salvation. A saved person cannot be possessed by demons and Jesus will eliminate any demons these people are possessed by. Satan does not have power against the Lord Jesus and he will clean them of any demons they may have.

Demonic spirits are real and the evidence is all around you as you see evil after evil being promoted and celebrated by people who have in the past seemed somewhat reasonable, demonic possession does not allow a clear mind. It is time for America to come back to God’s protection and turn away from demonic possession. Only then will it once again enjoy freedom and liberty for all people rather than living under mandates and forced vaccinations or the celebration of sin.

Pray for America’s revival.

Docu-series “Propaganda Exposed [UNCENSORED]” Blows the Lid off Collusion, Corruption, and Conspiracy between Government, Tech & Pharma

By Ty & Charlene Bollinger

November 5, 2022

Throughout the course of human history, healers have been revered and even worshiped. From Hippocrates, “The Father of Modern Medicine,” in 400 B.C., to Anton van Leeuwenhoek, who first discovered blood cells in 1670, to Sir Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin in 1928, physicians have still been hailed as pioneers and champions of healing.

Becoming a doctor is widely considered one of the most noble professions; the respect that a white lab coat and stethoscope can command is comparable to that of a cassock or war medal. It is one of the only professions in which its members demand that their title be used in everyday life.

This praise and admiration is not without merit. Doctors save lives. The amount of cumulative knowledge that it takes to repair an artery, replace a joint, or arrive at a seemingly impossible diagnosis requires a lifetime of dedication that is hard to manufacture. Each generation of healers stands upon the shoulders of the last, and the human race has benefited tremendously.

Furthermore, these healers have benefited greatly from breakthroughs in science and technology that have led to the creation and discovery of numerous drugs, therapies, and surgical interventions. These healing modalities have undoubtedly saved the lives of millions of Americans.

After all, where would we be without penicillin or appendectomies? Even our ability to sterilize wounds and prevent infection has drastically increased the average lifespan. But not all treatments are created equal. For every breakthrough, lifesaving discovery, dozens more turn out to be harmful, ineffective, or even deadly.

The Truth About Modern Medicine

For nearly as long as modern medicine has existed, so have egregious ethical violations. When you hear the term “medical experimentation,” your mind may recall the horrendous experiments conducted in Nazi Germany on Jews, communists, homosexuals, and an assortment of other “undesirables” under the Third Reich. While these experiments were undoubtedly appalling, they were neither the first nor the last of their kind.

In fact, the history of unethical experiments in the United States and abroad is long and harrowing. Children, soldiers, minorities, prisoners, and even entire cities have been forcibly or unknowingly subjected to dangerous, cruel, and often lethal experiments… all in the name of science.

The doctors and scientists responsible for the development and administration of these drugs are both trained and constrained by the corrupt system that now controls them. Western medicine as we now know it exists in orbit around the pharmaceutical industry. Medical schools teach doctors how to match symptoms with prescriptions, hospitals negotiate with insurance companies based on the cost of drugs, and the race is ongoing to create the latest and greatest drug that will cure what ails ya.

The healers of today are no longer the heroes of old. The healers of today are trained, funded, and accountable to the pharmaceutical industry. That corruption is largely enabled by a system of governmental oversight that is nothing more than an instrument used by the medical industrial complex to approve and sell their products while limiting their liability.

Worse, these governmental puppets are now using the private tech and media industries to ensure that only the official narrative is put forth; those with dissenting opinions or contradicting data are silenced, censored, and calumniated.

This was once considered to be a conspiracy theory. To insinuate that these institutions could be involved in a global conspiracy that has cost tens of millions of lives and undermined the very foundations of our democracy was tantamount to blasphemy.

Until now…

The Emperor is Naked

Over the past few weeks, shocking evidence has emerged that demonstrates a rigorous effort by tech industry, medical corporations, media outlets, and government agencies to silence dissenting opinions, attack specific people and organizations, and control what information you can silence dissenting opinions, attack specific people and organizations, and control what information you can access.

On August 31, 2022, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry filed a lawsuit alleging that at least 45 federal officials across multiple agencies within the Biden administration colluded with Facebook and Twitter to adjust their algorithms to “censor freedom of speech” on a number of topics, including the COVID-19 pandemic (Google, LinkedIn, and others are also implicated in the petition).

The following is an excerpt from that document, which you can read in its entirety here:

Under the First Amendment, the federal Government should have no role in policing private speech or picking winners and losers in the marketplace of ideas. But that is what federal officials are doing, on a massive scale – a scale whose full scope and impact is yet to be determined.

Secretary Mayorkas of DHS commented that the federal Government’s efforts to police private speech on social media are occurring “across the federal enterprise.” It turns out that this statement is true, on a scale beyond what Plaintiffs could ever have anticipated.

The limited discovery produced so far provides a tantalizing snapshot into a massive, sprawling federal “Censorship Enterprise,” which includes dozens of federal officials across at least eleven federal agencies and components identified so far, who communicate with social-media platforms about misinformation, disinformation, and the suppression of private speech on social media—all with the intent and effect of pressuring social-media platforms to censor and suppress private speech that federal officials disfavor.

This shocking discovery was followed by a damning report published by The Intercept that sheds further light on just how far this conspiracy goes. In particular, the DHS sub-agency CISA, or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has been most active in efforts to combat “mis-, dis-, and mal- information,” or what it abbreviates as “MDM.”

The report makes use of recently leaked or unsealed internal documents, giving a view into the kinds of conversations corporate executives and government officials have had over how to handle potentially harmful online narratives and sensitive topics.

In the March meeting, Laura Dehmlow, an FBI official, warned that the threat of subversive information on social media could undermine support for the U.S. government. Dehmlow, according to notes of the discussion attended by senior executives from Twitter and JPMorgan Chase, stressed that “we need a media infrastructure that is held accountable.”

It’s been treated as a crime against humanity to question any of the ‘COVID measures’ forced on all humanity by governments worldwide — especially COVID vaccination, which is itself a crime against humanity — and yet it’s dangerous to say as much.

But history has shown that these suspicions are not unfounded. In fact, there is an extensive and well-documented history of corruption and unethical practices by the same pharmaceutical companies and government agencies that we’re told to trust.

Pfizer’s Criminal Track Record

In 2009, Pfizer (and its subsidiary Pharmacia & Upjohn Company) paid $2.3 BILLION to settle criminal and civil liabilities for illegal promotion of their pharmaceutical products. The amount included payment of more than $102 million in civil settlement to six whistleblowers of the company’s fraudulent practices.

Bextra, an anti-inflammatory drug that was withdrawn from the market in 2005 due to safety concerns, was marketed by the company for various off-label uses. The company also illegally promoted several other drugs, including antipsychotic drug Geodon, antibiotic Zyvox, and anti-epileptic drug Lyrica. Healthcare providers received payments for prescribing these drugs to patients for off-label use… literally bribing doctors to prescribe untested and unapproved drugs to patients.

False claims were submitted to government healthcare programs, allowing them to bypass the insurance programs. Pfizer had to pay approximately $1 BILLION to Medicare, Medicaid, and other government insurance programs under the settlement.

And those are just a few examples.

In 1993, anti-seizure drug gabapentin was widely prescribed for off-label uses such as treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions. Courts ruled that Pfizer utilized propaganda campaigns, paid for favorable research and coverage, and suppressed unfavorable research regarding the drug. Several regulatory bodies found the drug ineffective for the associated ailments, and Pfizer paid $430 million in one of the largest settlements to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges.

A “whistleblower suit” was filed in 2005 against Wyeth, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2009, alleging that the company illegally marketed sirolimus (Rapamune) for off-label uses, targeted specific doctors and medical facilities to increase sales of Rapamune, tried to get transplant patients to change from their transplant drugs to Rapamune, and specifically targeted African-Americans.

According to the whistleblowers, Wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals that prescribed the drug with kickbacks such as grants, donations, and other money. In 2013, the company pleaded guilty to criminal mis-branding violations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. By August 2014, it had paid $491 million in civil and criminal penalties related to Rapamune.

In June 2010, health insurance network Blue Cross Blue Shield filed a lawsuit against Pfizer for allegedly illegally marketing drugs Bextra, Geodon, and Lyrica. Blue Cross alleged that Pfizer used kickbacks and wrongly persuaded doctors to prescribe the drugs. According to the lawsuit, Pfizer handed out ‘misleading’ materials on off-label uses, sent over 5,000 doctors on trips to the Caribbean or around the United States, and paid them $2,000 honoraria in return for listening to lectures about Bextra.

An internal marketing plan revealed that Pfizer intended to train physicians “to serve as public relations spokespeople.” The case was settled in 2014 for $325 million. Fearing that Pfizer was “too big to fail” (and that prosecuting the company would result in disruptions to Medicare and Medicaid), federal prosecutors instead charged a subsidiary of a subsidiary of a subsidiary of Pfizer, shielding them from virtually all financial responsibility.

In 2013, Pfizer agreed to a $964 million settlement for selling insulation laden with asbestos.

That same year, Pfizer withdrew “between $400,000 and a million dollars” worth of ads from Harper’s Magazine following an unflattering article on their depression medication.

In 1994, Pfizer agreed to pay $10.75 million to settle claims by the United States Department of Justice that the company lied to get approval for defective heart valves that killed roughly 500 people.

In 1996, an outbreak of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria. Pfizer representatives and personnel set up a clinical trial and administered an experimental antibiotic, trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children. Local officials reported that more than fifty children (over 25%) died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities.

Bribing Doctors

Sadly, this unethical (and often criminal) behavior extends beyond corporations to the very men and women we trust with our health and wellbeing. It’s important to mention that the overwhelming majority of doctors are kind, honest, hardworking folks who have a genuine desire to help their fellow man.

But many have been captured by the medical industrial complex.

Most doctors receive gifts from Big Pharma in one form or another. A 2018 survey published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that nearly three out of four doctors have financial ties to Big Pharma. The vast majority of these relationships were with representatives of prescription drug or medical device manufacturers. Gifts included drug samples, meals, and payment for consulting or advisory roles.

Since 2013, federal law has required that payments to doctors by medical device and pharmaceutical companies be publicly reported. The database (which you can access here) has published over 78 million records from 2015 to 2021, reflecting $63.23 billion in gifts and payments.

Dr. Aaron S. Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the survey, says this may be influencing doctors’ behavior. According to the study, “Free samples are used as a marketing tool and have been linked to prescribing of high-cost, brand-name drugs over lower-cost generic alternatives.” He suggests that money paid for public speaking and consulting engagements may have an even more acute impact on doctor behavior. “Social scientists will tell you that any amount of money will influence people, but I think larger sums can influence behavior more,” Dr. Kesselheim said

We trust our physicians to make the best recommendations for our health, but the majority of these doctors are receiving gifts from Big Pharma that may influence the treatments they recommend. For example, an orthopedic surgeon in Manhattan received almost $2,000,000 from companies that manufacture hip and knee replacement products between 2015 and 2017. Not coincidentally, the surgeon, Dr. Geoffrey Westrich, performs hundreds of hip and knee replacements each year. In 2017, this doctor received $870,573.39 in general payments from pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including $448,000 for “consulting fees”, $28,580 for non-educational speaking engagements, and over $23,000 in travel and lodging.

The Most Important Documentary of Our Lifetime

It’s time for the world to learn the truth, and that’s why Ty and Charlene Bollinger created their groundbreaking new docu-series: Propaganda Exposed [UNCENSORED] which seeks to uncover the lies of the mainstream media and medical industry and educate viewers on the truth about how we are slowly losing our freedoms, as well as what we can do to take them back.

Propaganda Exposed [UNCENSORED] shares the story of Big Pharma corruption, conflicts of interest, and explains why current medical interventions are so heavily skewed toward patented drugs. The docu-series also covers the sordid history of medical experimentation in the USA in an attempt to help the viewer understand how we got here, why we are now losing our health freedom, what we can do about it, and so much more.

Some notable experts featured in the 9-episode docu-series include Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Dr. Robert Malone, Dr. Judy Mikovits, Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Omar Hamada, Del Bigtree, Mike Adams, Dr. Russell Blaylock, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, Zach Vorhies, John Schneider, Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, Dr. Carrie Madej, Sayer Ji, Dr. Alan Keyes, Dr. Irvin Sahni, and many others.

This docu-series will cover everything from cancer and cannabis to fluoride and the Federal Reserve. Most importantly, it will expose the TRUTH about COVID, vaccines, and the real-life conspiracies that are actively underway RIGHT NOW.

Here’s a breakdown of all 9 episodes:

In total, over 60 doctors, scientists, health experts, and freedom fighters are featured in this eye-opening docu-series which will change lives, influence friends and family, and quite possibly “wake up” enough people to create a “tipping point” for truth and liberty.

“Throughout human history, those who tell inconvenient and uncomfortable truths have been ostracized, demonized, and attacked by those in power. What we have experienced in the past two years is no exception to that rule. I am not surprised that history is once again repeating itself. However, Ty and I feel that it is important to continue exposing these schemes meant to silence us all into submission.”

His presence, his voice, what he had to say and why, were balm for my troubled soul. Here in this book is the story that explains why this softly spoken man did what he did. He has been true north for so many who felt utterly lost. Here are more of his words. I have nothing to offer but gratitude.” All my very best wishes as always.

The common theme? Ads. Or lack thereof. In a surprising turn of events, ads have become Big Tech’s Achilles’ heel.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4553958-elephants-in-the-room,"gremlin/E+ via Getty Images

In 2017, I wrote a book about Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (META), and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) called The Four. After working for 25 years, I became an overnight success: speaking gigs, appearances on cable news and talk shows, book and podcast deals. I spent a bunch of time with elected officials, and powerful people wanted to have lunch with me. People were fascinated — shocked, even — by this simple observation: Big Tech is powerful, maybe too powerful.

Much of the concern was a function of the ad-driven nature of platforms — algorithms that tapped into good/bad aspects of human nature to addict us. Most people knew how Facebook and Google made money, but not how they actually worked, how the ad revenue was fueled by the collection of data and the harvesting of attention. In fact, the phrase “Big Tech” was barely known back then. (Check the Wikipedia entry for Big Tech and see which NYU professor is credited with defining the category.) I just read the last sentence and realized I still crave other people’s affirmation. #Pathetic.

Anyway, things are different today. We know we’re being tracked, and we understand how digital platforms make money. We also know they’re lucrative, as in, among the fastest growing, most profitable businesses in history. Since A Beautiful Mind won Best Picture in 2002, Google has grown its revenue 625-fold. Digital ads transformed the company from a garage project into a multinational corporation, and turned Meta from a college-campus website into the largest media business in the world. If you had to bet everything, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to go with whoever controls our attention. Meta or Google? Safe bets. Snap (SNAP)? Riskier, but the moppets love it. It’s fun to flirt with other sectors and firms, but these companies are the smart, safe bets.

Until now.

Sea Change

This is proving to be a historically bad year for tech. Few saw it coming. If you bought Facebook stock in 2015, you’ve lost money. If you purchased shares of General Motors (GM), IBM (IBM), or Chevron (CVX), you’ve made more money than Meta shareholders. Seven years of gains, erased in 10 months. Meta’s meltdown is shocking, but not singular. Google is down 40% this year, Amazon 45%, and Snap 80%. These losses are unprecedented in the Big Tech era.

As with bankruptcy, the sell-off happened gradually, then suddenly. Last week was a turning point. Amazon, Google, Meta, and Snap all missed big on earnings. The common theme? Ads. Or lack thereof. We knew the Mad Men era had come to an end; we weren’t expecting the end of Ad Men. But let’s be honest, advertising sucks. Cable ads provide a glimpse into what it’s like to have restless leg syndrome, and digital ads, while more relevant, are carbon — the noxious byproduct of converting attention into shareholder value via algorithms that bring out the worst in the species. I’ll say it again, advertising sucks.

In a surprising turn of events, ads have become Big Tech’s Achilles’ heel. Google’s ad revenue grew just 3% this quarter, down from 43% growth a year ago. For the first time, YouTube ad revenue declined. Snap registered its slowest ad revenue growth ever. Meta’s ad sales, which make up more than 98% of the business, were a train wreck. Meanwhile, (and yes, this brings me joy) the company continues to incinerate $2 billion a month feeding Mark’s fever dream that he is a god of new worlds. BTW, it appears people are more likely to worship Tom: Myspace has more traffic than Meta’s Horizon Worlds.

Macro

What is/are the meteor(s) that have struck the Genghis & Khan of ads? Meta says the problem is “the uncertain and volatile macroeconomic landscape.” Google blames “the challenging macroclimate.” Snap, “macro headwinds.” Macro, as in, rising inflation, interest rates, and supply chain issues all conspiring to depress advertising demand. And it makes sense, because if people stop spending money on stuff, then the businesses that make that stuff have less money to spend on advertising.

But here’s where it gets scary for these companies’ shareholders: The “macro” culprit is a ghost, as people haven’t stopped spending. U.S. consumer spending beat expectations in September, rising 0.6% for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is doing, well, fine — U.S. GDP grew 2.6% last quarter. Of course, there’s still a lot of uncertainty. Growth has slowed, and we’re by no means in the clear. But the weakness we’re seeing in the macroeconomy is a drizzle compared to the Category 5 storm we’re seeing in digital advertising.

The state of the economy is a distraction here. Something else is killing ads, and tech companies are reluctant to acknowledge it because, unlike the economy, it’s not cyclical but structural.

Elephant No. 1

The elephants in the room are Apple and TikTok. Apple is the larger of the two, figuratively and literally. Last week, the Cupertino giant cemented its position as the most enduring tech company in history: Facing the same macro headwinds as Google and Meta, Apple beat earnings expectations on both the top and bottom lines. At $2.4 trillion in market cap, the company is roughly 10 times more valuable than Meta. Three years ago, it was twice as valuable. It’s getting easier to understand why the Zuck wants out of this universe.

Executioner

Apple may be the last thing an ad-driven platform sees before everything goes black. A year ago, Apple’s iOS upgrade forced apps, including Facebook and Instagram, to ask users for permission to track their data. Meta relies on that data to serve personalized ads that garner greater clicks and sales. So if users opt out, the ads become less effective, and Meta, dramatically less valuable.

But few predicted the change would hurt Meta this much. Turns out, when Apple’s privacy prompt pops up, only 16% of users agree to being tracked. And if data is the new oil, ad platforms are losing 84% of their Brent Crude. Apple has gone Putin on Meta’s Germany by cutting supply — though this decision was positioned more virtuously, in the name of privacy, vs. war.

Without data, the digital ad ecosystem doesn’t work. I saw this play out in real time. Here at Prof G Media, we collect data — specifically, whether or not you opened this email. It’s not powerful data, but it’s data. It helps us understand what resonates. However, several months ago our open rate fell off a cliff. Why? Apple’s privacy change: Every iPhone reader started showing up as a no-open. Overnight, our data had become useless.

This newsletter isn’t monetized, so the data blackbox isn’t a game changer. But for most online businesses, it’s dire. Small e-commerce companies across the country have seen customer acquisition costs skyrocket … by 10 times. Why? The ads are no longer shown to the right people at the right time. As a result, small businesses have had to shift spend. Since the iOS upgrade, almost half of e-commerce store owners have decreased their Facebook ad spending by 25% or more. This year, the average price of ads on Meta declined 20%. One year ago, before the privacy change, prices had risen 20%. Tim’s revenge turned Meta, overnight, from a spry, twenty-something growth stock into a Golden Girl, mature and complaining.

Elephant No. 2

In advertising, the pie stays the same. The industry has consistently accounted for roughly 1.3% of U.S. GDP. Which means a couple of things: 1) There’s always demand, and 2) it’s a zero-sum game. As with foreign exchange, every increase is met with a commensurate decrease somewhere else.

So if the money isn’t going to Facebook, where is it going? The phantom menace here is likely TikTok. Last quarter (the same quarter Google, Meta, and Snap got crushed), TikTok was the highest-grossing app for the fourth consecutive quarter — meanwhile, the rest of the app market declined. It was also the most downloaded app on the App Store, and more than a quarter of Americans under 30 now get their news from it. TikTok’s global ad revenue will triple this year, to $12 billion, which would best the revenue of Snap and Twitter combined. That number doesn’t include Douyin, TikTok’s China-based counterpart. ByteDance (BDNCE), the parent company that houses these assets, was recently valued at $300 billion. That’s roughly equal to Meta, Snap, and Twitter (at Elon’s inflated price) combined.

TikTok’s growing influence is well documented. We’ve discussed it many times before. Less discussed is the extent to which Xi and Cook have formed an unspoken alliance to repel the advance of Meta. The company is in full-blown retreat. After Facebook and Instagram ads became less effective, ad buyers overwhelmingly turned to TikTok. Standard practice, according to one ad firm, was to move 10% to 15% of ad spend from Facebook to TikTok. The data is opaque (part and parcel of ByteDance being China-owned), but the trend is clear: TikTok is becoming the premier ad platform.

You’d think TikTok would be just as susceptible to Apple’s privacy change as Facebook. After all, TikTok’s ads are fueled by an algorithm, which is fed with your data. But research suggests TikTok is more insulated against Apple’s privacy change than others. According to cybersecurity experts, TikTok can circumvent Apple’s code audits and track activity without the user’s knowledge. Exactly how this works is (again) not so clear, and that’s the point — as one expert pointed out, “ByteDance has gone to monumental lengths to conceal the inner workings of the app.” What could go wrong?

Once that date is reached, it’s trash. The Chromebook will not get any more patches or updates.

Tap or click for a list of 17 Chromebook make and model numbers to avoid buying.

If you’re Googling, ""Do I need a new laptop?"" or ""Should I upgrade or replace my laptop?"" the answer is probably yes. Tap or click here for my picks for the best Chromebooks and Windows and Mac laptops for every budget.

Let’s look at the clear-cut signs buying a new laptop is in your immediate future.

Sign 1: Your laptop is a slow poke

I'm not just talking about web pages taking a little longer to load. I'm talking about when your laptop takes 10 minutes to turn on. Maybe you're running two programs at once, and everything slows down to a crawl.

A laptop getting slower is mostly a sign of age. Of course, it could also mean you have malware or hackers on your device. Here’s how to tell if your computer has been compromised.

Laptops slow down as their memory fills up and when multiple applications are running at once. Sometimes you can speed up a computer by upgrading the CPU and RAM. You could save yourself a lot of money by upgrading your hardware.

My rule of thumb: When the cost to upgrade or fix an old laptop is 30% of the price of a new one, buy a new one.

Sign 2: It’s hot

Laptops come with built-in fans to keep cool. You may have heard the fan whirring when your machine has been running for a long time. It's trying to make the toasty device drop a few degrees in your lap.

Over time, these fans can get full of dust and debris — or they're just worn down. When this happens, your laptop will still heat up, but now it can't cool itself down.

Ultimately, this kind of heating up signifies that you should replace your laptop. If your computer gets hot enough, it will cease to function. Consistent overheating can even lead to breakage or even melting.

Tap or click for 10 reasons your computer is running hot and how to fix them.

Sign 3: It’s a risk to use

Count your blessings if your laptop is more than four to five years old. One downside: Often, using an old machine is a considerable cybersecurity risk.

Software updates are critical for your digital health. Operating system updates come with new features that make life easier, but they also patch bugs that hackers exploit.

For example, you're in danger if you're still using Windows 7. Microsoft doesn't update that OS anymore. Windows 10 or 11 get frequent updates, which means they have better cybersecurity protections.

Dig through your settings to see which OS you’re running. Research the latest update and see if your device can run it. If not, take this for what it is: One of the most prominent signs you need a new laptop.

Sign 4: Your screen or your keyboard is busted

Laptops are durable and made to take a beating. But even if you’re careful, accidents happen. Your screen might be missing a few pixels. It can also start flickering for no apparent reason.

Your laptop keyboard may be missing letters and numbers. Or perhaps certain keys no longer work at all. The trackpad may lose its sensitivity over time, too.

Rather than replacing a laptop screen, you can save some money and hook an external monitor up to it. You could also do the same with a keyboard.

Unless your laptop is less than three years old, repairing a screen or a keyboard is usually not the best decision. Sell it and apply that money towards purchasing a new laptop.

Sign 5: Your battery doesn’t hold a charge

Laptop batteries, like phone batteries, lose charge as you use them. Over time, your laptop will eventually need to be charged more often.

This can escalate to the point where you must plug it in all the time to work. For many people, particularly those whose only computer is a laptop, keeping it powered up isn't that much of a hardship. Laptops should be portable, though.

 Read more at straitstimes.com.",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/russia-reactivates-its-trolls-and-bots-ahead-of-tuesday-s-us-midterms-elections,"NEW YORK - The user on Gab who identifies as Nora Berka resurfaced in August after a year-long silence on the social media platform, reposting a handful of messages with sharply conservative political themes before writing a stream of original vitriol.

The posts mostly denigrated President Joe Biden and other prominent Democrats, sometimes obscenely. They also lamented the use of taxpayer dollars to support Ukraine in its war against invading Russian forces, depicting Ukraine’s president as a caricature straight out of Russian propaganda.

The fusion of political concerns was no coincidence.

The account was previously linked to the same secretive Russian agency that interfered in the 2016 presidential election and again in 2020, the Internet Research Agency in St Petersburg, according to the cyber-security group Recorded Future.

It is part of what the group and other researchers have identified as a new, though more narrowly targeted, Russian effort ahead of Tuesday’s United States midterm elections.

The goal, as before, is to stoke anger among conservative voters and to undermine trust in the American electoral system. This time, it also appears intended to undermine the Biden administration’s extensive military assistance to Ukraine.

“It’s clear they are trying to get them to cut off aid and money to Ukraine,” said Mr Alex Plitsas, a former army soldier and Pentagon information operations official now with Providence Consulting Group, a business technology company.

The campaign – using accounts that pose as enraged Americans like Nora Berka – have added fuel to the most divisive political and cultural issues in the country today. It has specifically targeted Democratic candidates in the most contested races, including the Senate seats up for grabs in Ohio, Arizona and Pennsylvania, calculating that a Republican majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives could help the Russian war effort.

The campaigns show not only how vulnerable the American political system remains to foreign manipulation but also how purveyors of disinformation have evolved and adapted to efforts by the major social media platforms to remove or play down false or deceptive content.

In October, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an alert warning of the threat of disinformation spread by “dark web media channels, online journals, messaging applications, spoofed websites, e-mails, text messages and fake online personas”. The disinformation could include claims that voting data or results had been hacked or compromised.

The agencies urged people not to like, discuss or share posts online from unknown or distrustful sources. They did not identify specific efforts, but social media platforms and researchers who track disinformation have recently uncovered a variety of campaigns by Russia, China and Iran.",cybersecurity,the straits times

Bin Chiang

Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Grid Dynamics Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I am Bin Chiang, Head of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]

Joining us on the call today are CEO, Leonard Livschitz; and CFO, Anil Doradla. Following their prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Please note, today’s conference is being recorded.

Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements. This includes our business and financial outlook and the answers to some of your questions. Such statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. During this call, we’ll discuss certain non-GAAP measures of our performance. GAAP to non-GAAP financial reconciliations and supplemental financial information are provided in the earnings press release and the 8-K filed with the SEC. You can find all the information I have just described in the Investor Relations section of our website.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Leonard, our CEO.

Leonard Livschitz

Thank you, Ben. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Q3, 2022 was another record revenue quarter of $81.2 million, and this marked the ninth consecutive quarter of record revenue in the company’s history. We performed exceptionally well across multiple areas. Additionally, our third quarter results exceeded our guidance with respect to the revenue and profitability.

For the first time as a public company, we surpassed our target operating model of 40% gross margin and 20% EBITDA margin on a non-GAAP basis. The better-than-expected performance was due to a couple of factors. First, during the quarter, we witnessed strong demand across some of our large technology customers, as they continued to ramp on both existing and new programs; and second, we witnessed strong momentum with recent logo wins. Notably, we enter the fourth quarter in 2023 with a very robust pipeline with the new client business.

Customers are even more seeking to partner with Grid Dynamics for their strategic digital transformation initiatives, and we’re increasingly viewed as a company that can provide scalable, high-quality engineering. I’m confident of our strengths and believe the company is well positioned to grow successfully.

Let’s talk about locations. In Poland, our second largest delivery country, our profile and status has been elevated, as a technology leader in the Polish business community. We’re now fully function across the 4 largest cities in Poland, Warsaw, Krakow, Gdansk and Wroclaw. Grid Dynamics internships expand across all these locations. In addition, Poland’s great support of Ukraine has resulted in our offices, posting a substantial number of Ukrainian employees.

During the quarter, I’m happy to highlight that Grid Dynamics leadership team was invited by the United States Ambassador to Poland to lead the round table business discussion with U.S. corporations, Polish academia and other institution during the visit to Warsaw. This is a true testament of the company’s strengths, and we expect such recognitions to help us in recruiting high-quality talent and attracting new global customers, who are operating in Poland and other European countries.

In India, we completed the incorporation and are now directly hiring on our payroll. We have augmented our leadership with across HR, delivery and operations and partnered with one of the leading universities for internships. In a couple of weeks, we’re opening our new office in one of the premium location in Hyderabad Knowledge Park and expect our presence in this location to help us in attracting and recruiting high-quality talent.

We also ramped up hiring of engineering talents in several countries, such as Mexico, Serbia, Armenia, Romania and others. In each of these countries, we offer unique advantage for our global growth. During the quarter, we expanded our relationship with the university and hired our first group of interns in Armenia and Romania, while we’re expanding office in Serbia, we’re also opening 2 new engineering centers in the 2 cities in Romania.

As you all know, over a couple of past quarters, we executed flawlessly in transitioning a significant proportion of our workforce, while continuing to deliver projects in a timely manner. And I’m happy to report we continue to operate across all our geographies without any disruptions. Furthermore, with our distributed delivery model, projects are spread over across different geography regions, thereby lowering the geographic delivery risks.

Our company has always been at the forefront of emerging technologies. Within the IT service industry, we’re one of the first companies to embrace cloud engineering, big data, machine learning as well as other innovative products and offerings for large enterprise clients. We continue to maintain our technology leadership and always keep R&D at the center of our service offering. Our Chief Technical Officer, with his team, spearhead a number of strategic initiatives to support growing customer digital transformation demand.

Regarding the personnel, we have hired subject matter experts to build expertise in selected verticals such as manufacturing, supply chain, life science and financial services as well as insurance. Regarding capabilities, we’ve made a substantial progress in building custom IP solutions, targeting specific industry verticals. This include accelerators and engineering implementation frameworks, such leveraging distributed agile, cloud and DevOps, as well as automation. Such initiatives clearly demonstrate the reduction of implementation risks and customer costs.

In the quarter, there were several positive trends that I want to share with you, few of the notable ones. Demand trends. In the Q3, we witnessed enhanced budget scrutiny across customer bases with some retail clients [being] more sensitive. We expect the trend to persist in Q4. Meanwhile, the majority of our clients continue to invest in revenue-generating programs, which tend to be more insulated from macro headwinds. In addition, Q3 revenue also benefited from our new logo business development and based on the current trends in Q4, we expect it to continue strength from the new logos.

Coming to some additional third quarter segment commentary. Our Technology segment was the largest during the quarter, and similar to the Q2, some of our largest technology customers continued to ramp aggressively and support our growth, as we expanded into new geographies. Our Financial segment grew healthy, as we benefited from new programs tied to wealth management applications.

Logo momentum, in the third quarter, we added several new logos across industries, which included a Fortune 500 climate control equipment manufacturer, a specialty retail and a large online consumer platform. I’m happy to report that in September, we signed new contracts and started engagement with 2 Fortune 30 companies. One is a global automotive manufacturer; and another one is the leading membership-only discount chain. We received revenues from these 2 customers starting October.

European business expansion. During the quarter, we made a good progress with our European clients. Cybersecurity is one of our strategic focus areas. We expanded business with a number of cybersecurity and software companies. In addition, we witnessed a strong ramp with a global footwear company. We also continued to scale our business with the large U.K.-based home improvement chain. And finally, we secured new business with a major Nordic truck manufacturer.

New business pipeline. We entered the fourth quarter in 2023 with a robust pipeline of new logos and strong demand across our non-retail verticals. On the new logo front, we’re witnessing strong momentum and expect adding more logos in Q4 than we’ve done in Q3 this year. At some of our new large customers, we also witnessed faster ramp up, as they are willing to scale business more rapidly. We’re expanding our business within existing programs, and we expect to contribute from them meaningfully in 2023.

Partnerships. Partnerships are increasingly playing an important role in our ability to attract new clients. In the Q3, [to our] new logos wins came through our partnership channel. We also made progress in our large [cloud] partners with Microsoft Azure, we’ll confirm gold status. At AWS, we’re recognized, as a launch partner for their EKS delivery program, which focuses on application, modernization across enterprises. At Google Cloud platform, we have one of the largest number of specialization and [indiscernible] IT service providers. In addition to hyperscalers cloud partners, we strengthen our alliances with SaaS and product companies in digital commerce, data and advanced analytics.

M&A. M&A continues to be an important component of our growth strategy. As a reminder, our M&A focuses on capabilities, key customers and delivery locations. In early September, we successfully [concluding] raising primary capital. One of the key reasons for this raise was M&A. Our current pipeline is robust, and we’re actively exploring multiple acquisition opportunities to expand our capabilities, complemented with our geographic expansion strategy.

During the quarter, Grid Dynamics delivered some notable projects. Number one, for a global technology company, we proposed, designed and implemented snowflake integration to run business intelligence reports on petabytes of data. As a result, end users were provided with enhanced reporting capabilities to drive the company’s business and operational decisions. This solution met all the acquired data service level agreements for large-scale data management and resolved previously observed challenges in maintenance, capacity and scalability.

For a global technology leader in the cloud space, Grid Dynamics was a key partner in the development of one of the core B2B products dedicated to artificial intelligence-driven product capabilities. Grid Dynamics contribution included end-to-end quality engineering of the product and then customer onboarding tool suite. The product gives end users a tailored product discovery experience and dramatically increases conversion through better search and recommendations relevance.

At a leading financial service firm, we helped the client to modernize the primary customer portal. Our solution provides greater flexibility and speeds up integration processes with each business unit. The modernized portal provides end users also with a more streamlined experience and highlights financial products and services relevant to their needs.

For one of the largest manufacturing service company, we developed an intelligent cloud-based module for their supply chain management system. This module aggregates information about excessive stock matches against the contractual terms and allows to generate claims. It’s certainly in production and has helped our client in collecting additional revenues.

With that, let me turn the call over to Anil, who will discuss Q3 in more details. Anil?

Anil Doradla

Thank you, Leonard, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue of $81.2 million exceeded our guidance range of $78.5 million to $80 million and was up 4.9% on a sequential basis and 40.1% on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, our revenue was negatively impacted by the weaker euro and British pound against the U.S. dollar.

On a constant currency basis, our revenue growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis was 5.8% and 43.1%, respectively. The better-than-expected revenue in the quarter was driven by strong demand from our large technology customers and revenue contribution from recent logo wins. TMT, our largest vertical, represented 32.4% of our third quarter revenues and grew 12.6% on a sequential basis, and 49.7% on a year-over-year basis. We witnessed strength across our customer base with some of our largest technology customers, where we grew business across existing new programs.

During the third quarter, Retail, our second largest vertical represented 31.1% of our revenues and decreased 0.8% on a sequential basis and grew 38.3% on a year-over-year basis. The sequential decline was largely driven by some customers, who are more cautious in spending with the ongoing macro concerns. We expect these concerns to persist in Q4 at some of these customers.

Here are the details of the revenue mix of other verticals. Our CPG and Manufacturing represented 19.8% of our revenue in the third quarter and decreased 0.2% on a sequential basis and grew 43.3% on a year-over-year basis. The slight decline on a sequential basis came from the decline at some customers, and this was offset by growth at our largest CPG customer.

Finance represented 7.5% of revenue, increased 20.3% on a sequential basis and grew 16.3% on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential basis, we witnessed growth across most of our customers tied to financial services, banking and insurance. And finally, the other segment represented 9.2% of our third quarter revenue and was up 1.1% on a sequential basis.

We exited third quarter with a total head count of 3,746 down from 3,763 employees in the second quarter of 2022 and up from 2,884 in the third quarter of 2021. The head count reduction was driven by a couple of factors. First, at a company-wide level, we streamlined our engineering bench. Second, in the quarter, our pace of hiring moderated to align with demand. That said, our average billable head count increased on a sequential basis in the third quarter over the second quarter, and this partially contributed to the increase in revenue.

At the end of the third quarter of 2022, our total U.S. head count was 322 or 9% of the company’s total head count and remained on the same level compared to the second quarter of 2022 and down from 11% on a year ago quarter. The year-over-year decline as a percentage of the total head count was largely driven by greater mix of non-U.S. headcount. Our non-U.S. headcount, which we sometimes refer to as offshore, located in Central Eastern Europe, UK, Netherlands and Mexico and other locations was 3,424 or 91% of our total head count.

In the third quarter, revenues from our top five and top 10 customers were 44.5% and 61.1%, respectively. In the second quarter, our top five and top 10 customer concentration was 44.2% and 60.2%, respectively. And during the same period a year ago, our top five and top 10 customer concentration was 42% and 58.2%, respectively. During the quarter, we had a total of 200 customers, down from 208 customers in the second quarter and 215 customers in the year ago quarter. The sequential decline in our customers was largely driven by our commercial business or Daxx, which we acquired in December 2020. As a reminder, we only count the revenue-generating customers in the quarter and do not include customers, who are inactive during the quarter.

Moving to the income statement, our GAAP gross profit during the quarter was $32.7 million or 40.3%, up from $28.9 million or 37.3% in the second quarter of 2022 and up from $25.3 million or 43.6% in the year ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, our gross profit was $33 million or 40.7%, up from $29.1 million or 37.7% in the second quarter of 2022 and up from $25.4 million or 43.9% in the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was driven by a combination of third quarter seasonality with more working days and favorable FX trends with the stronger dollar.

Non-GAAP EBITDA during the third quarter that excluded stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, expenses related to geographic reorganization, transaction and other related costs was $17.1 million or 21.1% of revenue, up from $13.3 million or 17.2% in the second quarter of 2022 and up from $12.5 million or 21.6% in the year ago quarter. The sequential increase in EBITDA, both in terms of dollars and percentage of revenue was due to a combination of higher levels of revenue, flattish operating expenses and favorable FX trends.

Our GAAP net loss in the third quarter totaled $6.7 million or a loss of $0.10 based on a share count of 69 million shares compared to the second quarter loss of $13.2 million or $0.20 per share based on 67 million shares and a loss of $0.5 million or $0.01 per share based on 63 million shares in the year ago quarter. The sequential and year-over-year increase in GAAP net loss was largely due to higher levels of stock-based compensation and geographic reorganization costs, offset by higher levels of revenue.

On a non-GAAP basis, in the third quarter of our non-GAAP net income was $11 million or $0.15 per share based on 72 million diluted shares compared to the second quarter of 2022 non-GAAP net income of $8.2 million or $0.12 per diluted share based on 70 million diluted shares and $7.9 million or $0.11 per diluted share based on 69 million diluted shares in the year ago quarter. The key reasons for the increase in the non-GAAP net income on a sequential basis were higher levels of revenue and flattish operating expenses. The increase in the non-GAAP net income in comparison to the year ago quarter was largely from higher levels of revenue, partially offset by higher levels of operating expenses.

Now coming to the balance sheet. On September 30, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $255.2 million up from $150 million in the second quarter of 2022 and up from $144.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we conducted a primary share offering and raised $115 million, of which $109.5 million was received by the company.

Coming to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect revenues to be in the range of $77 million to $78 million. With this, our full year 2022 revenue expectations will be in the range of $307 million to $308 million or 45% to 46% growth on a year-over-year basis. We expect our non-GAAP EBITDA in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 16.4% to 17% or $12.6 million to $13.2 million. For 4Q 2022, we expect our basic share count to be in the 74 million to 75 million range and our diluted share count to be in the 77 million to 78 million range.

That concludes my prepared remarks. Bin, we’re ready to take questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

A - Bin Chiang

Thank you, Anil. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Siegler from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.

Josh Siegler

Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on the results today. So with concerns over global growth slowdown, can you provide some updated color on the robust demand environment, specifically your ability to continue to win new logos in this uncertain macro environment. What commentary are you hearing from new clients that are driving them to your services? Thank you.

Leonard Livschitz

Thank you, Josh. It’s always good to be first. You can ask any question, right. So the feedbacks we’re getting is actually what I mentioned in my remarks that the dynamics of the growth in multiple industries continues to expand geared toward the revenue generation. As we know, we’re all kind of heading to pursue a recession, kind of inflationary point or other stuff. So it’s more about the situation, where winners takes it all. So the competition for dollar become more fierce. And we see that the digital services we offer, and at both engineering, the customer service as well as the partnership with the product companies become more vital for those – securing those revenue dollars for the clients.

Josh Siegler

Excellent. Thank you for the color. And Anil, I’d love to dive a little deeper into the strong margin we saw this quarter and the guidance for 4Q, especially considering your recent focus on building out into new geographies. Can you walk us through some of the margin tailwinds that you expect as we move into the fourth quarter?

Anil Doradla

Sure. Well, there were – I mean, you meant third quarter, right? We had – and then when we go into the fourth quarter, really, when you look at it, we – there are some puts and takes you’re right. On the pluses, we continue to expect some tailwinds from the – on the FX side, right? Now on the other side, if you look at the size of the quarter, fourth quarter, as you know, we tend to see furloughs. We tend to be having fewer billable hours. So you’re going to be a little bit seeing some of the headwinds there. So when you look at the revenue, Josh, and actually extrapolate it from Q3 to Q4, you could see we are going to have – we’re going to continue maintaining some level of OpEx control. And the drop in revenue is basically kind of flows through onto the EBITDA front, you could see that. But larger the reason for there is a number of workdays. And you’re going to be seeing some level of conservativeness in terms of some of the other customers.

Leonard Livschitz

Yes. I just want to add, Josh, that the Q3 result, by and large, when I was giving the guidance to the public when we were heading IPO more than 2.5 years ago. The 40/20 is our Board deal [indiscernible] and very few companies can accomplish that. It wasn’t a strange goal then, but we were hitting a lot of obstacles over time. If world normalizes, that’s where we want to be, that’s what we will be. When the time comes to a little bit more stable growth, I think we just gave the inspiration to the community to show, where we actually able to deliver.

Josh Siegler

Great. Thank you very much.

Bin Chiang

Thank you, Josh. Thanks for your question. Next question comes from the line of Ryan Potter from Citi. Please go ahead.

Ryan Potter

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to start by touching on the situation in Ukraine and with the recent escalations there and with infrastructure instability and some plant blackouts, have you seen any incremental headwinds in terms of productivity or utilization of Ukraine and has that impacted your client conversations at all?

Leonard Livschitz

Right. So the short answer is no, but it would be too simple to answer, Ryan. Months and months ahead, we were preparing for the time what is called in Eastern Europe, the heating season, right? There is a lot of centralized activities. We, of course, did not know about the hurriedness attacks of Russians twice during October. But we knew when this whole situation, where the infrastructure being a little bit more stressed during the war, we need to be prepared in advance, which we have been, knock on wood, our people are safe. We’re adding more micro offices throughout the country. We actually plan to add up to nine of them just by the end of November, which are providing even further autonomous control over the power generators, water supply, food supply, Internet connectivity and then [indiscernible] StarLink and Other services. So we have a relatively smaller size of people. It’s still the largest location by number. But if you look at how we drive our business, the dependency of enterprise businesses in parallel has been greatly reduced from the Ukrainian operation. There are some of the – more of the business acquired from Daxx, little bit more driven by smaller companies, start-up companies, so commercial, what we call. But by and large, we are blessed to be better prepared, but you never know what’s going to happen in the future. Today, we’re comfortable to say we are in good shape.

Ryan Potter

Got it. That’s good to hear. And then touching on verticals and the Retail and TMT vertical, in particular, could you just provide an overview of like the overall trends you’re seeing? And for Retail, in particular, is the softness you’re seeing kind of industry vertical theme or is it more kind of client specific than TMT, you have like the focus on cost or hiring freezes has that led to any change trajectories with your clients?

Leonard Livschitz

Well, we’re not immune. Retail is retail. As we learned lot of lessons during the early COVID days with such an incredible decline of our relationship for a short period of time with us and department stores, we took it very seriously. Majority of our retail customers are not as much dependent on brick-and-mortar stores. So they are a little bit less affected. They are more efficient. And there is a planning to go into the recession mode, plus, don’t forget we’re close to the holiday season. At the same time, the usual suspects are putting restrictions, same suspects, who were there 2 years ago [indiscernible] 2 years, 3 years ago, so there is a sequential decline driven by cost savings. We expect it’s going to last some period of time, but we are compensating that we’re scaling other businesses. And another very important point on Retail, the [Technical Difficulty] work we do, again, is majority driven by features related to the revenue generation. So we – I wouldn’t found the chest and say we’re the most critical supplier we have. But in many cases, the core team still remains intact, which means gives you more expectations when the industry comes back, we will rebounce faster in those particular retail customers.

Ryan Potter

Got it. Thanks again.

Bin Chiang

Thank you, Ryan. Next question comes from Maggie Nolan from William Blair. Please go ahead.

Maggie Nolan

Hi, thank you. Maybe to follow-up on that last topic a little bit. Can you talk about how your retail client base compares to what it maybe looked like a couple of years ago in terms of any notable differences in the type of clients that you’re working with now or the type of projects that you’re working on?

Leonard Livschitz

Yes. So you know us quite well by now and we’ve been in constant communication. So the critical path client relationship on the retail comes from the pricing, logistics, supply chain management, some key data analytics factors, areas of efficiencies on rebalancing supply, price optimization, etcetera, etcetera. So those were key areas of our relationship. When it comes to general distribution of the clients, we actually by reducing overall revenue from the [Technical Difficulty] on the retail, we brought a number of clients, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And these clients tend to be more modernized in terms of their relationship or minimizing the impact, for example, of very painful layoffs, right? So during the COVID time, they had to shut down the stores. So the massive number of people had to be let go as employers, employees of the retailers. We don’t see it – again, distribution is different, focus of the product is different. Other thing, which you’ve noticed, again, it’s some subtlety, but I think it’s notable, we have a fewer U.S.-based employees. There is a good and better with it. But with retailers, in particular, we started with a lower cost base, and it comes from nearshoring such as Mexico and Jamaica, but it’s also offshore. And we are adding Indian contingent to that. So, we are not only prepared from the client base, type of product base, but from the cost efficiency when we relate to the retailer clients.

Maggie Nolan

That’s very helpful, Leonard. Thanks. And then my follow-up question is just can you elaborate a little bit on what you did to streamline the engineering bench, as Anil referred to? And then are these efforts going to continue into the coming quarters?

Leonard Livschitz

Yes. So, some of the bench relates to the transition from Q2 to Q3 when we exited Russia was kind of catch up some of those tools. So, that was one area. The other area is that we tend to look at, again, our bench with the skill set, which we project to be less relevant for the recession time to be more efficient. But at the same time, we have an incredible investment into internship programs, so everywhere across all the countries, obviously, including Ukraine and others. We signed university partnership in India already and in Mexico, and of course, Poland, Romania and Armenia. There are other investments, which we do quite a bit. We believe it’s a perfect storm for us to continue to invest into the R&D, into the sales and development, subject matter expertise. There is much more upfront preparation for our innovation proposals. So, one thing which I mentioned in the remarks, but I think it’s very important to reiterate in answering the first question was, as our clients come to the time, where winners take it all, I think on our peer group, it is also relevant for our business. So, having stronger and more efficient front-end organization with more customer consultancy capability, architecture capability just adding like life science and pharma just keep coming. It’s a great entry. We had one big customer. Now, we have two customers. This is doing quite an acceleration. That’s the factor. So, when you look at the total headcount, that’s one thing. The other one, which is not noticeable here, but it’s also relevant. There were some commercial clients from the former Daxx, which had some headcount. We had to replace or reduce because they were less relevant or several customers, which we decided not to continue relationship mutually because we were virtually renaissance of the old pre-acquisition time, which made no sense for both parties. So, if you look at the billable employees and a relevant bench, it actually has grown. But if you look at overall, you see a modest decline.

Maggie Nolan

That’s very helpful. Thank you and congrats.

Leonard Livschitz

Thank you very much.

Bin Chiang

Next question comes from Puneet Jain from JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Puneet Jain

Thanks for taking my question. So, Leonard, like the work, the projects that typically gets delayed like in retail vertical or other verticals, given the macro environment. What’s your line of sight, maybe based on the past experience when stuff got delayed? What’s your line of sight on when clients come back with those projects typically like how much like of a lag or a duration should we consider in terms of like the work that gets delayed?

Leonard Livschitz

Somewhat savvy with that. So, there are some, some few notable declines, which may be longer term not as material. Most of them happens more temporarily. So, we get ourselves into conversation with the senior leadership because obviously, we want to make sure not only our businesses continued, but their project will be continued because we can’t guarantee to keep the bench just to wait for the miracle has returned, right. So, as I mentioned earlier, Puneet, we most of the time, negotiate the core team. And they understand from the past recessions and declines, it’s very critical to maintain continuity. And that’s what we provide. But then in some cases, we find alternative projects. There are some more critical area, and our customers would like to retain their workforce. If you look at it from the big pressure perspective, we are still a fairly small company and as one of the very key client said, you guys are good and will be good across all your geographies, one of the big contentious area discussed by many of them is India because you are to sigma will be shifted to the right. In other words, the standard deviation of the value of our people will remain to be much more technically sophisticated regardless of the location. So, that gives us a little bit of leverage with the clients. And of course, there are many more color points I would be able to provide by the end of Q4 because there are some discussions to undertake. But we are entering this difficult for the industry period a bit more confident. By the way, yesterday, I was privileged to be in a small conference by your distinguished leader, Jamie Dimon and a small group of people, he was saying that regardless all the world challenges, United States is probably the more shielded one because we owe that to ourselves. We spend money, which we built into our savings account more than ever. And when other people need to cover the debt with the dollars, they need to earn, we covered the debt with dollars we have. That very much resonates with my thinking about how we approach our business.

Puneet Jain

And then second, for your tech vertical, it was great to see like the vertical being so strong despite all those news flow around hiring freeze, layoffs at some of the large tech companies. How should we think about like the defensiveness of the work you do for your technology clients? Is it like the nature of work that you do that’s driving growth or that’s relevant for clients, or is it like just the type of projects like that’s changing within that vertical, maybe you are doing more cost saving projects for them instead of maybe digital transformation in the past. Like what’s driving strong growth impact? And how defensive that can prove to be?

Leonard Livschitz

Well, I don’t want to anger my big customers that I am going to go into a lot of details. They are probably going to read the transcripts as well. So, I am not going to say my guys are the best in the world. That’s kind of a cheap topic [ph]. We have very high capable team. The most important part, I know there are some of the other earnings calls in the past few days, and I kind of read some – most of them. I don’t see that turns into cost savings from the big tier guys. Of course, the cost saving is there, but it’s all about mainstream operational capabilities. So, when I talk about one of the largest customer, there is a lot of articles, where the headsets – the handsets are produced and how it works and what’s the supply chain logistics. We have been way front of those kind of elements. Also, very humbled, we have been elevated to a very senior level people. Sometime it’s scary when you get to the front of this very large decision-maker, multibillion-dollar project, but they take it seriously because, again, we are technically contributing to very strategic elements, and those elements are growing. So, I would not say we are on a defensive development for the cost savings. I think we are, again, driving the key elements, which necessitate areas, which today relates to the manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, their e-commerce, their optimization areas. And that’s just what we do. So, digital is still there, which we can talk forever, what elements are involved. But I believe very bullish that all these challenges, our core value remains to be unwavered.

Puneet Jain

Thank you.

Bin Chiang

Thank you, Puneet. Next question comes from the line from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead.

Bryan Bergin

Hi guys. Good afternoon and thank you. So, you had good strong momentum here in the new logos that you were citing there. I am curious, are the priorities of these new clients, the programs that you are engaged with them, is it any different with these new engagements relative to your existing base as it relates to efficiency programs versus those typical growth and revenue generation initiatives?

Leonard Livschitz

Yes, Bryan, the disadvantage to be later in the queue, right. Yes. I tried to answer this question already several times. But I know where it’s coming from and I respect it. I think the efficiency portion was beyond the revenue generation. It’s just the way how revenue is being generated for some of those notable clients are very different. I would not divulge into the specifics because it’s very sensitive to their specific strategies. But I have to assure you what they are asking us to do is revolutionary different how – from how they generate the business before. We don’t get call a very senior leadership to provide services for something linear because they have plenty of suppliers of doing this. So, it’s really truly aligned what we have done in some other businesses as well.

Bryan Bergin

Okay. And then just talk about current visibility in the business that you have, is it any different right now versus a typical year at this stage of the year? Any early indications as you think beyond 4Q, any guideposts?

Leonard Livschitz

Yes. I have been prepared for that. You already asked this question in my earlier conference today, right. So, I could ask Anil to repeat the question. We see the growth of the return to profitability and – sorry, to the increased revenue starting second half of next year will be a pleasure isn’t. So, I ask you not to say that to you. But we see similar trends. In terms of the Q4, you’ve noticed we came out with a very modest decline from Q3 to Q4 sequentially. It’s a bit unusual for us. And the reason we have done it is because even there is a little bit of a variance of visibility [Technical Difficulty] we can have December with few furloughs. Again, we are still a smaller company and the big company variance in around holiday season may make an impact. So, I am not implying that our numbers are way too conservative. They are somewhat conservative. But I believe that there will be some fight for battlefield for the ground with many customers will remain in Q1. Again, now you are talking about not guidance, but Leonard Livschitz. What I do believe, my company goals for 2023 are quite aggressive. And before I was surprising all of you guys because Anil, you mentioned what 45% to 46% year-over-year. In my better years, I would have never dared to say that because anything over 20% year-over-year, you are not, well, we are. And I have a very streamlined, that’s why I was like crazy into the sales, marketing, SMEs, technology innovation. Thank god we have money for both innovations and for M&As, as we come in soon. But the short-term tactics, we have prepared for the very, very tight competitive work for the Q1 as well. It doesn’t limit my optimism, but this makes our ground work much more useful for us.

Bryan Bergin

Okay. It makes sense. Thank you, guys.

Bin Chiang

Thanks Bryan. Next question comes from Mayank Tandon from Needham. Your line is open. Go ahead.

Mayank Tandon

Hi, Leonard. Hi Anil. I wanted to just maybe drill into utilization. Where was it in the current quarter? What is the trend line you are expecting given maybe some of the moderation in demand? And then I guess what I am really getting at is when do we see hiring ramp back up in terms of when you see demand start to improve, how much sooner do you have to start ramping up recruiting to be able to meet that demand? So, maybe a couple of questions sort of all lumped in around utilization and recruiting plans.

Leonard Livschitz

Right. Let me answer the easy part and I have Anil to struggle with the numbers, right. So, the recruiting ramp has not been slowing down. It’s just been modified in terms of the regional strategy. There are areas, where we continue to push very hard for the growth. One of the notable example is India. You know that contractually people are required to stay for several months before they can change the job. So, those offers are being made. So, those places we are definitely continuing to push for expedite roll out. Poland is another good example, obviously, because we believe that down there, early part of next year, we will see that kind of a – the churn, and then we need to run very quickly. And I don’t want to run unintelligent though we need to prep people with very high technical level of training. So, you see a little bit of this gap because we are not only hiring insurance, but we are planning for the bench. Now, as we become bigger, we needed to become more intelligent because my inspiration is going to a significant increase of the revenue of the company. So, we need to play a little bit of long passes, little throws, right, so, to catch in – the zone of your competitors. So, we need to run very prepared the new capabilities. So, the bottom line we have not slowed down on the strategic hiring. We are not slowing down on training of the people. You just see the same readjustment of the workforce so to see. And of course, another thing is we are much more competitive of scaling of hiring, so we can hire on that in various locations better before. We will be adding new countries. Again, I want to save some sensations in three months, otherwise too boring. But we planned that way ahead of the time in various locations as well. But now the floor is yours.

Anil Doradla

Yes. So, Mayank, when it comes to utilization this quarter, it trended up relative to last quarter. In my prepared comments, I did talk about the billable headcount going up, and we talked about the bench and all of that, so a lot of moving parts. Net-net, our utilization went up.

Mayank Tandon

Alright. And then maybe just turning to the supply side, given that, again, there seems to be some moderation in demand that does tend to ease some of the supply pressures, so, could you just talk about where attrition is today, your expectations around that? And do you think wage inflation might also start to maybe ease a little bit, which should help profitability in the face of maybe slightly slowing demand?

Leonard Livschitz

Again, it’s interesting. If you look at the cyclical behavior during the Q3 and starting in Q4, demand is not slowing. Demand is continuing to be strong. On some of the existing business, there is some softness, right. So, there is kind of reallocation of assets, right. And that’s even more difficult task than just flat, right. So, we are doing well. In terms of the supply attrition is probably one of the lowest level, the voluntary attrition as we experienced, again, in certain regions, there are comfort region, we are helping people tremendously. There is no reason for people to run. In other regions, that people anticipate some of this. In some other places, we’re a little bit newbies with a very well, newly hired, very advanced leadership team. So, people are kind of walking to us to see if we are going to be any different from the other employers. So, Anil, do you have any color on the [Technical Difficulty]. Overall, I feel very comfortable at this point now. Anil?

Anil Doradla

So, from a number of point of view, we are not going to quote it, but directionally, voluntary went down. Last couple of quarters, obviously, we had some involuntary component, as we moved out of some places. But as Leonard pointed out, it was a nice drop from a voluntary point of view this quarter.

Mayank Tandon

Alright. Thank you so much for taking my questions.

Anil Doradla

Thank you.

Bin Chiang

Thank you, Mayank. At this point, we have no more questions in the queue. That will be all of the Q&A session for today. I will now pass the call back to Leonard for the closing comments.

Leonard Livschitz

Thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. Our solid results and performance highlight our company’s strong value to customers and incredible resilience. Our track record of successfully delivering large and complex projects and our reputation as a high-end engineering provider is driving our growth. I am confident that in the course of 2023, we will continue to see strong momentum, as the company continues to expand our relationship with global enterprise customers. I look forward to giving you a business update early next year. Thank you.

Operator

Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Gibraltar Industries Quarter Three of 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is my pleasure to introduce your host, Carolyn Capaccio of LHA. Please go ahead.

Carolyn Capaccio

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me on the call is Bill Bosway, Gibraltar Industries' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Murphy, Gibraltar's Chief Financial Officer.

The earnings press release that was issued this morning as well as a slide presentation that management will use during the call are both available in the Investors section of the company's website, gibraltar1.com. As previously noted, Gibraltar classified the processing equipment business in the Agtech segment as held-for-sale with first quarter 2022 results and has removed the related revenues and expenses from the processing business from adjusted results.

Gibraltar's earnings press release and remarks contain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables of reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted financial measures can be found in the earnings press release that was issued today.

Also, as noted on Slide 2 of the presentation, the earnings press release and slide presentation contain forward-looking statements with respect to future financial results. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and the company's actual results may differ materially from the anticipated events, performance or results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Gibraltar advises you to read the risk factors detailed in its SEC filings, which can be accessed through the company's website.

Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Bosway. Bill?

William Bosway

Thanks, Carolyn. Hey, good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. We'll start with an overview of our third quarter results. Tim will take you through our financial performance, and then I'll come back and update you on our outlook for the rest of the year. And then we'll open the call for your questions.

So let's get started by turning to Slide 3 titled Third Quarter 2022 Results. 2022 continues to unfold in line with our expectations. And we delivered a strong quarter with adjusted revenue up 6%, adjusted operating income up 16%, adjusted EBITDA up 14% and adjusted EPS up 19% to $1.12 per share. All 4 of our segments delivered double-digit operating margin performance, and the Residential and Infrastructure businesses both generated solid revenue growth as well.

In our Residential business, we acquired Quality Aluminum Products, which broadens our geographic channel and product footprint for the business. And Quality Aluminum Products added $0.02 to our adjusted EPS in the quarter. Our backlog decreased 7% during the quarter to $356 million driven by lower backlog in our Renewables and Agtech businesses.

As we experienced during the second quarter, it remains challenging for our renewables customers to finalize contracts and schedule projects as the solar panel supply chain learns how to work through the new UFLPA importation requirements. UFLPA went into effect in June, and the industry expects to see more efficiency, reliability and scale with importation process in the first half of 2023.

In our Agtech business, although project design and quote activity is robust, backlog was down at the end of the quarter when compared to last year's strong order inflow. But we anticipate new bookings to increase as we finish 2022.

Focus on our five key performance initiatives have not changed. And given our year-to-date results and current demand profile, we are raising the lower end and narrowing the range of our GAAP and adjusted EPS outlook, and we're also reaffirming our outlook for consolidated revenue.

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll talk a little bit about commodity prices, supply chain and general inflation. Hot-rolled coil steel and aluminum spot prices have corrected further as global and regional demand and supply becomes more aligned. And we've also seen slight improvement in structural and plate steel spot prices. In general, steel and aluminum spot prices remain above pre-pandemic levels. And other cost inputs, labor, transportation, et cetera, remain inflated and are expected to continue in the near-term.

Our supply chain is performing better, and we continue to focus on reliability and consistency as we accelerate customer service levels and improve working capital performance. We also continue to work diligently to balance price actions and input costs in a timely manner, accelerate our 80/20 initiatives for productivity and cost reduction, and manage and optimize contract terms with our customers.

Let's move to Slide 5 for an update on the panel supply for the solar industry. So the two trade issues impacting solar panel supply. The UFLPA enforcement continues to have the greatest near-term impact on customers' ability to move forward with projects. Just as a reminder, the UFLPA was implemented in late June and is enforced by the U.S. Custom & Border Protection.

And while customers continue to work with CBP to understand documentation requirements, panel input -- import flow and availability has remained a challenge for customers. Our industry contacts concern progress is being made, albeit slower than expected, and expect panel flow to improve in the first half of 2023.

On the second issue, the Department of Commerce delayed its preliminary ruling on the AD/CVD investigation from late August to later this month, November 22, and with its final ruling now expected in April of 2023. We still expect the DOC's preliminary ruling will provide solid direction to the industry and what to expect in the final ruling.

Keep in mind, administration has instructed the DOC to implement a 2-year waiver on tariffs, and we expect the DOC will execute in order to do so in conjunction with or around the time of the DOC's preliminary ruling on the AD/CVD case.

I'd say despite the near-term impact of these trade issues, given the role solar energy production continues to play in U.S. energy policy, the ongoing investment in the industry, the size and growth of the industry and the substantial increase in incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act over the next 10 years, we really remain very excited about our future in this industry and expect the U.S. solar industry to accelerate even faster. And we're also in a very good position to accelerate our business as well.

So with that, I'll turn it over to Tim for a review of our results.

Timothy Murphy

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our consolidated segment results, starting on Slide 6. Adjusted third quarter revenue increased 6.4% to $389 million. Approximately half of this growth was organic and was driven by participation gains in price management in the Residential segment, partially offset by continuing end-market supply chain challenges and project delays in the Renewables and Agtech segments. And the other half resulted from the inclusion of our acquisition of Quality Aluminum Products in the Residential segment, which we completed in August.

Backlog at quarter end was $356 million, down approximately 7% from third quarter 2021, driven by customers' waiting greater visibility on near-term solar panel availability and project timing in Agtech, partially offset by continued demand in Infrastructure. Adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA dollars increased 16.2% and 14.2%, respectively, in the third quarter with adjusted EPS up 19.1%.

Margin improvements in the business were driven by participation gains, price management, business mix and 80/20 initiatives with Renewables, Agtech and Infrastructure margins continuing to expand and Residential margins down slightly. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 3.7% to 31.8 million in the third quarter through our share repurchase program, which I'll discuss in a moment.

Now let's review the segments starting with Slide 7, the Renewable segment. Revenue decreased 14.7%, and our backlog was down 9% as customers remain in a holding pattern on existing and new projects as they look for improved visibility on solar panel availability. Our customer project planning activity is very strong and is accompanied by a robust pipeline of contracts in process.

As a reminder, we only include actual orders with signed contracts and deposits in our backlog. Purchase orders without a signed contract and deposit and our verbal agreements with customers are not and have never been included in our new bookings or project backlog.

Profitability continued to improve with adjusted operating margin of 12.9%, up 150 basis points over last year and 590 basis points sequentially, while adjusted EBITDA improved 190 basis points over last year and 570 basis points sequentially. Improvement was driven by project management, price/cost alignment and field operations efficiencies. We expect continued improvement -- we expect continued improved execution to drive margins throughout the remainder of the year.

Our integration is on track and accelerating, and our common ERP system is providing better visibility and enabling us to accelerate implementation of best practices in our supply chain. Our in-sourcing initiatives are underway and expected to provide better flexibility to meet customer demand.

Let's move to Slide 8 to review our Residential segment. Segment revenue increased 25.7% with 19% organic, representing our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Quality Aluminum Products, which we acquired in August 2022, contributed an additional 6.7% of growth, and performance is expected in the quarter. Organic revenue was driven by pricing carryover from prior quarters and participation gains, particularly in our roofing and related repair businesses.

We are experiencing normal seasonal demand patterns and have begun to see some initial incremental repair demand from Hurricane Ian. As a reminder, 80% to 90% of our Residential business is driven by existing home repair, either because of aging or weather damage. Historically, home repair has not seen significant impacts from changing interest rates. Repairs, especially the roof, typically occur regardless.

We remain engaged with customers about their plans and expectations over the next few quarters, keeping a keen eye on any changes in demand. Segment adjusted operating income and EBITDA grew 22.6% and 21.6%, respectively. Adjusted operating EBITDA margin contracted 40 and 60 basis points, respectively, due to the inclusion of our recent acquisition, QAP.

On an organic basis, our margins were essentially flat with last year as operational improvements were offset by unfavorable product mix. Going forward, we expect QAP margins to improve as we execute our integration plan and implement 80/20 with the QAP team. Our initial integration work is progressing, and our new team members are very engaged in the process.

Last quarter, we went live on SAP in our mail and package business, which will improve operations with more scalable and effective systems and processes. We will continue our SAP investment as we strengthen each operation with common systems and processes and data and analytics to leverage supply chain, 80/20 initiatives, material management, customer service and connectivity, and our brand. We are on track to achieve our objectives for top and bottom line growth for this business this year.

Let's move to Slide 9 to review our Agtech segment. Adjusted revenue decreased 7.3% as project schedules primarily in produce continued to shift. The commercial business continues to be robust with good momentum, and the cannabis business is strengthening as we see progress on regulatory legislation in many states.

After growing 30% last quarter, backlog decreased 7% against a strong comparison last year. Demand remains strong, and we continue to have a number of sizable projects in the final planning stages. We continue to expect accelerating momentum for the remainder of the year and into 2023.

Segment adjusted operating and EBITDA margins improved 200 and 230 basis points, respectively, as the benefits of higher-margin backlog converted into a stronger business mix, improving price/cost management, continued improvements in supply chain, 80/20 and lean initiatives. As a result of these improvements, we expect steady performance as we end the year. With respect to the process equipment sale, we made in active discussions, and we'll provide updates when we have them.

Let's move to Slide 10 to review our Infrastructure segment. Segment revenue increased 9.1% on timing of project work and increased non-fabricated product demand. Order backlog increased 11%. We expect increased spending related to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to continue to impact us positively through the end of this year and into 2023.

Segment adjusted operating income increased 62.5% and operating and EBITDA margin 380 and 370 basis points, respectively, driven by price material cost management, volume leverage, positive mix and improved operating execution. We expect margins to improve on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2022 as projects negatively impacted by plate steel inflation are completed.

Let's move to Slide 11 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. At September 30, we had $273 million available on our revolver and cash on hand of $22 million. We generated $38 million in cash from continuing operations in the quarter. And excluding QAP, we invested $5.9 million in working capital during the quarter. This represents a decrease of $59.3 million from the $65.2 million we invested in the prior year quarter when we are managing for disruptive supply chain.

Current quarter's investment was driven by reductions in receivables and inventory were offset by decreases in payables and other liabilities. The disruption in supply chains has taken longer to moderate, causing a delay in our plans to further reduce inventory investment.

The reduction in accounts payable was affected by the timing of inventory purchases during the quarter in terms of suppliers. And the reduction in other liabilities was driven by a decline in billings of excess of costs, which results from the timing of billings based on contractual project billing schedules and customer deposits as we continue to work on projects in-house and backlog declined on lower levels of new project bookings.

During the quarter, we made a net cash investment of $51.6 million for the purchase of QAP, largely by drawing on our revolver. QAP added $24 million of net working capital, $15 million in inventory, $20 million of receivables and $11 million of payments. We expect to optimize QAP's working capital investment during integration. Our net leverage at quarter end remained approximately one-two turn.

During 2021 and early 2022, we invested in inventory to ensure strong support for our customers' needs during the current supply chain challenges, which enabled us to increase our participation. However, ongoing extended lead times in the supply chain have required us to keep inventory levels higher than we expected. As a result, we've reduced our target for 2022 free cash flow generation to approximately 6% of revenue from 10% to account for the delay in inventory reduction.

We continue to expect strong cash flow generation for the remainder of the year with continued improved earnings and reduction in working capital investment. And as always, we expect to use generating cash flow to fund investments in organic and inorganic growth along with opportunistic stock repurchase, supplemented as needed by use of our revolver depending on timing of any M&A or repurchases during the remainder of the year.

Let's move to Slide 12 to update you on our share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we repurchased 138,500 shares with a market value of $5.5 million or an average price of $40. We funded this repurchase through the revolver. Quarter end, we had 31.5 million shares outstanding with a weighted average of 31.8 million during the third quarter.

Now I'll turn the call back to Bill.

William Bosway

Thanks, Tim. Let's move to Slide 13 for an update on our key priorities. Simplify and Focus. The journey continues for us, and we are staying the course and really trying to focus on what we can control. The last 24 months have been a tremendous learning experience for our team. And given the ever-changing end market macro environment, it's really forced us to assess and challenge many of our operating paradigms.

I believe we've made solid progress with change management in each of our businesses, and we have plenty more opportunity in front of us. Relative to our priorities, as I said, they have not changed.

First and foremost, driving 80-20, at service speed, winning new business, productivity and costs, expanding margins and good cash performance; secondly, managing supply chain to minimize disruption, but also optimize cost and reduce our working capital; third, accelerate our digitization in our operations.

It's quote to cash, it's customer service levels, it's supplier connectivity and it's cybersecurity; fourth, improving organizational health, agility and flexibility to operate in this current environment and create the best environment we can; and then finally, just continue to conduct business the right and responsible way every day.

Let's turn to Slide 14, and we'll review our 2022 guidance. So as mentioned at the beginning of today's call, given our performance to date and our current demand profile going into the fourth quarter, we are raising the lower end and narrowing the range of our GAAP and adjusted EPS outlook. Our outlook for consolidated revenue remains $1.38 billion to $1.43 billion compared to $1.32 billion in 2021. We now expect GAAP EPS to range between $2.90 and $3 compared to $2.25 in 2021. And adjusted EPS is expected to range between $3.30 to $3.40 compared to $2.86 in 2021.

Now I want to switch gears and talk briefly about 2023. We're currently engaged in our annual budget planning process, and we will finalize our plan in December. I'd say the macro environment continues to be dynamic. Our end markets are evolving, and our customers are working through their respective plans as well. With general market and customer input, let me share some of my initial observations on our end markets. Let's start with renewables.

The market is expected to grow with a slower first half, accelerating in the second half as panel supply improves. Inherent end-market demand remains strong as customer planning activity is high with a robust project pipeline. Key commodity prices are coming down, and the Inflation Reduction Act should provide positive impact in 2023 once the final guidelines are published.

Switching to Residential. I think the market is returning to its normal seasonality and moving toward traditional normal growth rates. As a result, the level of business in the fourth and first quarter will be lower than what has been experienced in recent years. Interest rates and inflation will continue to impact new housing construction, while housing repair activity should remain relatively solid. Improved supply chain reliability will help optimize channel inventory, and market prices will begin to shift downward as input cost decline and inflation is less impactful.

In Agtech, similar to Renewables, there's a strong customer planning activity and robust project pipeline evolving. Consumer demand for fruits and vegetables remain solid and will drive produce growers to invest in more growing capacity. The momentum in the commercial market will continue, and investment in cannabis growing capacity will increase as we see progress in regulatory legislation in many states.

And then finally, Infrastructure. Infrastructure bill will continue to drive market demand as state DOTs have better visibility of and access to funding over the next 5 years. Airport authorities are also in a stronger position to fund general runway maintenance similar to pre-pandemic levels.

As mentioned earlier, for us, it's going to continue to be about simplify and focus and focusing on what we can control. Our strategy is solid. Our priorities have not changed. We have a lot of work to do as markets evolve, a lot of opportunity in front of us as well. And I think we also have a lot to be proud of and thankful for.

And lastly, I just -- I really do want to mention our teams in Florida and their families, many of which live and work in the Fort Myers area where Hurricane Ian made landfall. I'd say everyone on our team was impacted in some way by Hurricane Ian. And everybody, fortunately, was able to remain safe during the storm.

There are a ton of stories to tell, but I will say this group is special. A month after the storm hit our folks today continue to deal with damage to their homes and communities, and they have spent countless hours helping others recovers and find support. And in the midst of all of this, our teams continue to manage the business and take care of our customers. It really does make me incredibly proud to have this group of folks in our team. It's the kind of folks that make Gibraltar who we are. So I just want to get them a shout-out.

Now, hey, let's open up the call and we'll take your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Daniel Moore of CJS Securities.

Dan Moore

Maybe we'll start with the resi side of the business. If you said this, I was a little late to the call, so I apologize. The 19% organic growth, what was pricing versus volume during the quarter?

William Bosway

Yes. Same mix, Dan, as we've been experiencing where it's a combo with price still being the main driver, but volume hanging in there as well. And that volume is coming through, again, participation gains that we've been winning over the last year or so that are kind of continue to read through at this stage.

Dan Moore

Helpful. And what are you hearing from your resi customers in real time, including big-box retailers? Any inventory reductions given incremental uncertainty and just kind of sequential order trends monthly into Q3 and into Q4?

William Bosway

Yes. On a volume basis, I don't think we've seen at the big-box level a change in volume over the last few months. That's our take based on what we see at POS. I think what I mentioned during the call was the last couple of years, we have really not seen the normal seasonality in Residential business as you would have seen the last 50 years, the patterns, if you will, mainly because the supply chain was such a challenge around the world.

So we never got a break in Q4 and Q1 the last two years. I think as the economy has started to slow, that seasonality will come back into play, which is fully expected. We thought that was going to be the case coming into this year. So that's part of this. And then I think things will ramp back up as they normally would as we get into next year.

But in general, I'd say volumes at the big-box level have stayed relatively consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of months. And then when you start getting into things like Hurricane Ian and so forth, there's a lot of puts and takes as we see it in our business as well.

Dan Moore

Got it. And the corollary to that, just margins, your ability to maintain the strong margins you've had as, let's say, seasonality in [indiscernible] demand normalizes to some degree?

William Bosway

Yes. We fully expect to be able to maintain the margin performance that we've been generating. This particular quarter, relatively flat year-over-year. We had some product mix play in. QAP, as we mentioned when we acquired the company, is accretive to Gibraltar, but less margin than our core Residential business to start with.

That will change as we integrate and drive that performance upwards. So as we always say, we expect to continue to drive top and bottom line as we move forward. And our thoughts haven't changed on that front as we go into this next phase of the economy moving.

Dan Moore

All right. One more and I'll jump back in queue. But switching to Renewables. Thank you for the color, obviously, as it relates to the UFLPA and the DOC. It sounds like you still expect full year growth next year, net-net. Once we have let's say, a little bit more clarity, how long do you expect it to take for the supply to ramp back up and work its way through the channel? I mean once your customers are feeling more comfortable, does it take a quarter or two kind of for that supply to flow through and then into your business?

William Bosway

Yes. It does vary a little bit, Dan, on that front. But I would expect that you'll see based on the readiness that we know customers have now with where projects are in the planning phase, buttoning up the last 5 yards in the red zone to get the project up and running is going to move relatively quickly.

I think there's a lot of panels that are waiting to come in. And so I would expect that within a quarter, you'll start to see things start -- I think you'll start to see flow come back to more normal levels once that starts happening. I don't think it will take 6 or 9 months for that to occur. I think people are very anxious to get on with it, and it'll happen sooner than later once the panel start to flow in.

Operator

The next question comes from Ken Zener of KeyBanc.

Ken Zener

Could you talk to inventory? It seems to have had an impact on your free cash flow, and you talked about building inventory to make sure you could service your customers. But as you highlighted your Slide 4, input costs are rolling over. So can you talk to how you're managing the risk that you didn't acquire inventory that is above market value, and it will be a drag on your margins?

William Bosway

Right. So two points on inventory. When we went into the quarter, we expected some of the supply chain issues that were coming to an end in Q2 to help us as we went into Q3. I think they took a little bit longer to get worked out than we anticipated. So that forced us to keep a little more inventory on the books than we thought we were going into the third quarter. So that's that impact. And that's just a timing element of the supply chain. That's started to work itself out.

And then we've talked in the past about a price/cost alignment, how do you manage the flushing out of your current input cost while market prices start to move and change. And we anticipated coming into this year that, that would be the case with prices -- market prices starting to shift. We've assumed a little bit sooner than what's probably happened this year. But as that happens, it's just a matter of working with our customers and driving down our inventory cost that we have on the books in conjunction with how prices move accordingly.

And that's how we're managing. And it's really just customer to customer but -- in terms of how we go through this. I wouldn't suggest that we have a gigantic risk in front of us. I think our customers are partnering with us and trying to navigate through. Remember, a lot of that, that we brought in was about driving service for our folks.

And so they've been very positive in working with us because they know we brought this in for them specifically to work -- help us work through it. So our hope is that we'll be able to manage that relatively well, and we're starting to see that in Q4 and try to get ourselves really well positioned as we go into 2023.

Ken Zener

Good. And appreciate the comments around the Residential tenant trends. But focusing on renewable, which at least for me is the more difficult for me to understand business. The fact you're at 12.9% margin, it's a big difference from where you were in the first quarter and the second quarter. You talked about that kind of sustaining earlier in the year. Could you talk to, first -- you talked about Renewable, the market, not guidance, being stronger in the first half versus the second half, I believe, was your commentary [indiscernible] 2023.

William Bosway

Yes. So I think as it relates to '23, Renewables as a market will have -- I think will grow year-over-year. The growth in total for the year will be dependent on the ramp between the first and second half. The first half will be slower as people work through the UFLPA importation process.

Ken Zener

Got it. Okay.

William Bosway

Right. And so that's how that's...

Ken Zener

If it's slower, does that mean your margins second half '22 versus the first half of '22 -- I mean, is there a way to think about that? Because that's created so much, I think, volatility around your company. With your margins coming back in, does that mean your run rate in the second half is kind of not a good way to think about the first half of '23? I mean I don't want to actually a guidance. I'm just trying to understand the operating cost of the business.

William Bosway

Yes. No. So one, always remember there's seasonality in this business, and the first quarter is always the lowest because of construction around -- in the toughest weather months, right? So that's always been the case for the renewables industry. It's always been the case for our business. So that's one thing to think about.

Secondly, if you recall the first quarter of 2022, it was a very difficult quarter for us related to a lot of project movement that occurred the previous year and flowed into Q1. So from a comp perspective, I think we're in a much better position going into next year than we were this past year in regards to the top line situation.

So we're set up, I think, to -- as we said, going into the second half of this year, we expect to generate double-digit margins in this business. We expect that momentum to carry into next year. Those margins, obviously, will be stronger in Q2, three and four where you have more volume. Q1 seasonally is the lowest, is the slowest, but we're coming also against a tough Q1 and 2022 to compare with as well.

Ken Zener

Right. And then I apologize, just one last one on Renewable. Could you talk to your understanding or conversations with your clients, which are developers, which themselves, right? Try to get cost so they get their own returns? With the yield curve moving so -- well, the yield curve as well as the absolute yield, how is that affecting developers' ability to understand their cost of capital? Is that a headwind separate from all these other issues you've been facing this year?

William Bosway

Yes. I don't know if it's a new headwind, so to speak. I mean this environment has been ongoing for some time. If you think about the industry in 2021, before you started to see impact on yields fee and overall cost of capital relative to interest rates and so forth, there's unbelievable amount of inflation that hit this industry in such a large way. We talked a lot about that.

Think about hot-rolled coil steel as an example. It was $1,000 more per ton year-over-year at the same period in Q3, right? That's one of your biggest components that go into our customers' set of economics that they're looking at. So yes, you've had interest rates go up. And so cost of these projects on one hand are seeing some headwinds there.

But on the flip side, you've seen a significant amount of costs come down on -- operating costs come down as well. So there's a balance, I think, that each of our customers are looking at. Everyone has a little different profile in terms of the return that we're looking for.

But I would say just based on the amount of activity that we're engaged now, designing, developing and getting projects into the red zone, it's as active as it's ever been. And if you take that step further and look at the land that's out there that's been acquired, what it's earmarked for, I think it's still relatively robust.

And then finally, the last thing I think developers and others are thinking about is the IRA can be very impactful in 2023. So effectively, without getting into the details, there's two sets of guidelines that we'll hopefully finalize here relatively soon. One from the Department of Treasury and one from Department of Labor, as it relates to the guidelines such that you can go drive incremental benefits even more so above than where we have been historically.

So I think customers are now using that -- or factoring that into their equation as well when making these decisions. But that's a substantial upside opportunity on top of inflation coming down. So yes, interest rates are still high. But at the end of the day, there are some tailwinds that are starting to kick in that have people excited as well.

Ultimately, at the end of the day, what really matters is we've got to get panels flowing in, number one. And then I think the rest of it will start to balance itself out, at least that's our impression as we talk with many of our top customers. They're not slowing down.

Operator

The next question comes from Julio Romero of Sidoti.

Unidentified Analyst

Hello? Can you hear me there?

William Bosway

Julio, are you there? Yes. We can hear you.

Unidentified Analyst

This is Stefan Gil on for Julio Romero. I guess the question is on the Renewable segment, what do you foresee as the key variables succeeding in 2023?

William Bosway

Well, number one is panel supply for the industry. Again, that's not what we buy. It's what our customers do, and that's been a problem or challenge for really the last 4 or 5 quarters. And we're hoping that the industry, now that it has a quarter or so behind it with dealing with the new UFLPA in another quarter or so working through that. Those panels will start to flow into the country in a way that our customers are able to move forward with a lot of projects that they've been planning on. That's probably the number one.

Number two, I think, is how does inflation or things that have been highly inflated really impact the returns on their business and incent them to move faster and some of the major components, as I just mentioned earlier, coming down significantly versus where we were a year ago. That's helpful. Cost of capital is up a little bit, obviously, with interest rates. But then the Inflation Reduction Act is something that could be incrementally very beneficial for a lot of customers, and they're hoping to be able to take advantage of that in 2023 as well.

So there's a lot of moving parts and a couple of different levers there that could be pulled by customers, but those are things -- I'd say the three things that, from our perspective, that matter most for the industry as we move into 2023, and that will be a reflection of our business as well.

Unidentified Analyst

That was helpful. My second question is on the Residential segment. Can you talk a little bit about the QAP deal and the strategic rationale?

William Bosway

I'm sorry, I didn't hear the first part. Talk a little bit about the what?

Unidentified Analyst

Can you talk about the QAP deal?

William Bosway

QAP.

Unidentified Analyst

And strategic rationale behind it?

William Bosway

Oh, QAP, sorry. Yes, so -- sorry, QAP, yes. And the second part of your question?

Unidentified Analyst

The strategic rationale behind it?

William Bosway

So we acquired QAP during the quarter. They're based in Hastings, Michigan. It's a company we've known for quite a while. I spent the last 9 or 10 months having discussions with them. The rationale for us moving forward, one, it opens up the door relative to some channel opportunities. They're very big in residential wholesale, and that really helps balance our portfolio in terms of channels, wholesale versus big box.

They get us into some geographic locations that we haven't been in historically. So we've got a geographic expansion that is very important to us. And then they bring a new set of products -- or an additional set of products that will help us with our customers, which is kind of interesting.

So there's a lot of cross-selling opportunities, whether it's core Gibraltar business selling through the QAP network to its set of customers in the wholesale channel or vice versa coming back through Gibraltar. So those are the three core pieces of rationale behind it. We felt we brought the business into the family at a good price, at the right multiple. And yes, we're excited to have them, and we're looking forward to getting through our integration and driving the synergies that we expect to see.

Unidentified Analyst

All right. So can you please speak to the margin profile of QAP? Like it seems to be below that of the legacy Residential segment. So maybe you can talk about the....

William Bosway

Yes. It is. And as...

Unidentified Analyst

Can you talk about the opportunity, if any?

William Bosway

Yes. We expect to bring the margins up more in line with where our historical performance is in our core business. It's going to take a little time. We've got pretty good synergies that we see starting to flow in that will be impactful in 2023, their supply chain, in particular, getting our 80/20 operating system into the organization, which they've actually already started even before we finished the acquisition.

So this is a good business that has inherently a better margin profile than what we acquired, but there are some things that we can bring to the table, help get them there. But I would expect them to start creeping more towards our core margin profile performance as we move into 2023 or exit 2023. So it will take a little time, but we will get there.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Walt Liptak of Seaport Global.

Walter Liptak

Well, I wanted to ask -- thanks for the 2023 outlook that you gave at the end of your remarks. And if we kind of look at all those things together, I wonder if you're thinking about 2023 being a revenue growth year and where you think the -- I guess with 80/20 and some of the other things that you're doing, could it be an EPS growth here as well?

William Bosway

Yes. I would say, Walt, you know as well as anybody, our view is this, is we expect to grow on both top and bottom line each year. And I think that's a reasonable expectation as we go into next year. We'll have a better view of that as we finish up the planning process. I mean trying to understand each of the quarters and what the full year is going to look like over the next, really, 1.5 months is where our focus is right now.

But our expectation going into the year based on participation opportunities that we're involved in now and that we're working on in the residential business, I think, would be very helpful. We've got to get the panel situation for the solar industry to open up and when it does, we're in a great position to really execute on that. Our Infrastructure business is humming along. And then Agtech got some really large projects that, as they come across the finish line, will -- should get us off to a good start next year as well.

So if you think about the things that drive -- think about things that drive Renewables, Agtech and Infrastructure, that's half of Gibraltar. That really is probably going to be a little bit more recession-resilient. In other words, the things that are holding back Renewables have nothing to do with the overall economy, so to speak. They have more -- there's trade issues that got to get worked out.

So given the IRA out there pushing even incremental benefits there, I think -- we think that will accelerate as the panel situation gets worked out. That's a good news story, not just next year but going forward. Infrastructure has got a 5-year support plan in place with the infrastructure bill that's out there now, and we're starting to see the impact of that.

And Agtech is just really about people's demand for fruits and vegetables and our commercial business, which are the two pieces that really drive that. Those aren't necessarily related to some of the broader macro things in a lot of ways.

And then the Residential, for us, it's about repair. New housing has been a drag for 10 months now. So I think we entered this coming year knowing that, that was going to be the case. And so again, it gets back to how do you drive participation. QAP gives us some incremental growth. And then managing your price/cost and doing that through 80/20 initiatives and other productivity efforts, I think that we're set up for -- to have a solid year in 2023. And we'll give you more -- we'll shed more light on that here early next year when we come out with the plan.

Walter Liptak

Okay. And in the Residential segment specifically, the comments that you made about Hurricane Ian sounded a little bit mixed. And I wonder why that was or if that was the case. And if you have any damage data or roof replacement data that -- from that hurricane. And then going back up to like the 50,000-foot level on Residential, could 2023 be a growth year in dollars or organics because you've got some of your raw material costs moving around as you talked about earlier?

William Bosway

Yes. Sorry, the second question, be a growth year in dollars or what? What did you -- what was the second part?

Walter Liptak

Yes. I mean if you've got some deflationary metal prices, Residential will be down because of that as opposed to organic growth.

William Bosway

Yes. So first one, Hurricane Ian, sorry, I didn't -- maybe I wasn't -- didn't mean to be unclear. That has -- we're seeing the impact of that. We start to see that almost immediately. The degree of the impact, it takes time to evolve because the first month or two or six is all about cleanup and then understanding the magnitude, but we -- the damage and then the repair and then how quick can that repair based on just having the labor available, et cetera, et cetera, to kind of work through these things at a major storm like this.

So we've been helping our wholesalers and retailers quickly respond to the needs, and that has started. How long that lasts? That could be months, could be a year. It really depends on storm by storm and magnitude of damage. But we've already started to see impact from it, and we're responding accordingly.

And I will say just again, a shout-out to our teams that are supporting right now. We're sending water and other supplies to wherever our shipments are going for whoever needs it on the back of every truck or what we're [indiscernible]. So you've got situations where you're delivering trucks to parking lots because the stores don't have either the store is damaged or they don't have enough space inside because they're gearing up for all the work that has to be done.

So we'll get more clarity as time goes on. It's really hard to predict and tell you what the damage or magnitude is and timing. It's just the nature of this. But we're a month or so into this, and there's still a lot of cleanup and work that's going on. But it is having an impact on our orders at this stage.

From a -- question about 2023, yes, you would expect as -- if you remember, as we went through this inflationary upward cycle, we had this constant conversation around our pricing catching up with the inflationary cost, and we drag on margins on the way up. And then finally, we flip the switch once our pricing caught up. And then that's governed oftentimes with our big box in our large retail customers through our contracts.

So as things come down, you have the same type of discussion. So market prices will bring down revenue on the top line as they subside. That's -- we've got that baked into our thought process. Like I said earlier, we thought that was going to happen earlier this year than it did, but we fully expect that in our plan going into next year. We offset that through things like QAP and other participation gains.

So I do think we can continue to grow into next year despite market prices coming down, hitting the top line. We'll offset that through volume pickup, through participation gains and the full year effect of QAP. So yes, we feel like there's an opportunity to grow in 2023. We've got some work to do, but it's absolutely our intent to get there.

Walter Liptak

Okay. Sounds great. And then switching over to Renewables. The Q&A that we already have about the double-digit 2023 operating margin, it sounded to me like you were saying that that's what you're expecting, the double-digit operating margin for 2023, but not in the first quarter, later on in the year, like second quarter and second half. Is that right?

William Bosway

Yes. So think of it this way, we said coming into the second half, we would run double digit second half. And so that gives us the momentum going into next year. Next year, our intent is to run double digit for the year. We got to finalize those plans. But if you kept that momentum going into next year, that's great. But there is seasonality in this business, right?

Q1 is always the lowest revenue quarter for the industry because of construction in January, February, particularly for us. We do a lot in the Northeast and the East Coast. So it's always been our lowest quarter. So the margin in Q1 will not be necessarily reflective of the full year.

I think the full year, we have a line of sight. We're going to continue the momentum that we've had in 2022 and drive that forward. If we do so, then we'll get back to the performance that you saw in 2020, which if you recall was 12%, 13% operating income. So we think that's very reasonable.

And just to remind everybody, if you think about this quarter, revenue was down 14%, almost 15%, versus last year. And we drove an operating performance that was much better than we had last year. And a lot of it has to do with just getting into the systems and aligning price/cost and our field operations and field efficiency work that the team has been doing over the last really year.

So if you can generate that type of operating performance when you're down 15% in a particular quarter, I think that gives you some confidence that we're in a good position to follow through whatever comes our way. And now and as panel supply starts to open up, that flowing through with some cadence will really -- we're set up to do really well in that environment. So yes, we expect to have a solid year in renewables next year as well.

Walter Liptak

Okay. Yes, that sounds great. Yes, we did notice that the revenues were down in Renewables, and it was a nice operating margin. And I guess that's why I was thinking about double digits for the first quarter because if you can flex cause or be productive even on lower revenue in the first quarter, maybe you can get to the double digits as well.

William Bosway

Yes. Well, we'll -- as we finish up our plans and we'll have a better idea of what that's going to look like. As I talked earlier, recall, this year was a tough Q1. So I think you'll see a marked difference in performance -- operating performance in Q1 versus Q1, but that's mainly because we had a very difficult Q1 this year. But I think as we've always seen in Q2, three and four, with two and three being your most busy quarters, that's where typically the business generates its highest margins during the year. And that's more volume.

Republican before a rally with Senator Marco Rubio and other Florida Republican politicians and candidates competing in the US 2022 midterm elections in West Miami, Florida. Credit:AP The campaigns show not only how vulnerable the American political system remains to foreign manipulation but also how purveyors of disinformation have evolved and adapted to efforts by the major social media platforms to remove or play down false or deceptive content. Last month, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an alert warning of the threat of disinformation spread by “dark web media channels, online journals, messaging applications, spoofed websites, emails, text messages and fake online personas.” The disinformation could include claims that voting data or results had been hacked or compromised.

The agencies urged people not to like, discuss or share posts online from unknown or distrustful sources. They did not identify specific efforts, but social media platforms and researchers who track disinformation have recently uncovered a variety of campaigns by Russia, China and Iran. Recorded Future and two other social media research companies, Graphika and Mandiant, found a number of Russian campaigns that have turned to right-leaning Gab, Parler, Getter and other newer platforms that pride themselves on creating unmoderated spaces in the name of free speech. Russian trolls seek to aid Republicans in hopes they will lessen US support for Ukraine. Joe Biden said the NATO alliance will support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. Credit:Bloomberg These are much smaller campaigns than those in the 2016 election, where inauthentic accounts reached millions of voters across the political spectrum on Facebook and other major platforms. The efforts are no less pernicious, though, in reaching impressionable users who can help accomplish Russian objectives, researchers said. “The audiences are much, much smaller than on your other traditional social media networks,” said Brian Liston, a senior intelligence analyst with Recorded Future who identified the Nora Berka account. “But you can engage the audiences in much more targeted influence ops because those who are on these platforms are generally US conservatives who are maybe more accepting of conspiratorial claims.”

Many of the accounts the researchers identified were previously used by a news outlet calling itself the Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has previously linked the news outlet to the Russian information campaigns centred around the Internet Research Agency. Yevgeny Prigozhin, left, and Vladimir Putin in 2011. Prigozhin, known as “Putin’s chef”, owns the IRA troll farm. Credit:AP The network appears to have since disbanded, and many of the social media accounts associated with it went dormant after being publicly identified around the 2020 election. The accounts started becoming active again in August and September, called to action like sleeper cells. Nora Berka’s account on Gab has many of the characteristics of an inauthentic user, Liston said. There is no profile picture or identifying biographical details. No one responded to a message sent to the account through Gab. The account, with more than 8000 followers, posts exclusively on political issues — not in just one state but across the country — and often spreads false or misleading posts. Most have little engagement but a recent post about the FBI received 43 responses and 11 replies, and was reposted 64 times.

Since September the account has repeatedly shared links to a previously unknown website — electiontruth.net — that Recorded Future said was almost certainly linked to the Russian campaign. Loading Electiontruth.net’s earliest posts date only from September 5; since then, it has posted articles almost daily ridiculing Biden and prominent Democratic candidates, while criticising policies regarding race, crime and gender that it said were destroying the United States. “America under Communism” was one typical headline. Liston said that links to electiontruth.net appeared to be closely coordinated with the accounts on Gab linked to the Russians. In another campaign, Graphika identified a recent series of cartoons that appeared on Gab, Gettr, Parler and the discussion forum patriots.win. The cartoons, by an artist named “Schmitz,” disparaged Democrats in the tightest Senate and governor races.

One targeting Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, who is black, employed racist motifs. Another falsely claimed that Representative Tim Ryan, the Democratic Senate candidate in Ohio, would release “all Fentanyl distributors and drug traffickers” from prison. Loading The cartoons received little engagement and did not spread virally to other platforms, according to Graphika. A recurring theme of the new Russian efforts is an argument that the United States under Biden is wasting money by supporting Ukraine in its resistance to the Russian invasion that began in February. Nora Berka, for example, posted a doctored photograph in September that showed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine as a bikini-wearing pole dancer being showered with dollar bills by Biden.

“As working class Americans struggle to afford food, gas, and find baby formula, Joe Biden wants to spend $13.7 billion more in aid to Ukraine,” the account posted. Not incidentally, that post echoed a theme that has gained some traction among Republican lawmakers and voters who have questioned the delivery of weapons and other military assistance. Loading “It’s no secret that Republicans — that a large portion of Republicans — have questioned whether we should be supporting what has been referred to as foreign adventures or somebody else’s conflict,” said Graham Brookie, senior director of the Digital Forensics Lab at the Atlantic Council, which has also been tracking foreign influence operations. While Russians in the past sought to build large followings for their inauthentic accounts on the major platforms, today’s campaigns could be smaller and yet still achieve a desired effect — in part because the divisions in American society are already such fertile soil for disinformation, he said. “Since 2016, it appears that foreign states can afford to take some of the foot off the gas,” said Perez, who previously worked at Twitter, “because they have already created such sufficient division that there are many domestic actors to carry the water of disinformation for them.”",cybersecurity,the sydney morning herald

A year ago, attorney Alex Spiro helped rapper Jay-Z win a lawsuit over perfume royalties. This week, he was part of a team that fired thousands of Twitter employees. The 39-year-old lawyer has become a central figure in Elon Musk’s inner circle, tapped by the billionaire as one of a small group of men to enact his shock doctrine takeover of the company. Spiro has quickly risen to be one of Musk’s closest lieutenants, confidants and consiglieres.

Evidence of Spiro’s meteoric rise could be felt throughout the social media company on Thursday and Friday, when a large portion of the company’s workforce was terminated while Musk frantically tried to stop an exodus of advertisers. Musk has assumed the public face of Twitter’s overhaul, but Spiro has done a lot of the heavy lifting behind the scenes on virtually all legal matters. Musk has built an inner circle that relies on people with an indefatigable work ethic and a strong sense of loyalty, traits that Spiro embodies.

He first worked for the billionaire back in 2019, when he helped quash a defamation lawsuit brought by a British diver who Musk called a “pedo guy” during one of his Twitter fights. His role in Musk-world skyrocketed, however, after he helped lead Musk’s doomed legal argument that he should be able to back out of the legal contract he signed to buy Twitter earlier this year.

Musk would ultimately reverse himself, again, and decide to buy the company after all. That deal — which Musk closed last month for $44 billion — has launched a new chapter in Spiro’s career. Hours after Musk closed the acquisition and fired Twitter’s CEO and three other top executives, Spiro gained oversight of Twitter’s legal, marketing, and trust and safety teams, which are responsible for Twitter’s elections work, according to four people familiar with Spiro’s role who weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

The lawyer has also been involved in the plans for laying off thousands of Twitter employees, which went into fruition Thursday as the company began terminating around half of its more than 7,000 workers. Firing that many people spread over several states and countries is a gargantuan task, and layoff notices received by employees in different places were carefully tailored to avoid running afoul of local laws.

A spokesperson for Twitter did not return a request for comment. It couldn’t be learned whether Musk plans for Spiro to play a longer-term role with the company or was just brought in to be part of the immediate shake up.

Spiro isn’t the only one in Musk’s inner circle taking an active role. Jason Calacanis, an investor, podcaster and associate of Musk, has been pitching ideas for new features for Twitter and meeting with advertisers to try to assure them about the company’s new direction. David Sacks, who worked with Musk years ago at PayPal and has been a successful venture investor since then, is also on board.

But Spiro is unique in his lack of previous corporate experience. He’s been a lawyer since 2008, and though he has extensive white-collar defense experience, he isn’t a trained manager.

Musk is a lawyer’s nightmare. He tweets constantly, getting in spats with celebrities, politicians and random strangers. Sometimes his unserious musings run up against the fact that he helms several giant companies, including one that’s publicly traded, leading to lawsuits and fees.

He churns through lawyers, once cutting ties with a major law firm because they refused to fire an employee he didn‘t like. Tesla, his electric vehicle company, has had three legal heads in the past two years.

But Spiro has apparently cracked the code of working with Musk. Despite failing to extricate Musk from the Twitter deal, Spiro has been elevated even further.

Spiro has worked for years as a defense lawyer, representing some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment, including Aaron Hernandez, Jay-Z, Chance the Rapper and Naomi Osaka. His rapid rise to the center of Musk’s inner circle, and his newfound responsibility for helping run Twitter, shows how the tech billionaire prizes loyalty and tenacity over experience and a traditional skill set.

“He’s got a dogged personality and he will get after and continue to get after an issue until he gets what he wants,” said Ronald Sullivan, a professor at Harvard Law School who has had Spiro help him teach a class on trial litigation and has worked on a handful of cases with him.

While a typical partner at a corporate firm might have six or seven years-long trials going on at once, Spiro is often working 30 to 40 shorter ones at once. “He is in constant motion,” Sullivan said. “That is Alex personified, he seems to have unlimited wells of energy and he takes on all sorts of cases.”

Spiro grew up in Massachusetts and stayed local for college — studying psychology at Tufts University. While there he worked at Harvard’s psychiatric hospital, working with children with autism and Asperger’s syndrome, and considered going on to medical school, he told Harvard’s newspaper the Crimson in 2020.

But he opted for law instead, telling the Crimson he saw it as a better way to fight for the issues he cared about. He graduated from Harvard Law in 2008 and did a fellowship at the Central Intelligence Agency before getting a job as a prosecutor in the New York County District Attorney’s office. In 2013 he got a job as a defense lawyer at Brafman & Associates, a New York City law firm with big-name clients including pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli and former movie producer Harvey Weinstein.

In 2014 he represented rapper Bobby Shmurda who was charged in a 69-count indictment that included murder. The case went viral, with hip-hop fans mounting a campaign called “free bobby shmurda” that was part internet meme, part protest of the U.S. prison system.

The Shmurda case brought new media attention to Spiro. In 2016 he landed on “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” for his work representing Thabo Sefolosha, who was found not guilty of resisting arrest in an incident that broke his leg. Comedian Roy Wood Jr. presented him with champagne and a cake that said “You did it,” for winning the case. Spiro responded in a serious tone, saying he warned his client it was incredibly risky to not take a plea deal and go to trial with the case.

Since then, he’s represented a parade of famous clients. In 2016 he helped represent former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, who was standing trial for allegedly killing two men, while appealing his conviction on a different murder charge. The tragic case had a tragic ending, as Hernandez was acquitted in the double murder trial but died by suicide days later. Spiro went on to win a lawsuit for former NBA player Thabo Sefolosha against the New York Police Department for using excessive force against him. He represented several other famous people including musician and investor Jay-Z; Robert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots; and tennis star Naomi Osaka.

In 2019 he began working for Musk, who had been sued for defamation by British cave diver Vernon Unsworth. Musk had offered to build a submarine to help rescue a group of Thai teens who had been trapped in a cave, and was accused by critics online of forcing himself into the news story to get credit. The diver was part of the team who actually did rescue the boys.

During a Twitter spat, Musk called Unsworth a “pedo guy.” In court documents, Musk was quoted saying that emailing unverified information about Unsworth to a reporter in hopes it would lead to an investigation was “one of the dumbest things I’ve ever done.”

Still, Spiro won the case for him.

Since then, he’s represented Musk in a range of legal situations. He defended Musk in a fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused him of breaking an earlier agreement not to tweet about Tesla’s share price after he said online that he was taking Tesla private at $420 a share — a marijuana reference. He took on the Alameda County health department when it shut down a Tesla factory during the early months of the pandemic out of concern over coronavirus transmission. And he defended Musk in another defamation lawsuit brought by an online critic of Tesla.

He’s taken some unusual approaches in his work for Musk. In a filing in the SEC case, he quoted lyrics from the 2002 Eminem Song “Without Me.” “The [SEC] won’t let me be or let me be me so let me see,” the filing said. “They tried to shut me down …”

Advertisement

Then came the Twitter acquisition. Musk agreed to buy the company for $44 billion in April, but as fears about a recession and rising interest rates causes tech stocks to fall, his net worth shrank and analysts began suggesting the deal price was much too high.

Soon after, Musk was criticizing the company, saying it had misled investors about the number of bots and fake accounts it had. In July, he said he was pulling out of the deal, and Twitter sued him to force him to follow his signed contract and go through with it.

At the time, legal experts said Musk had a tough case, having signed the deal, waiving the right to take a deep look at the company, and committing to do everything he could to close it. Spiro and a handful of other lawyers worked to build a countersuit for Musk anyway, building on the bots argument and accusing Twitter of not providing the information it had promised him.

When The Washington Post reported in August that a former Twitter security chief was accusing the company of having bad cybersecurity practices, Spiro successfully fought for Musk to be able to amend his complaint against Twitter, arguing in court that the whistleblower’s allegations showed the company was not forthcoming during discovery.

Musk’s takeover of Twitter has been celebrated by conservative politicians and media figures as a win because the billionaire has criticized the company’s content moderation policies and said banning former president Donald Trump was a mistake. Sacks, another prominent member of Musk’s inner circle who has been active at the company over the last week, is a conservative media figure in his own right.

But Spiro is harder to pin down. He hasn’t publicly aligned himself with either political party, but he has worked with left-leaning groups on efforts to change the criminal justice system. He serves as an adviser to the charitable organization United Justice Coalition, alongside CNN commentator Van Jones and Rashad Robinson, the president of the civil rights group Color of Change, which coincidentally is one of the organizations which called for an advertiser boycott on Twitter out of concern that layoffs would affect the company’s ability to police its platform for hate speech.

He also has connections in the Washington-area. Earlier this year, he attended the White House correspondents’ garden brunch that was also attended by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Anthony Fauci and prominent media figures.

At Twitter, Spiro is already working as a conduit for Musk, a loyalist the billionaire can trust to steer the company in his absence. During the first week of Musk’s ownership, the new CEO did not hold any all-company meetings or send out an email acknowledging he was now in charge. But as workers shared intel and tried to piece together what the new normal of their company was, one name kept coming up as someone who was making decisions: Alex Spiro.

Faiz Siddiqui contributed to this report.

correction A previous version of this article incorrectly said tahat Spiro appeared on ""The Daily Show"" for his work representing Bobby Shmurda. Rather, he appeared to discuss his work representing Thabo Sefolosha. The article also incorrectly said that he represented Shmurda at trial. The article has been corrected to reflect that Shmurda's case never went to trial.

160,3 Cryptocurrencies to Avoid Like the Plague in November,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/707574/shiba-inu-dogecoin-cryptocurrency-blockchain-network-getty.jpg,06/11/2022,These widely owned digital currencies could lose most of their value.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/06/3-cryptocurrencies-avoid-like-plague-in-november/,"If you think the stock market has performed poorly over the trailing year, take a closer look at the cryptocurrency space. Since peaking at an aggregate valuation of roughly $3 trillion during the second week of November 2021, the total value of more than 21,600 digital currencies has plunged to below $1 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

While a lot of this value destruction can be blamed on Bitcoin and Ethereum, which together account for nearly 57% of the entire market cap of all cryptocurrencies, the real blame arguably lies with a multitude of other digital currency projects failing to live up to expectations.

Although cryptocurrencies are still relatively young and constantly evolving, some projects and tethered coins are clearly bad news. What follows are three popular cryptocurrencies to avoid like the plague in November.

Dogecoin

The first high-profile digital currency to keep your distance from in November is Shiba Inu-inspired meme token Dogecoin (DOGE -12.16%). DOGE tokens have rocketed higher by more than 100% since it became apparent that Tesla (TSLA -5.01%) CEO Elon Musk would close his $44 billion deal to acquire social media site Twitter.

The reason DOGE holders are excited about this deal closing is because Musk has long been a fan of Dogecoin, and has tweeted memes suggesting the token could ""go to the moon."" Musk has previously appeared on Saturday Night Live as the ""Dogefather,"" has tweeted that he'd work with developers to improve Dogecoin, and it's one of the three cryptocurrencies the Tesla boss has said he owns in his portfolio. Tesla even accepts DOGE as payment for select merchandise.

But in spite of these whimsical catalysts, there's nothing tangible in Dogecoin's sails that can remotely justify its nearly $18 billion market cap.

The biggest issue for Dogecoin is that it's ultimately just a payment coin. There's nothing particularly special about its underlying blockchain technology that would allow it to stand out in a veritable sea of digital currencies which can be used as a form of payment.

To build on this point, it's not a particularly popular payment token, either. Over the past 10-plus months, Dogecoin has added fewer than 100 new merchants on online business directory Cryptwerk. In fact, it took more than eight years for DOGE to be accepted as a form of payment by 2,000 mostly obscure merchants listed on Cryptwerk.

And as I've been pointing out for years, payment coins that deliver historic gains in a short time frame pretty much always implode not longer after. Even though DOGE has retraced as much as 93% from its May 2021 all-time high, history shows that most payment coin bubbles end in even steeper declines. Since Dogecoin offers no competitive advantages, history seems poised to win, once again.

Axie Infinity

The second digital currency to avoid like the plague in November is gaming-focused token Axie Infinity (AXS -6.76%).

All I can is what a difference a year makes, and oh how wrong I was! At this time last year, Axie was the hottest thing in blockchain-based gaming. Users would collect, raise, and battle monsters known as Axies, earning various experience points along the way. During a six-month stretch ended in mid-January, Axie Infinity generated more than $1.2 billion in decentralized application (dApp) protocol revenue, according to data from TokenTerminal.com.

Something else that helped Axie Infinity stand out at the time was allowing users ownership of their Axies via non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For decades, personal computer and console game developers retained the rights of all in-game creations. Blockchain-based gaming offered to change all that by giving users ownership of their creations, as well as the ability to monetize them.

But as I said, what a difference a year makes. Over the trailing 180 days, through Nov. 2, 2022, Axie Infinity has brought in just $1.6 million in protocol dApp revenue, according to TokenTerminal.com. The story is fairly similar from Be[In]Crypto Research, which estimates that Axie Infinity revenue plunged from $126.5 million in January 2022 to just $3.2 million by June 2022.

To add fuel to the fire, interest in NFTs as a tradeable tool/store of value has effectively fallen off a cliff. According to data from Bloomberg, monthly NFT trading volume has plunged from $17.2 billion in January 2022 to $466.9 million in September 2022. That's a 97% decline for those of you keeping score at home, and a significant detriment to a game-focused business built on the idea of NFT-character ownership and NFT marketplace transactions.

Although blockchain-based gaming may be popular in the future, Axie Infinity is wholly avoidable right now.

Shiba Inu

The third popular cryptocurrency to avoid like the plague in November is meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB -7.87%).

Shiba Inu's claim to fame is that it delivered what may well be the largest single-year gain for an investable asset in history. Based on a starting value of $0.000000000073 per SHIB coin at the stroke of midnight on Jan. 1, 2021, SHIB holders found themselves with gains topping 121,000,000% by Oct. 27, 2021. Shiba Inu eventually ended 2021 higher by around 46,000,000% after a pullback. If anything, it's the digital currency that's shown how powerful fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) investing can be in the crypto space.

But just like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu lacks the competitive advantages and differentiation that's necessary to stand out among more than 21,600 (and counting) cryptocurrency projects. At its core, Shiba Inu is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. Though Ethereum has been a popular choice among for dApp developers, this popularity has translated into relatively slow processing times and costly transaction fees. Plus, as noted earlier, there's nothing special about payment coins.

SHIB isn't a popular payment coin, either. Despite the buzz it creates on Twitter and message boards, Shiba Inu's merchant count has hardly budged this year on Cryptwerk (659, as of November 2022). That's likely a function of SHIB tokens plunging as much as 91% in value over the past year, and merchants being unwilling to accept this wild volatility.

Although Shiba Inu's developers are intent on creating blockchain-based games, the popularity of NFTs and blockchain-based gaming looks to be a ship that's sailed. The buzz that SHIB rode to big gains in 2021 simply can't provide that same level of momentum anymore.

With history the enemy of meme coins, I'd anticipate a far steeper pullback for a project that's yet to prove it's worth $6.7 billion -- or even a fraction of that.",blockchain,motley fool

In October, crypto asset prices traded in a tight range, with Ethereum outperforming major stock indices, bonds & most commodities (except heating oil & gasoline).

Crypto asset prices traded in a tight range in October, with Ethereum especially outperforming major stock indices, bonds & most commodities (except heating oil & gasoline), even as value stocks beat growth stocks for the month. The most likely reasons for digital assets’ positive performance were 1) the U.S. dollar DXY index fell in October for only the second month in the last ten months; 2) Elevated short interest and a strong equity market prompted more than $2b in leveraged short ETH & BTC positions to be liquidated on major exchanges during a three day period mid-month, including the largest daily sum since July 2021; 3) Republicans’ odds to control the Senate rose sharply in October, implying a lower chance of the US congress passing harmful regulation after the midterms; and 4) UK lawmakers voted in favor of adding crypto to the scope of activities to be regulated via a proposed Financial Services and Markets Bill, the first legislative attempt by new, purportedly pro-crypto prime minister Rishi Sunak.

For the month, ETH rose 14%, Nasdaq +4%, the MVIS Smart Contract Leaders Index +4%, and Bitcoin +4.5%.

Staying on the prospects of further dollar weakness, Saudi Arabia and China have reportedly discussed pricing some oil sales in RMB, according to the WSJ. Russia’s Secretary of State told a legal forum on October 20th that Russia would “bypass” the EU’s crypto-related sanctions and would “provide businesses with the ability to carry out cross-border settlements” making use of “cryptocurrencies, the digital ruble, or a hybrid.” And even as Egypt devalued its pound and sought IMF protection, new central bank governor Hassan Abdalla touted a new currency indicator (including gold but not the USD) meant to wean people off the U.S. dollar: “America is not my major trading partner,” he lamented. “I don’t know why people are always fixated on the dollar.” Vietnam, Nigeria, Argentina, Lebanon and China all devalued in October; all of them but Lebanon rank in the top 20 for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis’ recently updated global crypto adoption index.

Since 2009 and especially post-2020, governments, not corporate or households, have driven most of the growth in global debt. Thus, we continue to believe that government (and thus FX) failures will mark this cycle, highlighting Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, supply-constrained reserve asset that can be used as both a stranded energy sink and a geopolitical negotiating tool by frontier states with unique domestic politics. We will be speaking on this topic at the “Adopting Bitcoin” conference in El Salvador later this month, with the aim of putting some specific probabilities on countries’ likelihood of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. (For those still making the argument that digital assets are a Ponzi scheme compared to military-backed Fiat, we note that long-term inflation-linked gilts are now down 79% from their peak, exceeding the peak-to-trough decline in the Bitcoin price. Fourteen major currencies have declined more than 20% vs. the dollar this year.)

Meanwhile, amidst the tailwinds of the weaker dollar in October, we noticed some meaningful examples of mainstream adoption of crypto payment rails in the month.

Smart Contract Platforms:

The MVIS Smart Contract Leaders index rose 4% this month, with most of the gains happening in the last week. Ethereum led the sector, up 14%, largely due to short covering, as noted with the liquidation data above. As for fundamentals, despite continued lackluster volumes on-chain (demand), ETH supply has grown only +0.16% since the September migration to proof-of-stake, with negative supply growth in October. This compares to Bitcoin supply +1.7% and a 3.6% ETH inflation rate under the old proof-of-work algorithm. Defi (30%), NFTs (23%), MEV applications (2%), and layer 2s (2%) comprise the largest sources of the ~56,000 ($~84M) ETH gas fees burned in October. Interestingly, since the September merge, an increasing proportion of Ethereum outstanding has either been locked in smart contracts (DeFi, +$3b since the merge) or staked to the Beacon chain (+$1.3B). Ethereum available for sale on exchanges, conversely, has fallen by more than 1%, or $2.5B. In aggregate, Ethereum captured more than 75% of total fees paid for all space on all open-source blockchains in October, and has gained market share since the merge.

Ethereum Supply

Among competing layer 1 protocols, October saw the launch of Aptos (APT-USD), the latest high-profile attempt to build a monolithic blockchain promising a better mix of speed & cost than Ethereum. Founded by Avery Ching and Mo Shaik, who worked on Meta’s Diem project. Aptos differentiates itself from competitors by using “parallel execution” and the Move language. Parallel execution allows for multiple, simultaneous transactions to execute at the same time, allowing—theoretically—for faster speed overall. However, there are some tradeoffs to this approach, notably seen in the performance of the similarly parallelized Solana blockchain, which has had several outages this year. One difference is that Aptos smart contracts are natively written in Move, a Rust-based language initially designed for the Diem project. Move prioritizes security and scalability and consistently ranks among developers’ favorite programming languages.

On the general topic of Layer 1 blockchains and whether the ‘fat protocol thesis’ is still intact: despite the poor price performance this year of most crypto assets, developers continue to release meaningful upgrades to the open-source code of layer 1 protocols. This developer activity, which can be tracked using public github repositories, has increased year-to-date for every smart contract leader aside from Solana. Indeed, the ratio of developers working on these smart contract leaders, relative to those working on open-source blockchain protocols overall, has recently reached an all-time high, as seen in the below chart. We see this as an indication of consolidation amidst the crypto winter.

Infrastructure Applications:

The MV Infrastructure Applications Leaders Index rose 10% in October, led by continued relative strength from Quant Network (+26%) and Polygon’s MATIC token (+15%).

Polygon launched its zkEVM (zero knowledge, Ethereum Virtual Machine) testnet on October 10th. ZkEVMs are a key part of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap that improve throughput by transferring computation and state storage off-chain. ZK rollups submit transaction data to Ethereum along with zero-knowledge proofs, which verify the validity of off-chain transaction batches. Early ZK-rollups lacked the ability to execute smart contracts and were constrained to simple token swaps and payments. But, with the introduction of EVM-compatible zero-knowledge virtual machines, ZK-rollups are starting to support Ethereum dApps. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet comes amidst heavy competition but few available token options. ZkSync, another contender in the zkEVM race, launched an updated version of their scaling solution that is EVM compatible, and has been promoted as the first-ever “product-ready” rollup with a zkEVM. However, public access will be limited until the end of the year, and there is no token yet.

Polygon also benefited from its partnership with Reddit, which introduced the second generation of its NFT avatars in October. Reddit whitelisted independent artists from within the Reddit community to create the avatars and paid a share of all primary and secondary sales to creators. The avatars can be used as profile pictures on the platform and give users access to new profile animations. Reddit’s first generation of avatars was released in July and took a few weeks to sell out. Their second collection launched on October 21st and all 40k avatars were sold on the first day. The ability to own an avatar in a password-protected “vault” rather than a crypto wallet and not marketing the avatars as NFTs are two factors that led to the success of the collections. At the TechCrunch disrupt conference, Reddit chief product officer Pali Bhat revealed that users created more than 3 million Polygon-based Reddit Vault wallets to store their NFTs. The combined market cap of Reddit Avatars now exceeds $100M.

DeFi:

The MV Decentralized Finance Leaders index rose 5.6% in October, with makerDao’s MKR (+17%) Uniswap’s UNI (+14%) and Aave (+16%) leading gains.

MakerDAO is the largest defi protocol by TVL ($8.15 billion) and issuer of the DAI stablecoin, which has a $6.2 billion market cap. In October, MakerDAO members voted in favor of an “endgame” proposal by founder Rune Christensen, who wants to make the protocol more decentralized and resistant to censorship, such as the Tornado Cash sanctions. While the voting process itself was criticized for a lack of decentralization, as Christensen influenced 63% of the votes backing his proposal, it appears likely that MakerDao will vote to split into a number of MetaDAO clusters, each with its own governance token. The “endgame” also proposes that MakerDao begin to buy staked Ethereum (stETH) in order to build a balance sheet that can serve as collateral for a non-dollar-backed algorithmic stablecoin in the future. Note that the Endgame is a long-term gambit; in the short-term, MakerDao delegates recently voted to move $500M worth of DAI tokens into short-term US treasuries and corporate bonds, custodied by Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum, which will issue the funds into a portfolio of BlackRock ETFs. MakerDAO also voted in October to custody $1.6B with of the DAO’s USDC coins with Coinbase in return for an annual 1.5% reward, another example of lines blurring between DeFi and real world assets.

In other DeFi news, Aave Companies, one of the contributors developing the Aave protocol, has released a technical paper on Aave’s upcoming GHO stablecoin, along with the results of its first security audit. GHO is a decentralized, over-collateralized stablecoin that was proposed in July. Aave plans to stabilize GHO via algorithm and on-chain governance, depending on the different “facilitators” minting GHO and on the collateral pledged by borrowers, to set an appropriate rate. Facilitators refer to protocols or entities whitelisted by AAVE governance to mint and burn GHO tokens. Since Aave will employ an overcollateralization strategy, it will rely on arbitrage and monetary policy to stabilize GHO. When GHO is below $1, borrowers will be incentivized to purchase GHO at a discounted price and repay/liquidate, profiting on the difference. Conversely, when GHO is above $1, users are incentivized to borrow GHO and sell it on the market, repaying their loan once GHO stabilizes and profiting from the difference. Because GHO is minted via borrowing on the protocol, GHO cannot be used as an asset on the supply (lending) side. Also, the borrow interest rate will not dynamically adjust by the usual supply and demand mechanics. Instead, Aave Governance will set the GHO interest rate, adjusting the borrow interest rate and the discount rate depending on the collateral pledged in order to expand or contract the GHO supply. GHO is designed to accrue interest when supplied to a liquidity protocol.

GHO will have a lot of ground to cover in order to gain market share over its established competitors like Dai. However, Aave’s position as the largest DeFi protocol could help accelerate the growth of GHO’s demand and turbocharge the security and decentralization of AAVE since stkAave holders can mint GHO at a reduced interest rate. GHO’s first facilitator, the Aave Protocol, will initially allow users to mint GHO using deposited assets on its lending market. This may limit the amount of GHO that can be minted due to overcollateralization requirements. But, once GHO has shown to be stable and having sufficient demand, minting could potentially be carried out using delta neutral positions, real-world assets (RWAs), or automated market operations (AMOs), whether by the Aave Protocol itself or by another facilitator. We look forward to talking with Aave founder Stani Kulechov at a VanEck event in London on November 9th.

Lastly, in DeFi, Mango Markets (MNGO), a decentralized finance platform hosted on the Solana blockchain, was exploited for over $100 million by DeFi trader Avraham Eisenberg, who called the attack “a highly profitable trading strategy.” The gambit was enabled by Eisenberg’s manipulating the price of the native MNGO token threefold higher on an illiquid venue and then taking out a $116M loan, leaving Mango’s treasury with a negative balance. Eisenberg later negotiated a settlement with Mango leadership, which enabled depositors to be made whole while Eisenberg kept $47M. The attack raises legal and ethical questions about whether market participants need to consider the intentions of the code-writers and not just the code itself. Blockchain analytics firm Peckshield estimated 44 exploits grabbed $760M in ‘stolen funds’ in October, a record, bringing the YTD total to $3B, double last year’s sum. In a poll on Twitter, podcaster Laura Shin asked, “Is code law?”: 44% of the respondents voted “hell yeah” vs. 56%, “hell no.” In the wake of the Mango Markets attack, Solana’s TVL dropped 23% to $997 million from $1.32 billion.

Metaverse:

October metaverse land sales reversed lower after a positive September. Aggregate land value fell 8% in October, with APE’s Otherside continuing to command the highest average sale price of 3.5 ETH, down from the 4.5 ETH it averaged at the start of the month. Decentraland and NFT Worlds were the only metaverses that saw increases in volume (11.6% and 4.8%, respectively) over the past 30 days. Recent news articles have highlighted the lack of users in Decentraland specifically, something the platform hopes to turn around in November with their Metaverse Music Festival from the 10th-13th. These platforms continue to explore product market fit with regard to curated experiences.

NFT trading volume across major blockchains was mixed this month, with only ImmutableX, Polygon, and Avalanche seeing increases in trading volume of 107%, 44%, and 30%, respectively. NFT trading on ImmutableX was mainly driven by their genesis game, Gods Unchained, which accounted for over 90% of the $21.4 million of volume. ImmutableX also announced mid-month that they would reward NFT traders up to 100k IMX tokens per day to incentivize activity on the network. The increase of NFT volume on Polygon was largely a result of the popularity of Reddit’s Collectible Avatar NFTs discussed above. Avalanche’s NFT trading growth was supported by OpenSea integrating Avalanche NFTs in its marketplace and the launch of an NFT farming game, Chikn Farm. Despite these developments, the NFT volume on Avalanche was still less than 1% of the total NFT volume over the last 30 days. Solana experienced the largest decline, with NFT trading volume falling by 39%.

Centralized Exchanges:

Centralized exchange tokens continue to perform well, up 6% in October, with low volatility thanks to FTX and BNB’s continued market share gains and attractive buy-back-and-burn tokenomics. In September, Coinbase spot trading volumes fell 18% to the lowest levels since January 2021, while competitors OKX, Binance, and FTX saw their spot volumes rise 24%, 8%, and 5%, respectively.

Meanwhile Huobi token (HT) paced sector gains +106% in October after HK-based About Capital announced plans to buy a majority stake in the 8th largest exchange globally. While the transaction of an undisclosed amount crowns About Capital as Huobi’s new controlling shareholder, the exchange stated that core operations and the existing management team would remain unchanged. Justin Sun, the Tron co-founder and reportedly a major investor in About Capital, also announced he would be joining Huobi’s global advisory board, prompting the Sun’s Tron (TRX) token to outperform most layer 1s in the month.

Given these statistics, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that technology has become a critical component for ensuring the advancement of the trucking industry. Yet while GPS tracking, autonomous driving and other mainstream technologies may be apparent, a couple of organizations are aiming to bring tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFI) to the trucking sector to advance its payment systems.

Faster, fairer payments for trucking companies

Philip Schlump, chief commercial officer and lead developer of TruckCoinSwap (TCS) — a Wyoming-based fintech and freight company — told Cointelegraph that there are more than one million trucking companies and third-party logistics firms in the United States relying on banking entities to get paid. Schlump, who is also a former truck driver, explained that this has become the case due to how the full truckload industry’s payment system operates. He explained:

“When a truck picks up a full load of potatoes, for instance, a bill of lading is generated. This is essentially proof that the trucker and the trucking company are responsible for the potatoes during the shipment period. Once the potatoes are delivered, the bill of lading becomes account receivable, yet it often takes a net 30 to 180 days for trucking companies to receive payments.”

While Schlump pointed out that smaller full truckload companies tend to have better payment terms, 45 days is the average time it takes within the United States for truck drivers to get paid. As a result, trucking companies have become reliant on factoring firms to help truckers receive quicker payments, as these entities ensure payments are made within 10–14 days.

Yet, Schlump noted that this alternative eats away at drivers’ salaries. “Factoring companies typically charge 3% gross on every invoice, so a 20–25% interest rate is annualized over the term. These banking entities are collecting up to 90% of net revenue on every load simply because most carriers cannot wait the industry standard of 30–180 days to be paid directly by shippers,” he remarked.

Schlump believes that tokenization can potentially solve this problem. For example, Schlump explained that TCS replaces factoring companies with a token-based settlement service that allows trucking companies to get paid at face value within a few days. In order to ensure this, Schlump explained that TCS launched its “TCS Token” on the CrossTower crypto exchange in September this year. TCS will then work directly with trucking companies to buy a bill of lading using the tokens. He said:

“We are swapping the bill of lading for tokens. We are now able to pay trucking companies at the face value for their bill of lading, and they get instant liquidity in return by selling TCS Tokens.”

TCS CEO Todd Ziegler explained that when TCS swaps TCS tokens for collection rights in a shipper invoice, the trucking company is settled and can then sell their TCS on the crypto exchanges to get U.S. dollar liquidity. TCS then owns the collection rights in the shipper invoice and waits for the shipper to pay TCS. He noted that TCS does not engage in any sort of lending or financing.

Although this process may sound complex, Schlump believes that such a model could result in a $20,000 to $60,000 income increase for truck drivers. Ziegler said that the firm is beta-testing the mobile app with trucking companies “to ensure the process is totally frictionless.""

TCS isn’t the only company using tokenization to advance trucking payment systems. Myron Manuirirangi, founder of Truckonomics — an organization focused on fair salaries for long-haul truck drivers — told Cointelegraph that he also believes cryptocurrency, combined with blockchain technology, can be extremely beneficial for truck drivers.

Like Schlump, Manuirirangi is a former truck driver. Through this experience, Manuirirangi became aware of the fact that there is a shortage of truck drivers across the globe. “I started researching why this was the case and came to the conclusion that there is a shortage of truck drivers due to inadequate compensation.”

To put this in perspective, a FrieghtWaves article published in 2018 noted that a trucker in 1980 earned an average of $38,618. Almost 40 years later, in 2018, they earned around $41,000.

“The driver shortage isn’t a problem, but rather a symptom of a much larger issue that Truckonomics aims to solve with a token-based model,” said Manuirirangi.

He explained that Truckonimics has created a digital token known as “GDPC” for trucking and shipping companies to use as a payment method. In addition, GDPC will be tied to all activities taking place during the shipment process, using blockchain tech to provide transparency and a single source of truth between shipment companies, retailers and consumers. “We are building this model on the Avalanche blockchain. We will then build our own blockchain platform to facilitate trade and transactions using the GDPC token.”

By connecting GDPC with freight shipments, Manuirirangi believes that this will add intrinsic value to Truckonomic’s token. “As more trucking companies use GDPC, the more the price will be impacted.” In turn, truck drivers will be able to receive payments faster at much higher rates — as long as the token is used and becomes implemented on a crypto exchange. At the same time, Manuirirangi thinks that the blockchain component will help advance the trucking industry’s infrastructure.

“The trucking industry has needed blockchain for a while, yet no one has found a way to properly implement this technology. Having the GDPC token associated with Truckonomics can modernize the industry by helping pay the high costs associated with blockchain implementation, while also bringing transparency to freight shipments,” he said.

Is the trucking industry ready for DeFi?

Although tokenization and DeFi concepts have the potential to revolutionize payments within the trucking sector, a number of challenges remain.

First and foremost, getting truck companies and drivers involved with such business models could be difficult since cryptocurrency remains misunderstood by many individuals. Schlump is optimistic, however, noting that 21% of Americans are familiar with using cryptocurrency. He added that TCS has conducted internal surveys and has found that 17% of truck drivers are open to receiving crypto payments. He said:

“It becomes less challenging when there are a million trucking companies and you only need to work with about 500 to be successful. In terms of value, this can add thousands of dollars per year to trucker drivers’ salaries, so this generates positive attention as well.”

From a regulatory perspective, Schlump further mentioned that TCS Token is not an investment, as it functions as a commodity with a fixed supply. Moreover, he mentioned that TCS is a Wyoming-based company, a factor that has helped TCS gain regulatory clarity due to the state’s crypto-friendly stance.

Manuirirangi also pointed out that Truckonomic’s GDPC token has been put through the Howey test to prove that it’s not an investment vehicle. “This is a decentralized native token with smart contract functionality,” he said.

While these points are notable, some industry experts believe that DeFi adoption by enterprises and institutions will be slow, given the sector is still in development. For example, Mike Belshe previously told Cointelegraph that while he believes DeFi will overtake traditional financial institutions, it will take at least another two to three years before real progress is made.

Yet real-world tokenization use cases may help speed up adoption. “We have a real-world use case, unlike many crypto-based projects. TCS is targeting a $500 billion a year market, with a significant dollar-value added when trucking companies run payments through our settlement service,” highlighted Schlump.

Meanwhile, trucking companies have been successfully implementing blockchain without cryptocurrencies. For example, Xavier Fernandez, chief technology officer and technical lead for Smart EIR — a blockchain-based container management system — told Cointelegraph that Smart EIR uses the Antelope blockchain network (previously EOSIO) to document the history of containers.

Recent: US Election update: Where do the pro-crypto candidates stand ahead of the election?

“We focus on the equipment interchange receipt, which is a form that is generated every time a container goes from one interchange point to another.” According to Fernandez, photographic data from these containers are stored on a private IPFS network, while metadata is stored on the Antelope blockchain network.

While Fernandez mentioned that this use case comes in handy for dispute resolutions, there is no cryptocurrency element involved: “Crypto volatility and regulatory concerns have created too much controversy. We are just using blockchain as a ledger, and a single source of truth to create trust within an ecosystem.”",blockchain,cointelegraph

What is crypto whale tracking?

There are dedicated solutions to track the actions of crypto whales. These solutions can provide analytics on whale actions and, in some instances, can also make investment/trading decisions for the user.

Crypto traders and investors constantly track the amount of cryptocurrencies going in and out of exchanges. When a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ether (ETH) is moved in large quantities into an exchange, it is expected to see some sell action resulting in a fall in price. Conversely, if cryptocurrencies flow out of exchanges into wallets, it is considered a precursor to a rise in price.

This is because when exchanges have a high net outflow of cryptocurrencies, they have reduced supply resulting in an increase in price. Oftentimes, a whale could buy cryptocurrencies on an exchange and move them into their wallets in large volumes. This could result in a bullish price action for the crypto.

In some scenarios, whales may choose not to disturb the markets by buying or selling on an exchange. They would do an over the counter (OTC) transaction between two wallets. For instance, they may send Bitcoin to a wallet that will send USD Coin (USDC) back, resulting in a sale of BTC without the market spotting the transaction.

When the blockchain records a large transaction, investors can study the transaction and pick up the wallets involved in it. If the wallets hold large cryptocurrency positions, they can be labeled as crypto whale wallets. From then on, a regular check on these wallets and the transactions that are conducted can be insightful in assessing price movements of the crypto held in the wallet.

Whale tracking can be equally beneficial in the NFT markets too. Most NFT communities have large holders of the collection. In many instances, these NFT holders are identified by the community. Tracking the behavior of wallets of these whales can help investors make quick buy/sell decisions.

For instance, if a famous NFT collector or a whale sweeps the floor of a nonfungible token collection, that can indicate high convictions. Followers of the NFT collection and the whale would notice that and purchase the nonfungible tokens. This behavior was noticed with Gary Vaynerchuk several times during the NFT bull market in 2021.

However, it can be overwhelming and time–consuming to manually stay on top of whale action, even when it is just for one cryptocurrency or NFT collection. This is where whale tracking tools come into play.",blockchain,cointelegraph

After the cloud service provider announced it will now serve as validator for the Solana network, SOL initiated a rally that pumped its price by 15%, enabling it to briefly reach the $40 marker.

At press time, however, tracking from Coingecko reveals the asset wasn’t able to hold on to its gains as it is currently changing hands at $35.76.

Despite losing almost $5 in its spot trading price, the altcoin is still up by almost 9% over the last seven days and has also gone up by 28% for the past two weeks.

On a month-to-date basis, the 10th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization has grown by 7.2% although it is still several miles away from its all-time high (ATH) of $259.96 which it attained on this very day last year.

Google Cloud And Solana Connection

Just recently, German data center operator Hertzner, which cited violation of its policies as the ground, removed 1,000 Solana validators from its system.

Despite this development, Anatoly Yakovenko, founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the blockchain network remained positive and was confident in saying that no more outages will be experienced by their clients before the year ends.

Now that we got your attention… check this out: Google Cloud is running a block-producing @solana validator to participate in and validate the network. — Google Cloud (@googlecloud) November 5, 2022

He went on to say that there will be a new validator that would help Solana to maintain its network uptime. Then here comes Google Cloud.

Using its official Twitter account, the service provider tagged Yakovenko asking if they should tell their big news. This was followed by the following message:

“Now that we got your attention… check this out: Google Cloud is running a block-producing @solana validator to participate in and validate the network.”

Not Stopping At Just Being A Validator

It looks like the partnership between Solana and Google Cloud is more than just the latter becoming a helpful and reliable blockchain validator.

It was also announced by the cloud service provider that it will work with the DeFi network to introduce a Blockchain Node Engine to the Solana Chain next year.

The engine, which is well known for being widely used by Ethereum developers, is a hosting service that when integrated to the network will make it easier to be accessed.

If this plan pushes through next year, the Solana network and its SOL native token are sure to benefit from it as more accessibility means more transactions and more transaction volumes would later translate into higher trading prices for the crypto asset.

However, creators should consistently sell to demonstrate a proof-of-concept to boost the NFT’s floor price.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-pricing-strategy-how-to-price-your-nfts,"Early in 2021, markets for nonfungible tokens (NFTs) started to gain some notoriety, and by the end of March 2021, this new market for digital assets had a total lifetime traded volume of about $550 million. Any digital asset can be an NFT including collectibles, artwork, video game characters, virtual world objects and digitized sports.

A blockchain, often one on the Ethereum network, is where an NFT’s ownership is recorded. However, the sale of this digital asset will result in ownership transfers and the blockchain recording of the crypto payment received. This isn’t to say that NFTs and cryptocurrencies are the same. In general, one of the fundamental properties of cryptocurrencies and fiat money is fungibility or interchangeability, whereas the nonfungibility characteristic of NFTs makes them valuable.

This article will discuss how to price NFTs with profitability, what makes NFT’s floor price go up, how to know if your NFT is valuable or not and how much you should charge for an NFT.

How are NFT prices determined?

As artists in the Web3 space begin their NFT journey, they may frequently find themselves considering the vital question: “How does one price their art?” or “what is the best strategy to sell NFTs?” Although there are no fixed strategies to price nonfungible tokens, NFT sellers may choose to sell them at the listing price in a secondary marketplace. Alternatively, they may conclude the sale at a price that a buyer is willing to pay, called buyer price.

Regardless, being the creator, you have full authority to choose the best NFT pricing strategy. However, if you set your price too high, you risk never being able to sell that item, and if you select your price too low, it will be more challenging to raise it gradually. So here are a few things to consider to determine how much you should charge for an NFT or how to price your NFT art pieces.

Understand different types of costs involved

Different kinds of costs are implied while producing and selling NFTs, including creation costs such as the wages of a professional 3D artist if one needs to learn how to create nonfungible tokens themselves. Using a zero code tokenization platform like TokenMint might be an alternative option for those with a non-software development background.

Other costs involve minting costs that may vary with the fluctuating gas fees, marketplace fees for minting or listing nonfungible tokens, selling fees charged by NFT marketplaces and the cost of marketing nonfungible tokens.

Rarity and functionality

A rare NFT is worth more than a common one because an asset’s supply and type determine if it is rare or not. For instance, a limited edition NFT may be priced higher than one with multiple copies. Similarly, a physical painting may be worth more than its digital image(s) available. In terms of functionality, utility tokens are more valuable because owners may use them to buy goods and services. Therefore, you must consider your clients’ needs when determining the price for these utility NFTs.

Build your brand and improve visibility

The NFT ecosystem is still developing and has enough room to grow. As consistency is one of the most crucial factors to accomplishment and success, the same goes for the nonfungible token artists, i.e., they need to display passion and trust in the process.

To make a reputation in the NFT industry, one needs to market their artist’s name to the masses via different mediums such as Twitter, Discord and Telegram to familiarize people with the artistic journey. Additionally, working with other platforms, artists and businesses in the nonfungible token space may open further opportunities to sell your work at the right price.

Makes sales your proof-of-concept to raise floor price

Having an idea that, “if Beeple can sell his Everydays artwork for an astounding $69 million, why can’t I?” is good for motivation. However, overconfidence can be misleading as you may not garner the same sales that another artist in the space achieved. So, what makes the NFT floor price go up? In order to raise the floor price of an NFT, make some consistent sales to establish a proof-of-concept.

The floor price is the lowest price for NFT collections and is constantly updated. A nonfungible token’s floor price is initially determined during the minting process by the NFT project’s founder or creator. Then, holders who list their work on a secondary market, once the minting procedure is complete, set the floor price. That said, the floor price for an NFT project rises as it gains popularity. And, proof-of-concept is evidence that intends to assess an idea’s viability or confirm that it will work as intended.

Utilize multiple platforms and maintain some consistency in your pricing

NFT artists can sell their artwork at marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible, but their work is considered valuable everywhere, regardless of where it was minted. Therefore, leveraging multiple platforms with consistent prices for your work may be an ideal option to stay active and gain maximum traction.

Add value to your NFTs by offering unlockables

For NFTs, unlockable content creates utility for owners. The artist can enhance the NFT’s real-world worth by creating unlockable content outside of the digital token. There is a setting for unlockables when configuring nonfungible tokens. Unlockable content is the hidden content to be viewable by NFT owners only.

Redeemable discounts, thank-you notes, physical objects like signed products and high-resolution video clips are all examples of unlockable content on nonfungible tokens. This strategy aids NFT sellers in building brand equity and selling their work at competitive prices.

How to start selling NFTs like a pro?

The first step to successfully selling and pricing your NFTs is to understand the industry, blockchains used in NFT development, marketplaces for nonfungible tokens, common types of NFTs already sold by artists in the space and their typical price range. The next step is to choose an NFT marketplace that suits your goals and determine the creation, minting, service and selling costs before defining your token’s unique value proposition. So, can you price an NFT at any price?

Being a creator, you can price an NFT at any price you find suitable. However, understanding what makes your nonfungible tokens unique from the competition is critical to charge a higher price for your NFTs and attract more buyers if you have a distinct and appealing value proposition. Then, research the ways to sell NFTs. The techniques you can use to sell your nonfungible tokens depend on your preferences.

NFTs can be sold utilizing two most common methods: at a fixed price or an auction, where nonfungible tokens are offered for sale on the open market. Fixed price can be set up for NFTs during the minting process or if you want to test the market, choose an auction in which your NFT is won by the bidder who makes the highest payment at the end, often called an English auction.

However, one can opt for a timed auction, a particular kind of English auction in which an NFT is up for bid for a predetermined length of time, with the highest bidder winning at the end. Additionally, a dutch auction is another option available; it is a decreasing-price auction in which the price keeps declining until your NFT is purchased. If NFT sellers want to earn revenue each time their work is sold, they can choose the royalties option. Finally, set a fair price for your NFT after considering the above-mentioned substitutes.

How to price your NFTs on OpenSea?

Nonfungible token sellers can sell crypto art or NFTs on OpenSea by following the steps below:

Click the “Profile” button in the top right corner of the OpenSea page, as shown in the image below.

Choose the nonfungible token from your wallet that you want to sell, or learn how to create an NFT to get started. Click “Sell” on the top right of the item page, as shown in the image below.

Select the price as a fixed price or timed auction, choose a default sale period or enter a specific duration using the calendar.

The item can also be set aside for a specific customer by typing the wallet address into the “Reserve for specific buyer” field under the “More Options” section, as shown in the image below. For this sale, OpenSea charged a 5.5% fee, including a 3% creator fee and a 2.5% service fee.

Sign a transaction to complete your listing. A pop-up confirmation will indicate that your item has been listed for sale.

Can you sell NFTs without marketing?

Marketing is at the heart of selling nonfungible tokens like any other product. So, if you are wondering why your NFT is not selling, it might be due to a lack of awareness among the nonfungible tokens community. But, how hard is it to sell an NFT?

Every artist has their own personal preferences: Some choose to be publicly visible, while others like to remain anonymous. However, to raise an NFT project’s profile, informing buyers of your professional background, including name, experience with blockchain technology and crypto art or other nonfungible tokens, is of paramount importance.

So, what kind of NFTs sell best? Although there is no definite answer, nonfungible tokens with a solid presence on different social media channels and displaying clear roadmaps may sell better than others. For instance, if an artist frequently tweets about their digital artwork and joins conversations about NFTs, it will help them build a brand and attract people to buy their work.

Alternatively, an attractive website listing your NFT collection with an accurate description will indicate genuineness to the community and help convert website visitors to actual buyers. However, avoid under-promising or over-delivering to build customer confidence in your work.",blockchain,cointelegraph

(Hopefully not cheese sandwiches.)

A firm of tech bros and real estate developers are creating Agia , supposedly the first time an entire real estate development is up for grabs on the blockchain, Curbed reported. The company announced its plans for the “first-ever luxury crypto community” last month.

Forget the crypto hoops buyers will have to jump through for a second; the most important part of this development is the site: Roker Point on the island of Great Exuma, best known for the fraud luxury music festival that spawned thousands of memes, multiple documentaries and a prison sentence for its co-founder Billy McFarland.

The development will include 60 homes, ranging from 1,000 to 6,500 square feet. Each will feature a private pool and a private floating boat slip.

The purchasing process is … complicated. First, a buyer needs to mint an NFT that represents the villa via cryptocurrency, which will cost $10,000. That gives the buyer the ability to buy another NFT, one of the villas themselves, which carry a $3.5 million asking price. Then, a buyer needs to mint yet another NFT, which is the deed and title.

That last NFT also comes with a range of perks, including a concierge service, a beach and yacht club, 100 rounds of golf and a fitness center. It can also provide an “expedited pathway” to Bahamian citizenship, which marketing materials reviewed by Curbed reference “immediate access to one of the world’s most sophisticated offshore banking systems.”

For what it’s worth, the crypto project has some interesting partners. Oppenheim Architecture is designing the project. And the Setai Group, a luxury hotel developer in Miami, is collaborating as well.

According to the firm’s press release, some of the founders already minted properties during a launch event. The minting process doesn’t appear to have opened up to the public yet, although the company did promote a waitlist for interested buyers ready to bet on a Bahamas bohemia.

However, the blockchain repeatedly showed why it might be difficult to “refine the web3 experience” for its users.

Wonder why? Well, on 21 October, Aptos Explorer revealed that the network was processing only eleven Transactions Per Second (TPS). For a blockchain that was dubbed the “Solana Killer”, this was an unimpressive rate.

Fast forward to 5 November, the story witnessed a change. Yet, it was nowhere close to the thousand of transactions that many investors looked forward to. As of 5 November, Aptos Explorer showed that the TPS of the network was 19, with validators remaining at 102.

Additionally, APT’s performance suffered a correction by 0.19% in the last 24 hours and was exchanging hands at $7.71 at the time of writing.

The APT trend might interest you

The Aptos increase signified a revival from its massive dump to $7.19 from $8.23 on 2 November. However, the rejuvenation might have been impossible without some underlying factors. Besides the 58% volume increase, APT’s four-hour chart showed that the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) had exited the -0.24 zone it was on 4 November.

With its value at -0.07, it was evident that investors had filled up the network with enough liquidity. This implied that APT had been able to generate immense interest from the crypto community lately.

Additionally, the above chart showed the trend of the Money Flow Index (MFI). As for the MFI, an incredible amount of money had entered Aptos such that it hit the overbought level of 77.88. As expected, the MFI trend had reversed and was now close to maintaining an excellent buying level.

Despite the reversal, there was no confirmed sign of selling pressure. In fact, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicated that although slight, buyers (blue) were still in control over sellers (red). However, the failure to rise above the MACD histogram might keep APT at bay of falling to the demands of sellers. So, the increase in the APT price was not a signal for an unbreakable resolve to decrease in value.

Will the chain redeem APT?

Per on-chain analysis, it seemed that Aptos was struggling to adapt to the reality of the market. This was because its initial dominance that helped it sparked in socials and search had obviously decreased.

At press, Santiment showed that its social dominance on 5 November was 0.225%— a massive fall from 2.105% on 24 October. Development activity was also nowhere near highs. At 6.5, the signs were similar to that of an abandoned ship. However, this might not be enough to bother APT investors especially as APT did not look like it needed a superb on-chain performance to thrive.",blockchain,ambcrypto.com

Experts, researchers...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xinhua-finance-smart-china-expo-020600834.html,"CHONGQING, China, Nov. 5, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On October 31, 2022, Smart China Expo Kaizhou Forum on the Construction of Digital Government took place in Kaizhou District, Chongqing. Experts, researchers and business representatives tackled the topic of how to build an effective digital government, and how such a government would yield new opportunities for the development of public services, rural areas and industries.

Smart China Expo Kaizhou Forum Discusses How to Build Effective Digital Government

1. Public services continue to improve as digital government becomes the norm

In the view of Meng Qingguo, executive director of the National Governance Institute of Tsinghua University, when building a digital government, a thorough reconstruction of the existing department-driven information model where systems, platforms, and data are decentralized becomes necessary. The government is now being tasked with accelerating the establishment of a national, fully integrated big data system for all public affairs, with the multiple goals of further promoting the integration and sharing of data, improving existing and developing new data disclosure, authorization and operation mechanisms, and putting in place a digital government that is both systematic and holistic.

Li Zonglei, director of the E-government Office of Chongqing Municipal People's Government, said that as a key part of the city's efforts to build a digital government, Yukuaiban, the integrated online government service platform of the E-government Office has digitalized and created e-documents for every resident including their ID, health, social security and medical insurance information. The platform is divided into service areas for more than 100 application scenarios covering housing, employment, tourism, entertainment and shopping, in addition to providing local residents with easier access to authentication, medical treatment, transportation, and other services. Next, the E-government Office will continue to enhance the online delivery system for the full range of public services, making it more user-friendly and widening the number of channels through which the services can be accessed.

Story continues

Pu Binbin, Party Secretary of Kaizhou District, Chongqing, said that based on actual conditions, the district will build a digital government, a digital and smart Kaizhou, and digital villages, with the goal of promoting quality development throughout the region with big data and intelligence, while providing more convenience to the companies and residents who do business and live in Kaizhou.

2. Digital villages facilitate the optimization of the rural digital governance system

According to Lei Xiaoling, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Kaizhou District People's Congress, more than 5,300 4G base stations, 1,500 5G base stations, and six Internet Towns have been built in the district, forming a strong network of agricultural big data and resources. A large number of premium and unique rural e-commerce brands are emerging with the establishment of the online big data platform, creating a flourishing rural network culture and making the rural digital governance system more sophisticated.

Zhang Zhaoxin, a researcher at the Rural Economy Research Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, suggested that digital technology be deployed to enhance the IT infrastructure and network, overhaul the basic information collection system, accelerate the development of service systems, and build a system-wide services chain, empowering the transformation of the whole agricultural industry chain in addition to enabling the public and specialized services systems to better serve rural revitalization.

Wang Dacheng, deputy secretary of the National Remote Sensing Application Engineering Technology Research Center of the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that given where the world is at in terms of the transition into the digital era, the planning and governance of rural areas is in urgent need of digital technologies. E-maps, satellite images, capture of street scenes in real time and other geographic information data, as well as portals where villagers can participate in interactive activities, can deliver to the community what is expected and should be expected from rural governance.

3. The digital economy is the future as digital industries are booming

At the forum, Tan Jianrong, an researcher at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor at Zhejiang University, summarized five key steps that must be taken to achieve a digital economy and digital transformation: innovative design, process improvement, quality enhancement, service extension and market expansion, all of which serve to advance the digital transformation of all businesses in the region and foster quality development of a digital economy.

Zhao Kefeng, academic chairman of the Shenzhen Artificial Intelligence Industry Association, offered the opinion that it is necessary to accelerate the process of extracting value from the available data, promote the digital transformation of the real economy, strengthen the governance capacity of the digital economy, improve basic industrial capabilities, and further the open cooperation that will be the result of the creation of a digital economy.

Guo Linyuan, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and deputy general manager of Digital Chongqing Company, said that Chongqing is moving forward with the construction of Smart City 2.0 and, while doing so, improve urban intelligence with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies, strengthen the underlying infrastructure, resolve any data chokepoints, and exploit the value of data, while fostering the agglomeration and development of industry and commerce.

The forum was hosted by the Organizing Committee of Smart China Expo, and co-organized by the Chongqing Big Data Application and Development Administration and Chongqing Kaizhou District People's Government.

In a panel hosted by Cointelegraph, editor-in-chief Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr sat with Mitchell Amador, founder and CEO at Immunefi, and Brendan Eich, founder and CEO of Brave browser, to discuss the evolution of Web3 and its future trajectory.

“There’s a lot of Web2 in Web3. That’s a problem right now,” began Eich when asked about the ongoing Web2 to Web3 transition. From using trusted servers to sub-custody wallets, Amador believed that such Web2 sites could be full of adversaries. He also pointed out the recent EIP-5593 proposal, which aims to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

In Web2, there is a common practice of implementing security features post-launch through patches and antiviruses, which can be inherited by Web3 apps using such services. In addition, security concerns in Web3 stem from the centralization through decentralized application (DApp) sites.

Speaking about the security concerns in Web3, Amador stated that hackers in Web3 are very different from Web2 hackers. According to him, there are two types of hackers. In Web3, hackers are found to be young, typically under the age of 35 and most under the age of 30.

In relation to the second type of hacker, Amador highlighted the influx of older tech-savvy individuals — “which many blockchain hackers lack” — that have spent a few years understanding Web3 and are able to break into the systems. He added:

“We’ve seen a number of these guys, including several of the top 10 hackers now; they just storm the leaderboard with their skills. They just need to get good enough.”

Supporting this stance, Eich added that, during the bull run era of 2021, he noticed the rise of reentrancy attacks. Brave has been using HackerOne to protect its in-house crypto wallets and has tripled its bug bounty to eradicate the wallet’s security concerns.

Eich further highlighted that Brave has total control over the browser and crypto wallets, which helps them fend off phishing attacks on the users. Brave has amassed a wide demography of users that prefer privacy, crypto or both, currently serving 20 million daily users, which, when compared to last year, has doubled.

When it comes to protecting the Web3 community, Amador believes it boils down to ethos:

“To wish for, fight for, and create a better world for which their most sinister and capricious behaviors simply won’t work and won’t be allowed. If we do that successfully, we will draw these expert security talents, their best executives, their best leaders over to our side and neuter them by destroying the base of their ability to work.”

Cornèr agreed with the duo as she stated that in Web3 security, it’s not only about money; it’s about the culture and values that the community protects, which brings out the need for education.

While Amador further revealed the efforts of Immunefi, Brave and other partners to work with the governments trying to make Web3 more accessible, adding:

“We’re in a position where we need to heavily lobby and ask for the support and graces of various other power players precisely because what we’ve built today is not good enough, not valuable enough and not safe enough.”

Eich, on the other hand, highlighted the need to develop better programming languages and tools to safeguard the systems. He called for a need to segregate the world of ethos from the world of bad programming. “Education sounds prim and proper. But if it doesn't have incentives, it's not gonna work,” he concluded.

As a bug bounty platform, Immunefi created trust and legitimacy in the industry by solving the problem related to projects not willing to pay up bug bounties after successful bug discovery. They did this by providing an impartial, third-party service that can mediate that interaction and make sure both sides come to the task.

Immunefi recently released a Whitehat Leaderboard for listing the top 20 most elite white hats in Web3.

“As the volume of saved funds continues to grow, the leaderboard is another opportunity to give our white hats the recognition they deserve, as well as to encourage them to keep pushing the boundaries to make the web3 ecosystem safer,” Amador noted in a statement.",blockchain,cointelegraph

Cointelegraph’s ground team — present during the conference — shared insights into Solana’s roadmap, which includes the launching of smartphones, decentralized application (DApp) stores and a partnership with Google Cloud, among others.

Good morning from @SolanaConf

Solana Breakpoint, a four-day conference scheduled from Nov. 4 to Nov. 7, attracted 13,000 people in just one of the four venues it’s being held simultaneously.

QR Code giveaways and GeoNFTs for Solana Store

Fortunately for Cointelegraph’s ground team, the venue featured Solana co-founder Raj Gokal and Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko.

Soon after, Vibhu Norby, the CEO and founder of Solana Spaces, took the stage to deliver an interactive presentation while asking attendees to scan QR codes to participate in a giveaway.

Norby further unveiled the Solana Store in Miami, showcasing a walkaround video of people checking out the store, as shown above. In addition, the CEO revealed that:

“Now anyone, anywhere can build their own Solana Store.”

While explaining the process of building a Solana store, Norby announced the launch of GeoNFTs — a nonfungible token (NFT) implementation — that allows users to geo-tag an area in their city. He further explained:

“If you have a GeoNFT, you can redeem it 1-for-1 with the exclusive rights to open a Solana store in that region.”

With GeoNFTs, Solana aims to empower solo entrepreneurs that wish to get into business.

Solana smartphones available for pre-order in early 2023

“It’s made for the people,” said the Solana mobile team while announcing the launch of its upcoming smartphones. Cointelegraph found that the preorders for Solana mobile phones will commence in 2023. However, the company hs yet to declare an official date for its availability.

A differentiating feature of the Solana phone lies in its ability to securely store the private keys of crypto wallets. The Solana smartphone will be powered by a Qualcomm chipset sporting an Arm-based SoC, allowing for higher productivity.

Cointelegraph’s ground team managed to bring in a sneak peak of the soon-to-be-launched Solana smartphone.

Solana dApp store: A promise of crypto-friendly policies

Gearing up for the Web3 disruption, Solana announced the launch of the Solana App Store. During the conference, a Solana spokesperson highlighted the need for a good user experience in Web3.

Supporting the cause, Solana’s DApp store promises to do away with charges, revenues and fees. Moreover, the company confirmed with the interested participants that submissions would open January 2023.

Google Cloud is soon to become a Solana node validator

While the above announcements mark a series of milestones for Solana, the ecosystem’s partnership with Google Cloud evidently stole the limelight.

Based on the information collected by Cointelegraph’s ground team, Google Cloud is building a block-producing Solana validator to participate in and validate the network.

Google Cloud’s Blockchain Node Engine, which was first announced on Oct. 27, will feature on the Solana chain from 2023. The integration will allow users to launch a dedicated Solana node in the Cloud.

Additionally, Google Cloud will index Solana data and bring it to BigQuery — a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse — by next year, making it easier for the Solana developers to access historical data.

On Oct. 11, Solana (SOL) users were attacked by hackers via a fake Solana wallet security update.

Hackers were found airdropping NFTs to users masquerading as a new Phantom wallet security update. However, the fraudulent update was a malware designed to steal crypto assets.

Users falling for the fake Phantom update hack saw malware being downloaded from GitHub, which attempts to steal browser information, history, cookies, passwords, SSH keys and other user information.",blockchain,cointelegraph

The launch of Bitcoin, the first blockchain and cryptocurrency project, paved the way for the numerous cryptocurrency projects in the market. The introduction of different types of cryptocurrencies has, in turn, allowed for other innovations such as NFT marketplaces, decentralized finance(De-Fi) applications, and trading platforms.

BudBlockz is one of the latest additions to this ever-expanding sector. BudBlockz is the first peer-to-peer ecosystem dedicated to the legal cannabis industry.

Experts have estimated that the global cannabis industry will experience accelerated growth in the coming years and surpass the $176.5 billion mark by the close of the decade. BudBlockz hopes to play a significant role in this growth by bringing cannabis enthusiasts and businesses worldwide to a platform where they can interact and trade their favourite products.

Cannabis enthusiasts and businesses such as farms, cafes, and dispensaries can use BudBlockz’s leading cryptocurrency, $BLUNT, as a medium of exchange in secure, transparent, and private transactions.

$BLUNT holders can also stake their coins in the BudBlockz network and receive rewards in $BLUNT. They also receive the hottest news from the global cannabis industry, giving them an edge in making investment decisions.

In addition to uniting consumers and businesses of cannabis products, BudBlockz will also allow investors to own Ganja Guruz NFTs and participate in the BudBlockz arcade.

Ganja Guruz NFTs are non-fungible tokens enabling holders to own a percentage of a cannabis farm or dispensary. BudBlockz arcade, on the other hand, is a P2E gaming platform where fans earn exciting rewards while playing their favourite retro-inspired video games.

BudBlockz will also launch Bud Swap, a decentralized exchange where users can participate in the De-Fi space, swap different ERC-20 tokens, and make profits.

Can BudBlockz Outperform Cardano And Polygon

Although BudBlockz is still in its pre-sale stage, its success so far has led analysts to speculate that BLUNT is on its way to becoming a top utility project and surpassing well-known cryptocurrencies such as Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC).

Cardano (ADA) is a cryptocurrency platform that allows users, developers, and innovators to create tokens, improve on them, and provide a scalable and sustainable blockchain. Cardano is, therefore, a significant player in the De-Fi space, and its shot at success in the cryptocurrency sphere is brimming with innovations.

Like most cryptocurrencies, Cardano (ADA) experienced a major drop in price in 2022. However, price predictions show that the coin might recover in the coming years, but BudBlockz might still give Cardano a run in the coming months.

Polygon (MATIC) is an Ethereum-based Blockchain project for building and connecting Ethereum- compatible blockchains. The platform is a layer-2 solution designed to help improve the functionality and scalability of the Ethereum network.

Unfortunately, Polygon (MATIC) has lost more than 70% of its value in 2022. Although the platform gained some attention from investors when polygon announced a major partnership with RobinHood, it is still likely to face major competition from BudBlockz (BLUNT) soon.

Here is Draper’s bio (from Draper University’s website):

“He is a supporter and global thought leader for entrepreneurs everywhere, and is a leading spokesperson for Bitcoin, Blockchain, ICOs and cryptocurrencies, having won the Bitcoin US Marshall’s auction in 2014, invested in over 50 crypto companies, and led investments in Coinbase, Ledger, Tezos, and Bancor, among others.

“He created viral marketing, a marketing method for exponentially spreading an electronic service from customer to customer, instrumental to the successes of Hotmail and Skype and other applications, particularly effective for mail and communications applications. Arguably, social media, crowdsourcing and growth hacking are all outgrowths of viral marketing.

“He is regularly featured on all major networks as a proponent for entrepreneurship, innovative governance, free markets and Bitcoin, and has received various awards and honors including the World Entrepreneurship Forum’s ‘Entrepreneur of the World,’ and is listed as one of the top 100 most powerful people in finance by Worth Magazine, the top 20 most influential people in Crypto by CryptoWeekly, #1 most networked VC by AlwaysOn, #7 on the Forbes Midas List, and #48 most influential Harvard Alum. Global Guru listed Tim as one of the top 30 Startup Gurus in the world.“

Anyway, the prominent venture capitalist latest comments about Bitcoin were made during an interview for YouTube series “White Crypto” that was released on 4 November 2022.

Acording to a report by The Daily Hodl, Draper said:

“There are 100 million Bitcoin wallets now, and that’s pretty extraordinary, pretty exciting. And we’re only 15 years in... You know, people say, ‘Well, why aren’t there 10 billion [wallets]?’

“Well, there aren’t 10 billion wallets because it takes time for new technologies to proliferate throughout the world. Facebook is everywhere but it’s 20 years [since it launched]. So give Bitcoin five more years and you’ll see some great things happening.…

“I think the best use for Bitcoin is as a currency. As soon as we can buy our food, clothing and shelter in Bitcoin, then there’s no reason to hold on to any fiat currency.“

And according to a report published by Decrypt on 4 November 2022, while speaking on stage at Web Summit 2022, Draper said that he expected the Bitcoin price to hit $250,000 by mid 2023:

“With Bitcoin, the women are going to be the ones who take it to $250,000. And the reason is that women control about 80% of retail spending, and you can’t really buy your food, clothing, and shelter yet in Bitcoin—but once you can, then there will be no reason to hold on to fiat currency, and there’ll be sort of a run on the banks.“",blockchain,cryptoglobe

Why UniSwap Will Pump Soon

Not only did rival PancakeSwap experience a huge drop, UniSwap Labs itself recently raised over $165 million as investors’ and traders’ attention shifts to NFTs and Web3.

In a Series B funding round, UniSwap managed to secure bags from the Polychain Capital foundation and existing investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, Variant, and SV Angel. This extra liquidity is expected to boost the development of UniSwap as a project, as well as increase UniSwap investor trust.

On a technical level, UniSwap intends to use the funding to further expand its product offerings, improve the UX of its platform, and develop new applications. On Twitter, UniSwap Labs announced they would ‘’Bring Web3 to Everyone’ soon, however speculation among UniSwap enthusiasts has provided no conclusive explanation as to what this means.

Why You Should Add Gnosis to Your Crypto Holdings

Although Gnosis is down almost 90% from its all-time high, the altcoin is set to pump any time soon as of writing this article. Decentralized network The Graph will soon start using Gnosis Chain instead of its current centralized hosted service and this is huge for Gnosis!

The Graph Foundation is a blockchain indexing platform, also called the ‘’Google of Blockchains’’ that allows blockchain-based apps to collect on-chain data from all blockchains. The Graph does this by organizing and formatting blockchain transaction data in a way that NFT marketplaces, DeFi exchanges, and other blockchain apps can read and use this data through the use of APIs. By switching to the Gnosis chain,The Graph brings massive utility to an already-strong contender in the blockchain world.

Our experts have found that this may very well be the catalyst Gnosis was looking for all these months and that this recent development will make Gnosis stand out from the crowd when it comes to altcoin investing.

What is Orbeon Protocol?

ORBN is the native token of the Orbeon Protocol ecosystem, an investment platform that is fixed upon disrupting the crowdfunding and venture capital industries. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) will use fractionalized NFTs or F-NFTs to allow retail investors to invest in start-ups in a more cost-efficient, low-entry, and transparent way. By minting these unique and exciting startup companies as fractionalized NFTs, investors can now support these previously-unreachable opportunities for as little as $1.

Normally, only huge companies and high-net-worth individuals could invest in such a matter in start-ups, but Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is set to bring venture capital investing to the masses. Orbeon Protocol will even use a so-called ‘’Fill or Kill’’ mechanism that ensures investors get their money back if companies don’t raise the amount of money needed within a pre-specified timeframe.

This is all done by the use of smart contracts and these very same smart contracts allow users to stake their NFTs and vote on key decision-making through governance. These benefits and more, such as transaction fee discounts and access to exclusive investor groups, are available to ORBN token holders. As per tokenomics, the team’s tokens are locked for one year, and are then released quarterly whilst the liquidity pool is locked for 10 years, ensuring no rug-pull can take place.

The total Orbeon Protocol token supply is 888,000,000 with only 40% of its tokens available for public presale. Analysts predict that by the time presale concludes, the price per token will have surged from $0.004 to $0.24. Like we said in the beginning of this article, it is only a matter of time before this altcoin pumps like crazy!

The multichain wallet provider Blocto is building on its recent integration with the Aptos blockchain with the launch of a $3 million ecosystem fund that’s intended to help new Aptos-based projects grow their user bases.

Blocto is a popular, cross-chain smart contract wallet that provides features designed to ease problems around private key management, complicated wallet addresses and high transaction fees. The Blocto wallet supports hundreds of different cryptocurrency tokens, as well as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets across a range of popular blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Tron and Flow.

One of Blocto’s stated aims is to make it easier for people to engage in the emerging Web3 ecosystem, which it does with features such as email logins and universal gas fees.

Support for Aptos was announced last month, and Blocto claims that it onboarded more than 300,000 new users within the first week.

Aptos is an up and coming Layer-1 blockchain for We3 platforms that’s built on the foundations of Diem, a project originally created by Facebook parent company Meta Platforms. Diem was widely regarded to hold a lot of promise, only for Meta to scrap the project due to regulatory concerns. With Aptos, Diem has effectively been reborn. As with Diem, the key advantage of Aptos is its Rust-based programming language Move, which differs from the better-known Solidity in the way it handles assets separately, as resources. Because of this, Aptos is able to provide higher security and more fairness, and better performance for a range of decentralized applications.

One of the reasons why Aptos has generated so much excitement is the incredible backing it has received from the venture capital community. In March it raised $200 million in funding from Andreesen Horowitz and others, before closing on a second, $150 million round in July led by FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto.

Blocto claims to be able to onboard new Aptos users and help them set up a wallet in as little as 30 seconds. Its decision to support Aptos was based on a DAO community vote. At the time, Blocto said it is a big believer in Aptos’ vision of creating the safest and most performant blockchain in the world, and wants to help the project succeed in that goal.

With that in mind, Blocto’s new ecosystem fund for Aptos makes a lot of sense. In a statement, the company said it will support standout Aptos projects during the challenging “user acquisition” phase. It’s not only funding that projects will be able to receive. In addition to the $3 million pot, Blocto will also provide expertise and assistance via its own community of developers, together with financial marketing support, communications and access to its investor base. In this way, Blocto believes it will be able to help select Aptos projects grow much more quickly, attract new users and with that, foster growth within the wider Aptos ecosystem.

Blocto co-founder and CEO Hsuan Lee said his team had been on the lookout for promising blockchain ecosystems with long-term growth potential, and that Aptos was the one that caught its attention. “It aims to make blockchain accessible for average users - a big focus for us at Blocto - and has accumulated a lot of momentum in the dev community, even in the current market situation,” he said.

As Aptos’ user base grows, Blocto hopes that its wallet will become a key component of its ecosystem. Thanks to its integration with Aptos, Blocto enables users to deposit, withdraw and swap Aptos tokens and NFTs, stake Aptos tokens and more. Users also have the choice of making their wallet non-custodial, meaning they control their own security, or custodial, a feature that allows them to create a key recovery mechanism.

Lee added that he was extremely bullish about Aptos and the wider Web3 ecosystem, despite the current bear market conditions.

“We know this bearish market is the best time to build and refine products in preparation for the next wave of crypto adoption,” he said. “Historically, those projects continuing development during downturns create the most impact when sentiment reverses.""

FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried tells his 793,500 Twitter followers that FTX stayed on the sidelines because it wasn’t clear how the social media platform would incorporate crypto technology into its business model with Musk at its helm.

“We passed on Twitter because it didn’t seem like our strengths were what was needed for Elon’s vision for Twitter (e.g. if he wanted to do blockchain-based social media, or blockchain wallets/payments, we’d have been excited to work on that! And who knows, maybe he still will).”

In a recent interview with Forbes, Bankman-Fried also says that he spoke with Musk, and while he believes in the Tesla CEO and his vision for Twitter, he wasn’t convinced that FTX should get involved.

“I’m really excited for what he’s doing. I think it’s going to hopefully revitalize Twitter. There’s a lot of open questions and a lot of tough questions that I think have to be answered. I think there is a ton of upside in what he’s doing…

He’s got a vision for what he wants to do with Twitter, and I think his vision is not exactly the same vision as mine would be, but that’s okay. It doesn’t have to be. And ultimately I view this as ‘Is this a case where our visions are complementary and that there’s really something I can add to it?’

I don’t think that ended up being the case, and so it ended up an opportunity where I didn’t feel like it made sense for us to get involved.”

In a new report, Santiment says the “crowd is piling in” on Polygon as supply on crypto exchanges plummets from over one billion MATIC tokens in mid-October to 833.03 million coins on November 4th.

“MATIC’s supply on exchanges continue to fall even as prices skyrocket, indicating that folks are pretty confident about further price rise.”

MATIC is in the midst of a blazing rally to kick off November, opening the month at $0.90 and surging to as high as $1.30 for a 44% increase in less than a week.

MATIC has retraced since and is trading at $1.17 at time of writing.

Looking at MATIC’s other on-chain metrics, Santiment says that the coin’s rally comes as Polygon sees its highest network growth in months. According to the analytics firm, network growth illustrates user adoption by tracking the amount of new addresses that transferred MATIC tokens for the first time.

“MATIC is seeing its highest network growth in months. A sustained network growth would be good but as soon as it falls and price continues to hover, forming a divergence, it tends to signal a local top as no new folks are coming in.”

With more traders jumping in and participating in the rally, Santiment warns that one-chain metric is signaling that MATIC may be on the verge of a corrective move. According to the analytics firm, the coin’s seven-day market value to realized value (MVRV) metric shows that MATIC holders are in a good position to lock in profits.

“MATIC’s MVRV 7D, which measures the short-term profit/loss of holders, is showing that we are now in the Danger Zone, where historically saw MATIC’s price decline shortly after as a local top forms.”

The Miller’s Organic Farm Case: Part 1

Why write about a disturbing misfortune when to all appearances nothing can be done?

In the Amish village of Bird-in-Hand in a remote area of Pennsylvania, Miller’s Organic Farm has been in business for a century. Today, it supplies organic foods—grass-fed beef, raw milk and eggs, dairy from grass-fed water buffalo, and all types of produce—to a private food club of 4,000 members who pay top dollar for high-quality whole food.

Members want food from a farmer who doesn’t process his meat and dairy products at U.S. Department of Agriculture facilities. Aaron Miller, the owner, chooses to defend his preparation of food as the way God intended it. He himself has run the farm for a quarter of a century with no electricity, no fertilizer, and no gasoline. Observers are impressed with crop yields he achieves by the oldest and 100 percent organic methods.

The farm’s website says: “…we are proud to be entirely chemical, cruelty, and GMO-free. The animals are born and raised without antibiotics or hormones, and they spend their entire lives naturally and stress-free out on pasture. All the farm’s food is traceable, pure, and grown on nutrient-dense soil, under traditional time-honored methods.”

Sounds to me like the consolidated dream about a dozen environmentalist organizations: opposing animal cruelty, GMO, and use of chemical fertilizers—not to mention eliminating fossil fuels (no gas, no electricity).

Last summer, armed federal agents sent by the USDA demanded that Miller cease operations and prepared to hit him with more than $300,000 in fines. That would shut Amos Miller down.

They demanded that he stop selling meat until he comes under federal agencies that regulate it. Miller responds that such regulation “hurts the nutrition of the food…you wash it in these things, you’re given these vaccines, and the cows get all types of medicine, I don’t do any of that…your regulatory process will actually hurt the quality of my food and that’s what I’m being paid top dollar for…”

Federal agents camped at the farm to take inventory of his meat, dairy, and other food to make sure he is not selling anything and not increasing his production.

Miller took the case to the U.S. District Court of Eastern Pennsylvania, which ruled in favor of the USDA. The USDA dictated the following text required to be posted on the farm’s website:

“To the Members of Miller’s Organic Farm: Please be advised…Miller’s Organic Farm violated the Court’s Injunction Order and Consent Decree. Accordingly, we will not provide fresh or newly slaughtered amenable meat, meat food products, poultry, and poultry products for sale or purchase unless and until Miller’s Organic Farm liquidates its existing…frozen meat and poultry inventory and complies with other requirements of this Order and other orders of the Court… “…We are working diligently with the government to find some long-term solutions…”

But what “long-term” (or even short-term) solution? Miller’s farm is in violation of what might be called “bedrock” USDA regulations. The court order listing violations is an outline of the USDA’s Food and Inspection Service regimen. Farmer Miller’s own judgment of how to produce the highest quality food is a flat-out rejection of regulation. A decision of the court suggests the government’s position on Miller’s methods.

On July 21, 2021, Federal Judge Edward G. Smith signed a 39-page order imposing sanctions on Miller and the farm, including a $250,000 fine and other penalties “to effect defendants’ future compliance, by making them aware of the seriousness of their violations and the consequences of future violations…”

The farm was ordered to pay the fine within 30 days or face further penalties “including imprisonment of Amos Miller.”

The farm is ordered not to slaughter any animals in violation of the order or face a $25,000 a day penalty. Miller is ordered to cease and desist all meat and poultry retail operations, except to get rid of inventory.

In summer, 2022, Amos Miller, continuing his six-year legal battle with the USDA (represented by the U.S, Justice Department), filed papers with the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania. Miller also has taken some of the decision-making to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, including an appeal to change attorneys (which has been denied).

However, they don't realize that a crypto token's real potential lies in its tokenomics and future roadmaps. This is why today you'll go through Decentraland (MANA), Aptos (APT) & Dogeliens Token (DOGET) in detail and figure out if they are worth holding in the long term. So, let's review them one by one!

What's Great About Decentraland (MANA)?

The first project under discussion is Decentraland (MANA). It's an ERC-20 cryptocurrency with blockchain running on the Ethereum (ETH) network. MANA was developed by a Silicon Valley entrepreneur going by the name of Ariel Meilich. According to his Bio, he had previous experience with CRM startups, so initiating this new venture didn't require many resources. Due to the collaborative efforts of his team and funding firms, MANA came into existence in the later months of 2017.

The main use case of this cryptocurrency is in the VR realm. MANA's blockchain enables digital creators and developers easy access to the metaverse. Individuals on its main net can trade virtual space and develop their ecosystems around it. Similarly, MANA is a big player on the governance side of things. Due to the recent metaverse hype, MANA has significantly improved its price tag. It's trading under the $10 mark, with an ATH of $5 at the beginning of 2021.

What's Great About Aptos (APT)?

The next token on the review is Aptos (API). It's widely renowned as a ""Solana (SOL) Killer"" in the market due to its similar application. Like MANA, API is a new cryptocurrency in the niche that Avery Ching founded. It's a decentralized project led by a team of more than 500 onboard developers.

Nevertheless, APT became operational near the end of 2022. It uses proof of stake consensus and is compatible with on-chain governance. APT aims to unite web 3.0 technologies and make the blockchain more accessible for every sort of consumer. Due to its robust roadmap, APT has received more than $300 million in VCS funding. Its maximum token supply is kept at the 1 billion mark, with more than 8% allocated for crypto pre-sale.

What's Great About Dogeliens Token (DOGET)?

The last project in this post goes by the name of Dogeliens Token (DOGET). It's a meme currency much like its predecessor (DOGE), with tokenomics utterly dependent on community support. The good thing about DOGET is that it's built around an open-source blockchain. This gives a bit of transparency in the market with trust deficiency. Similarly, it uses the Binance Smart Chain, which means its on-chain potential could be second to none.

At the time of writing, DOGET is going through its token sale, after which they plan on releasing its NFT collectibles. DOGET also has big plans to close the gaps between GameFi applications. This way, users can earn token rewards while playing their favorite games. It has a maximum on-chain supply of 25 billion, with a decent chunk of tokens reserved for early holders.

Buying Guide for Dogeliens Token (DOGET) In Pre-sale

Dogeliens Tokens (DOGET) are accessible in the presale stages, and holders can buy these tokens from their official web page. All you need is to sign in to your MetaMask or other wallets in the given timeline and choose the exchange pair. Then select how many DOGET tokens you would like to hold, and it's done! This concludes our list of the best cryptocurrency with long-term insight.

Tokens like DOGET are good contenders to test the bear market and acquire a loyal community. As long as they stick to their roadmaps, their potential could skyrocket, and that's coming from a meme project. Like most tokens, Dogeliens Token (DOGET) offers some fantastic pre-sale bonuses. On each of your ETH transactions, you get a solid 10% bonus back. On top of that, if you buy DOGET through USDT, you will receive a staggering 18% reward.

In a new blog post, Daniel Schoenberger, the Web3 Foundation’s chief legal officer, tells the SEC that DOT has transformed from a security into software and no longer falls under the regulatory agency’s jurisdiction.

“Over the years, we have developed what we believe is a workable theory of how token morphing may be achieved for an increasingly decentralized project, like Polkadot, and a digital asset that, other than having been offered and sold initially for fundraising purposes, does not, itself, bear security-like characteristics. We have shared this theory many times with the SEC…

Consistent with the views that we have shared with the SEC staff, we are pleased to announce that DOT, the native digital asset of the Polkadot blockchain, has morphed. In our view, current day offers and sales of DOT are not securities transactions, and DOT is not a security. It is merely software.”

Schoenberger says that while DOT could have been considered a security at first, the team behind it made sure they did everything they could to morph it, including talking with the SEC.

“Whatever it took in order for DOT, the native token of the Polkadot blockchain to be – or to become – a non-security, we were willing to do it. And so, we decided to try to take the SEC’s FinHub [Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology] staff up on the offer to ‘come in and talk to us.’”

The executive goes on to say that the SEC was open and willing to communicate, leading the Web3 Foundation to create solutions to the issues the regulatory agency may have had about DOT’s transformation.

“Our experience has been a positive one. The SEC has welcomed meetings with the Web3 Foundation, and there has been a spirit of open communication and dialogue. Those ongoing interactions have given us a deeper understanding of some of the SEC’s concerns and have helped us to develop solutions to address them.”

Ellen bought us tickets to see Jerry Seinfeld last night in Phoenix.

He missed lines, yelled at the audience, and used a lot of old material.

I kid (although I am sure someone on Twitter said this).

He was great. He is still at the top of his game on the stage. It was fun to see a legend.

Jerry makes it seem as if anyone could do comedy, which is of course the gift, because it is impossible to do what Jerry does as he weaves words and tones together with his stories and observations.

As for stuff I read that you might enjoy…

I own some Meta stock and it has been a bloodbath. I thought I was buying a tobacco stock but it tuns out I just bought a terrible technology stock.

The big problem is Mark Zuckerberg getting schooled in how ‘pipes’ work by Apple. The other big problem is the META spending on the METAverse.

Anyhoo, Ben Thompson sheds a little light on the METAmyths floating around.

This podcast from Joe and Tracey at Bloomberg does a great job explaining the ass kicking Apple has delivered to Facebook and the ad industry. Have a listen.

The cloud is where I have most of my small remaining stock portfolio these days and it has been a horrifying place to be. I have been bludgeoned as rates rise and money flows out. Battery is out with their yearly ‘State of the OpenCloud’ so you may enjoy reading it.

Lastly, my new favorite topic is NFT’s. I am building my next company on the blockchain and I have been down the NFT rabbit hole because of the benefits I believe it will offer my users/members/customers. One of those benefits is creator royalties which have come under siege of late. Fred explains it better than I could.

I look at the royalties as a way to help new companies (like the one I am building) that build using NFT’s to profit from ‘churn’ the bane of existence of every web 1 and 2 business.

One thing about building for ‘web 3’ is the art of ‘not rushing’. We just got through a ‘web 2’ era of go fast, break things, winner take all, launch and fix so one of the big mistakes I notice about web 3 companies is the rush to launch and the assumption that web 3 business and growth tactics will be the same as web 1 and 2 tactics.

Maybe one day, but not just yet.

If you have not listened to my podcast with Sami and Maggied discussing this slow move to blockchains and the importance of compute, you should do that. You can listen right here.

Many crypto firms faced issues this 2022 due to the market crash. Some downsized, while others filed for bankruptcy. Generally, the entire market felt the impact of the crypto winter, and investors lost billions of capital too.

As a result, those that survived the crash are taking measures to avoid such situations in the future. Also, most firms are aiming better to protect their customers’ funds in times of crisis. On this note, Circle has taken a bold step to prepare itself for such situations.

About Circle Reserve Fund

Circle partnered with BlackRock when creating the Fund. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world. It was established in 1988 and focused on managing its client’s assets and helping them minimize risks. The company is based in N.Y. city and has a total of $10 trillion in AUM (Assets Under Management).

The Fund which Circle established is already registered under Rule 2a-7 government money market fund under BlackRock. According to details, the Fund contains short-dated U.S Treasuries and cash.

The Fund will operate under an independent board’s control and release the portfolio holdings report daily. Also, it complies with the provisions of the 1940 Investment Company Act.

Only Circle can access the Fund and plans to buy new Treasury holdings with the proceeds. Also, the USDC issuer aims to store its Treasury holdings in the Fund that the Bank of New York Mellon controls. Circle has already started the process and plans to round it up by Q1 of 2023.

How Is USDC Performance So Far

In the stablecoin market, USDC is the second largest crypto in market capitalization after USDT. The stablecoin is pegged to the United States Dollar and has continued to grow in recognition and acceptance.

Circle has continued its effort to make USDC a widely adopted option. The firm plans to spread it on more networks, including Cosmos, Polkadot, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Near. USDC will enter the COSMOS blockchain by early 2023, while others will follow by the end of 2023.

Also, Circle will soon start issuing crypto in Singapore. It has already secured the approval to acquire a license to run a payment institution in the country. This license has empowered it to handle cross-border and domestic payments in Singapore. The firm received the approval in November 2022.

Circle aims to make USDC a go-to stablecoin amongst United States crypto investors. It is safe to say that the firm might soon accomplish the feat.

Coinbase recently revealed that the number of people who buy USDC with USD is higher than those who believe in other fiat currencies.

The best way to capitalize on Aptos airdrop season safely is to use as many applications on the network as possible.

We've created a short step-by-step guide to help readers get in on airdrops from Aptos projects that are rumored to launch them.

In crypto, new network launches are typically followed by airdrop seasons. These “seasons” are periods when all the new projects that have successfully built applications on the network’s testnet get ready to launch them on mainnet. To spur activity and attract new users to their product, they airdrop an allocation of their native token to early adopters.

For new projects, airdrops are a great way to attract attention and do a fair initial distribution of their native governance tokens. For users, they’re a great way to earn risk-free money by trying out new applications. The latest example of this is the launch of one of the most anticipated Layer 1 networks, Aptos, and the airdrop season that is coming up.

Hunting for Aptos Airdrops

Before we dig into the best ways to capitalize on Aptos airdrop season, here is a short primer on the network.

Aptos is a Proof-of-Stake-based Layer 1 blockchain that combines parallel transaction processing with a new smart contract language called Move to achieve very high transaction throughput. It’s built by Aptos Labs, a blockchain startup spearheaded by two former Meta employees, Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching. It is considered the technological successor of Meta’s abandoned blockchain project Diem, which is the main reason it has garnered a lot of early attention.

Aptos launched on mainnet on October 19 with an airdrop of 150 APT tokens (worth about $1,237 at the time) to users who took part in its incentivized testnet. Less than a month since, hundreds of new projects have either launched or announced their release on Aptos, with many hinting at potential airdrops. And while the majority of these airdrops have not yet been officially confirmed, many airdrop hunters have already started using applications in hopes of qualifying.

The best way to capitalize on this gold rush is to use as many Aptos applications as possible since many of them could retroactively reward their users with airdrops. You can start using the network and preparing for airdrop season with a small amount of capital to reduce your risk exposure; allocating a lower sum to airdrop hunting strategies is unlikely to exclude you from potential opportunities. Aptos News provides a Notion page with an extensive list of live and upcoming applications on Aptos. You can filter for the projects that are already live on mainnet and then go through them to see whether they have plans to launch tokens.

To help you kickstart your Aptos journey and potentially walk away with a nice profit, we’ve put together a short step-by-step guide that could help you secure tokens from some projects that are rumored for upcoming airdrops.

1. Get an Aptos Wallet

The first step in this process is to download a crypto wallet that supports Aptos. Currently, the two most popular wallets are Martian and Pontem. Download and install both, as some Aptos applications only support one and not the other. Besides, both wallets are rumored to launch their own tokens, but to qualify you’ll have to follow different steps.

For Martian, after you download the Chrome extension and create your wallet, visit this webpage, change the network from inside your wallet to the Devnet, acquire some devnet APT tokens, and mint the free Martian NFT. Holding this NFT will increase your chances of receiving a potential airdrop from the project soon.

To qualify for the Pontem airdrop, which has been officially confirmed, you’ll first need to download the Pontem Chrome extension, create your wallet, and bridge some tokens to Aptos.

2. Bridge USDC using the Aptos Bridge

We recommend bridging a stablecoin like USDC using LayerZero’s Aptos Bridge. There’s a good chance that you’ll kill two birds with one stone doing this, as LayerZero is also rumored to launch its own token.

To move USDC to Aptos, go to the Aptos Bridge, connect your MetaMask wallet on Ethereum and your Pontem wallet on Aptos, select the amount of USDC you want to move from Ethereum to Aptos and click “transfer.” In a few minutes, you’ll have USDC in your Pontem wallet on Aptos. This should help qualify you for the LayerZero airdrop.

3. Trade on Liquidswap

To qualify for the Pontem airdrop, you’ll need to use the project’s decentralized exchange on Aptos, Liquidswap. Before you can do this, however, you’ll need to acquire some APT tokens, as you’ll need them to pay the gas fees to transact on Aptos. Currently, the only way to do this is by using centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or FTX and then withdrawing the APT to your Pontem wallet on Aptos.

After you’ve got some APT, you can go on Liquidswap and make a simple swap to hopefully qualify for the Pontem airdrop. For example, if you want more exposure to APT, you can swap the USDC you bridged from Ethereum for APT, which should be enough to qualify you for the airdrop. However, to increase your chances even further, it could also be a good idea to provide liquidity. Since you should already have USDC and APT on Aptos if you followed the previous steps, you can provide liquidity in the APT/USDC pool on the exchange. To do this, click on the “Pools” option in the top right-hand corner of Liquidswap’s homepage, select APT and USDC as your desired tokens, and then click “Provide Liquidity.” You can stop providing liquidity at any time, but it would be wise to keep doing it until the airdrop is distributed.

4. Buy Aptos Monkeys or Aptomingos NFTs

Enchanter Finance is another decentralized exchange on Aptos that has confirmed an airdrop. To qualify for this one, you’ll have to purchase NFTs from either the Aptos Monkeys or the Aptomingos collections and follow the steps outlined in the team’s official airdrop guide. This airdrop campaign is set to start in the following days, so make sure you keep tabs on the project’s social media accounts for updates. It’s also a good idea to do a simple swap or provide liquidity on the exchange in case they decide to retroactively reward their users in the future.

5. Trade on Cetus Protocol

To cover all bases, consider swapping and providing liquidity on the Cetus Protocol decentralized exchange, as it’s another project rumored to launch a token soon. The process is effectively the same as swapping or adding liquidity on Liquidswap and Enchanter Finance.

6. Start liquid staking on Tortuga

Another project you should consider using is the Aptos liquid staking protocol Tortuga. While it has yet to officially confirm an airdrop, Tortuga has announced plans to launch its own token, which it will distribute to its users. To qualify for a potential Tortuga airdrop, you can stake APT for the yield-bearing tAPT token on Tortuga’s liquid staking application and then provide liquidity for the APT/tAPT trading pair on the AUX decentralized exchange on Aptos.

Final Thoughts

As many of the potential airdrop opportunities are unconfirmed, there is a good chance that some of them may not materialize. Furthermore, it’s worth considering that the Aptos ecosystem is still in its early stages, and the applications built on it may be prone to bugs or hacks. This is especially true for decentralized exchanges, which may experience liquidity issues or suffer from platform-wide outages.

With that said, hunting for Aptos airdrops using only small amounts should outweigh the inherent risks of using the nascent Layer 1 network and its smart contract-based protocols. As Aptos airdrop season approaches, there’s every reason to follow our guide and get stuck in.

This shows that when investors intend to invest in a cryptocurrency, they must assess its tangibility and fundamentals.

Among such cryptocurrencies with good fundamentals are Hex Coin (HEX) and Enji coin (ENJ), which show promise. However, market analysts suggest Flasko, an alternative investment with the potential to go to the moon.

Hex Coin (HEX) Investors Hop On To Fasko (FLSK) Presale

Hex Coin (HEX) is a revolutionary cryptocurrency that presents itself as a top blockchain certificate of deposit. Hex Coin (HEX) started on the Ethereum network, and since its inception, the price has significantly increased and had an annual percentage yield of 38%, which led to it having a high-interest rate.

The Hex Coin (HEX) token combines Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of work (PoW) algorithms with a consensus mechanism. Hex Coin (HEX) trades at $0.043 after a 1.05% price reduction in the past seven days. While it has a market capitalization of $7.56 billion, its daily trading volume is around $5.46 million, which shows a significant drop in the number of investors.

Enjin Coin (ENJ) Price In Reds, As Flasko (FLSK) Price Climbs Higher

Enjin Coin (ENJ) is an Ethereum-based ecosystem that offers related gaming blockchain items. Users in the ecosystem can build virtual goods stores and clans and even talk with others on the social Enjin Coin (ENJ) gaming platform.

Since this year's market crash, Enjin Coin (ENJ) has been in the red and has struggled to get out of the bearish zone. Last year, the price of Enjin Coin (ENJ) decreased by more than 70%, and since it reached its all-time high of $4.89 on 25th November 2021, Enjin Coin (ENJ) has dropped by more than 80%.

Enjin Coin (ENJ) currently trades at $0.44 and has yet to be able to reverse its situation by showing positive growth. Over the past 90 days, Enjin Coin (ENJ) has declined by more than 23.86%, with Enjin Coin (ENJ) only showing a recent price reversal in the past seven days by performing a +3.38% price increase.

Analyst Predict Flasko (FLSK) To Be The Top Investment Of The Year

Flasko will be the first alternative platform that lets investors trade in minted and fractionalized NFTs backed by a real-world utility in the form of luxury wines, champagnes, and whiskeys. As a novel idea, investors would be able to partake in a multimillion-dollar sector known to grow in value.

Flasko is currently in its second presale stage, and we think it might be a good opportunity to buy into a future blue-chip cryptocurrency at an excellent price of only $0.077. The first presale stage recorded a massive influx of whales, and market analysts predicted Flasko would perform over 2,000% by Q1 2023.

Analysts predict Flasko to be among the top cryptocurrency investments of 2023 simply because it has passed its audit from Solid Proof and has liquidity that will be locked for 33 years. This makes it a safe investment that prevents situations like a rug pull. You can learn more about the Flasko protocol by following the links below.

However, new data indicates that the company stood a bigger chance of more profits if it had opted for Ethereum (ETH).

In this case, MicroStrategy could have recorded about 108.72% or an additional $3 billion in profits as of November 6 by investing in Ethereum, data by Blockchain Center’s Rohmeo_de indicates.

In particular, as of September 20, 2022, the company had a Bitcoin haul of 130,000 BTC with a market value of $ 2.76 billion by the time of publishing. However, if the amount was invested in Ethereum, it could control about 3,542,000 ETH valued at $ 5.77 billion.

Possible profits between BTC and ETH for MicroStrategy. Source: BlockchainCenter.net

MicroStrategy’s history with Bitcoin

It is worth mentioning that MicroStrategy has accumulated Bitcoin during different phases of market cycles. As reported by Finbold, the company used the ongoing bear market to add more Bitcoin, with former CEO Michael Saylor maintaining that the asset is the ultimate store of value and hedge against inflation alongside being ‘second to none’.

At the same time, MicroStrategy has incurred losses on its Bitcoin investment. During Q2 2002, MSTR reported quarterly revenue of $122.1 million against expectations of $126 million, with a $918.1 million loss. Interestingly, $917.8 million of the losses was attributed to its Bitcoin holdings.

Elsewhere, the company has received criticism for the Bitcoin option, with ‘The Black Swan’ author Nassim Nicholas Taleb mocking Saylor by stating that his exit from the helm of MicroStrategy was another “nail in the coffin” to the company’s skepticism of not selling Bitcoin despite the bear market.

Ethereum’s potential

Based on the profit potential, Ethereum appears to live up to its latest expectation amid intense network development. Ethereum has undergone different upgrades, like the Merge that transitioned the blockchain to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) status.

Due to the accompanying deflationary features, the historic upgrade has been touted to make Ethereum attractive to institutions.

Furthermore, due to Ethereum’s decentralized nature and energy efficiency, a market section believes the token is poised to overtake Bitcoin as the number one cryptocurrency. Despite recently recording a minor price rally, Bitcoin’s continued drop in market dominance aids the flipping notion. Interestingly, the drop in dominance comes as more altcoins continue to be the center of attention.

Amid the variance in potential profits, Ethereum and Bitcoin still maintain bullish sentiment. By the end of 2022, projections indicate that Bitcoin might regain the critical support level of $25,000. Elsewhere, as reported by Finbold on October 27, Ethereum could reclaim the $3,000 level by 2023.

In general, both assets continue to be weighed down by the prevailing market conditions leading to a drop from significant levels. By press, Bitcoin was attempting to sustain recent gains, trading at $21,187, while Ethereum was valued at $1,600.",blockchain,finbold.com

In a lengthy Twitter thread, Pal tells his 984,000 followers that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could reshape almost every aspect of societal infrastructure.

The Real Vision founder says that currently, most people think NFTs predominantly pertain to cultural purposes, such as art, community or brands. However, Pal says this is only the tip of the iceberg.

“While the tokenisation of culture is almost infinite and has only just started, most people miss the even bigger picture…

ALL contracts will get tokenized as NFTs as they more efficient, cheaper, faster and more secure.

ALL: ID, tickets, reservations (hotels, airlines, trains, restaurants etc), all insurance contracts, internet permissions, hotel keys, car documents, real estate, certifications…

advertising, supply chain contracts, inventory management, business deals, driving licenses, medical records, employment history, references, etc etc… but it gets even bigger…”

The macro expert says that the entire financial industry – quadrillions of dollars worth of value – could ultimately be forced to integrate with NFT and blockchain technology.

“The entire financial industry is based around contracts at a truly VAST scale – too big for the old City of London ‘My Word is My Bond’ system to work and a two party, audited ledger/database….

There are somewhere between $650 trillion and $4 QUADRILLION of derivatives, $250 trillion of equities, same in bonds, etc. These are all non-fungible contracts of sorts (some are large and some are one of ones like a special over-the-counter option)..

All asset management and funds will be tokenized too. It is much faster, accessible, transparent and more efficient.

AND the ‘smart’ element of NFTs mean that enforcement or dispute resolution is automatic, cheaper and faster, as is ‘storage or ownership.'”

It does not necessarily reflect the opinion of U.Today. Every investment and all trading involves risk, so you should always perform your own research prior to making decisions. We do not recommend investing money you cannot afford to lose.

The main token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, SHIB, has performed impressively against its main rival Dogecoin since midweek. Since Wednesday, Nov. 2, SHIB has gained 13% against DOGE, now trading at 0.0001 Dogecoin per Shiba Inu token.

However, despite strong gains from the middle of last week, the chart of the week prior to this one is best left unopened. SHIB then fell to DOGE, driven by news of Musk's purchase of Twitter, by almost 40%, despite its price to the dollar rising by 30%.

""Wen Shibarium?""

A possible trigger for SHIB's price was the emergence of fresh details about Shiba Inu's own Layer 2 blockchain Shibarium. First, it was announced by the project's lead developer that after the release of Shiba Eternity, the team's focus and energy are now entirely on Shibarium.

Then later in the week the information was confirmed by a member of the Unification Foundation, also involved in building the protocol. Unification's product lead confirmed Shytoshi Kusama's words and said that the alpha version of Shibarium is getting an update every day.

Originally planned for release in the third quarter of this year, Shibarium should take the ecosystem to the next level and expand the use of not only SHIB, but also all other tokens involved like BONE or LEASH.",blockchain,u.today

Dogecoin continued to exhibit strength this week taking centerstage against the backdrop of Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.

Last week, the world’s largest meme cryptocurrency surged by as much as 165% to touch $0.1583 after Elon Musk purchased the social media giant, bringing the idea of integrating Dogecoin closer to fruition. However, the crypto asset’s price recoiled sharply over the weekend ahead of the Fed’s interest rate decision dropping as low as $0.1230 on Wednesday.

Nearly 64 Billion Dogecoins Purchased at $0.092

Despite Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies exhibiting weak volatility, Doge has remained buoyed even as investors seemingly stockpiled on the hope that a further nod on the integration could be a boon for the asset’s price.

Crypto analysis expert “Ali” shared a chart showing 350,000 addresses purchased nearly 64 billion DOGE on Saturday at an average price of $0.092. Technically, this level is considered solid support by Dogecoin bulls, as it took close to seven months for the price to breach. Thus, according to Ali, this level “provides a stable and stiff support floor for DOGE,” he tweeted.

Furthermore, according to data from IntoTheBlock, 64% of Dogecoin traders are currently in profit, with the cryptocurrency’s sentiment indicator tilting to the “mostly bullish” side.

Traders Remain Bullish on Doge

Meanwhile, most investors believe there is still some room for Dogecoin’s growth, having undergone a major outbreak. “Even after more than a year of a hardcore bear market, we still see that there’s always room for speculation,” crypto-focused analytics firm Santiment wrote on Monday.

David Gokhshtein, the founder of Blockchain Media Company Gokhshtein Media, also indicated that there is a likelihood that Doge would still rally to surpass its all-time high of $0.7332 if Elon musk carries on with his Dogecoin-Twitter integrations plans. “If it’s true from Elon’s hint yesterday about possibly implementing DOGE into Twitter, it easily will pass its ATH,” tweeted Gokhshtein.

While chasing the rally now may be risky because of the possibility of a “sell-the-news” event, DOGE’s breakout may have long-term implications if the bulls build a new base above the former resistance-turned-support of $0.92. Currently, most traders are waiting for a price pullback to make entries around the said support, believing that it could help trigger a sizeable bounce to $0.20.

As of writing, dogecoin was trading at $0.124 after posting a 3.11% drop in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.",blockchain,zycrypto

Cardano's community-focused Twitter account, ADA whale, revisits his prediction of ""big techs"" or tech giants entering the crypto industry, so much so that the latter becomes ""indistinguishable"" from it.

ADA whale predicts that while most cryptocurrencies will compete with these tech giants, Cardano will raise the bar by being fully P2P decentralized and self-governed.

They're going to get their heads stuck so deep up Big Tech's behind that they will become indistinguishable from it. Again, I've been predicting and explaining that this would happen since the moment I started tweeting. Now sit back and watch it all play out — ADA whale (@cardano_whale) November 5, 2022

He wrote, ""Tech giants will enter crypto. AppleCoin will have amazing smart contracts and offer regulated financial products. Most of crypto will be competing with them. By then, Cardano will be fully P2P decentralized and self-governed. Out of anyone's grasp and a different beast altogether.""

At the heart of the Cardano network are 3,229 stake pools run by operators (SPOs), who oversee the distributed nodes that keep the network operational. This is because the decentralization of Cardano puts the responsibility for running the blockchain in the hands of stake pools.

Ads

Likewise, reliable and efficient connections between all the distributed nodes and making sure the network is resilient to failure are key components of this decentralization drive.

With the launch of the peer-to-peer (P2P) testnet in December 2021, Cardano began a significant project to help its continued push toward complete decentralization. P2P communication aims to enhance information transfer between nodes.

After the Vasil hard fork event that occurred on Sept. 22, P2P networking, or decentralization of the networking layer, is the most anticipated upgrade. Once all P2P nodes are operational, the Cardano network will be entirely decentralized, eliminating the need for centralized services that the network currently utilizes.

The pseudonymous trader known as Kaleo tells his 538,000 Twitter followers that Cosmos (ATOM), which aims to be an ecosystem of interoperable blockchains, will be one of the more explosive altcoins on the market once it gets going.

Kaleo takes a look at Cosmos’ Bitcoin pair (ATOM/BTC), which he says will signal the next big move for ATOM.

“I wouldn’t sleep on ATOM either.

When it finally breaks out of this three-year base range formed on the BTC pair, it’ll be explosive.”

At time of writing, ATOM is valued at $15.12.

Kaleo also has a high price target for meme token Dogecoin (DOGE), which he thinks still has much more gas in the tank, despite the recent hype around it.

According to Kaleo, DOGE is on its way to tagging the $0.20 level.

“DOGE path to $0.20.”

At time of writing, DOGE is changing hands for $0.124.

The trader is also forecasting huge strength for top Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL), predicting that it will significantly outperform Bitcoin in the coming weeks.

“SOL is up against resistance on the verge of absolutely sending on this fine Saturday morning”

Based on Kaleo’s chart, he expects the SOL/BTC ratio to soar roughly 78% from its current price of 0.00168 BTC ($35.56).

The closely followed trader is also bullish on Ethereum scaling solution Polygon (MATIC). Despite showing relative strength against the market over the past week, Kaleo thinks MATIC still has more room to run, setting a rough target near all-time highs at about $2.80.

“Plenty of room to run higher.”

At time of writing, MATIC is trading for $1.15.

The crypto trader also has his radar locked on THORchain (RUNE), blockchain platform designed to facilitate the secure and cheap transfer of assets between different blockchains.

Kaleo calls for an upward target of $3.00 for RUNE, 81% higher than its current price of $1.65.

“Ideal RUNE target price is ~ $3.00”

203,Vitalik Buterin Faces Criticism of Ethereum's Centralization,https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/2022-11/25523.jpg,06/11/2022,Future of Ethereum becoming more questionable as way decisions are made remains unclear,https://u.today/vitalik-buterin-faces-criticism-of-ethereums-centralization,"Future of Ethereum becoming more questionable as way decisions are made remains unclear

Every investment and all trading involves risk, so you should always perform your own research prior to making decisions. We do not recommend investing money you cannot afford to lose.

Censorship, centralization and control have been the buzzwords around Ethereum for the past few months after the implementation of the Merge on the network. Those allegations are not made without a foundation, as the path the network is taking is questionable, and users feel that way when confronting Vitalik Buterin.

Who is battling Vitalik Buterin?

A Twitter user with the nickname mr.y asked the Ethereum community about the inner governance structure and the decision-making process in which the future of the network is decided and the roadmap is formed.

According to the user, it is hard to call a network truly decentralized when its faith is decided by one person only, which is why they created a thread in which they tried to find out how exactly the roadmap for Ethereum is created.

Ads

Some users and developers assume that Vitalik Buterin gathers information from developers, enthusiasts and validators and then forms a consensus, which becomes a foundation of a roadmap in the future.

However, the user questioned the aforementioned approach and asked Buterin to clarify how exactly the Ethereum founder gathers opinions about the future of the blockchain outside of the core team.

Surprising answer

Prior to Buterin answering the question, it was assumed that he talked to users on conferences and via private messages since it is a convenient way of gathering data and then forming a consensus on the future of the network.

The above, and passively read twitter and reddit like everyone else. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 5, 2022

Shortly after, Buterin added that one of his methods of forming a network-wide consensus is ""passively reading Twitter and Reddit like everyone else,"" which caused a mixed reaction in the community since forming an opinion based on an algorithm-based recommendation feed could be inaccurate, to say the least.",blockchain,u.today

It is no news to anyone that the rules of crypto make it a risky game to play, but as the year draws to close many crypto platforms are achieving great success and communities are building.

As 2023 is nearly upon us, it is time to start really figuring out which cryptocurrencies are best to invest in and which platforms will allow people’s online funds to excel. We are all familiar with some of the most iconic coins, but which ones are really skyrocketing at the moment? And which ones are worth investing in to kickstart your crypto success in the new year?

Let’s dive into five exciting cryptocurrencies which you have to look into investing in before 2023.

You Are In For A Surprise With Big Eyes

This meme token phenomenon is far from being on its way out. Big Eyes Coin is curating huge success and bringing together the cat-loving community in the meantime. The platform despite still being in presale has already raised just under $10 million and has a hugely impressive online following.

It exists to connect a large community of feline friends and allow them to learn and discuss the world of crypto whilst bonding over their favourite cute animals.

With an exceptional charity plan set up targeted towards saving the oceans and developing out-of-this-world NFTs, the Big Eyes Coin is one to certainly look into and consider investing in.

The development of a solid and reliable community with Big Eyes is certainly what is making them the talk of the crypto town. It gathers trust in a risky industry and allows people to connect on that very level. With excellent and fun features and functionalities at your fingertips, what are you waiting for?

Do Not Dodge Dogecoin

Sticking with the meme tokens, Dogecoin is the OG which kickstarted the meme coin craze. The open-source digital currency having recently celebrated its 17th birthday, is one of the most resilient coins and very relevant for the meme culture of this generation. It allows investors to relate to the content while earning from it at the same time.

It connects people to teach them about crypto, enjoy fun and super cute memes, fundraise for great causes and all in all be a secure and enjoyable currency to invest in.

Don’t hesitate. You would be woofing mad too.

The Little Dog with A Big Bark - Shiba Inu

This small but super popular meme coin gained its initial popularity through its charm and inspires artists worldwide to rejoice over dog-loving meme content and everything crypto. Still, a relatively new coin, launching in 2020 it aims to be an Ethereum-based counterpart and act as the ‘Dogecoin killer’.

It also gained huge success last year by being listed on Coinbase, which is the largest US-based crypto exchange!

This coin really has something to show for itself in this dog-eat-dog world.

The Cardano Crypto Extraordinare

Cardano is an impressive blockchain platform designed for innovative individuals and visionaries. It hosts a combination of different technologies which provide security for its users and sustainability to decentralised systems.

People investing in this ADA coin will be delegated into a stake pool with the chance to win exciting benefits and rewards, with the chance to also participate in running the platform yourself. Exciting right?

The platform allows like-minded individuals to connect and explore the world of crypto on their terms.

With many people exploring the wonders of crypto, it is about time we all really got our teeth stuck in. Check out the link below for very exciting developments.

In a blog post published two days ago, Hayes explained the difference between CBDCs and the current forms of electronic cash:

“A CBDC is government issued digital currency (i.e., digital cash) that exists purely in electronic form and allows you to defy the above physics lesson. It is base money just like physical cash — a liability of the central bank. This is different from the electronic money you are familiar with, which rides on the traditional commercial bank rails. That money — created by the banking system through loans — is made-up credit money, rather than a direct liability of the central bank (a la cold, hard cash).

“The other big difference between CBDC’s and current electronic cash is that, due to the innovations afforded by blockchain technology, the government can program their CBDCs to be 100% under their control. It’s this additional level of control that will enable them to solve their two-pronged inflation problem.“

He then talked about private fiat-backed stablecoins and why they were doomed:

“The reason why stablecoins exist and are popular is because there is no competing CBDC. Should the Federal Reserve roll out FedCoin, there will be very little reason to use any of these solutions, as the FedCoin will be backed by the government and can never go bankrupt.“

He ended his blog post by saying:

“I am also optimistic because today I still have the ability to buy the supreme antidote: Bitcoin. This window won’t last forever. Capital controls are coming, and when all money is digital and certain transactions are not allowed, the ability to purchase Bitcoin will quickly vanish. If any of this doom porn resonates with you and you don’t own at least a very small % of your liquid net worth in Bitcoin, the best day to have bought Bitcoin was yesterday.“

In a recent interview, the former BitMEX CEO talked about how he selects potential winners for the next bull cycle in the crypto market.

According to a report by The Daily Hodl, during an interview with Real Vision Founder and CEO Raoul Pal that was recorded on 22 September 2022, Hayes said:

“I guess you use survivorship bias. If I’m looking at a top 20 market cap asset and it’s down 95%, will it survive to the next cycle? Will it survive the next two years? How much money did they raise? If the answer is yes, buy it... Worst case, it goes down to zero. Best case, goes up with 10x or 20x. If it went from 100 to one and it goes from one to 10, it’s a 10x. Still isn’t anywhere near where it was, but I’m just playing the rebound.

“So you know that on the rebound of crypto, when the next cycle begins, everything that fell the most is going to rise the most just by the path dependency of how returns work. And so, I guess this doesn’t change in most of these things. Most of them will fail, you don’t really care. It’s really just a numbers game.“

In a blog post published on 23 September 2022, Hayes talked about how he expects the Ethereum ($ETH) price to change in the next few months:

“As I have said in various interviews, the only thing that I believe matters in the short term (i.e., the next three to six months) is how ETH issuance per block falls under the new Proof-of-Stake model. In the few days post-merge, the rate of ETH emissions has dropped on average from a +13,000 ETH per day to -100 ETH.

“The price of ETH continues to get smoked due to deteriorating USD liquidity, but give the changes in the supply and demand dynamics time to percolate. Check back in a few months, and I suspect you’ll see that the dramatic reduction in supply has created a strong and rising floor on the price.

“I wrote previously that I purchased $3,000 strike ETH/USD December 2022 call options. I fear I might not have enough time left to get into the money on those options…

“Is the removal of almost $2 billion in sell pressure enough to cause the price to more than double in a little over three months from now? If my USD liquidity index turns higher, then maybe I stand a chance. But hope is not an investment strategy. I most likely overestimated how quickly the reduction in supply would translate into higher ETH fiat prices.

“Versus Bitcoin, I am confident that ETH will continue to outperform. The cleaner trade would have been to buy options on the ETH/BTC cross. But I already had that position in the physical, and I like trading, so I went for it.“

Solana has faced many challenges over crypto winter, including ongoing outages and a decline in DeFi activity.

While Solana has issues to overcome and competition to face, it remains one of crypto's strongest and most promising ecosystems.

Solana is one of several Layer 1 networks to have suffered in the enduring crypto winter. But sunny skies could return, Chris Williams writes.

Solana Makes a Splash at Breakpoint

It was a big weekend for Solana as the Layer 1 network hosted the 2022 edition of its Breakpoint conference. As for SOL? Not so much.

The thousands of Solana fans that flocked to Lisbon for the Layer 1 blockchain’s flagship event were treated to several big announcements throughout the conference. Arguably the biggest one came Saturday when Google Cloud revealed that it was running a Solana validator and would start indexing Solana data via its BigQuery product in early 2023. Google Cloud will also make Solana available via its Blockchain Node Engine to help users run their own nodes in the cloud. Per CoinGecko data, SOL immediately rallied double digits past $38 as the announcement broke, but the momentum didn’t last. It’s since cooled by 5.5%, trading at around $34 today.

In a different approach to other blockchains such as Ethereum, the various engineers working in the Solana ecosystem have focused on building products for the mass market. An example of such a product is its Saga phone, which aims to be the world’s first Web3-ready smartphone. Solana announced at Breakpoint that it would ship the product to developers as soon as next month.

USDC issuer Circle also appeared at Breakpoint, announcing that it would make its Euro Coin offering available on Solana in the first half of 2023. Euro Coin is already live on Ethereum. Circle also revealed that its forthcoming cross-chain protocol would support Solana.

Arguably GameFi’s most anticipated title, Star Atlas developers shared an early demo for the game at Breakpoint. Solana’s high-speed capabilities (it claims to process 65,000 transactions per second) could make it a prime candidate for the Web3 gaming space, but as there are no leading titles available to play today, it’s unclear how much progress teams have made—and whether Solana will become a hub for the niche. Games typically take years to develop, so it could be some time until Solana’s GameFi ecosystem picks up.

The State of Solana DeFi

Like much of the crypto space, Solana has had a rocky year, not least in its DeFi ecosystem.

Solana topped $10 billion in total value locked as SOL neared $260 in November 2021, around the time of the inaugural edition of Breakpoint.

However, Solana DeFi has taken a beating this year thanks to crashing market prices, liquidity taking flight to other networks, and brutal token unlock schedules diluting the value of some of the ecosystem’s stars of 2021. According to Defi Llama data, today the total value locked on Solana is around $968 million, which is slightly less than Avalanche’s $1.31 billion and a fraction of Ethereum’s $32.29 billion. If the numbers don’t drastically change in the future, Solana may find that it thrives in other areas. However, it’s also worth noting that the total value locked has remained more stable in SOL terms this year, down around 54% from its June 2022 peak to roughly 31.3 million SOL.

Notably, Solana now trails the Ethereum Layer 2 network Arbitrum in total value locked terms, and only slightly leads ahead of Optimism. If Layer 2 continues to grow at its current pace, Solana could find that it’s not only in competition with other Layer 1 networks for liquidity.

Both the Mango Markets and Solend exploits were possible due to low liquidity levels on their platforms, which made it easier for whales to manipulate their markets to take out outsized loans. While Solana protocols are coming up with solutions to such problems, the network’s DeFi ecosystem could continue to run into issues as long as liquidity is low.

While Solana DeFi is down, by far the biggest criticism leveled at the network is over its repeated outages. Solana has suffered from hours-long downtimes on multiple occasions over the past two years, most notably in September 2021 when it went down for 18 hours. Solana has been hit by four major outages in 2022, with the most recent downtime last month occurring due to a misconfigured node.

Though outages have been a persistent problem for the network, Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko has said that a forthcoming upgrade will prevent such incidents in the future. If Solana can overcome the problem as he promises, the network should be in a much better position by the next crypto market boom.

Leveraging High Speeds and Low Costs

While Solana DeFi may be in a slump, the same can’t be said for the network’s NFT ecosystem.

With the second biggest NFT ecosystem behind Ethereum, Solana has built a fast-growing community of so-called “JPEG enthusiasts.” This year, collections like DeGods and y00ts have taken the NFT scene by storm, trading at thousands of dollars on the secondary market despite adverse market conditions.

Solana has also attracted many big names from the digital art world. At Breakpoint, Metaplex announced that it would launch “immersive 3D NFTs” from Beeple on Solana, taking a notable branch out from Ethereum. pplpleasr, another leading artist in the NFT space, has also previously launched Solana NFTs. Where much of the mainstream attention over non-fungible digital collectibles has been on Ethereum, NFT natives have seen that activity is growing on its strongest competitor network. The next NFT bull cycle could look different to the last one now that Solana’s NFT community and infrastructure have gained so much pace throughout the bear market.

Solana also seems to be aware of its standing in the GameFi world due to its high-speed, low-cost capabilities. Breakpoint featured an entire day dedicated to the buzzy sector, which was where Star Atlas and other teams showed off their latest progress to a packed room of would-be Web3 gamers.

What’s the Future for Solana?

While the network has challenges to overcome, it’s abundantly clear that many positive developments are coming from the network. The various announcements made at Breakpoint prove that talented companies, artists, and projects are taking a keen interest in the Solana network despite the difficulties it has faced.

It’s also worth pointing out that Solana and SOL aren’t the only victims of crypto winter. While SOL is down around 86.9% from its peak after outperforming in 2021, many other Layer 1 networks have suffered similar losses. DeFi has also taken a beating across the board, with Ethereum coming out strongest. Historically, Ethereum’s competitors—sometimes dubbed “Ethereum Killers”—have seen activity wane and their tokens die off in bear markets, but none of them has had as many positive developments as Solana has done over recent months.

Perhaps the greatest hurdle ahead for the network lies in its competition. The new Layer 1 networks Aptos and Sui, both developed by former Meta employees, have been compared to Solana owing to their promise of high speeds, and both projects have raised nine-figure war chests this year. Aptos, which claims it can process 100,000 transactions per second through its Move programming language, launched with a token airdrop last month and anticipation for its growth is high. Sui is also believed to be preparing its own airdrop. Capital is merciless in crypto; if these projects successfully capture the space’s attention, they could end up outpacing Solana on the next market rally.

As with other leaders of what’s become known as the “alternative Layer 1” space, Solana will also soon have competition in the form of Layer 2 networks. Arbitrum and Optimism’s rapid growth this year has proven that liquidity will flood to Layer 2 if Ethereum succeeds, and many other Layer 2 projects are yet to launch in earnest.

Still, Solana has one of crypto’s most active and fastest-growing ecosystems with several promising developments on the horizon. Despite its issues, it’s clear that the network isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. As for SOL, while the utility token may not be moving today, that’s not uncommon for crypto bear markets—however positive the news cycle looks. Once sentiment flips to bullish, though, there’s good reason to believe that SOL could see the benefit.

Blockchain elements are referred to by a long hexadecimal string. Just like IPv6 addresses, those are hard to remember. Creating human-friendly names that resolve to those strings was deemed an important step for the early adoption of blockchain technologies. Early blockchain developers did not develop DNS extensions for that purpose. They created entirely new alternative naming systems based on the particular blockchain they were working on.

We are exploring all options for a unified web based solution to the problem.

Now, the Twitter co-founder has earned the hatred of the people who work at that social network, among other things, for having supported Elon Musk's purchase of it.

""Jack is hated at Twitter,"" a close source told the New York Post. ""They blame Jack for what happened with Elon's takeover of the company. Parag Agrawal - the now former Twitter chief - and the board think he's a really bad character.""

""Just look at the stock price before Elon bought it. It was about $37 and had been flat for about 10 years. The company hadn't grown because Jack was riding around in his jet surrounded by models,"" the source said. ""But no one wrote about what a mess the company was because everyone idolizes Dorsey and thinks he's the next Steve Jobs.""

Dorsey didn't leave good numbers at the company

""When [Dorsey] left this last time he blamed Twitter's problems on other people - even though he was on the board and CEO!"" author Nick Bilton said of Dorsey's resignation in 2021.

Dorsey, in fact, opted to reinvest his $1 billion stake (thanks to 18 million shares) in Twitter rather than cash out.

""At one point he was the lowest person in the room at Twitter and then, because he wanted to be the highest person in the room, he was, and he ended up being CEO,"" said Bilton, author of the 2014 book ""Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power Friendship and Betrayal.""

Others come to his defense

""Jack is not hot-headed or hot-blooded,"" said Nik Yakovenko, who worked at Twitter under Dorsey from 2015 to 2017. ""He's a calm person. A lot of bosses are not calm. He's a little more cerebral. He's also a lot more sincere than you'd think. He's not that interested in money. He loves nature and the outdoors and is very into blockchain. It remains to be seen what happens with Bluesky. It's about decentralizing social networks in the future to give users more autonomy.""

After co-founding Twitter in 2006 with Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Noah Glass, ""Jack no longer talks to any of his Twitter co-founders,"" said another source.

""Jack always seems to be the harbinger of things to come. His diet, biohacking, fasting: he's always one of the first to do things. What he does will be seen as hip and cool three years down the road,"" expressed another.",blockchain,marca
212,hydra-chain-py added to PyPI,https://pypi.org/static/images/twitter.6fecba6f.jpg,06/11/2022,Hydra Chain Tools & Application Library.,https://pypi.org/project/hydra-chain-py/,"This is a Python support library for the Hydra Chain project (https://hydrachain.org) aimed at simplifying the process of using and developing apps for the blockchain.

Primarily, hypy (pronounced ""hippie"") currently provides:

RPC tools to access the Hydra JSON-RPC service.

A flexible command line tool with simple integration.

Application infrastructure to extend apps & tools.

Integrated apps for common tasks such as monitoring or connecting to new nodes.

Quick Start

If you know what this is and just want to get going, install:

pip install hydra-chain-py

Or with poetry:

poetry add hydra-chain-py

This adds the hydra package to your Python installation.

Then, to get started, run:

hy --help

Full download/install and usage instructions follow.

Usage

This library connects to a Hydra node on a local system or over a network.

The primary tool to interface with the node is called hycli , and for the most part behaves exactly the same as hydra-cli , with some nicer output options:

hycli getinfo

getinfo .version 180506 .protocolversion 70017 .walletversion 169900 .balance 28047 .31917165 .stake 1452 .99760027 .locked .used 128 .free 65408 .total 65536 .locked 65536 .chunks_used 2 .chunks_free 2 .blocks 155763 .timeoffset 0 .connections 8 .proxy .difficulty .proof-of-work 1 .52587890625e-05 .proof-of-stake 797825 .1819042678 .testnet True .moneysupply 20931869 .76468454 .burnedcoins 73748 .17511400 .keypoololdest 1635530802 .keypoolsize 2000 .unlocked_until 1741407462 .relayfee 0 .004 .errors

There's also hytop , which periodically displays useful node status info in a human-readable format:

hytop -C

Clone & Install

This is both a library that you can import into your Python code and a command line tool that you can use and extend.

When installing hypy , the command line tools become available as well.

To install the latest from git without cloning the repository, jump down to the Remote Installation section.

Clone/Download Sources:

git clone https://github.com/hydraverse/hypy

Cloning into 'hypy' ... ...

Environment

The simplest way to use hypy is to install it at the system level, but sometimes it can be hard to manage varying Python version needs and dependencies.

If installing at the system level, jump down to the Installation section.

Poetry

This is now the only recommended/supported way to install or develop with this package.

Create a new poetry project:

poetry new myproject && cd myproject && poetry add hydra-chain-py

Installing

From Source

Installing from the cloned hypy library folder:

poetry install .

Remote Installation

Installing directly from GitHub:

poetry add git+https://github.com/hydraverse/hypy

Or to get a specific branch, tag, or revision:

poetry add git+https://github.com/hydraverse/hypy@v2.7.2

This example installs the v2.7.2 tagged version.

Uninstall

pip uninstall hypy

Or

poetry remove hydra-chain-py

Packaging

You can create a redistributable wheel package for later installation with the following command:

poetry build

Use: hy

hy is the Hydra Chain Tool, a command-line toolkit meant to run standalone modules, aka apps , with convenient access to instantiated library objects.

Some apps are provided by the library, and the hy module provides you with a means to integrate your own apps and run them as if they were part of the tool. More on that in the example app below.

Running an app on the command line looks something like this (note: '֍' is the command shell prompt):

hy [-h] <some-app> [-h] [options] [app params]

Use the -h option before the app name to see a list of apps, and after to get usage for a particular app.

The primary apps currently available are cli and test . These are provided as system-level commands alongside hy when you install hypy .

This means that instead of calling hy cli ... , for example, you can use hycli ... instead.

Note that all program options (except -h or -v ) must appear after the app name.

Run Unit Tests

hy test - [-k ""<test_name_pattern> or <test_name_pattern> ...""]

This command is also available globally (with slight variation, no need for - param) after installation as hytest .

You can also specify different parameters for the tests with environment variables, such as HYPY_LOG . These variables also work with hy .

HY_RPC_WALLET=watch HY_LOG=ERROR hy test -

Experts, researchers and business representatives tackled the topic of how to build an effective digital government, and how such a government would yield new opportunities for the development of public services, rural areas and industries.

1. Public services continue to improve as digital government becomes the norm

Smart China Expo Kaizhou Forum Discusses How to Build Effective Digital Government

In the view of Meng Qingguo, executive director of the National Governance Institute of Tsinghua University, when building a digital government, a thorough reconstruction of the existing department-driven information model where systems, platforms, and data are decentralized becomes necessary. The government is now being tasked with accelerating the establishment of a national, fully integrated big data system for all public affairs, with the multiple goals of further promoting the integration and sharing of data, improving existing and developing new data disclosure, authorization and operation mechanisms, and putting in place a digital government that is both systematic and holistic.

Li Zonglei, director of the E-government Office of Chongqing Municipal People's Government, said that as a key part of the city's efforts to build a digital government, Yukuaiban, the integrated online government service platform of the E-government Office has digitalized and created e-documents for every resident including their ID, health, social security and medical insurance information. The platform is divided into service areas for more than 100 application scenarios covering housing, employment, tourism, entertainment and shopping, in addition to providing local residents with easier access to authentication, medical treatment, transportation, and other services. Next, the E-government Office will continue to enhance the online delivery system for the full range of public services, making it more user-friendly and widening the number of channels through which the services can be accessed.

Pu Binbin, Party Secretary of Kaizhou District, Chongqing, said that based on actual conditions, the district will build a digital government, a digital and smart Kaizhou, and digital villages, with the goal of promoting quality development throughout the region with big data and intelligence, while providing more convenience to the companies and residents who do business and live in Kaizhou.

2. Digital villages facilitate the optimization of the rural digital governance system

According to Lei Xiaoling, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Kaizhou District People's Congress, more than 5,300 4G base stations, 1,500 5G base stations, and six Internet Towns have been built in the district, forming a strong network of agricultural big data and resources. A large number of premium and unique rural e-commerce brands are emerging with the establishment of the online big data platform, creating a flourishing rural network culture and making the rural digital governance system more sophisticated.

Zhang Zhaoxin, a researcher at the Rural Economy Research Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, suggested that digital technology be deployed to enhance the IT infrastructure and network, overhaul the basic information collection system, accelerate the development of service systems, and build a system-wide services chain, empowering the transformation of the whole agricultural industry chain in addition to enabling the public and specialized services systems to better serve rural revitalization.

Wang Dacheng, deputy secretary of the National Remote Sensing Application Engineering Technology Research Center of the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that given where the world is at in terms of the transition into the digital era, the planning and governance of rural areas is in urgent need of digital technologies. E-maps, satellite images, capture of street scenes in real time and other geographic information data, as well as portals where villagers can participate in interactive activities, can deliver to the community what is expected and should be expected from rural governance.

3. The digital economy is the future as digital industries are booming

At the forum, Tan Jianrong, an researcher at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor at Zhejiang University, summarized five key steps that must be taken to achieve a digital economy and digital transformation: innovative design, process improvement, quality enhancement, service extension and market expansion, all of which serve to advance the digital transformation of all businesses in the region and foster quality development of a digital economy.

Zhao Kefeng, academic chairman of the Shenzhen Artificial Intelligence Industry Association, offered the opinion that it is necessary to accelerate the process of extracting value from the available data, promote the digital transformation of the real economy, strengthen the governance capacity of the digital economy, improve basic industrial capabilities, and further the open cooperation that will be the result of the creation of a digital economy.

Guo Linyuan, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and deputy general manager of Digital Chongqing Company, said that Chongqing is moving forward with the construction of Smart City 2.0 and, while doing so, improve urban intelligence with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies, strengthen the underlying infrastructure, resolve any data chokepoints, and exploit the value of data, while fostering the agglomeration and development of industry and commerce.

The forum was hosted by the Organizing Committee of Smart China Expo, and co-organized by the Chongqing Big Data Application and Development Administration and Chongqing Kaizhou District People's Government.

217,Inside Succession meeting at Lachlan Murdoch's $150M LA mansion where Rupert 'passed the baton',https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/11/04/00/64177719-0-image-a-32_1667522919835.jpg,06/11/2022,Observers at a gathering of billionaire Rupert Murdoch's top international lieutenants believe they watched the media mogul silently relinquish power to his 51-year-old son.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11383881/Inside-Succession-meeting-Lachlan-Murdochs-150M-LA-mansion-Rupert-passed-baton.html,"It was the unprecedented gathering of Fox and News Corporation leaders from around the world where Rupert Murdoch would be upstaged by one of his own children.

Lachlan Murdoch had summoned the empire's most senior executives to his Los Angeles mansion Chartwell, the fictional Clampett family's home in the 1960s TV sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies.

Media mogul Rupert's eldest son dubbed the meeting 'MegaTrends 2022' and it was meant to sharpen the focus of News and Fox bosses on where their operations were heading.

But to some observers it became the moment the ageing Australian-born billionaire relinquished control of the family business to his enigmatic heir apparent.

It was also one of the last times Rupert, now 91, was seen with fourth wife Jerry Hall before the former model, 25 years his junior, filed for divorce.

Rupert Murdoch reportedly 'passed the baton' to eldest son Lachlan at a meeting of Fox and News Corp executives earlier this year. Lachlan is pictured being pursued by photographers outside his father's London home at the height of News Corp's phone hacking scandal in 2011

Lachlan Murdoch, pictured with wife Sarah, called a meeting at his Bel Air mansion to sharpen the focus of News and Fox bosses. To some observers it became the moment media mogul Rupert relinquished control of the family business to his enigmatic son and heir apparent

What happened at Chartwell that day is part of the sweeping story journalist Paddy Manning tells in his new book The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch.

Manning has written the first major biography of the 51-year-old who as News Corp co-chairman and Fox executive chairman and CEO is already one of the planet's most powerful people.

The Successor explores Lachlan's upbringing, business dealings and political beliefs. Its publisher describes Manning's work as 'an epic saga of ruthless power plays and family battles'.

While Lachlan's destiny might seem clear he could yet have to contend with sisters Prue, 64 and Elisabeth, 54, and brother James, 49 upon their father's death.

[Prue's mother was Patricia Booker. Elisabeth, Lachlan and James's mother is Anna Torv. Rupert's much younger children Grace, 20, and Chloe, 19, to third wife Wendi Deng are beneficiaries of the Murdoch trust but do not have voting rights].

The direction the Murdoch empire would take under Lachlan was laid out to all those guests he greeted at the gates of Chartwell from 7.30am on February 9 this year.

While Lachlan's destiny might seem clear he could yet have to contend with sisters Prue, 64 and Elisabeth, 54, and brother James, 49 upon their father's death. Lachlan is pictured left with father Rupert and brother James after Rupert's wedding to Jerry Hall in March 2016

The following is an extract from The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch by Paddy Manning published by Black Inc:

The scene was worthy of Succession, as some guests joked to one other. A convoy of luxury black minivans collected the Fox and News bigwigs from three nearby hotels before snaking up Bel Air Road and disgorging them at the mansion.

Given Rupert, now ninety years old was attending, the vigilance against the coronavirus was high: everyone had to be fully vaccinated and tested on the way in.

Lachlan had already distributed a 124-page dossier of clippings, articles and links to podcasts, transcripts and corporate announcements, with a glossary at the back for the less geeky.

Journalist Paddy Manning has written The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch, the first full biography of the 51-year-old. Rupert Murdoch and second wife Anna are pictured in London in 1973 with children (clockwise from top left) James, Lachlan and Elisabeth

It raised some challenging questions for the century-old empire of influence that Lachlan and his guests controlled, most crucially how a combination of structurally challenged newspaper and cable television businesses would survive 'Web 3.0' - the next iteration of the internet - a trustless and permissionless 'creator economy' in which content was globally and instantaneously distributed, disintermediated and tokenised, and barriers to entry were obliterated. Blockchain, crypto, the metaverse - all were on the agenda. It was heady stuff.

The timing was fortuitous, as the guests had barely seen one another in person through two long years of COVID. And it was fun: for most guests, it was a first look at Chartwell, which Lachlan had bought for $150 million just before the pandemic struck.

Lachlan Murdoch bought Chartwell (above) for $150million in 2019. The mansion was used for exterior scenes of the Clampett family home in the 1960s TV sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies

Lachlan and Sarah Murdoch are pictured at the funeral of his grandmother Dame Elisabeth with sons Kalan and Aiden. Dame Elisabeth, Rupert's mother, died in 2012 aged 103

Turning into the driveway, leading to the forty-car motor court, guests walked through the eighteenth-century French replica interiors and downstairs to the cinema, which opened out through big double doors onto a huge terrace with sweeping views over the gardens and Los Angeles.

After coffee and breakfast, everyone came back inside and sat in rows... wherever they liked. Lachlan stepped onto the stage, which was set up with a podium and sofas in front of two big projection screens.

After welcoming everybody to Chartwell, he gave a short speech before proceedings got underway. Nobody knew what to expect. Apparently, you could have heard a pin drop. Rupert said nothing. This was Lachlan's show, in Lachlan's home, following an agenda he had worked out with his chief technology officer.

Lachlan married model Sarah O'Hare in 1999 and they have three children. The rock solid couple is pictured in November 1998 shortly after announcing their engagement

COVID had made both companies stronger, Lachlan said, adding that while in the past both Fox and News had tried to respond to an externally changing environment, 'we are now strong enough to shape that environment'. That was the point of the strategy day: to make sure the leaders of both businesses had a clear understanding of the forces unfolding in the media industry, so that together the two companies could shape what the future would bring.

Everything about that day at Chartwell was different.

Firstly, Rupert had not brought the Fox and News leadership teams together since they had demerged a decade earlier, in the wake of the phone hacking crisis. The ageing mogul had always pitted his top executives against each other, giving them separate profit and loss statements and letting their businesses compete.

Lachlan crewed on American business magnate Larry Ellison's yacht Sayonara in the 1998 Sydney to Hobart race when six sailors died. He described the experience as harrowing

Lachlan was more concerned to find synergies between TV, print, radio and other assets, and to foster cooperation among them. It was a theme that had run through his career, right back to the 1998 speech at Sun Valley, Idaho, when he had called for an unofficial system to share information across the Murdoch empire, horizontally as it were.

There were all kinds of pre- and post-meetings between the News and Fox leadership, and the presence of both under one roof invited speculation that a merger of the two companies - ruled out by Lachlan at the investor day three years earlier - was again under consideration.

Secondly, the meeting was about strategy, not about operations or short-term tactics. The last time News Corp's senior executives had all met together, at Rupert's Carmel ranch, was three years ago; at that meeting, there had been much preening about which division had the fastest-loading websites.

The Successor is 'an epic saga of ruthless power plays and family battles'. Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are pictured outside News Corp's headquarters in Sydney's Surry Hills in 2004

The day at Chartwell was much more farsighted. In Lachlan's view, media companies had panicked at the advent of Web 1.0, and only belatedly realised that Web 2.0 meant Google, Facebook and the rest were going to soak up the advertising dollars.

This time around, with Web 3.0, Lachlan was determined that both Fox and News would be active, working together and even alongside other media companies to confront yet another potentially existential threat.

If Web 1.0 undermined revenue from consumers, and Web 2.0 took the advertising revenue, Web 3.0 could undermine the very relationship between a broadcaster such as Fox, or a publisher such as News, and their most critical resource: employees.

Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are pictured deep in conversation before a morning session at the Allen & Co Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho in July 2018

Legacy media businesses were ripe for disruption in the creator economy, warned the pre-read, which would enable individual creatives to build a business around themselves. Once again, this harked back to Lachlan's first big speech at Sun Valley, when he had said he hoped News would become the greatest creative company in the world.

Thirdly, the meeting was all about business. It was not an editorial meeting. Unlike the company gatherings under Rupert, there were no politicians, secretaries of state or military brass to gladhand over a drink.

Editors, journalists or on-air talent were not invited. No Fox commentators Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity to throw their weight around; no newspaper columnists Miranda Devine or Gerry Baker to lob sceptical questions. And because there were no gossipy journalists there, not a word leaked to the media. According to one attendee:

Lachlan and Sarah Murdoch are pictured aboard their $30million yacht Istros on Sydney Harbour earlier this year. Lachlan bought the boat for Sarah's 50th birthday

'Journalists are going to get time to meet with politicians,' said one participant, 'but meeting with politicians is not going to help you run your business better. This is for the leadership of these two companies, and it's going to be about our business.

'That's Lachlan's point: he's setting the bar high and saying ""I need high calibre executives"". Being able to make chit-chat with politicians is fantastic if you're a journalist, and that's a really important part of our business. But I need strategic people who know what the future is and who are going to help shape that.'

After Lachlan stepped down from the stage, it was the invited speakers' turn. There were sessions on the metaverse, gaming, non-fungible tokens, and the awesome, enduring power of live sports content.

The gathering at Lachlan's mansion Chartwell was one of the last times his father Rupert was seen with fourth wife Jerry Hall (both pictured). She filed for divorce in July this year

Shopify founder Tobi Lütke, who'd recently joined the board of crypto exchange Coinbase, talked through the implications of Web 3.0 for Fox and News... although with his own share price tanking, there were a few septics.

Silicon Valley-based investor Ben Horowitz talked about the changing role of venture capital, which could provide the kind of high-risk, patient funding that had fuelled many of the technological innovations of the previous two decades.

The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch by Paddy Manning is out now in Australia and is published by Black Inc

That caught some attention, especially among those in the room who knew Lachlan's history of off-again, on-again efforts to take part or all of News Corp private. Was privatisation back on the agenda?

By the time the session broke for morning tea, the guests were remarking to each other on the most noteworthy aspect of the whole thing: 'Lachlan's in charge.' The invited speakers were there because they had a relationship with Lachlan, not his father.

Rupert was saying nothing - or if he did, it was to ask questions about Web 3.0 that showed he wasn't up to speed, and he made no speech, either at the meeting or at the dinner and drinks that followed, to which Jerry Hall turned up - one of the last occasions at which they would be seen together before their divorce shocked the world.

The whole mood was different: instead of blokey and jokey, beery and matey, the vibe was serious. There was a lot of talk about Russia's expected invasion of Ukraine, which would occur only two weeks later.

One attendee reckoned the whole day at Chartwell was about an explicit transfer of power, from father to son: 'It was just a massive turning point. The baton had very obviously been passed and the rest of us, as a group, we all went, ""Okay, we missed the point that the baton got passed, but it's been passed.""'

The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch by Paddy Manning is out now in Australia (Black Inc.) through Booktopia and in all good bookshops. The book will be published in US and UK on November 15.",blockchain,daily mail

The internet has arguably been one of mankind's greatest inventions. Over the years, the web has evolved into a digital ecosystem where communities and businesses can thrive. Web3 has presented a ton of opportunities for creativity and connectivity. Cryptocurrency, NFTs, AR, and VR are some innovations that promise to elevate marketing in Web 3, and software development company Dev Team Inc. has made a move to dominate this space.

Denis Gvozd co-founded Dev Team Inc. in 2016. The company started providing IT services, and the core value was always to listen to the customer. Their website says: ""Our goal is to create a special culture that encourages and inspires our people to become the main driving force of our client's success."" True to form, the company is driving itself to the forefront of innovation.

Since the beginning, Dev Team has been composed of a small number of skilled people - ensuring efficiency and speed. Don't be fooled by their size, however, as they have a full suite of offers. Dev Team serves you with multiple IT-related services, such as custom web applications, mobile apps, DApps development services, augmented reality services, big data consulting, cloud consulting, UX design services, and quality assurance.

The company offers a risk-free trial with no contracts or obligations for those looking to get started with Dev Team.

Since the inception of Web3, companies have been moving towards it, and so has Dev Team. The team has integrated their client app with the latest blockchain-based infrastructure in the backend. Dev Team also helps brands provide their clients access and interaction through cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and even NFTs. These services make it easier and smoother for Web 2-based clients to transition their services to Web3.

Dev Team's specialized teams help clients prepare decentralized apps for web-based operations or smart contracts. Cardano looks to be their platform of choice, which means they are positioned early for highly-efficient Web3 optimization. Denis said ""I also launched the Cardano Stake Pool and the profits from the stake pool will go to our internal school where we teach students Haskell language and Cardano Dapps development.

The move towards decentralized platforms is a huge challenge especially because the technology is in its infancy. But innovation, vision, and drive has always been the core to the moves made at Dev Team. Denis mentions that starting Dev Team wasn't easy; he faced a real dilemma of starting his new venture or continuing a secure job. Contributions made by Denis and Andrei Pakliak, another co-founder at Dev Team Inc, were crucial in finding the right talent, establishing corporate culture, finding clients, and more.

When asked what his biggest entrepreneurial learning was, Denis says: ""My motto in life is never to give up. No matter how it sounds, if you want to succeed, you do not need to give up at the first difficulty."" He's also a firm believer of the fact that difficulties make us stronger.

The future of the Dev Team is to grow and offer a wider variety of services. The team looks forward to adding more offices across the US. They also want to form business partnerships with similar IT companies abroad, including Argentina, Poland, Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan.

Experts, researchers and business representatives tackled the topic of how to build an effective digital government, and how such a government would yield new opportunities for the development of public services, rural areas and industries.

Smart China Expo Kaizhou Forum Discusses How to Build Effective Digital Government (PRNewswire)

1. Public services continue to improve as digital government becomes the norm

In the view of Meng Qingguo, executive director of the National Governance Institute of Tsinghua University, when building a digital government, a thorough reconstruction of the existing department-driven information model where systems, platforms, and data are decentralized becomes necessary. The government is now being tasked with accelerating the establishment of a national, fully integrated big data system for all public affairs, with the multiple goals of further promoting the integration and sharing of data, improving existing and developing new data disclosure, authorization and operation mechanisms, and putting in place a digital government that is both systematic and holistic.

Li Zonglei, director of the E-government Office of Chongqing Municipal People's Government, said that as a key part of the city's efforts to build a digital government, Yukuaiban, the integrated online government service platform of the E-government Office has digitalized and created e-documents for every resident including their ID, health, social security and medical insurance information. The platform is divided into service areas for more than 100 application scenarios covering housing, employment, tourism, entertainment and shopping, in addition to providing local residents with easier access to authentication, medical treatment, transportation, and other services. Next, the E-government Office will continue to enhance the online delivery system for the full range of public services, making it more user-friendly and widening the number of channels through which the services can be accessed.

Pu Binbin, Party Secretary of Kaizhou District, Chongqing, said that based on actual conditions, the district will build a digital government, a digital and smart Kaizhou, and digital villages, with the goal of promoting quality development throughout the region with big data and intelligence, while providing more convenience to the companies and residents who do business and live in Kaizhou.

2. Digital villages facilitate the optimization of the rural digital governance system

According to Lei Xiaoling, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Kaizhou District People's Congress, more than 5,300 4G base stations, 1,500 5G base stations, and six Internet Towns have been built in the district, forming a strong network of agricultural big data and resources. A large number of premium and unique rural e-commerce brands are emerging with the establishment of the online big data platform, creating a flourishing rural network culture and making the rural digital governance system more sophisticated.

Zhang Zhaoxin, a researcher at the Rural Economy Research Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, suggested that digital technology be deployed to enhance the IT infrastructure and network, overhaul the basic information collection system, accelerate the development of service systems, and build a system-wide services chain, empowering the transformation of the whole agricultural industry chain in addition to enabling the public and specialized services systems to better serve rural revitalization.

Wang Dacheng, deputy secretary of the National Remote Sensing Application Engineering Technology Research Center of the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that given where the world is at in terms of the transition into the digital era, the planning and governance of rural areas is in urgent need of digital technologies. E-maps, satellite images, capture of street scenes in real time and other geographic information data, as well as portals where villagers can participate in interactive activities, can deliver to the community what is expected and should be expected from rural governance.

3. The digital economy is the future as digital industries are booming

At the forum, Tan Jianrong, an researcher at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor at Zhejiang University, summarized five key steps that must be taken to achieve a digital economy and digital transformation: innovative design, process improvement, quality enhancement, service extension and market expansion, all of which serve to advance the digital transformation of all businesses in the region and foster quality development of a digital economy.

Zhao Kefeng, academic chairman of the Shenzhen Artificial Intelligence Industry Association, offered the opinion that it is necessary to accelerate the process of extracting value from the available data, promote the digital transformation of the real economy, strengthen the governance capacity of the digital economy, improve basic industrial capabilities, and further the open cooperation that will be the result of the creation of a digital economy.

Guo Linyuan, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and deputy general manager of Digital Chongqing Company, said that Chongqing is moving forward with the construction of Smart City 2.0 and, while doing so, improve urban intelligence with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies, strengthen the underlying infrastructure, resolve any data chokepoints, and exploit the value of data, while fostering the agglomeration and development of industry and commerce.

The forum was hosted by the Organizing Committee of Smart China Expo, and co-organized by the Chongqing Big Data Application and Development Administration and Chongqing Kaizhou District People's Government.

225,"Cloudflare Sets Ambitious, and Realistic, Growth Target",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/708016/cloud-computing-microchip-technology-1.jpg,06/11/2022,The edge computing leader is looking to 5X its annualized revenue over the next five years.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/06/cloudflare-sets-ambitious-and-realistic-growth-tar/,"Shares of Cloudflare (NET -5.04%) were hammered on Friday despite beating analyst estimates on all fronts with its third-quarter report. The edge computing company is feeling no real pain from the current economic environment. Cloudflare grew revenue by 47% year over year and signed up 159 enterprise customers with annual budgets exceeding $100,000. There are now 1,908 of these large customers on Cloudflare's platform.

While Cloudflare's results were impressive, its long-term outlook was the real story. After reaching $1 billion in annualized revenue in the third quarter, Cloudflare has plans to grow that number to $5 billion over the next five years. To reach that goal, revenue would need to grow at a compound annual rate of about 38%.

This target may seem ambitious, especially considering the state of the economy. Here's why it's doable for this edge computing leader.

Massive market opportunities

Cloudflare got its start protecting websites and servers from attacks. Its platform slides between end users and servers, detecting and absorbing malicious traffic. This requires a global network, which Cloudflare has expanded to over 275 cities in 100 countries over the years.

Cloudflare's greatest asset is optionality. That global network is useful for a whole lot more than keeping customers safe from attacks. Websites can be sped up by caching content close to users; bits of code can be run at the edge; and a full suite of security products can help companies connect employees with applications and data.

Cloudflare's total addressable market was just $32 billion in 2018, consisting of the core security and content distribution services that gave the company its start. TAM has since expanded to $115 billion, and Cloudflare expects it to grow to $135 billion by 2024.

The markets for Cloudflare's core features are still growing; layered on top of that are additional growth opportunities. Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform, which competes with Zscaler and other cloud-first cybersecurity companies, helps employees securely access a company's applications and data. That capability is particular important now that remote work and hybrid work are so prevalent.

Object storage is another big opportunity. Any company making use of cloud computing needs to store arbitrary data somewhere. There are plenty of object storage services available, including on the big cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services. Cloudflare stands out with its pricing. Storage costs are low, and the company doesn't charge for bandwidth at all. AWS, on the other hand, piles on the fees.

Cloudflare is also aiming to become a full-fledged cloud computing platform for developers. It offers Workers, allowing developers to run code close to users, Pages, which hosts static content like webpages, various data products including the D1 database, and messaging hub service Pub/Sub. A full-stack application can be deployed entirely on Cloudflare's platform, albeit with some limitations, potentially eliminating the need for traditional cloud platforms like AWS.

Even if some of these products don't work out quite as well as the company expects, Cloudflare has so many irons in the fire that hitting its growth target looks very doable.

Still an expensive stock

Cloudflare has excellent long-term growth prospects, but the stock is expensive enough that it should give investors pause. Even after taking a beating this year, Cloudflare is valued at roughly $13.5 billion. Based in its 2022 revenue guidance, Cloudflare trades at a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 14.

In this market environment, that's a valuation that's hard to justify. Cloudflare is growing fast, but the company is not yet profitable or free-cash-flow-positive. And while business is still humming along, it's hard to say how durable the company's results will be if global economies enter recession next year.

Cloudflare is a great company, but even the best company bought at too high a price can lead to lackluster results for investors.",cloud computing,motley fool

Chinese giants Tencent and Unicom form edgy CDN JV

Two of China's tech titans – web and gaming giant Tencent, and mega-carrier China Unicom – have formed a joint venture to promote edge computing and content delivery networks.

After Chinese press spotted a regulatory filing about the team up, China Unicom told the world in a filing [PDF] on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

That document states the companies plan to create a jointly owned company ""which mainly engages in content distribution network (CDN) and edge computing businesses [and] will develop comprehensive CDN/ Multi-Access Edge Computing platform capability, operating capability and product innovation capability.""

Neither has said if the JV will operate outside China – an issue of some interest as the US won't let Chinese carriers touch its networks.

China's government has made development of edge resources a policy priority, so the JV will likely find fertile ground.

Facebook India boss bails

Facebook's Indian leader has resigned and joined rival social media service Snap.

In a LinkedIn post Ajit Mohan wrote: ""After almost 4 years leading Meta (Facebook) in India, I am stepping down from my role. I am grateful to the company for the amazing opportunity to lead its efforts in one of its most important countries and I am absolutely proud of the work the team and I have done to create impact for people, creators and businesses around the country.""

""When I took on this role, my objective was to build a team and a company that would be a valuable ally to India and play a useful role in fuelling its economic and social transformation. This is exactly what we have managed to do in the last four years.""

Facebook has certainly found itself in fewer fights with government than other social media outfits over the last few years but has also struggled with India's laws requiring online platforms to moderate more content and faced criticism of its privacy practices.

Mohan wrote that he is ""excited to share that I am going to lead the Asia Pacific region for Snap and be a part of the company's executive team.""

US gets tetchy about Chinese rocket launch

China's third and final space station module, Mengtian, successfully launched and docked with Taingong space station last week.

But China again failed to inform he world of where the Long March booster would land, sparking tetchy tweets from US space command.

#USSPACECOM can confirm a second atmospheric reentry correlated with the #PRC’s Long March 5B #CZ5B as it exited the #USSPACECOM Area of Responsibility over the Northeast Pacific Ocean region at 4:06am MDT/10:06 UTC on Nov. 4. https://t.co/keJdc1tmxi — U.S. Space Command (@US_SpaceCom) November 4, 2022

China often launches payloads without advising where upper stages will land. Tracking such hardware is non-trivial, and the objects are sufficiently large to do significant damage, making the failure to advise of trajectories impolite in the extreme and also unusual among spacefaring nations.

See why I rate MSFT stock a buy.,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4553918-microsoft-dont-give-in-to-fear-here,"lcva2

Thesis

We updated investors in our previous Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) article to consider waiting for a validated bullish reversal for a more conservative entry.

Unfortunately, the bullish reversal didn't arrive. Instead, it only brought upon bears who correctly anticipated CEO Satya Nadella and team could release weak guidance, given the significant macro headwinds (coupled with the Street's optimism).

Hence, further value compression in MSFT to de-rate its More Personal Computing segment was justified, with the segment's execution likely significantly de-risked accordingly to Trefis' sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation.

The company's guidance reflecting broad-based deceleration, particularly in its Cloud segment, demonstrated that MSFT's valuation could continue to trade in a tight range. As a result, we assess that its valuation is close to the lows last seen in the 2018 and 2020 bear markets. Also, it's re-testing its critical 200-week moving average, which should also attract long-term buyers to stanch further downside momentum from the bears.

Notwithstanding, we also observed that SaaS stocks had been broadly de-rated after recent poor releases from MSFT's industry peers, as Fortinet (FTNT) and Atlassian (TEAM) got ""destroyed,"" given their poor guidance.

Therefore, the market is looking for MSFT to demonstrate market leadership in uncertain times to lift the buying sentiments of its software peers. With MSFT cautiously perched against its ""final defense line"" before a potential further selloff, a validated bullish reversal (still pending) in MSFT could telegraph confidence in software stocks after this week's compression.

While we remain cognizant of the risks of a broad industry de-rating impacting MSFT, we believe the reward/risk of MSFT at these levels seems favorable.

Maintain Buy.

Microsoft Cloud Needs To Reverse Its Below-Trend Growth

Microsoft Cloud Revenue change % (Company filings)

Microsoft Cloud accounted for 51.3% of FQ1'23 revenue, up from Q4's share of 48.2%. Therefore, Cloud's increasing importance to Microsoft's valuation cannot be further emphasized and will be carefully parsed by the market moving forward.

With Nadella putting increasing emphasis on the interoperability of Microsoft's Cloud ecosystem, it has helped Microsoft avoid even more pain as the PC market slumped significantly.

In a recent interview with Stratechery, Nadella highlighted his vision of why Microsoft is working closely with Meta Platforms (META) in realizing the broad concept of the metaverse. He accentuated:

I also want our application experiences in particular, to be available on all platforms, that's very central to how our strategy is. For example, when I think about the Metaverse, the first thing I think about is it's not going to be born in isolation from everything else that's in our lives, which is you're going to have a Mac or a Windows PC, you're going to have an iOS or an Android phone, and maybe you'll have a headset. So if that is your life, how do we bring, especially Microsoft 365, all of the relationships that are set up, the work artifacts I've set up all to life in that ecosystem of devices? - Stratechery

However, Microsoft Cloud's revenue was not immune to the macro headwinds, as its growth decelerated to 24% in Q1, down markedly from Q4's 28%.

Azure Revenue change % (Company filings)

Notably, Azure's Q3 growth of 35% YoY, down from Q2's 40% YoY, markedly impacted the company's momentum. As a result, it has placed Nadella's Cloud-focused strategy under more pressure, given MSFT's premium against the broad market.

Microsoft Revenue change % and Adjusted EBITDA change % consensus estimates (S&P Cap IQ)

As a result, Microsoft's FQ2 guidance (quarter ending December 31) implies total revenue growth of 2.2% on revenue of $52.9B (midpoint). In addition, the revised consensus estimates indicate topline growth of 2.9% YoY, down from previous estimates of 9.2%.

In other words, Microsoft and Street analysts were too optimistic about the headwinds that the company needs to navigate. Notwithstanding, analysts remain convinced that Microsoft's growth could bottom out in FQ2 before recovering through 2023.

We think there are a few possibilities that corroborate the Street's optimism. Energy costs, highlighted as a critical factor that impacted its Cloud margins, have continued to fall through October.

DXY price chart (weekly) (TradingView)

Furthermore, the dollar index has also pulled back from its September highs. Hence, it could mitigate the forex headwinds that impacted its growth cadence in the previous quarters.

However, assessing whether the pullback could be sustained is still too early. Still, it's constructive to help mitigate the macro challenges that faced MSFT in FQ2.

Is MSFT Stock A Buy, Sell, Or Hold?

MSFT NTM EBITDA multiples valuation trend (koyfin)

With an NTM EBITDA multiple of 15.3x, it has fallen closer to its 10Y mean of 13.9x. We believe MSFT is no longer overvalued.

MSFT price chart (weekly) (TradingView)

But that doesn't mean MSFT cannot face more value compression. Its valuation is more reasonable but still not undervalued. Hence, it's possible for the market to de-rate its growth premium further if it anticipates a worse-than-expected recession that could hurt its cloud computing momentum further.

Notwithstanding, we gleaned that MSFT re-tested its 200-week moving average (weekly), a critical defense zone that long-term buyers are expected to hold vigorously.

Hence, we believe investors who can stomach near-term volatility should find it reasonable in anticipation of buying support at the current levels by adding exposure.

Despite that, a further pullback toward its intermediate support is possible, improving its reward/risk further, and justifying more aggressive buying.

Maintain Buy, but we urge investors to exercise prudent capital allocation strategies to capitalize on potential downside volatility.",cloud computing,seeking alpha
228,Why Amazon Stock Dropped This Week,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/708065/investors-gettyimages-1170740969.jpg,06/11/2022,Inflation is taking a toll on the e-commerce titan's growth.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/06/why-amazon-stock-dropped-this-week/,"What happened

Shares of Amazon.com (AMZN -0.49%) plunged 12% this past week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, furthering the decline in the online retail giant's stock price since its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 27.

So what

Amazon's net sales grew by 15% year over year to $127.1 billion. Excluding foreign exchange movements, the e-commerce leader's revenue was up 19%.

However, sales growth at Amazon Web Services slowed to 27% from 33% in the second quarter and 39% in the year-ago period. AWS, as the division is often called, is Amazon's most important profit driver, so investors were understandably concerned about the deceleration in the segment's pace of expansion.

Moreover, rising fulfillment and labor costs weighed on Amazon's retail margins, while higher energy costs took a toll on the company's cloud computing operations. Amazon's operating income, in turn, plummeted 49% to $2.5 billion.

Amazon's guidance was even more worrisome. Management sees sales growth decelerating to only 2%-8% in the fourth quarter. The company's revenue forecast of $140 billion to $148 billion was below Wall Street's expectations of roughly $155 billion.

During a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that inflation and other economic concerns were driving consumers and businesses to rein in their spending.

Now what

Despite these near-term challenges, Amazon's long-term future remains bright. Its fuel, shipping, and electricity costs should moderate as inflation abates over time. And Amazon is working to make its massive fulfillment network more efficient after it doubled in size during the pandemic.

Most importantly, the shift to the cloud remains in its early innings. CEO Andy Jassy said in April that only about 5% of global information technology (IT) spending was in the cloud. Yet research firm Gartner projects that more than half of corporate IT spending in major markets -- including application software, infrastructure software, business process services, and system infrastructure -- could migrate to the cloud by 2025.

With these tech trends fueling its expansion, AWS is likely to remain a powerful -- and highly profitable -- source of growth for many years to come. So rather than sell, long-term investors might want to use the recent downturn in Amazon's stock price to buy some shares at a sizable discount.",cloud computing,motley fool

The release has new features such as Network Policy Status, Contextual Logging, and signing release artifacts, generally available for stable features such as PodOverhead, CSI volume expansion, and CSR duration, beta features such as OpenAPI v3, gRPC probes, volume populator, and deprecated features such as DynamicKubeletConfig. In version 1.24, dockershim is removed.

In the new release, kubectl, the command-line tool to run commands against clusters, includes a new subresource flag to fetch and update subresources. The new subcommand makes it easier to update subresources instead of using curl commands.

Contextual logging is introduced to make log output more useful so that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger.

To increase supply chain security, container images pertaining release artifacts can now be signed and verified using cosign, one of signstore’s tools to sign, verify, and protect software.

In version 1.24, a status subresource has been added to network policies to make it easier to troubleshoot network-related issues since network policies are implemented differently by the different CNIs.

OpenAPI v3 support moved to beta in version 1.24 and it’s turned on by default. Such a feature allows the kube-apiserver, the server that validates and configures data for the API objects which include pods, services,...etc, to serve objects in OpenAPI v3 format.

In addition, mixed protocols in services with the type LoadBalancer are turned on by default in beta. This allows a service of type LoadBalancer to serve different protocols (i.e: TCP and UDP) on the same port.

Graceful node shutdown was first introduced in version 1.21 and now it’s in beta. Such a feature allows distinction between the termination of regular pods and critical pods running on the node and provides pods with extra time to stop.

CSI volume expansion became generally available in this release and enabled by default. This feature can dynamically resize persistent volumes whenever the underlying CSI driver supports volume expansion.

Also, PodOverhead became stable in this release and enabled by default. This allows Kubernetes when scheduling a pod to account for the pod infrastructure on top of the container requests and limits. A Runtime class that defines the overhead field is required to utilize such a feature.

Storage capacity tracking moved to stable in version 1.24 allowing the Kubernetes scheduler to make sure there’s enough capacity on a node’s associated storage before placing a pod. That way, it minimizes multiple scheduling attempts by filtering out nodes that do not have enough storage.

Kubernetes is an open-source production-grade orchestration system for deploying, scaling, and managing application containers.

According to the release notes, Kubernetes version 1.24 has 46 enhancements including 13 new, 13 becoming generally available or stable, and 15 moving to beta. In addition, six features have been deprecated.

If you missed any of the previous articles, head on back to the introductio for a quick update.

After laying out the groundwork for this series in the initial article, I spent some time in the second article sharing who the observability players are. I also discussed the teams that these players are on in this world of cloud native o11y. For the third article I looked at the ongoing discussion around monitoring pillars versus phases.

Being a developer from my early days in IT, it’s been very interesting to explore the complexities of cloud native o11y. Monitoring applications goes way beyond just writing and deploying code, especially in the cloud native world. One thing remains the same, maintaining your organization’s architecture always requires both a vigilant outlook and an understanding of available open standards.

In this forth article I’m going to look at architecture level choices being made and share the open standards with the open source landscape.

As any architect will tell you, open standards are always preferred when considering adding on to your existing infrastructure. Does the candidate component under consideration adhere to some defined open standard? Does it at least conform to using open standards?

The open choice

When an open standard exists, and in some early cases open consensus where everyone centers around a technology or protocol, it gives an architect peace of mind. You often have choices as to the final component you want to use, as long as it’s based on a standard you feel as if you can swap it out in the future.

An example of one such standard is the Open Container Initiative (OCI) for container tooling in a cloud native environment. When ensuring your organization’s architecture uses such a standard, all components and systems interacting with your containers become replaceable by any future choices you might make as long as they follow the same standard. This creates choice and choice is a good thing!

Open o11y projects

In cloud native observability (o11y), there are many open source projects to help you tackle the initial tasks of o11y. Many are closely associated with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as projects and promote open standards where possible. Some of them have even become an unofficial open standard by their default mass usage in the o11y domain.

Let’s explore a few of the most commonly encountered cloud native o11y projects.

Prometheus

Prometheus is a graduated project under the CNCF umbrella, which is defined as “…considered stable and used in production.” It’s listed as a monitoring system and time series database, but the project site itself advertises that it is used to power your metrics and alerting with the leading open source monitoring solution.

What does Prometheus do for you?

It provides a flexible data model that allows for you to identify time series data, which is a sequence of data points indexed in time order, by assigning a metric name. Time series are stored in memory and on local disk in an efficient format. Scaling is done by functional sharing, splitting data across the storage, and federation.

Leveraging the metrics data is done with a very powerful query language called PromQL which we will cover in the next section. Alerts for your systems are set up using this query language and a provided alert manager for notification.

There are multiple modes provided for visualizing the data collected, from a built-in expression browser, integration with grafana dashboards, to a console templating language. There are also many client libraries available to help you easily instrument existing services in your architecture. If you want to import existing third-party data into Prometheus, there are many integrations available for you to leverage.

Each server runs independently making it an easy starting point and reliable out of the box with only local storage to get started. It’s written in the Go language and all binaries are statically linked for easy deployment and performance.

There is a Prometheus organization with all the code bases for their projects.

PromQL

This is officially a part of the Prometheus project, but well worth mentioning on its own as an unofficial standard used widely to query ingested time series data. As stated in the Prometheus documentation:

“Prometheus provides a functional query language called PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) that lets the user select and aggregate time series data in real time. The result of an expression can either be shown as a graph, viewed as tabular data in Prometheus’s expression browser, or consumed by external systems via the HTTP API.”

There are various ways to learn about how to write queries in PromQL, but a fun little project called PromLens with an online demo that helps you accelerate your use, understanding, and troubleshooting of PromQL. You can also easily spin up a Docker image with the tool setup for exploration on your own local machine. Visually building queries of your time series data is a big boost to your productivity.

There is a good background story on the origins of PromQL in an interview with the creator Julius Volz.

OpenTelemetry

Another up and coming project is found in the incubating section of the CNCF site, it’s called OpenTelemetry (OTEL). This is a very fast growing project with a focus on “high-quality, ubiquitous, and portable telemetry to enable effective observability.”

You can find the community and their code in the Open-Telemetry organization.

Jaeger

Before OTEL was on the scene, the CNCF project Jaeger provided a distributed tracing platform that has targeted the cloud native microservice industry.

“Jaeger is open source, end-to-end distributed tracing. Monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems.”

While this project is fully matured, it’s targeted an older protocol and has just recently retired their classic client libraries while advising users to migrate to their native support for the OTEL Protocol standard.

Start your monitoring engines

This concludes the short overview of the open source projects and (un)official standards that you will encounter when getting started with cloud native o11y. This brings me to the first step in getting hands on where we want to start exploring the open source projects, with the understanding that we are starting without issues of having to scale yet.

Next up, I plan to get hands on with Prometheus, getting some practical experience for my cloud native o11y journey.",cloud computing,javacodegeeks.com
231,eBPF – Adding functionality to OS at runtime to achieve performance and security,https://www.ebpf.io/images/ogimage.jpg,06/11/2022,A detailed step by step introduction to the eBPF technology with lots of references for further reading.,https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/,"eBPF Documentation

What is eBPF?

eBPF (which is no longer an acronym for anything) is a revolutionary technology with origins in the Linux kernel that can run sandboxed programs in a privileged context such as the operating system kernel. It is used to safely and efficiently extend the capabilities of the kernel without requiring to change kernel source code or load kernel modules.

Historically, the operating system has always been an ideal place to implement observability, security, and networking functionality due to the kernel’s privileged ability to oversee and control the entire system. At the same time, an operating system kernel is hard to evolve due to its central role and high requirement towards stability and security. The rate of innovation at the operating system level has thus traditionally been lower compared to functionality implemented outside of the operating system.

eBPF changes this formula fundamentally. By allowing to run sandboxed programs within the operating system, application developers can run eBPF programs to add additional capabilities to the operating system at runtime. The operating system then guarantees safety and execution efficiency as if natively compiled with the aid of a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and verification engine. This has led to a wave of eBPF-based projects covering a wide array of use cases, including next-generation networking, observability, and security functionality.

Today, eBPF is used extensively to drive a wide variety of use cases: Providing high-performance networking and load-balancing in modern data centers and cloud native environments, extracting fine-grained security observability data at low overhead, helping application developers trace applications, providing insights for performance troubleshooting, preventive application and container runtime security enforcement, and much more. The possibilities are endless, and the innovation that eBPF is unlocked has only just begun.

What is eBPF.io?

eBPF.io is a place for everybody to learn and collaborate on the topic of eBPF. eBPF is an open community and everybody can participate and share. Whether you want to read a first introduction to eBPF, find further reading material or make your first steps to becoming contributors to major eBPF projects, eBPF.io will help you along the way.

What is the bee named?

The bee is the official logo for eBPF and was originally created by Vadim Shchekoldin. At the first eBPF Summit there was a vote taken and the bee was named eBee. (For details on acceptable uses of the logo, please see the Linux Foundation Brand Guidelines.)

Introduction to eBPF

The following chapters are a quick introduction into eBPF. If you would like to learn more about eBPF, see the eBPF & XDP Reference Guide. Whether you are a developer looking to build an eBPF program, or interested in leveraging a solution that uses eBPF, it is useful to understand the basic concepts and architecture.

Hook Overview

eBPF programs are event-driven and are run when the kernel or an application passes a certain hook point. Pre-defined hooks include system calls, function entry/exit, kernel tracepoints, network events, and several others.

If a predefined hook does not exist for a particular need, it is possible to create a kernel probe (kprobe) or user probe (uprobe) to attach eBPF programs almost anywhere in kernel or user applications.

How are eBPF programs written?

In a lot of scenarios, eBPF is not used directly but indirectly via projects like Cilium, bcc, or bpftrace which provide an abstraction on top of eBPF and do not require to write programs directly but instead offer the ability to specify intent-based definitions which are then implemented with eBPF.

If no higher-level abstraction exists, programs need to be written directly. The Linux kernel expects eBPF programs to be loaded in the form of bytecode. While it is of course possible to write bytecode directly, the more common development practice is to leverage a compiler suite like LLVM to compile pseudo-C code into eBPF bytecode.

Loader & Verification Architecture

When the desired hook has been identified, the eBPF program can be loaded into the Linux kernel using the bpf system call. This is typically done using one of the available eBPF libraries. The next section provides an introduction into the available development toolchains.

As the program is loaded into the Linux kernel, it passes through two steps before being attached to the requested hook:

Verification

The verification step ensures that the eBPF program is safe to run. It validates that the program meets several conditions, for example:

The process loading the eBPF program holds the required capabilities (privileges). Unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, only privileged processes can load eBPF programs.

The program does not crash or otherwise harm the system.

The program always runs to completion (i.e. the program does not sit in a loop forever, holding up further processing).

JIT Compilation

The Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation step translates the generic bytecode of the program into the machine specific instruction set to optimize execution speed of the program. This makes eBPF programs run as efficiently as natively compiled kernel code or as code loaded as a kernel module.

Maps

A vital aspect of eBPF programs is the ability to share collected information and to store state. For this purpose, eBPF programs can leverage the concept of eBPF maps to store and retrieve data in a wide set of data structures. eBPF maps can be accessed from eBPF programs as well as from applications in user space via a system call.

The following is an incomplete list of supported map types to give an understanding of the diversity in data structures. For various map types, both a shared and a per-CPU variation is available.

Hash tables, Arrays

LRU (Least Recently Used)

Ring Buffer

Stack Trace

LPM (Longest Prefix match)

...

Helper Calls

eBPF programs cannot call into arbitrary kernel functions. Allowing this would bind eBPF programs to particular kernel versions and would complicate compatibility of programs. Instead, eBPF programs can make function calls into helper functions, a well-known and stable API offered by the kernel.

The set of available helper calls is constantly evolving. Examples of available helper calls:

Generate random numbers

Get current time & date

eBPF map access

Get process/cgroup context

Manipulate network packets and forwarding logic

Tail & Function Calls

eBPF programs are composable with the concept of tail and function calls. Function calls allow defining and calling functions within an eBPF program. Tail calls can call and execute another eBPF program and replace the execution context, similar to how the execve() system call operates for regular processes.

eBPF Safety

With great power there must also come great responsibility.

eBPF is an incredibly powerful technology and now runs at the heart of many critical software infrastructure components. During the development of eBPF, the safety of eBPF was the most crucial aspect when eBPF was considered for inclusion into the Linux kernel. eBPF safety is ensured through several layers:

Required Privileges

Unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, all processes that intend to load eBPF programs into the Linux kernel must be running in privileged mode (root) or require the capability CAP_BPF. This means that untrusted programs cannot load eBPF programs.

If unprivileged eBPF is enabled, unprivileged processes can load certain eBPF programs subject to a reduced functionality set and with limited access to the kernel.

Verifier

If a process is allowed to load an eBPF program, all programs still pass through the eBPF verifier. The eBPF verifier ensures the safety of the program itself. This means, for example:

Programs are validated to ensure they always run to completion, e.g. an eBPF program may never block or sit in a loop forever. eBPF programs may contain so called bounded loops but the program is only accepted if the verifier can ensure that the loop contains an exit condition which is guaranteed to become true.

Programs may not use any uninitialized variables or access memory out of bounds.

Programs must fit within the size requirements of the system. It is not possible to load arbitrarily large eBPF programs.

Program must have a finite complexity. The verifier will evaluate all possible execution paths and must be capable of completing the analysis within the limits of the configured upper complexity limit.

Hardening

Upon successful completion of the verification, the eBPF program runs through a hardening process according to whether the program is loaded from a privileged or unprivileged process. This step includes:

Program execution protection: The kernel memory holding an eBPF program is protected and made read-only. If for any reason, whether it is a kernel bug or malicious manipulation, the eBPF program is attempted to be modified, the kernel will crash instead of allowing it to continue executing the corrupted/manipulated program.

The kernel memory holding an eBPF program is protected and made read-only. If for any reason, whether it is a kernel bug or malicious manipulation, the eBPF program is attempted to be modified, the kernel will crash instead of allowing it to continue executing the corrupted/manipulated program. Mitigation against Spectre: Under speculation CPUs may mispredict branches and leave observable side effects that could be extracted through a side channel. To name a few examples: eBPF programs mask memory access in order to redirect access under transient instructions to controlled areas, the verifier also follows program paths accessible only under speculative execution and the JIT compiler emits Retpolines in case tail calls cannot be converted to direct calls.

To name a few examples: eBPF programs mask memory access in order to redirect access under transient instructions to controlled areas, the verifier also follows program paths accessible only under speculative execution and the JIT compiler emits Retpolines in case tail calls cannot be converted to direct calls. Constant blinding: All constants in the code are blinded to prevent JIT spraying attacks. This prevents attackers from injecting executable code as constants which in the presence of another kernel bug, could allow an attacker to jump into the memory section of the eBPF program to execute code.

Abstracted Runtime Context

eBPF programs cannot access arbitrary kernel memory directly. Access to data and data structures that lie outside of the context of the program must be accessed via eBPF helpers. This guarantees consistent data access and makes any such access subject to the privileges of the eBPF program, e.g. an eBPF program running is allowed to modify the data of certain data structures if the modification can be guaranteed to be safe. An eBPF program cannot randomly modify data structures in the kernel.

Why eBPF?

The Power of Programmability

Let’s start with an analogy. Do you remember GeoCities? 20 years ago, web pages used to be almost exclusively written in static markup language (HTML). A web page was basically a document with an application (browser) able to display it. Looking at web pages today, web pages have become full-blown applications and web-based technology has replaced a vast majority of applications written in languages requiring compilation. What enabled this evolution?

The short-answer is programmability with the introduction of JavaScript. It unlocked a massive revolution resulting in browsers to evolve into almost independent operating systems.

Why did the evolution happen? Programmers were no longer as bound to users running particular browser versions. Instead of convincing standards bodies that a new HTML tag was needed, the availability of the necessary building blocks decoupled the pace of innovation of the underlying browser from the application running on top. This is of course a bit oversimplified as HTML did evolve over time and contributed to the success but the evolution of HTML itself would not have been sufficient.

Before taking this example and applying it to eBPF, let's look at a couple of key aspects that were vital in the introduction of JavaScript:

Safety: Untrusted code runs in the browser of the user. This was solved by sandboxing JavaScript programs and abstracting access to browser data.

Untrusted code runs in the browser of the user. This was solved by sandboxing JavaScript programs and abstracting access to browser data. Continuous Delivery: Evolution of program logic must be possible without requiring to constantly ship new browser versions. This was solved by providing the right low-level building blocks sufficient to build arbitrary logic.

Evolution of program logic must be possible without requiring to constantly ship new browser versions. This was solved by providing the right low-level building blocks sufficient to build arbitrary logic. Performance: Programmability must be provided with minimal overhead. This was solved with the introduction of a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler.

For all of the above, exact counter parts can be found in eBPF for the same reason.

eBPF's impact on the Linux Kernel

Now let’s return to eBPF. In order to understand the programmability impact of eBPF on the Linux kernel, it helps to have a high-level understanding of the architecture of the Linux kernel and how it interacts with applications and the hardware.

The main purpose of the Linux kernel is to abstract the hardware or virtual hardware and provide a consistent API (system calls) allowing for applications to run and share the resources. In order to achieve this, a wide set of subsystems and layers are maintained to distribute these responsibilities. Each subsystem typically allows for some level of configuration to account for different needs of users. If a desired behavior cannot be configured, a kernel change is required, historically, leaving two options:

Native Support Kernel Module Change kernel source code and convince the Linux kernel community that the change is required. Wait several years for the new kernel version to become a commodity. Write a kernel module Fix it up regularly, as every kernel release may break it Risk corrupting your Linux kernel due to lack of security boundaries

With eBPF, a new option is available that allows for reprogramming the behavior of the Linux kernel without requiring changes to kernel source code or loading a kernel module. In many ways, this is very similar to how JavaScript and other scripting languages unlocked the evolution of systems which had become difficult or expensive to change.

Development Toolchains

Several development toolchains exist to assist in the development and management of eBPF programs. All of them address different needs of users:

bcc

BCC is a framework that enables users to write python programs with eBPF programs embedded inside them. The framework is primarily targeted for use cases which involve application and system profiling/tracing where an eBPF program is used to collect statistics or generate events and a counterpart in user space collects the data and displays it in a human readable form. Running the python program will generate the eBPF bytecode and load it into the kernel.

bpftrace

bpftrace is a high-level tracing language for Linux eBPF and available in recent Linux kernels (4.x). bpftrace uses LLVM as a backend to compile scripts to eBPF bytecode and makes use of BCC for interacting with the Linux eBPF subsystem as well as existing Linux tracing capabilities: kernel dynamic tracing (kprobes), user-level dynamic tracing (uprobes), and tracepoints. The bpftrace language is inspired by awk, C and predecessor tracers such as DTrace and SystemTap.

eBPF Go Library

The eBPF Go library provides a generic eBPF library that decouples the process of getting to the eBPF bytecode and the loading and management of eBPF programs. eBPF programs are typically created by writing a higher level language and then use the clang/LLVM compiler to compile to eBPF bytecode.

libbpf C/C++ Library

The libbpf library is a C/C++-based generic eBPF library which helps to decouple the loading of eBPF object files generated from the clang/LLVM compiler into the kernel and generally abstracts interaction with the BPF system call by providing easy to use library APIs for applications.

232,2 Top Stocks to Buy in November,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/707525/hundred-dollar-bills-in-a-pile-of-leaves.jpg,06/11/2022,Use market volatility as an opportunity to invest in these industry-leading companies.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/06/2-top-stocks-to-buy-in-november/,"It's been a brutal year for stocks, and the market got off to a stumbling start in November. With the aim of curbing inflation, the Federal Reserve announced another substantial interest rate hike early this month and signaled that more substantial rate increases could be coming down the pipeline. Macroeconomic pressures are tamping down bullish sentiment, but for patient investors, there's a silver lining.

While the array of risk factors currently shaping the market may seem daunting, big sell-offs this year pushed valuations for some fantastic companies down to levels that leave room for huge long-term upside. Here's a look at two top stocks that are worth buying this month.

1. Amazon

Just a few days before Halloween, Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) published its third-quarter earnings report, and the results clearly spooked the market. While performance for the tech titan's e-commerce segment actually came in better than expected, growth slowdown and margin contraction for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and weaker-than-anticipated Q4 guidance caught investors by surprise. The tech titan's stock tumbled following the earnings release, and Amazon's share price is now down roughly 46.5% year to date and 52.5% from the lifetime high it hit in July 2021.

While third-quarter sales grew 15% year over year and fell just shy of the analyst average estimate at $127.1 billion, Amazon is guiding for sales in the current quarter to come in between $130 billion and $140 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 8% at the midpoint of the target. That's far removed from the rip-roaring rates of expansion that investors have seen for most of the last decade.

On the other hand, the company's core e-commerce and cloud computing businesses continue to look well positioned for the long term. All this means the stock is worth buying on recent pricing weakness.

While profitability and earnings growth are taking precedence for many investors, given current economic uncertainties, Amazon is a company that's leading multiple industries, and the company's price-to-sales ratio is near its lowest level in roughly a decade. Between macroeconomic pressures and challenges related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Amazon's online retail and cloud infrastructure businesses are facing headwinds that are hurting results.

The good news is that the company should eventually emerge from these pressures, and the combination of leadership in e-commerce and cloud services, impressive momentum in the digital advertising space, and payoffs from other growth bets will likely help the business get back to long-term earnings growth.

Amazon is a great company. Macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical risk factors are currently shaping market sentiment, but it's also a great stock at current prices.

2. Take-Two Interactive

If you asked people to name the most financially successful entertainment product of all time, you'd probably get responses clustering around installments in the Star Wars or Marvel Cinematic Universe movie franchises. According to some research, the most profitable entertainment release ever is actually Take-Two Interactive's (TTWO -0.12%) Grand Theft Auto V -- a video game that debuted in 2013 and has continued to put up stellar sales numbers ever since.

While movies and television series can be big financial hits, no other entertainment medium comes close to matching video games when it comes to keeping people active, engaged, and spending. With roughly 170 million copies shipped, Grand Theft Auto V generated billions in revenue from unit sales of the game alone, but there's another major component to its success.

The title features an online mode and its own in-game virtual currency that users have spent billions of real-world dollars to purchase -- and continued engagement for this online multiplayer mode helped transform Take-Two's financial performance.

Along with the strengthening of the company's overall franchise game catalog thanks to successful installments in the NBA 2K and Red Dead Redemption series, the success of GTA V has helped push Take-Two into consistent profitability. Now, Take-Two is readying another mainline installment in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the upcoming release could help the publisher enter a new growth phase.

Thanks to growth for key franchises and the recent acquisition of mobile games publisher Zynga, Take-Two's business looks much less cyclical than it did a decade ago. But the GTA series remains an incredibly important performance driver, and the likely release of Grand Theft Auto VI within the next couple of years should spur big sales and earnings growth for the company.

With the company trading at roughly 23 times this year's expected earnings and a major positive performance catalyst on the horizon, Take-Two stock looks like a smart buy at today's prices.",cloud computing,motley fool

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, Apple Inc's biggest iPhone maker, said on Monday it was working to resume full production at a major plant in China's Zhengzhou as soon as possible that has been hit by COVID-19 curbs, and revised down its fourth quarter outlook.

China ordered an industrial park that houses an iPhone factory belonging to Foxconn to enter a seven-day lockdown on Wednesday, in a move set to intensify pressure on the Apple supplier as it scrambles to quell worker discontent at the base.

The Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone in central China said it would impose ""silent management"" measures with immediate effect, including barring all residents from going out and only allowing approved vehicles on roads within that area.

Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, said in a statement that the provincial government in Henan, where Zhengzhou is located, ""has made it clear that it will, as always, fully support Foxconn in Henan"".

""Foxconn is now working with the government in concerted effort to stamp out the pandemic and resume production to its full capacity as quickly as possible.""

In a statement released at the same time, Apple said it expects lower iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Pro Max shipments than previously anticipated as COVID-19 restrictions temporarily disrupt production in Zhengzhou.

Apple's new iPhone 14 went on sale in September.

Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, is Apple's biggest iPhone maker, accounting for 70% of iPhone shipments globally. It makes most of the phones at the Zhengzhou plant where it employs about 200,000 people, though it has other smaller production sites in India and southern China.

Having previously guided for ""cautious optimism"" in the fourth quarter, Foxconn said it will ""revise down"" its outlook given events in Zhengzhou.

However, the firm reported October sales had soared 40.97% year-on-year, a record high for the same period, but down 5.56% compared to the previous month.

Story continues

""Benefiting from the launch of new products in October, stable demand for major products, and strong demand in the server market, revenue in all four major product segments grew,"" it said, referring to computing products, smart consumer electronics products, and cloud and networking products.

Computing products, smart consumer electronics products, and cloud and networking products all showed double-digit growth last month, compared to the same period last year, the company added.

The fourth quarter is traditionally the hot season for Taiwan's tech companies as they race to supply cellphones, tablets and other electronics for the year-end holiday period in Western markets.

Foxconn releases third-quarter earnings on Nov. 10.

235,3 Top Stocks to Buy Now in a Once-in-a-Decade Opportunity,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/707577/smartphone-city-connectivity.jpg,06/11/2022,Think of a destructive bear market simply as teeing up massive future investment returns.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/06/3-top-stocks-buy-now-once-in-a-decade-opportunity/,"There's no doubt about it, the bear market of 2022 has been painful, even confounding. Lots of high-quality businesses that are still growing and highly profitable have been tossed out on the curb like they're last night's trash. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes in an attempt to fight inflation -- perhaps at the short-term expense of the global economy's health -- is where all the eyeballs are focused right now.

Nevertheless, quality businesses are built to withstand this kind of pain, and will emerge even stronger once the storm clouds clear. Three Fool.com contributors think Qualcomm's (QCOM 3.19%), Roku's (ROKU 1.57%), and Amazon's (AMZN -0.49%) stock crashes this year are once-in-a-decade buying opportunities. Here's why.

Get this monopolistic stock at a decade-low valuation today

Billy Duberstein (Qualcomm): It's not often one gets to buy a wide-moat stock like Qualcomm for under 10 times earnings, but investors have that opportunity today. Even in difficult times over the past decade, Qualcomm's price-to-earnings ratio has typically bottomed at 15. So, even a reversion to that would yield 50% upside.

Of course, the next couple of quarters will be tumultuous. In its fiscal fourth-quarter report released Wednesday, Qualcomm beat revenue expectations, but guided for a sequential decline in revenue and earnings per share. Weak smartphone demand and high inventories at sellers are causing an abrupt downturn in Qualcomm's handset chip sales, which is its largest segment.

However, Qualcomm has a very high-margin core business, which should still generate cash flow in good times and bad. As the owner of key wireless patents, Qualcomm collects royalties on every handset sold. That division has sky-high operating margins of 73%, and brought in $4.6 billion in operating income over the last fiscal year. Even Qualcomm's semiconductor chip segment has high margins at 34% in the past fiscal year, bringing in nearly $13 billion.

Even if there is a cyclical correction in handsets in the next year, it's not as if 5G phone growth is over. In time, the market will return to growth once the economy recovers and inventories are cleared.

But what's interesting about Qualcomm is that management, under CEO Cristiano Renno Amon, is cultivating other high-growth segments in automotive connectivity and the Internet of Things (IoT) for both consumer and industrial applications.

The IoT segment was really impressive over the past year, growing 37% and making up 18% of chip sales. Automotive revenue soared 41% to $1.4 billion. While automotive chips only made up about 3.6% of chip revenue in fiscal 2022, Amon noted on the recent conference call that Qualcomm's automotive design win pipeline was $30 billion.

While the handset business is a growth business with a cyclical element, car models are employing more chip and connectivity across digital cockpit and advanced driver assist systems every year. Moreover, industrial and manufacturing companies are becoming more and more automated every year as well. So, these small segments should post growth even through a broader downturn.

With a rock-bottom valuation, a cash-cow legacy business, exciting secular growth drivers in the auto and industrial markets, and a dividend yield now close to 3%, Qualcomm seems to have a great risk-reward profile at this decade-low valuation.

Roku's challenges are temporary

Anders Bylund (Roku): Media-streaming technology expert Roku reported third-quarter results on Wednesday. The modest third-quarter guidance targets given in July turned out to be overly conservative, and the company crushed Wall Street's guidance-based estimates. Adjusted net losses per share were 31% smaller than expected and net revenue came in 10% above the consensus analyst view.

A financial performance like that normally sends share prices upward. However, Roku also set up another slate of soft guidance targets for the fourth quarter, and Roku's stock price plunged right away. Roku shares were priced at $45.49 per share at the end of Wednesday's extended trading session. The stock hasn't seen prices this low since January 2019.

If you think that's a fair price, I'm afraid you haven't been paying attention.

Over the last four years, Roku's active user accounts have swelled from 23.8 million to 65.4 million. Average annual revenue per user nearly tripled from $17.34 to $44.25. Together, the trends of surging user counts and rising revenue per user drove total revenue 339% higher over this period.

And Roku is achieving these results amid a period of economic crisis with massive inflation and tight consumer budgets. These challenges will eventually pass, letting Roku return to the stronger growth trends of years past. Roku CEO Anthony Wood said as much on the earnings call.

""[The market slowdown] is definitely temporary,"" Wood said. ""The economy doesn't even have to turn around. What needs to happen is there has to be more certainty in people's minds about where the economy is heading, and that will cause people to come back in the market and start spending again.""

That prediction applies both to consumers and advertisers. I can't say for sure when this recovery will start, but all signs point to a V-shaped rebound. Streaming media is the future of entertainment on a global scale. Roku offers a leading and service-agnostic media-viewing platform with a highly polished user experience.

Investors are looking at a long-term winner here, saddled with extremely low expectations and a price-to-sales ratio of just 2. Many ultra-traditional value stocks trade at twice that ratio, though they can't hold a candle to Roku's superior long-term growth. A more reasonable price-to-sales ratio for Roku would be in double-digit territory. And in the very long run, Roku is building a global entertainment empire with decades of profitable growth ahead.

So I would suggest picking up some Roku shares on the cheap right about now. You will probably want to thank me in a year or two, and again a couple of decades down the road.

Buy the cloud, but get a ""decent"" e-commerce business as a bonus

Nicholas Rossolillo (Amazon): Amazon stock has been overrun by a market that has completely lost interest in figuring out how to value it. In these days of hyper-focus on near-term profitability, Amazon's heavy spending to set up its next spate of growth is deeply out of favor. Shares of the tech bellwether are down a whopping 45% so far in 2022.

The third quarter of 2022 illustrates the issues Wall Street seems to be having. The e-commerce segment returned to growth in Q3 (North America and international net sales combined to increase 12.5% year over year to nearly $107 billion). However, e-commerce remained in the red on an operating income basis (North America operating loss was $412 million in Q3; international had an operating loss of $2.47 billion). As powerful as this online retailer is, investors are having a hard time wrapping their minds around this red ink as the company retools its operations for sustained expansion.

Meanwhile, the cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- which has been really paying the bills for years now -- reported decelerating growth. AWS revenue increased ""only"" 27.5% year over year in Q3, hampered by the record run-up in the U.S. dollar (a side effect of the Fed's interest rate policy). Operating income was $5.4 billion, a robust 26% operating profit margin. However, this was down from the 29% operating margin reported in the second quarter.

AWS's profits more than offset the temporary losses in the e-commerce juggernaut. But the market has nevertheless pulled out its microscope and is focusing on the internet retail segment's short-term dip into negative territory, rather than the power of AWS to keep the whole Amazon machine chugging higher.

Like the other tech giants, Amazon is being dragged down by the dollar's strong advance, as well as a general slowdown in the global economy. However, Amazon is busy preparing for the long term. Its heavy pace of investing is keeping a lid on profits at the moment (shares trade for 72 times trailing-12-month operating income), but Amazon has been in this position before -- only to reward shareholders with massive returns later on. If you've been looking for an opportunity to buy (or buy more of) this e-commerce and cloud computing leader's stock after an incredible decade of growth, now looks like the time to do so.",cloud computing,motley fool

In the current environment, with ongoing macroeconomic and foreign currency headwinds, geopolitical unrest, and fears of a global recession, companies across all sectors are being tested.

Even so, opportunities to invest in wonderful companies -- often, at discounted prices -- are still ripe for the taking. We're going to look at two top stocks to consider buying and holding in your portfolio for 10 years or longer.

Let's dive right in.

1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

Biotech stocks tend to be somewhat volatile, higher-risk investments in the world of healthcare stocks. These companies are often in the earlier stages of growth and work on experimental, novel treatments. As always, though, there are exceptions, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -1.81%) is arguably one of the most prominent.

There are a few reasons Vertex Pharmaceuticals is such a resilient play in the broad universe of biotech companies. The company focuses primarily on drugs that treat rare diseases. Its current pipeline includes therapy candidates targeting Type 1 diabetes, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, and APOL1-mediated kidney disease.

Right now, the company's ""bread and butter"" comes from its cystic fibrosis drugs. Its portfolio consists of four drugs, all approved to treat this rare genetic disease. Vertex's blockbuster Trikafta, which was approved in 2019, captures more than 90% of the cystic fibrosis patient population.

Vertex's portfolio of medicines accounts for the lion's share of all revenues generated in the global cystic fibrosis treatment market. Last year, the company reported revenue to the tune of $7.5 billion, a 22% increase from 2020. Vertex is also consistently profitable and has increased its bottom line by nearly 800% over the past five years alone.

Vertex's singular leadership in the cystic fibrosis treatment market -- which is expected to hit a global valuation of $14 billion by the year 2025 -- can continue to reap generous rewards for its balance sheet, and for investors in the process. The stock has delivered a return of more than 60% over the trailing 12 months alone, no small feat in an environment where the S&P 500 has declined about 20% during that same period.

At current share prices, a $1,000 investment in Vertex Pharmaceuticals would give you approximately three shares.

2. Amazon

Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) investors -- myself included in that lot -- have experienced somewhat of a bumpy ride lately. Broad sentiment has turned against growth-oriented tech businesses, not to mention that issues like supply chain constraints and the strength of the U.S. dollar have weighed on the company's margins. Even so, Amazon's core portfolio of businesses remains strong and poised for future growth that patient, forward-thinking investors can tap into for the long term.

When the company reported its third-quarter results on Oct. 27, which promptly sent the stock even further downward, investors were responding to a few standout areas from Amazon's earnings report. These included a more conservative revenue increase, a decline in operating income, and moderate fourth-quarter guidance. However, if you look beyond the headlines and closer at the key points and numbers from Amazon's recent report, the growth story isn't nearly so bleak.

Amazon's top and bottom line results all came well within the company's previous guidance for the Q3 period. In addition, its net sales still represented a 15% increase from the same stretch in 2021, boosted by a respective sales increase of 20% and 27% from its North America and Amazon Web Services (AWS) segments.

While Amazon's operating income and net income represented decelerations on a year-over-year basis, these still came in at respective figures of $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion for the three-month period. Stepping back from the most recent quarter -- and a single quarter alone shouldn't cause you to pull the plug or hit the buy button on any stock -- Amazon has delivered respective increases to its annual revenue and net income of 68% and 188% over the trailing three years alone.

Although the current macro environment is presenting challenges, even for a behemoth like Amazon, the company's leadership in the e-commerce and cloud computing spaces remains unmatched. It also operates in many other lucrative areas, including entertainment, grocery, and healthcare. Over the long term, these are tailwinds that can propel Amazon's financial growth and drive generous investor returns in the process.

At current share prices, a $1,000 investment in Amazon would give you approximately 11 shares.",cloud computing,motley fool

High Performance Transactions System (HPTS) is a invitational conference held once every two years at the Asilomar Conference Center near Monterey California. My first HPTS was back in 1995 thanks to Pat Selinger. I loved it and attended each one up until 2012 when I started a 10 year around-the-world cruise in a small boat.

It was great to be back at HPTS after a 10 year hiatus. Partly it’s a chance to catch up with old friends and valued colleagues and partly it’s a chance to see interesting work from both industry and academia. HPTS is a special group and most of the value of the conference is the people that attend. Attendees cover the spectrum from students, early career engineers, to Turing award winners. I was asked to do the keynote this year and I elected to cover HPTS Comes Full Circle. I’ve linked to the slides below and the talk summary follows.

HPTS Comes Full Circle

Over the years I’ve been attending HPTS, the meaning of “scale” has changed fundamentally. In the early days, “high-scale” were the transaction processing systems used by the largest enterprises, and at HPTS we talked about how these systems were built and how to keep them scaling. Later, data warehouses and large-scale analytics became the HPTS definition of “large”, and their 2x growth per year became our definition of rapid scaling. In 2001 Charlie Bell and Rick Dalzell spoke at HPTS about Obidos, the core of the Amazon.com ecommerce system. Again, our definition of scale had advanced – these mega-ecommerce systems made the large-scale enterprise systems look tiny.

Eight years later our definition of large had further advanced, and very large search and advertising systems had become our latest definition of “big.” Urs Holzle and Luiz Borroso’s “The Datacenter as a computer: An Introduction to the Design of Warehouse Scale Machines” focused on treating the entire datacenter as a computer. At this scale, custom hardware was possible and most of the hyperscalers were using custom server designs, with a few doing all-custom networking hardware. This revised definition of “high-scale” was a fundamental breakthrough in that we were no longer restricted to software innovation and the new canvas for high scale systems included the entire hardware and software stack.

High-scale cloud computing operates at a scale an order of magnitude beyond internet search and advertising systems and opens up yet another dimension for innovation. Building-scale warehouse computing has given way to regional computing complexes of 10s of datacenter each hosting 80 to 100 thousand servers. The world-wide footprint of the largest operators is many 10s of millions of cores and growing rapidly. The best operators develop their own software, their own servers, and their own networking equipment. None are stuck accepting the slow-paced world of standards, and the scale of a single operator has continued to increase to the point where even custom semiconductors are now possible. In the networking world, companies have emerged whose entire business model is producing custom networking ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) for hyperscaler cloud computing operators.

The growth rate of the hyperscaler operators has continued to accelerate and the next layer of innovation has opened up: custom general-purpose compute processors. Processor design is incredibly expensive where a single part will require a several hundred-million-dollar R&D program and competitive processors require generations of investments. HPTS innovation now includes the entire software stack, the servers, the networking system, and also the processors that form the servers.

In some ways, we have come full circle where, in the early days of HPTS, we were looking at the crazy low-volume IBM mainframes, assembled into complex systems whose sole purpose was to allow the few very largest enterprises to scale their online transaction systems. These wonderful systems that supported the world’s largest companies in the early days of HPTS were made irrelevant by high-volume silicon, high-volume commodity servers, and open source systems software. The super-optimized server hardware systems were replaced by high-scale clusters of commodity systems available to all customers.

The scale of cloud computing where 10s of millions of cores are purchased each year by a single provider returns us to the days of hardware innovation. The volume is there to support the development of general-purpose server processors by a single customer for use by a single customer.

The pallet of optimization open to HPTS attendees now starts at semiconductors optimized for the use of a single customer, includes custom servers, custom networking designs, the entire system software stack, custom database systems that aren’t even available on the open market, and all the control software that ties it all together. Just as early IBM mainframes had custom ASICs whose sole purpose was to control the cluster and specialized processors whose sole purpose was to offload I/O from the central processing complex, all these concepts have returned and exist in modern high-scale cloud computing system.

This talk focuses on a high-scale cloud operator with 10s of millions of cores deployed annually and the layers of innovation from semi-conductor, through custom servers, custom control processors, and custom networking hardware. We’ll look at what’s made possible by having control of all components in the hardware and software stack and show how many of the innovations of early mainframe processor complexes have returned.

IoT at Sea

In an unusual turn around, rather than have the students attending HTPS do poster sessions, Program Chair Peter Alvaro asked some of the long term attendee to do poster sessions. Peter’s thinking on why the inverted poster sessions would be fun:

As I am sure you already know, poster sessions are a common feature of academic conferences. In a typical poster session, a large group of graduate students assemble in a room, each stationed in front of a 36″ x 48″ printed poster that is organized into rectangular tiles, each of which contains figures, tables, or bulleted text. A larger group of conference attendees, almost always more senior than the presenters, then enter the room and begin to drift among the posters. Armed with wine and cheese, the audience members silently peruse the content, occasionally asking questions. Most questions are of the form: “so tell me about your poster.” The student then attempts to give their elevator pitch. More often than not, the audience member meanders away before the pitch is over. Another audience member drifts in, the student resets their pitch, and the process begins anew. Needless to say, the students are not able to enjoy the poster session as attendees.

For my poster session I chose to cover IoT at sea. This is the software system I wrote for our around-the-world boat tour that supported capturing 100s of data points every 5 seconds from sensors all around the boat weather station, fuel levels, main and auxiliary engine data, generator telemetry, navigation and communications systems data. The system supported generator auto-start, remote reporting and control, managing satellite, cellular, and WiFi communications links, and operator alerting.",cloud computing,mvdirona.com

According to market research firm Gartner, Information Technology or IT, ""is the common term for the entire spectrum of technologies for information processing, including software, hardware, communications technologies and related services.""

Given the growth in the computer, smartphone, and internet industry over the past three decades, the IT sector is the biggest sector in the market today. In terms of one of the most popular ETFs that track the S&P 500, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), the IT sector is largest sector by ETF weight with the sector accounting for 26.4% of the ETF as of 9/30/22. That compares to 15.1% in the healthcare sector and 11.7% in the consumer discretionary for the ETF, which are the second and third heaviest weight sectors.

Many of the world's largest companies are also IT companies. Microsoft, for example makes software for computers to process information while Apple make smartphone hardware and software.

IT Sector Growth

In the last three decades, the IT sector has benefited from Moore's Law and the emergence of the internet. With Moore's law, semiconductors have become cheaper and smaller over time, allowing more people to afford computers and smartphones. With the emergence of the internet, more websites/apps have reached the scale needed to produce useful services for people with computers and smartphones. With more services, the internet, computers, and smartphones become more useful.

Given the cycle, computer hardware companies have benefited from more demand and computer software companies have benefited from more potential customers. Similarly, smartphone companies have sold a lot more smartphones and internet/app companies have benefited from having more potential users.

Although Moore's law was just a rule of thumb and is no longer possible due to physics, computers and smartphones are now cheap enough that most of the world can afford them. With future economic growth, potential subsidies, and satellite internet, it may be possible for anyone in the world to afford a computing device and connect to the internet if they choose to a decade or two from now.

In addition to more users that could fuel more growth in the IT sector, the sector could also benefit from the emergence of new technologies.

McKinsey writes, ""The emergence of cloud and 5G, for example, exponentially increases compute power and network speeds that can enable greater innovation. Developments in the metaverse of augmented and virtual reality open the doors to virtual R&D via digital twins, for example, and immersive learning. Advances in AI, machine learning, and software 2.0 (machine-written code) bring a range of new services and products, from autonomous vehicles to connected homes, well within reach.""

2022

Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times in 2022 alone. As a result, the federal funds rate is now 3.75% to 4%, which is considered by many economists as 'restrictive' that could slow economic growth.

Given that many analysts think the U.S central bank will raise rates further, the potential for a recession has increased substantially.

Given the uncertainty, tech stocks have declined substantially and it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.

When you think of insurance you probably think of Geico’s Gecko or Progressive Insurance’s Flo. Your investment portfolio likely owns one, or many, insurance companies. A few companies that might sound familiar include Cincinnati Financial, Chubb Insurance, Travelers Insurance and Met Life.

When you think of insurance you probably think of Geico’s Gecko or Progressive Insurance’s Flo. Your investment portfolio likely owns one or many insurance companies. A few companies that may sound familiar include Cincinnati Financial, Chubb Insurance, Travelers Insurance, and Met Life.

There are two broad categories of insurance companies. Property and casualty insurance will reimburse you for losses from a car accident or when your house burns down. These policies also include liability coverage for damages to other people and their property that is caused by you. It is likely you also own life insurance, which insures unexpected mortality risk and usually pays the benefit to your spouse or children when you die.

Each insurance company underwrites risk based on an aggregated loss in a particular type of category and then an expected loss rate. As a regulated industry, similar to banking, insurance companies must maintain certain levels of capital based on the risks they are underwriting.

When a major event such as an earthquake, wildfire or hurricane occurs, and multiple different insurance companies are impacted by losses, the industry's aggregate capital base starts to shrink. A smaller capital base forces a company to reduce how much risk they can take, reducing competition which results in increased insurance prices.

As artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing have become more prevalent in recent years, companies are looking to use these capabilities to improve underwriting and offer price savings to clients.

One example is Kinsale Capital Group, founded in 2009 by prior industry executives. They focus on insuring companies that are smaller in revenue size and operate businesses in higher-risk categories. Generally, insurance companies underwrite these risks in a standardized manner given the small premium amount to lower underwriting costs. Kinsale has created an underwriting process using big data and artificial intelligence to offer lower-cost insurance to these customers.

Another company using big data is Palomar Holdings which is an insurer focused on specialty insurance for residential and commercial customers in areas such as earthquakes, excess property, professional liability, and flood insurance. Through technology, they’ve been able to reduce costs and help customers.

Every individual’s risk and return objectives are unique to themselves and require discussion with their investment professional before making any investment decision.

Experts, researchers...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xinhua-finance-smart-china-expo-020600834.html,"CHONGQING, China, Nov. 5, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On October 31, 2022, Smart China Expo Kaizhou Forum on the Construction of Digital Government took place in Kaizhou District, Chongqing. Experts, researchers and business representatives tackled the topic of how to build an effective digital government, and how such a government would yield new opportunities for the development of public services, rural areas and industries.

Smart China Expo Kaizhou Forum Discusses How to Build Effective Digital Government

1. Public services continue to improve as digital government becomes the norm

In the view of Meng Qingguo, executive director of the National Governance Institute of Tsinghua University, when building a digital government, a thorough reconstruction of the existing department-driven information model where systems, platforms, and data are decentralized becomes necessary. The government is now being tasked with accelerating the establishment of a national, fully integrated big data system for all public affairs, with the multiple goals of further promoting the integration and sharing of data, improving existing and developing new data disclosure, authorization and operation mechanisms, and putting in place a digital government that is both systematic and holistic.

Li Zonglei, director of the E-government Office of Chongqing Municipal People's Government, said that as a key part of the city's efforts to build a digital government, Yukuaiban, the integrated online government service platform of the E-government Office has digitalized and created e-documents for every resident including their ID, health, social security and medical insurance information. The platform is divided into service areas for more than 100 application scenarios covering housing, employment, tourism, entertainment and shopping, in addition to providing local residents with easier access to authentication, medical treatment, transportation, and other services. Next, the E-government Office will continue to enhance the online delivery system for the full range of public services, making it more user-friendly and widening the number of channels through which the services can be accessed.

Pu Binbin, Party Secretary of Kaizhou District, Chongqing, said that based on actual conditions, the district will build a digital government, a digital and smart Kaizhou, and digital villages, with the goal of promoting quality development throughout the region with big data and intelligence, while providing more convenience to the companies and residents who do business and live in Kaizhou.

2. Digital villages facilitate the optimization of the rural digital governance system

According to Lei Xiaoling, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Kaizhou District People's Congress, more than 5,300 4G base stations, 1,500 5G base stations, and six Internet Towns have been built in the district, forming a strong network of agricultural big data and resources. A large number of premium and unique rural e-commerce brands are emerging with the establishment of the online big data platform, creating a flourishing rural network culture and making the rural digital governance system more sophisticated.

Zhang Zhaoxin, a researcher at the Rural Economy Research Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, suggested that digital technology be deployed to enhance the IT infrastructure and network, overhaul the basic information collection system, accelerate the development of service systems, and build a system-wide services chain, empowering the transformation of the whole agricultural industry chain in addition to enabling the public and specialized services systems to better serve rural revitalization.

Wang Dacheng, deputy secretary of the National Remote Sensing Application Engineering Technology Research Center of the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that given where the world is at in terms of the transition into the digital era, the planning and governance of rural areas is in urgent need of digital technologies. E-maps, satellite images, capture of street scenes in real time and other geographic information data, as well as portals where villagers can participate in interactive activities, can deliver to the community what is expected and should be expected from rural governance.

3. The digital economy is the future as digital industries are booming

At the forum, Tan Jianrong, an researcher at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor at Zhejiang University, summarized five key steps that must be taken to achieve a digital economy and digital transformation: innovative design, process improvement, quality enhancement, service extension and market expansion, all of which serve to advance the digital transformation of all businesses in the region and foster quality development of a digital economy.

Zhao Kefeng, academic chairman of the Shenzhen Artificial Intelligence Industry Association, offered the opinion that it is necessary to accelerate the process of extracting value from the available data, promote the digital transformation of the real economy, strengthen the governance capacity of the digital economy, improve basic industrial capabilities, and further the open cooperation that will be the result of the creation of a digital economy.

Guo Linyuan, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and deputy general manager of Digital Chongqing Company, said that Chongqing is moving forward with the construction of Smart City 2.0 and, while doing so, improve urban intelligence with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies, strengthen the underlying infrastructure, resolve any data chokepoints, and exploit the value of data, while fostering the agglomeration and development of industry and commerce.

The forum was hosted by the Organizing Committee of Smart China Expo, and co-organized by the Chongqing Big Data Application and Development Administration and Chongqing Kaizhou District People's Government.

In October, crypto asset prices traded in a tight range, with Ethereum outperforming major stock indices, bonds & most commodities (except heating oil & gasoline).

Crypto asset prices traded in a tight range in October, with Ethereum especially outperforming major stock indices, bonds & most commodities (except heating oil & gasoline), even as value stocks beat growth stocks for the month. The most likely reasons for digital assets’ positive performance were 1) the U.S. dollar DXY index fell in October for only the second month in the last ten months; 2) Elevated short interest and a strong equity market prompted more than $2b in leveraged short ETH & BTC positions to be liquidated on major exchanges during a three day period mid-month, including the largest daily sum since July 2021; 3) Republicans’ odds to control the Senate rose sharply in October, implying a lower chance of the US congress passing harmful regulation after the midterms; and 4) UK lawmakers voted in favor of adding crypto to the scope of activities to be regulated via a proposed Financial Services and Markets Bill, the first legislative attempt by new, purportedly pro-crypto prime minister Rishi Sunak.

For the month, ETH rose 14%, Nasdaq +4%, the MVIS Smart Contract Leaders Index +4%, and Bitcoin +4.5%.

Staying on the prospects of further dollar weakness, Saudi Arabia and China have reportedly discussed pricing some oil sales in RMB, according to the WSJ. Russia’s Secretary of State told a legal forum on October 20th that Russia would “bypass” the EU’s crypto-related sanctions and would “provide businesses with the ability to carry out cross-border settlements” making use of “cryptocurrencies, the digital ruble, or a hybrid.” And even as Egypt devalued its pound and sought IMF protection, new central bank governor Hassan Abdalla touted a new currency indicator (including gold but not the USD) meant to wean people off the U.S. dollar: “America is not my major trading partner,” he lamented. “I don’t know why people are always fixated on the dollar.” Vietnam, Nigeria, Argentina, Lebanon and China all devalued in October; all of them but Lebanon rank in the top 20 for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis’ recently updated global crypto adoption index.

Since 2009 and especially post-2020, governments, not corporate or households, have driven most of the growth in global debt. Thus, we continue to believe that government (and thus FX) failures will mark this cycle, highlighting Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, supply-constrained reserve asset that can be used as both a stranded energy sink and a geopolitical negotiating tool by frontier states with unique domestic politics. We will be speaking on this topic at the “Adopting Bitcoin” conference in El Salvador later this month, with the aim of putting some specific probabilities on countries’ likelihood of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. (For those still making the argument that digital assets are a Ponzi scheme compared to military-backed Fiat, we note that long-term inflation-linked gilts are now down 79% from their peak, exceeding the peak-to-trough decline in the Bitcoin price. Fourteen major currencies have declined more than 20% vs. the dollar this year.)

Meanwhile, amidst the tailwinds of the weaker dollar in October, we noticed some meaningful examples of mainstream adoption of crypto payment rails in the month.

Cash App users can send and receive payments in BTC via the Lightning Network. Previously, the app could only send on-chain BTC payments. (Currently, the feature is available across the U.S., except for New York State.)

Smart Contract Platforms:

The MVIS Smart Contract Leaders index rose 4% this month, with most of the gains happening in the last week. Ethereum led the sector, up 14%, largely due to short covering, as noted with the liquidation data above. As for fundamentals, despite continued lackluster volumes on-chain (demand), ETH supply has grown only +0.16% since the September migration to proof-of-stake, with negative supply growth in October. This compares to Bitcoin supply +1.7% and a 3.6% ETH inflation rate under the old proof-of-work algorithm. Defi (30%), NFTs (23%), MEV applications (2%), and layer 2s (2%) comprise the largest sources of the ~56,000 ($~84M) ETH gas fees burned in October. Interestingly, since the September merge, an increasing proportion of Ethereum outstanding has either been locked in smart contracts (DeFi, +$3b since the merge) or staked to the Beacon chain (+$1.3B). Ethereum available for sale on exchanges, conversely, has fallen by more than 1%, or $2.5B. In aggregate, Ethereum captured more than 75% of total fees paid for all space on all open-source blockchains in October, and has gained market share since the merge.

Ethereum Supply

Among competing layer 1 protocols, October saw the launch of Aptos (APT-USD), the latest high-profile attempt to build a monolithic blockchain promising a better mix of speed & cost than Ethereum. Founded by Avery Ching and Mo Shaik, who worked on Meta’s Diem project. Aptos differentiates itself from competitors by using “parallel execution” and the Move language. Parallel execution allows for multiple, simultaneous transactions to execute at the same time, allowing—theoretically—for faster speed overall. However, there are some tradeoffs to this approach, notably seen in the performance of the similarly parallelized Solana blockchain, which has had several outages this year. One difference is that Aptos smart contracts are natively written in Move, a Rust-based language initially designed for the Diem project. Move prioritizes security and scalability and consistently ranks among developers’ favorite programming languages.

On the general topic of Layer 1 blockchains and whether the ‘fat protocol thesis’ is still intact: despite the poor price performance this year of most crypto assets, developers continue to release meaningful upgrades to the open-source code of layer 1 protocols. This developer activity, which can be tracked using public github repositories, has increased year-to-date for every smart contract leader aside from Solana. Indeed, the ratio of developers working on these smart contract leaders, relative to those working on open-source blockchain protocols overall, has recently reached an all-time high, as seen in the below chart. We see this as an indication of consolidation amidst the crypto winter.

Infrastructure Applications:

The MV Infrastructure Applications Leaders Index rose 10% in October, led by continued relative strength from Quant Network (+26%) and Polygon’s MATIC token (+15%).

Polygon launched its zkEVM (zero knowledge, Ethereum Virtual Machine) testnet on October 10th. ZkEVMs are a key part of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap that improve throughput by transferring computation and state storage off-chain. ZK rollups submit transaction data to Ethereum along with zero-knowledge proofs, which verify the validity of off-chain transaction batches. Early ZK-rollups lacked the ability to execute smart contracts and were constrained to simple token swaps and payments. But, with the introduction of EVM-compatible zero-knowledge virtual machines, ZK-rollups are starting to support Ethereum dApps. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet comes amidst heavy competition but few available token options. ZkSync, another contender in the zkEVM race, launched an updated version of their scaling solution that is EVM compatible, and has been promoted as the first-ever “product-ready” rollup with a zkEVM. However, public access will be limited until the end of the year, and there is no token yet.

Polygon also benefited from its partnership with Reddit, which introduced the second generation of its NFT avatars in October. Reddit whitelisted independent artists from within the Reddit community to create the avatars and paid a share of all primary and secondary sales to creators. The avatars can be used as profile pictures on the platform and give users access to new profile animations. Reddit’s first generation of avatars was released in July and took a few weeks to sell out. Their second collection launched on October 21st and all 40k avatars were sold on the first day. The ability to own an avatar in a password-protected “vault” rather than a crypto wallet and not marketing the avatars as NFTs are two factors that led to the success of the collections. At the TechCrunch disrupt conference, Reddit chief product officer Pali Bhat revealed that users created more than 3 million Polygon-based Reddit Vault wallets to store their NFTs. The combined market cap of Reddit Avatars now exceeds $100M.

DeFi:

The MV Decentralized Finance Leaders index rose 5.6% in October, with makerDao’s MKR (+17%) Uniswap’s UNI (+14%) and Aave (+16%) leading gains.

MakerDAO is the largest defi protocol by TVL ($8.15 billion) and issuer of the DAI stablecoin, which has a $6.2 billion market cap. In October, MakerDAO members voted in favor of an “endgame” proposal by founder Rune Christensen, who wants to make the protocol more decentralized and resistant to censorship, such as the Tornado Cash sanctions. While the voting process itself was criticized for a lack of decentralization, as Christensen influenced 63% of the votes backing his proposal, it appears likely that MakerDao will vote to split into a number of MetaDAO clusters, each with its own governance token. The “endgame” also proposes that MakerDao begin to buy staked Ethereum (stETH) in order to build a balance sheet that can serve as collateral for a non-dollar-backed algorithmic stablecoin in the future. Note that the Endgame is a long-term gambit; in the short-term, MakerDao delegates recently voted to move $500M worth of DAI tokens into short-term US treasuries and corporate bonds, custodied by Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum, which will issue the funds into a portfolio of BlackRock ETFs. MakerDAO also voted in October to custody $1.6B with of the DAO’s USDC coins with Coinbase in return for an annual 1.5% reward, another example of lines blurring between DeFi and real world assets.

In other DeFi news, Aave Companies, one of the contributors developing the Aave protocol, has released a technical paper on Aave’s upcoming GHO stablecoin, along with the results of its first security audit. GHO is a decentralized, over-collateralized stablecoin that was proposed in July. Aave plans to stabilize GHO via algorithm and on-chain governance, depending on the different “facilitators” minting GHO and on the collateral pledged by borrowers, to set an appropriate rate. Facilitators refer to protocols or entities whitelisted by AAVE governance to mint and burn GHO tokens. Since Aave will employ an overcollateralization strategy, it will rely on arbitrage and monetary policy to stabilize GHO. When GHO is below $1, borrowers will be incentivized to purchase GHO at a discounted price and repay/liquidate, profiting on the difference. Conversely, when GHO is above $1, users are incentivized to borrow GHO and sell it on the market, repaying their loan once GHO stabilizes and profiting from the difference. Because GHO is minted via borrowing on the protocol, GHO cannot be used as an asset on the supply (lending) side. Also, the borrow interest rate will not dynamically adjust by the usual supply and demand mechanics. Instead, Aave Governance will set the GHO interest rate, adjusting the borrow interest rate and the discount rate depending on the collateral pledged in order to expand or contract the GHO supply. GHO is designed to accrue interest when supplied to a liquidity protocol.

GHO will have a lot of ground to cover in order to gain market share over its established competitors like Dai. However, Aave’s position as the largest DeFi protocol could help accelerate the growth of GHO’s demand and turbocharge the security and decentralization of AAVE since stkAave holders can mint GHO at a reduced interest rate. GHO’s first facilitator, the Aave Protocol, will initially allow users to mint GHO using deposited assets on its lending market. This may limit the amount of GHO that can be minted due to overcollateralization requirements. But, once GHO has shown to be stable and having sufficient demand, minting could potentially be carried out using delta neutral positions, real-world assets (RWAs), or automated market operations (AMOs), whether by the Aave Protocol itself or by another facilitator. We look forward to talking with Aave founder Stani Kulechov at a VanEck event in London on November 9th.

Lastly, in DeFi, Mango Markets (MNGO), a decentralized finance platform hosted on the Solana blockchain, was exploited for over $100 million by DeFi trader Avraham Eisenberg, who called the attack “a highly profitable trading strategy.” The gambit was enabled by Eisenberg’s manipulating the price of the native MNGO token threefold higher on an illiquid venue and then taking out a $116M loan, leaving Mango’s treasury with a negative balance. Eisenberg later negotiated a settlement with Mango leadership, which enabled depositors to be made whole while Eisenberg kept $47M. The attack raises legal and ethical questions about whether market participants need to consider the intentions of the code-writers and not just the code itself. Blockchain analytics firm Peckshield estimated 44 exploits grabbed $760M in ‘stolen funds’ in October, a record, bringing the YTD total to $3B, double last year’s sum. In a poll on Twitter, podcaster Laura Shin asked, “Is code law?”: 44% of the respondents voted “hell yeah” vs. 56%, “hell no.” In the wake of the Mango Markets attack, Solana’s TVL dropped 23% to $997 million from $1.32 billion.

Metaverse:

October metaverse land sales reversed lower after a positive September. Aggregate land value fell 8% in October, with APE’s Otherside continuing to command the highest average sale price of 3.5 ETH, down from the 4.5 ETH it averaged at the start of the month. Decentraland and NFT Worlds were the only metaverses that saw increases in volume (11.6% and 4.8%, respectively) over the past 30 days. Recent news articles have highlighted the lack of users in Decentraland specifically, something the platform hopes to turn around in November with their Metaverse Music Festival from the 10th-13th. These platforms continue to explore product market fit with regard to curated experiences.

NFT trading volume across major blockchains was mixed this month, with only ImmutableX, Polygon, and Avalanche seeing increases in trading volume of 107%, 44%, and 30%, respectively. NFT trading on ImmutableX was mainly driven by their genesis game, Gods Unchained, which accounted for over 90% of the $21.4 million of volume. ImmutableX also announced mid-month that they would reward NFT traders up to 100k IMX tokens per day to incentivize activity on the network. The increase of NFT volume on Polygon was largely a result of the popularity of Reddit’s Collectible Avatar NFTs discussed above. Avalanche’s NFT trading growth was supported by OpenSea integrating Avalanche NFTs in its marketplace and the launch of an NFT farming game, Chikn Farm. Despite these developments, the NFT volume on Avalanche was still less than 1% of the total NFT volume over the last 30 days. Solana experienced the largest decline, with NFT trading volume falling by 39%.

Centralized Exchanges:

Centralized exchange tokens continue to perform well, up 6% in October, with low volatility thanks to FTX and BNB’s continued market share gains and attractive buy-back-and-burn tokenomics. In September, Coinbase spot trading volumes fell 18% to the lowest levels since January 2021, while competitors OKX, Binance, and FTX saw their spot volumes rise 24%, 8%, and 5%, respectively.

Meanwhile Huobi token (HT) paced sector gains +106% in October after HK-based About Capital announced plans to buy a majority stake in the 8th largest exchange globally. While the transaction of an undisclosed amount crowns About Capital as Huobi’s new controlling shareholder, the exchange stated that core operations and the existing management team would remain unchanged. Justin Sun, the Tron co-founder and reportedly a major investor in About Capital, also announced he would be joining Huobi’s global advisory board, prompting the Sun’s Tron (TRX) token to outperform most layer 1s in the month.

The release has new features such as Network Policy Status, Contextual Logging, and signing release artifacts, generally available for stable features such as PodOverhead, CSI volume expansion, and CSR duration, beta features such as OpenAPI v3, gRPC probes, volume populator, and deprecated features such as DynamicKubeletConfig. In version 1.24, dockershim is removed.

In the new release, kubectl, the command-line tool to run commands against clusters, includes a new subresource flag to fetch and update subresources. The new subcommand makes it easier to update subresources instead of using curl commands.

Contextual logging is introduced to make log output more useful so that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger.

To increase supply chain security, container images pertaining release artifacts can now be signed and verified using cosign, one of signstore’s tools to sign, verify, and protect software.

In version 1.24, a status subresource has been added to network policies to make it easier to troubleshoot network-related issues since network policies are implemented differently by the different CNIs.

OpenAPI v3 support moved to beta in version 1.24 and it’s turned on by default. Such a feature allows the kube-apiserver, the server that validates and configures data for the API objects which include pods, services,...etc, to serve objects in OpenAPI v3 format.

In addition, mixed protocols in services with the type LoadBalancer are turned on by default in beta. This allows a service of type LoadBalancer to serve different protocols (i.e: TCP and UDP) on the same port.

Graceful node shutdown was first introduced in version 1.21 and now it’s in beta. Such a feature allows distinction between the termination of regular pods and critical pods running on the node and provides pods with extra time to stop.

CSI volume expansion became generally available in this release and enabled by default. This feature can dynamically resize persistent volumes whenever the underlying CSI driver supports volume expansion.

Also, PodOverhead became stable in this release and enabled by default. This allows Kubernetes when scheduling a pod to account for the pod infrastructure on top of the container requests and limits. A Runtime class that defines the overhead field is required to utilize such a feature.

Storage capacity tracking moved to stable in version 1.24 allowing the Kubernetes scheduler to make sure there’s enough capacity on a node’s associated storage before placing a pod. That way, it minimizes multiple scheduling attempts by filtering out nodes that do not have enough storage.

Kubernetes is an open-source production-grade orchestration system for deploying, scaling, and managing application containers.

According to the release notes, Kubernetes version 1.24 has 46 enhancements including 13 new, 13 becoming generally available or stable, and 15 moving to beta. In addition, six features have been deprecated.

Enterprise technology so far has been a relative bright spot within the sector. That may continue, but with a growing emphasis on companies and services that are considered crucial to running a business and can be monetized right away.

The business case for adopting cloud computing and automation is fundamentally sound, said Sunil Kanchi, who serves as chief information officer and chief investment officer of UST, a privately held company in Aliso Viejo, Calif., that assists clients with digital transformation. UST operates internationally and has more than 30,000 employees.

“The changes that we will see going forward will be based purely on the economic drivers from the overall economy slowing down,"" Mr. Kanchi said.

He expects customers to continue to invest in areas such as automation and so-called low code-no code software platforms that reduce the need for human programmers, who are in short supply.

The metaverse, NFTs, and some aspects of cryptocurrency, or those technologies which don’t have immediate monetary value, will continue to fall out of favor, Mr. Kanchi said.

“The job cuts are only the start and the tip of the spear. Larger and more thoughtful companies are starting to understand that capital is fleeing investment in the stock market into ‘safer’ assets like bonds or treasuries as interest rates rise,"" said Wesley Chan, an investor and former tech leader at Google who developed early Google projects including Google Analytics, Google Voice and Google Ventures. He is a co-founder of early stage investor FPV Ventures.

“The downturn has kind of started but it hasn’t hit bottom and will get bad, very quickly, likely sometime mid next year,"" Mr. Chan said. He expects a decline in demand for marginal or luxury areas like crypto, grocery and food delivery services, “neobanks,"" and high-end travel and beauty.

Demand for business-critical services that feel like utilities, will fare better. The outlook for drug discovery and life sciences, cybersecurity, and companies that help customers address costly inefficiencies or unlock inventory in the manner of Uber Technologies Inc. or Airbnb Inc. also is promising, according to Mr. Chan. He predicts that “the new Google or Uber of 2023 and 2024 will come out of this downturn.""",cloud computing,livemint

China ordered an industrial park that houses an iPhone factory belonging to Foxconn to enter a seven-day lockdown on Wednesday, in a move set to intensify pressure on the Apple supplier as it scrambles to quell worker discontent at the base.

The Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone in central China said it would impose ""silent management"" measures with immediate effect, including barring all residents from going out and only allowing approved vehicles on roads within that area.

Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, said in a statement that the provincial government in Henan, where Zhengzhou is located, ""has made it clear that it will, as always, fully support Foxconn in Henan"".

""Foxconn is now working with the government in concerted effort to stamp out the pandemic and resume production to its full capacity as quickly as possible.""

In a statement released at the same time, Apple said it expects lower iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Pro Max shipments than previously anticipated as COVID-19 restrictions temporarily disrupt production in Zhengzhou.

Good day, and welcome to Arrow Electronics Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Seidlitz. Mr. Seidlitz, you may begin your conference.

Richard Seidlitz

Thank you. Good day, and welcome to the Arrow Electronics' Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With us on the call today are Sean Kerins, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, including statements about our business outlook, strategies, future financial results, which are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any of the forward-looking statements.

As a reminder, some of the figures we will discuss on today's call are non-GAAP. We have reconciled those to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. You can access our earnings release at investor.arrow.com, along with the CFO commentary, the non-GAAP earnings reconciliation and a replay of this call. Following our prepared remarks today, we will be available to take your questions.

I will now hand the call to our President and CEO, Sean Kerins.

Sean Kerins

Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before I discuss our most recent results, I'd like to share some thoughts about my first full quarter as the CEO of Arrow Electronics. You know, I spent much of this time meeting with suppliers and customers who continue to validate the essential role we play in their success. I've also had the chance to engage our leadership team to review our strategic priorities, explore opportunities for accelerated growth and begin the process of refining our road map for the years to come. I look forward to sharing more about this with you over the coming quarters.

Three months ago, I expressed how excited and confident I am about the future of the company. Today, I am even more motivated to lead this great company on a journey to realize its full potential as well as the noble purpose we fulfill in the process.

I'm also very pleased today to be joined by our new CFO, Raj Agrawal. Raj will be a key contributor towards helping us focus our resources and investments for growth, leveraging the totality of Arrow's capabilities to extend our market leadership and advancing stakeholder engagement through our finance and other support teams throughout the world. I believe his strong financial acumen and business experience make him the ideal executive to lead our finance and accounting team and be an instrumental part of driving the continued growth and success of Arrow.

Now turning to our results. I'm delighted to report that this was our best third quarter ever, with sales growth of 14% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This is a function of strong performance by both our global components business and our global enterprise computing solutions business as well. The dedication and focused execution by our team helped us deliver strong quarterly sales, gross profit, operating income and earnings per share. While market conditions remain challenging, they also provide ample opportunities for us to showcase our commitment to the success of our customers and suppliers.

In our global components business, demand for electronic components and associated design, engineering and supply chain services generally remain healthy. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 15% versus prior year. Bookings have returned to a normalized rate, following the exceptionally high levels we have experienced since late 2020. Yet despite bookings coming off all-time highs, we still carry a significant open backlog. While we are seeing some orders push out, we are not seeing cancellations to any material degree.

Lead times, while relatively stable since prior quarter, remain extended for the majority of products we sell. While supply is improving modestly, it is still insufficient to support the delinquent backlog, which has built over many quarters. Therefore, customer service and support remain our top priorities, and our teams continue to work tirelessly to support the deliveries needed by our customers.

Both the Americas and EMEA regions produced year-over-year growth rates in excess of 20% as both regions experienced robust demand across most end markets and industries, in particular, transportation, industrial and aerospace. The business in both regions remains very healthy, due in part to our ongoing investments in design and engineering capabilities, which have generated growth in demand-creation revenue.

In the Americas, we did see some softness in our shortage market services as bookings normalize and supply begins to improve. This was the primary driver to the sequential sales decline in the Americas as well as the margin compression for the global components business overall.

Sales in our Asia region declined due to weakening demand in several end markets, along with supply chain constraints as fewer parts were allocated to the region. However, overall backlog in the region remains healthy as we benefit from servicing a variety of industries and providing products from a diverse group of suppliers. We are not overly concentrated in any one piece of the market. Again, in this challenging environment, we continue to work with our suppliers to secure parts for the most critical customer needs.

In our enterprise computing solutions business, sales for the third quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance as demand for more complex enterprise IT content was healthy in both regions. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 10% versus prior year, fueled by growth in both regions. While supply constraints remain a challenge, we are starting to see some benefit from our historically high backlog. We continue to see strength in cloud, software and enterprise IT infrastructure and are well positioned for the transition to IT-as-a-Service.

In EMEA, we experienced strong growth in all of our markets and technologies. In the Americas, our growth came primarily from strength in compute, storage and data intelligence. We continue to measure this business on an operating profit growth, and we are pleased to report 9% growth in operating income on a year-over-year basis. We believe the prospects for this business will continue to improve across the balance of 2022 and into 2023.

Now before handing over the call, I do want to reiterate that our backlog remains strong and point out that our design win activities are at record levels. While there are indications that supply-demand imbalances will moderate over the coming quarters, I am confident that our capabilities are unmatched and that we are uniquely positioned to help our customers and suppliers navigate the road ahead.

With that, I will now hand the call over to Raj to provide more details on our results and our go-forward expectations.

Rajesh Agrawal

Thanks, Sean, and thank you for the warm welcome to Arrow. A few moments ago, Sean shared his excitement and confidence about the future of Arrow. I share his enthusiasm, and I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to join the company and help it realize its full potential. I am impressed with the strong talent level in the organization, the deep business expertise and significant opportunities for long-term growth throughout the business. I look forward to engaging more deeply with shareholders, employees and partners over the coming months.

Turning to our results. Third quarter sales grew by 9% versus prior year or 14% on a constant currency basis. Changes in foreign currencies impacted sales growth by approximately $380 million year-over-year, which was slightly more than our expectation of $350 million. Sequentially, the business declined by 2%, primarily due to currency impacts. The average euro-dollar exchange rate for the quarter was $1.01 to EUR 1 compared to our previous expectation of $1.02 to EUR 1.

Third quarter gross margin of 12.8% was up 20 basis points year-over-year driven by higher margins in both global components and global enterprise computing solutions. Gross margin declined 30 basis points sequentially due to the normalization of our shortage market activities discussed earlier.

Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 7.3%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. Interest and other expense totaled $51 million, above our prior expectation of $46 million due to higher rates on floating rate debt and higher borrowings. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%, in line with prior expectation and the target long-term range of 23% to 25%.

Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our third quarter operating cash flow was $141 million. Our cash cycle of approximately 63 days increased 3 days from the second quarter and 12 days year-over-year, primarily due to inventory increases, which are largely related to pricing. We have continued to make inventory investments to support customer demand and backlog and generated strong returns in the process. Our return on invested capital and return on working capital remain near all-time highs.

At the end of the quarter, net debt totaled $3.5 billion, and total liquidity stands at over $2.3 billion, including cash of $334 million. Our liquidity remains in one of the strongest positions we have had in recent periods. Our strong financial position and flexible balance sheet positioned us to maintain our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through the repurchase of $259 million of shares during the quarter. At the end of the third quarter, our remaining repurchase authorization stands at $629 million.

Please keep in mind that the information I've shared during the call today is a high-level summary of our financial results. For more detail regarding the business segment results, please refer to the CFO commentary, which we published on our website this morning. Also note that the CFO commentary includes information on our fiscal calendar closing dates.

Now turning to guidance. Midpoint sales and EPS guidance imply records for the fourth quarter. Our guidance reflects normal seasonality and a continuation of the current market conditions, which we have discussed. Midpoint global component sales reflects an expected growth rate of 4% compared to prior year and 9% on a constant currency basis. Our forecast suggests enterprise computing solutions sales will decline 2% year-over-year but grow 5% on a constant currency basis.

We estimate that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared principally to the euro will result in a reduction to sales growth of $420 million and EPS growth of $0.25. Compared to the prior quarter, we estimate that the impact will be $100 million to sales and $0.07 to EPS.

I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.

Matthew Sheerin

Just my first question, Sean, I'm just hoping you can provide a little bit more color on the bookings and the backlog within the components business. You said it sounds like book-to-bill is around 1. If you could clarify that. And in terms of the pushouts you're seeing, what are the reasons? We're hearing from others that there's an imbalance and customers are waiting for other parts. Is it that or other issues in there? Are there any specific markets where you're seeing more of that versus others?

Sean Kerins

Sure, Matt. Thank you. Happy to do some of that. So you're right. Our book-to-bill rates have normalized. We're at parity. That's for sure. As we said, demand in China is a little more challenging than it is in the West. I think the demand trends in the West are more broad-based and appear to be holding up certainly in the fourth quarter.

I think if you look at our backlogs, our backlogs are still at all-time highs. They came down from its most recent high in Q2, but just a little bit. One thing our teams continue to do a great job of is working with customers and suppliers to validate and revalidate that backlog on a constant basis. So it's still well beyond historical levels. Maybe 25% or more of our backlog is what we would call delinquent. We think that through all the validation work that we do, that a good chunk of the backlog is firm versus forecasted, which gives us some confidence in our outlook, certainly for Q4.

You asked about pushouts. We're seeing some pushouts. That's been mainly in China. But as I said earlier, almost no cancellation activity. To the extent that customers are looking to push out orders, it has more to do with them thinking about their production requirements for the long term. Demand patterns have not dropped precipitously, except for maybe in segments that are closely related to consumer technologies.

Matthew Sheerin

Okay. And then as a follow-up, just on the margins. It looks like based on your guidance, gross margins are going to be roughly flat quarter-on-quarter. So down 50 basis points year-on-year. I imagine part of that is due to the softness you're seeing in that shortage services business. I think that's called Converge. Are there any other reasons for that? Is it mix issues or anything else?

Sean Kerins

So Matt, if you look at the margin compression we saw in Q3, and some of which we'll see in Q4, you're right, it's primarily a function of just the normalization we're starting to see in the market and the softness in the shortage-related services that we provide. It's probably good to go back and just remind everybody what we talked about when we described the drivers for our operating margin expansion over the past several quarters. We said it was one part mix, both region and technology; it was one part pricing; but it was also one part structural.

And what gives me confidence about the future is, while shortage-related services are one part of our structural value add, the reality is we've invested for lots of other capabilities as well. We continue to see the benefits of our engineering investments to capture design win margins. I think as I said in the script, our demand-creation revenue mix improved, both sequentially and year-on-year. And that, I think, still has runway in it for many years to come.

Our supply chain capabilities are now helping us serve our customers in different and value-adding ways. For example, we're now finding ourselves with a viable role in the automotive industry in a more direct capacity than we would have ever imagined in the past. So when I look longer term, yes, we'll see some margin compression as it relates to shortage. But there's a lot of other structural investments that we've made to the model, which I think point us to sustainable returns.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Melissa Fairbanks with Raymond James & Associates.

Melissa Dailey Fairbanks

I was just wondering, you had mentioned that on the inventory increase, a lot of the increase was largely related to pricing. I was just wondering, in general, what are you seeing in terms of pricing across the portfolio, either from the suppliers? How much of that is maybe providing a tailwind to revenue or operating profit?

And then secondarily, as your inventory -- you are investing in inventory at kind of higher prices. Is there a risk that as kind of supply starts to normalize maybe as we go into next year, some of the pricing that you're able to pass along also normalizes?

Sean Kerins

Sure. I think I can easily speak to both of those questions. So if we tackle kind of pricing first, just so you have some broader context, price increases did drive the bulk of our year-over-year revenue growth. We have seen price increases kind of abate in terms of number and frequency, but they've not disappeared altogether. And what we were able to kind of monitor in the third quarter is that we still have been able to pass on price increases and haven't yet seen any real erosion. Unless demand were to drop precipitously, I think prices are going to remain fairly stable, especially in the technology sets still with longer lead times.

If we go back to inventory and kind of look at it overall, we were actually pleased that it only creeped up maybe 4% quarter-on-quarter. I think that was the number. That was progressively less than we saw in Q2 and Q1 and so forth. So I think that you're right. The increase you see in inventory is almost entirely due to price increases. Our units were still down sequentially and year-over-year.

But I'd say, we also feel pretty good about the quality of the inventory on hand. It's relatively current. And I'm not really concerned that we won't sell through it, given the size of the backlog that we still see in front of us and again, given the work we do to continue to validate its veracity.

Melissa Dailey Fairbanks

Great. That's extremely helpful. Maybe just one quick follow-up on lead times. Are there any product sets or categories where lead times are still extended beyond normal ranges? Or is the supply starting to improve kind of across the board?

Sean Kerins

It's a mixed bag, Melissa. There are certain technology sets, things like memory and CPU where we've seen lead times come in somewhat, but there's still a great number of categories that for which lead times remain extended, and so for which we still carry significant backlog. And that sort of gives some support to my point that I don't think prices are necessarily coming down anytime soon. Lead times will continue to come in as supply normalizes, but I think that's going to play out over multiple quarters. And I think the overall demand in the market is still in excess of our ability to supply it. And so I think we're going to watch this play out quarter-to-quarter, but I feel pretty good about where we sit today with our Q4 outlook.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.

Ruplu Bhattacharya

I have 2 for Sean, and if I can sneak one for Raj, that will be great. Sean, I wanted to ask you first on components. It looks like from the prepared remarks, you saw year-over-year revenue decline in Asia, which seems to be a somewhat weaker performance than one of your main competitors. So can you talk a little bit about what impacted your revenues in Asia? And did you see any share shifts in that region? And as we look into the December quarter, should we expect Asia to be a stronger -- to be stronger in the December quarter?

Sean Kerins

So what we saw in Asia in the third quarter, Ruplu, was largely a function of the macro headwinds and COVID-related lockdowns that we experienced in China. They were a little stronger and a little more persistent than we saw in Q2. We did also see a rotation of some level of supply from the East to the West, which bent a portion of our delinquent backlog, and that market went unserved.

But I think the important point to kind of move to maybe at a higher level, Ruplu, is to think about our strategy. We've been very intentional with our strategy in Asia and especially China to focus on the industrial mass market, where we continue to see really healthy returns for our investments, and then to a much lesser degree, the higher volume, lower return segments like mobility and compute.

So as I look at that market, I think at some point, the economic headwinds will diminish, and the economy will again improve. I wish I could tell you exactly when that will be, but I'm confident it will happen. Given our focus on the mass market, given the breadth of our line card, given the substantial size of our customer base, I really like our position in the Asia market for the long term.

Ruplu Bhattacharya

Okay. One more for you. In the ECS segment, in the Americas, you talked about muted growth due to supply chain constraints. So maybe can you talk about which parts were short? And what was the impact on your sales from not having those parts?

Sean Kerins

So if you go back a little bit, Ruplu, our business in North America has always been a little bit more weighted to infrastructure as compared to our business in Europe, which is a little bit more weighted to software and cloud. So our backlog in that business is also at all-time highs. And therefore, if you kind of map that to our regional mix, North America carries a disproportionate amount of it.

Some of the progress we did make in the quarter was a function of backlog relief, but the backlog levels are still high. I don't think that's going to improve in the near term. It tends to follow improvements in the semiconductor supply chain by a good couple of quarters, but we will get benefit from that backlog over time. And that's why the kind of the top line in North America may be not as robust as what we saw in Europe.

As we look forward, I think, again, we're continuing to make progress with software, cloud and other aspects of our sort of IT-as-a-Service strategy. And I think the momentum will continue to look better for us in North America over time.

Ruplu Bhattacharya

Okay. Raj, one question for you. Nice to have you on board.

Rajesh Agrawal

Yes. Thank you.

Ruplu Bhattacharya

Can you -- I was just wondering if you can talk about your thoughts on 2 things. One is on the free cash flow expectation, the working capital. How should we think about cash conversion cycle trending over the next couple of quarters and then free cash flow for the year? And then also, just in general, your capital allocation priorities. I mean, as you choose between buybacks or further delevering or M&A, I mean, just your thoughts on how you prioritize those different choices.

Rajesh Agrawal

Yes. Absolutely. On the -- let me take the second one first, the capital priorities. Our primary -- our priorities really are to invest in the business. As you've seen in our -- over the last couple of years, we've invested a lot in our working capital, and that continues to be our #1 priority to drive organic growth and expansion. And then although we've not been too active on the M&A front the last couple of years, we continue to evaluate M&A opportunities, and that could be a use of cash.

And then lastly, we use our excess cash flow over time. And I say over time because this business does go in cycles to buy back our stock, to the extent that we see it being attractive. And we see our stock at this stage being quite attractive as an investment, and so that's why we've been buying back our stock.

When we think about free cash flow and working capital, we continue to have significant opportunity for more leverage as we need it. So we've continued to invest in the inventory. As you've seen, the inventory balances have gone up over the last year or so. And we have -- as Sean said, we have a strong backlog and strong demand for the inventory balances that we have. And so we feel good that we can clean out that inventory over time and really drive good cash flow in the business. So I don't really see any issues with the business. And we have plenty of capital capacity in the business today to certainly invest more in the inventory and also to buy back more stock, and that's really our strategy as we go forward.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.

Jim Suva

You'd mentioned some order pushouts, you said geographically in China. Any sense on end market or end product like, I don't know, industrial or surveillance or anything like that for end market?

Sean Kerins

Yes. It's been more a function of consumer-related sectors. We did see a little bit of that bleed into, say, light industrial and parts of transportation in the quarter. But again, our teams still have a significant backlog. And even as they reschedule certain parts of it, we still end up with near-term demand that is a challenge to satisfy. But I would say the pushouts have not been broad-based, and they're far less significant in the West. And again, cancellations have been really de minimis.

Jim Suva

And then just a couple of modeling things. Should we kind of anticipate inventory to sustain at these levels or be working down a little bit? I know it seems like pricing is starting to change a little bit and lead times are. But anything on inventory as we look at it? I mean I don't view it as a bad investment, but I'm just wondering about, since it's been building a lot through ASPs, how would you kind of be thinking about inventory looking ahead?

Sean Kerins

I'm glad you said that, Jim, because I kind of like the returns that we posted with the working capital in Q3 as well, and not to make light of it. We obviously watch this very carefully. We take pride in the fact that we know how to walk the fine line between our returns as well as both supplier and customer satisfaction. We don't anticipate significant increases as this cycle plays out. Remember, in the aggregate, we still have less supply than we have demand to go satisfy.

So -- and as Raj points out, and as I said earlier, it's pretty current inventory. And as you've seen through many cycles, I'm sure we've got great confidence in our ability to sell through it, at which point, we start to generate lots of cash. So I think we're managing that about as effectively as we can give how complicated this market has been when it comes to trying to satisfy customers with scarce supply.

Jim Suva

Okay. And then yesterday, the Fed raised interest rates. Can you help us understand what we should kind of be thinking about for interest rates for your company? And I assume it would include the actions from yesterday, but if you can just help us with that.

Rajesh Agrawal

Yes. Jim, this is Raj. Our interest rate expense -- our interest expense has been going up, as you've seen in the third quarter. And then we also guided to even more interest expense in the fourth quarter, and that's largely related to the short-term rates going up over the last -- over this year actually, because the Fed has raised from almost nothing to high 3s now in terms of the Fed funds rate. And our debt balance is about 50 -- has been about 50-50 floating and fixed. And so that's why we're seeing the negative impact to the interest expense.

But it's quite manageable. It's still accretive for us to continue to do all the things that we've been doing, including buying back stocks. So we're going to -- we'll sort of manage through it. And as this business goes through its various cycles, we'll get cash influx at some point in time, which will help us pay down some of the short-term debt.

And now I’d like to turn the call over to Reggie.

Reggie Aggarwal

Thanks, April, and thanks, everyone, for joining today’s call. I’m excited to share our Q3 2022 results. Our revenue for the quarter was $161.3 million, which was $2.3 million above the high end of our guidance, representing 20% revenue growth year-over-year. Additionally, our cost containment measures enabled us to exceed the high end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $5.1 million and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance by 290 basis points.

These results demonstrate our commitment to delivering balanced top line growth and margin expansion, even in an uncertain macro environment. We’re excited about our solid Q3 performance and our prospects for the remainder of 2022. As a result, we are raising both our revenue and EBITDA guidance for the full year.

Now while we’re not immune from macroeconomic pressures, we’re confident that our established market leadership and recession-resilient platform positions us to outperform competitors and successfully navigate this unique macro environment. For those of you who are new to our story, here’s a brief overview.

Cvent is a SaaS platform that is comprised of our event and hospitality cloud solutions. Organizations use our Event Cloud products to plan market and organize engaging events of all sizes across their total event program, which includes all events and organizations post or tens. And our Hospitality Cloud offers a marketplace that enables meeting organizers to find and book event space at hotel and unique venues.

In addition, hotels and venues use our software to promote, manage and automate their meetings and events businesses. Fundamentally, our platform helps customers grow their top line revenue, drive engagement and deliver leads while reducing OpEx and facilitating greater compliance.

Before I dive more deeply into our Q3 2022 performance by cloud, I’d like to discuss some market trends that we’re seeing. First, the return of in-person events, which are the bedrock of the event industry. Nothing beats face-to-face human connection and interaction, which is why we continue to see in-person events returned so quickly.

In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, I attended IMEX America, one of the largest trade shows in the U.S. for the global meetings and incentive travel industry. The event attracted 12,000 in-person attendees just shy of their 2019 attendance. The return to in-person is also reflected in our sourcing data from the Cvent Supplier Network, which is our global marketplace where planners can source and find meeting space at more than 290,000 hotels, destinations and special event venues.

Our data shows that our RFP volume has increased since the beginning of the year and through Q3, sourcing volume in North America averaged about 95% of 2019 levels, which were $18 billion for the full year. Second, marketers are continuing to invest heavily in events, which are often their biggest area of programmatic spend.

However, in an uncertain market environment, they will look to maximize reach and ROI and for that, they need event technology. Our platform digitizes events, enabling CMOs to capture more data and attending insights to accelerate and optimize their sales and marketing efforts, making events more valuable as a marketing tactic than ever before.

Third, the triple threat, which is the powerful combination of all three event formats; in person, virtual and hybrid, is coming to life. For example, in Q3 of 2022, the events hosted in our Cvent attendee hub were about 46% in-person, 30% virtual and 23% hybrid. To put that in context, pre-pandemic, more than 95% of our revenue was for in-person only.

So we’re truly experiencing a meaningful change in the way people meet, and we believe this is a trend that’s here to stay. With our platform approach, we’ve embraced this new dynamic, which is why we believe Cvent is uniquely positioned to support this new event environment. The final topic I’d like to discuss is how Cvent is positioning itself during the time of economic uncertainty and why we believe Cvent is well-positioned to weather an economic downturn.

In a recessionary environment, we believe events has an increasingly critical component of the customer journey will remain prominent, and our platform can help organizations run events more efficiently on budget and increase their ROE, which is the return on event, all with fewer resources.

The total cost of an event can vary up to 90% depending on what format they choose. And our platform’s flexibility ensures organizations will be able to continue to host their events in whatever format they like. Due to how well-positioned we are for varying economic conditions, we believe Cvent will continue to attract a disproportionate share of Event Spend going forward. So even though our business is not recession-proof, we believe we’re recession resilient.

Now, I’ll dive more deeply into the performance of our two clouds. First, I’ll discuss the Event Cloud and how some of these market trends are working in our favor. Let’s start with return to in-person. In-person events, our receiving has been a leader for more than 23 years. The interest in our on-site solutions is a great proof point for the return of in-person events.

Let me give you an example. To prepare for more in-person events in 2023, a top cloud computing company and one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies in history, grew their total contract value in Q3 from $5,000 to nearly $1 million. This organization bought more of our in-person solutions as they look to digitize their in-person events to maximize ROI, something we’re seeing repeatedly across many of our customers.

The second trend I’ll discuss is the triple threat coming to life. Today, the need to deliver a total event program with a mix of all three event formats is a given for most organizations because of the blend of event formats offers more ways to connect and interact with your customers and your prospects.

Cvent offers an all-in-one platform to support the triple threat, which appeals to organizations that are looking to execute these more complex event programs. This new events landscape is also helping further elevate events in our organization’s go-to-market strategy. In our prospect and client conversations, we’re seeing more and more engagement from the marketing division from marketing operations up to the CMO level.

In addition, we landed new logos and deal expansions in the following industries: business services, financial services, manufacturing, technology, non-profits and third parties who leverage us on behalf of their clients’ events. For example, in Q3, we closed a $300,000 TCV deal with a global non-profit that helps build more inclusive workplaces for women.

Their initial event went so well that they’ve doubled their ACV with us since July and now work with Cvent to support their entire total event program. Our ability to meet the needs of specific verticals is helping to drive incremental growth. The third and final driver of our Event Cloud growth is our platform offering, which becomes even more compelling in uncertain economic environments.

Our integrated platform supports all of that formats, which means organizations have the flexibility to run event programs with a mix of formats and event types, which optimizes their budgets. That elasticity is extremely powerful when CMOs want to host events while CFOs want to control spend.

Let me give an example of our platform, which supports an organization’s total event program is helping us land new logos and expand deal sizes. A multi-billion dollar international software company left Cvent for a competitor a couple of years ago, but they reengaged with us and signed a $400,000 TCV deal because our platform was more flexible and better equipped to support all their event types and needs.

This example illustrates that despite a potential recession, organizations continue to spend in areas that will help drive revenue during a downturn and events, whether in-person, virtual or hybrid, are on top of that list.

An event technology like Cvent enables them to deliver those events with greater efficiency to maximize ROI with increasing headcount. Let’s pivot now to the Hospitality Cloud. In Q3, there were three key things that helped drive our growth. First, is once again the return to in-person events, which are the lifeblood of the Hospitality Cloud. This momentum is driving demand for technology as hoteliers and venues look to better attract, book and manage this in-person business.

For example, a convention in visitor bureau expanded their Cvent contract by $235,000 in Q3 to help them prepare for the influx of group visitors to their destinations. On Monday, the client confirmed yet another increase in spend for Q4 as group interest in their city continues to grow. Second, as hotels faced staffing shortages, teams know they need to work smarter and more efficiently.

Cvent technology can fill these gaps and help hoteliers automate and reduce manual processes from sourcing and prioritizing leads to managing room blocks and diagramming meeting space to getting smarter as they seek to win more group business.

For example, one of the largest hotel management companies in the U.S. increase their spend by $360,000 in Q3 to leverage our full suite of business intelligence solutions to drive efficiency across their platform and – excuse me, across their portfolio and increase market share at the property level. And hotels, don’t just want to drive efficiency on the hotel side. They also want streamline collaboration with their target audience, the event planner, which helped drive strong interest in both our diagramming and group room block software. Third, as hotels finalized their 2023 budgets, there’s still a growing expectation at the ownership level for properties to exceed their 2022 performance in 2023.

This is no easy task given the very strong 2022 many hotels had with the surge in leisure and business travel. In order to meet these expectations, hoteliers recognize that they need to focus even more on attracting meetings and events businesses to their properties to drive revenue and fill shoulder seasons or need periods.

In addition, events and group business is often the largest segment of their top line revenue for the larger hotels. It’s also frequently the most profitable segment. But most importantly, because it’s a contractual commitment, unlike, leisure and business transient that can be canceled up to 24 hours before the booking, it provides both long-term visibility and operational stability. All of this is driving increased interest in Cvent technology, especially our marketing and sales solutions.

In summary, our Q3 results were driven by strong competitive position and industry trends that work in our favor. We are well prepared to address our customer’s evolving needs and our platform flexibility means organizations can continue to engage their customers, which is especially critical in an uncertain environment while staying on budget.

So while we’re not immune from the current macroeconomic environment, our platform approach enables Cvent to power the events landscape regardless of an organization’s budget or how they choose to meet. In short, we feel good about our market position and we plan to continue to invest in our platform, make smart business decisions, and build on our decades of experience to further elevate our competitive position and take our disproportionate share of our $30 billion TAM.

Now, I’ll turn it over to our CFO, Billy.

Billy Newman

Thanks, Reggie, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll first walk you through our Q3 2022 financial performance and then discuss our guidance for Q4 2022 and updated guidance for full year 2022. Q3 revenue was $161.3 million, an increase of 20.3% year-over-year. Normalizing for the year-over-year timing difference of our client conference, Cvent CONNECT, which was held in Q2 this year and Q3 last year, revenue growth would’ve been 22.9%.

We beat the high end of our guidance for the quarter by $2.3 million. The beat was primarily driven by higher upsells of our core event management product in the quarter as the impact of the pandemic continues to moderate and planners quickly adapt to the return of in-person meetings.

Breaking down Q3 revenue by cloud, Event Cloud revenue was $112.9 million, an increase of 22.1% year-over-year, and Hospitality Cloud revenue was $48.4 million, an increase of 16.5% year-over-year. After adjusting for the year-over-year timing difference of Cvent CONNECT, Event Cloud revenue grew by 23.7% and Hospitality Cloud revenue grew by 21%. While revenue associated with our virtual solution is still one of our top Event Cloud revenue components and grew during the quarter, the primary driver of Event Cloud revenue growth resulted from the continued return of in-person meetings.

The same was true for the Hospitality Cloud, where the continued return of in-person meetings as increasing hotels demand for our advertising and software solutions. We also saw sequential expansion of our net dollar retention rate in Q3, which increased from 114% in Q2 2022 to 116% due to increased spend by our existing clients in both clouds.

Although, we’re very happy with the 116% net dollar retention rate in the quarter, the larger than anticipated improvement in this metric is influenced by a quick pivot back to in-person meetings and comparing results to a prior year period, when in-person meetings were less prevalent. In the near-term, we believe our net dollar retention rate will return to pre-pandemic levels and longer term, we still believe our net dollar retention rate will be approximately 115% exceeding pre-pandemic levels as a result of the increased need for technology across the total event program.

In discussing the remainder of the income statement, unless otherwise noted, all references to expenses and operating results are on a non-GAAP basis. You can find information on the most directly comparable GAAP metrics and reconciliation to those metrics in our Q3 2022 earnings release available on the Investor Relations page of our website at investors.cvent.com.

Non-GAAP gross profit in Q3 was $117.4 million or 72.7% of revenue compared to 74.7% in the same period of the prior year due to a higher percentage of our total revenue in the quarter coming from onsite solutions and merchant services, which have lower margin profiles. Compared to the prior substantial quarter of Q2 2022, gross margin expanded by 110 basis points after excluding the one-time impact of Cvent CONNECT on our gross margin in Q2. Like adjusted EBITDA margin, gross margin typically increased sequentially throughout the year and declines between Q4 and Q1 of the following year, primarily due to the reset of employer payroll costs and 401(k) match, higher PTO accrual and our annual merit increase.

Moving down the income statement to non-GAAP operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue continue to sequentially decline, declining by 310 basis points between Q2 2022 and Q3 2022 after normalizing for the one-time expense impact of Cvent CONNECT in Q2. The sequential improvement was driven by leverage in all operating expense lines as a pandemic continues to ease and our competitive position strengthens, allowing us to operate more efficiently. Year-over-year growth and total expense – operating expenses moderated as well, growing by only 14% in Q3 compared to the same period of the prior year.

Shifting to earnings, Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $33.7 million or 20.9% of revenue, which represents a $5.1 million [ph] beat over the high end of our guidance and a 290 basis point beat in terms of margin. The earnings beat is a result of our revenue over performance – result of our revenue over performance, tactically shifting some Q3 projects into the future and higher cost containment. Relative to Q2 2022 and normalized for the one-time Cvent CONNECT costs, we saw 420 basis points of sequential margin expansion. This improvement continues the very healthy margin expansion we’ve seen since the beginning of the year.

Turning to our balance sheet, we ended Q3 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $110.6 million, a decrease of $12.8 million from the end of the second quarter of 2022. This decrease was primarily the result of further paying down our new revolving credit facility by $30 million in the quarter. We paid down $70 million in Q2 2022, and we have now paid down $100 million since we closed the facility in late May.

As a reminder, the $500 million credit facility was put in place to expand our borrowing capacity for potential future M&A. We do not intend to use this facility to fund normal operations given our positive adjusted free cash flow position. And we expect the balance of the facility to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, as we use excess cash to minimize interest expense.

Finally, adjusted free cash flow before interest payments on our long-term debt and the change in client cash related to merchant services was $2.1 million in Q3 2022 compared to $17.9 million in Q3 of last year. Adjusted free cash flow in Q3 of last year was atypically high as a result of payment plans that allowed clients to defer payments of their 2020 invoices to 2021 due to COVID. Year-to-date in 2022, we have generated $64.5 million in adjusted free cash flow. Deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was $246.2 million, an increase of 8.8% compared to Q3 of the prior year due to year-over-year bookings growth across the business.

Now let’s turn to our guidance for Q4 2022 starting with revenue. We expect Q4 revenue of $169.3 million to $170.3 million, up 17.4% at the midpoint compared to Q4 of 2021. This guidance is in line with our midpoint of the implied guidance we gave in our Q2 earnings call in August, when we provided Q3 and full year 2022 guidance.

Shifting to full year 2022 revenue guidance. As a result of our Q3 2022 beat, we are increasing our full year guidance range to $628.9 million to $629.9 million, up 21.3% compared to the prior year at the midpoint and reflecting a $2.8 million increase of the midpoint of the guidance we shared in our last earnings call in August.

Moving to adjusted EBITDA, we expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $38.5 million to $39.8 million, representing 23 point – representing a 23.1% adjust EBITDA margin at the midpoint. Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to sequentially expand compared to Q3 2022 by 220 basis points at the midpoint, continuing the operating leverage expansion we’ve seen this year as the business continues to operate more efficiently with the pandemic easing and our competitive market position strengthening. Compared to the implied Q4 2022 guidance provided in our last call in August, our adjusted EBITDA expectation is lower, and that is the result of the Q3 2022 projects we tactically shifted into the future and some of the higher Q3 2022 cost containment not recurring in Q4.

Turning to full year adjusted EBITDA guidance, as a result of the higher than expected cost containment we saw in Q3 2022, we are increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $108.4 million to $109.7 million. This reflects a $1.9 million increase over the midpoint of the guidance we shared in our last earnings call in August and a 20 basis point increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance at the midpoint. $1.9 million raise is less than the $5.1 million Q3 2022 beat due to a portion of the Q3 beat coming from the Q3 projects that were shifted from Q3 to the future and higher cost containment at Q3 that will not return in Q4.

In closing, we’re pleased with our Q3 22.9% revenue growth and 420 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin sequential expansion, both on a normalized basis. We believe these results exhibit are strong competitive position and the industry trends that work in our favor. Every quarter that goes by, we believe we are getting closer to a more normalized state.

As Reggie mentioned, while we’re not immune from the current macroeconomic environment, our platform approach enables Cvent to power the event landscape regardless of an organization’s budget or how they choose to meet. And longer term, we feel we are well positioned to take our disproportionate share of the $30 billion TAM.

Now I’ll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Josh Baer

Great. Thanks for the question and congrats on another beat and race. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the partnership with American Express and some of the benefits that it brings to you.

Reggie Aggarwal

Hey, Josh. Thanks for the question. So American Express, there’s two parts. There’s the business travel and meetings and events side. This is more regarding their corporate credit card. So basically, it’s a payment solution. So let me just give you some context. So what happens with American Express is, they give it what we call a p-card. So for every single event what you have is your meetings, a virtual credit card’s giving. So every expense for that meeting can be consolidated and tracked. So it’s really giving planners a better idea of what they’re spending across everything. So let’s say, you’re flying somewhere and it’s a person taking people out to dinner after the event, all that is could put on the p-card. So it’s a way to control spend.

So it allows our customers to be able to get that better visibility per event. And it’s really helping them stay on budget and accurately calculate their meeting ROI. And it’s really what it does, is it gives another breath – another example of the breadth and depth of our ecosystem with our ability to partner with other market leaders to help drive kind of that ROE, which is return on event. And so it’s – we’re also helpful in compliance because a lot of our pharma and financial customers and just in general, it helps them have more compliance in particular with individual events as well as the total event program. So that’s really what it’s doing.

Josh Baer

Okay, great. And then I know billings isn’t a focus for you and we can look to full year revenue guidance moving higher as a pretty good indicator of the state of the business. But just wondering if there’s any puts and takes on billings invoicing in the quarter. I think we’re looking at like a decline in the growth rate in billings to single-digit, anything to note there?

Billy Newman

Yes. I’ll take that Josh. Using deferred revenue on a quarterly basis is not a great proxy for billings growth. And that’s because – this quarter for example, we saw higher than expected performance, because of upsells in the quarter, which often get closed in the quarter. And then get recognized in the quarter. Additionally, with the quick return back to onsite, we’ve got deals that will close in the quarter and then the event will happen within the quarter as well. So it’s a little difficult to use deferred revenue as a proxy for that. So that being said, I think we’re happy with the billings growth that we saw. It was relatively in line with what we were expecting. And I think what that’s showing is that the recession resiliency that our platform provides is helping us from a macroeconomic perspective currently.

Josh Baer

Okay, Thank you both.

Operator

Your next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.

Tyler Radke

Thank you for taking the question. Can you just help us understand kind of the moving pieces between the Q3 versus Q4 updated guidance? Obviously, the numbers came in Q3 ahead of where you guided. How much of that – but the Q4 implied guidance is a little bit below where you guided last quarter. So how much of it was timing impacts? And then are you kind of making any macro assumptions for Q4 just given what you’re reading in the news? Just help us understand if there was any timing impacts or if anything from just a guidance philosophy has changed. Thank you.

Billy Newman

Yes, I’ll take that one. Look, the – as I said, the over performance that we saw in Q3 was primarily due to the higher upsells that we saw in the quarter. So although, it’s possible this could recur in Q4. We want to make sure we’ve got a number out there that we feel confident in and which we do for our Q4 numbers. And so we haven’t assumed that recurs in Q4.

And so really no change in the expectations that we saw at the beginning of when we spoke to you last August in terms of the applied guidance. That’s why it’s – at the midpoint, it’s relatively in line. You’ll – so it’s really – and outside that, it’s really just the tightening of the guidance. We’re sitting here in November, so we have very good visibility into the quarter. As we sit here today, we have – and this is very typical for any given quarter, 90% of our revenue is contractually locked in. So it gives us really good visibility in addition to just our multi-year deals, the recurring nature of our revenue. And so really the – you just had some tightening of the spread around the midpoint given that we’ve got that great visibility as we sit here.

Tyler Radke

Great. And just a follow-up for Reggie or maybe Billy too, but I’m curious, did you talk to customers and you talk to them about their plans next year? How are they just thinking about their overall event budgets? Is it still up next year? Are they still kind of hoping to increase the size of these events even for the folks that did kind of do their first in person events this year? And maybe just kind of share how you’re thinking about the planning process as you look towards next year, given the puts and takes of the macro environment combined with what still seems like a pretty good return to in person.

Reggie Aggarwal

Yes. So thanks for the question. So look, first, look, as Billy said, we had a great Q3, we’re confident in our Q4 guide. But what we’re hearing from the field is that some customers are being a little cautious with spend, we’re seeing a little bit of elongated sales cycle. I think they still tend to move forward, but it is causing a little bit of lengthening of the sales cycle. They’re getting a little bit more people involved. And they’re still trying to figure out from their budgets, right, what they’re doing in the blend. Is it in person virtual or hybrid? And then they’re trying to – everyone’s trying to figure out what – everyone else is doing kind of thing. But look, so we’re not immune to the macro level environment, but I think we’re prepared.

And part of it is, is that we’re still – people still want to meet in person. You still have this latent kind of push that, people are still wanting to meet the person, because it’s been so long. CMOs are seeing that’s incredibly important. They’re getting more involved with events, because they see getting people in person how that really helps their top line. And I think that we’re still seeing all that momentum. I think with the macro level environments, people are all trying to figure it out and trying to see what happens.

So that is a little bit elongating your sales cycle, but I think the fundamentals are still the same that we’ve had in the prior time. And I think this in person is going to continue to kind of push it a little bit more than it would normally go, because of that pent-up demand. But look, the macro level is elongating our sales cycle a little bit as we’re starting to see.

Tyler Radke

And just to clarify with those elongated sales cycles, would that mean you kind of expect growth maybe a little bit below where historical patterns have been? Or how would you just think about those longer sales cycles translating into revenue?

Reggie Aggarwal

So couple things. Like I said, we feel good about our Q4 guidance. We’re not kind of – we’re not giving guidance to 2023 at this point. We’ll do that in our Q4 call that we’ll do. But look, the macro environment, it is slightly elongating sales cycles. It’s hard to predict what – how it will continue on. So that’s probably the best I can say right now. But I think the fundamentals are still there. And we’re still trying to understand that ourselves. But just today, just literally two hours ago, I was meeting with the VP of Marketing of a Fortune 100 company, their VP, Mark, was in our office and we were spending some time just now just talking about what they’re going through and so forth.

And we were talking about their saying what are other customers saying, but I think in the end, people are firmly committed to events and they’re trying to figure out if there is budget cuts, let’s say, for certain company, they could always do less in person, more virtual, because it tends to be less expensive. And so then that mixes a lot of what people are trying to figure out. The good news with virtual that wasn’t around before the other recessions is they can replace cost tremendously by going virtual. Our event technology is very similar. We get pretty similar economics. We get more if it’s a hybrid, little bit less if it’s in person, even a little bit less than that if it’s virtual. But we’re still a critical part of them switching from in person to virtual if they’re trying to save budgets. So I think people are all starting to work through that.

Tyler Radke

Thank you.

Operator

Your next question comes from [indiscernible] with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Unidentified Analyst

Hi, Reggie and Billy, thanks for taking the question. So couple of questions here. First, could you maybe help us better understand what you’re currently seeing in the environment as in person events and business traveler still returning? How has your competitive landscape changed? And also maybe help us better understand how you’re seeing the overall opportunity today, even versus perhaps six months ago.

Reggie Aggarwal

Yes. It’s a good question. So let’s take first the in person. There’s a bunch of questions there. So in person just give me one second. So I’m just trying to see what the in person. Sorry, you asked like three different questions. So I’m just trying to repeat the in person one. I apologize.

Unidentified Analyst

The question just had to do with what are you seeing in terms of the trends of the return in person relative to even six months ago? And then the two follow ups were around the changes in the competitive landscape, and then structurally in the overall opportunity that you see from a revenue perspective.

Reggie Aggarwal

Okay. So start with the in person. So look, there’s been a big shift in the last six months, as you know, it’s really been pretty incredible how fast in person came back. It was almost like a whiplash, almost similar to when virtual came and out of nowhere. So we’re seeing that trend. It used to be a trend. It’s no longer a trend to us, it’s just now the fundamental what it is. People are comfortable meeting in person. There’s still – we’re not up to the in-person numbers that we were previously, from an RFP volume for example, we’re about 75%. So I think if you look at a typical event, you’ll probably have about 75% of the attendees, let’s say, that you have. So they’re – in terms of the registrants you’re having less registrants coming, but this growing every quarter.

The good news for us, our registration counts are up because the virtual events were something that was an addition to what we had. So we’re actually up in registrations as a company at Cvent, but in in-person events, it’s starting to continue to move back. And in September, we saw it to be the highest number that we’ve seen. So that’s kind of from an in-person view. In terms of a competitive view, so look, we continue to feel better every quarter about where we are competitively. And so I think last earnings call we talked about, there were a lot of layoffs with a lot of our competitors. But I think we showed the ability to break out of the pack. We scaled obviously $600 million plus in revenue and generating actual profits.

I think most of our competitors have been able to generate cash profit, and they’re having a difficult time scaling, and they’re not getting this unlimited investments where they were just investing in a lot of things, where they could keep their prices low and keep investing. Now they have to, for example, start – because they have to be profitable. They have to focus on maybe raising their prices. They have to be more thoughtful about how they spend. And that’s better for companies like us who are very – trying to take a balanced approach.

Look, our platform thesis is playing out, I think by our strong growth that we’ve shown, which is to have everything under one. Most of our competitors tend to be point solutions. And just a couple last things as I think that our India office, for example, utilizing that has given us a real competitive advantage so we can continue to grow and we can continue to invest, because of our cost structure that we’ve built over the last 23 years.

And I think that gives us a big opportunity to take part of – larger part of that $30 billion TAM. So I think that the combination of all this and our thoughtful way of expanding and have been through these recessions has really given us a leg up to our competitors. So and the last question – sorry, I was right, the last question was regarding…

Unidentified Analyst

Just the opportunity from a revenue perspective.

Reggie Aggarwal

Okay. Opportunity from a revenue. So maybe give me more specifics in terms of just in general, what our opportunities are.

Unidentified Analyst

When we think about the mix of virtual shifting over to hybrid and in-person, just how do you think of that opportunity deferring across those types of events?

Reggie Aggarwal

So let’s first start. So our mix, historically, this is before the pandemic was 95% of our revenue was in-person. So effectively there’s hardly any virtual or hybrid. Now what we’re seeing is about roughly 50%, 25%, 25%, 50% in-person, 25% hybrid, 25% virtual. So that’s – so we’re seeing a permanent shift where virtual is certainly going to be a major part of the event landscape, which we think is good because it creates complexity, creates the need for software. But most importantly, in, let’s say recessionary environments allows people to have flexibility to be able to use whatever format they need to leverage the right budgets. So that’s kind of from a high level. But look, buyers are looking for solutions. We think for the total event program, which is again a mix of these, and they want the flexibility to go back and forth and be able to pivot because they’re – before it was the pandemic that was driving people’s need to go to virtual, now it might be the recession.

But look, because of the triple threat, we win more often at the outset. And so we think from a – compared to our competitors and keeping everything under consideration with the macro outlook, we think we will disproportionately be advantaged because of our scale, because of our ability to pivot and the depth of our product because in-person was our strength. But now that it’s combined in one platform or virtual, we can again do that pivot. So we think from an opportunity, we think we’re really well-positioned. And if virtual becomes a more important part of the segment.

Unidentified Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

Your next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Please go ahead.

Michael Rackers

Hi, everyone, congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. This is Michael on for Scott today. Just a couple of quick questions here. You mentioned the strong demand you’re seeing on the advertising side of the Hospitality Cloud, could you talk a little bit about that and maybe compare it to your expectations coming out of the pandemic, and just give us a little color there? Thank you.

Reggie Aggarwal

Yes. So first, in-person is the light blood of hospitality. And so that’s obviously coming back. And so people really want to get their fair share of that. What’s happened is in 2022, a lot of the demand was driven by consumer, leisure and some business transient. So actually, hotels fared pretty well.

What’s really happening for 2023. So we, again, feel pretty good about where we are for Q4, as we mentioned. So we think though that when it comes to 2023, what’s happening is there’s going to be less leisure business. So with less leisure business, events become more important. And so for larger hotels, they tend to be the largest segment of their top line revenue tends to be meeting the group for the larger hotels.

So it’s very important, it’s often the most profitable, but really what I think that people like as they’re locked in when you sign event contracts. Unlike [indiscernible] if we travel somewhere to visit someone, a grandmother in Miami or we go to a business trip we can cancel within 24 hours with an event business, you can’t cancel because it really gives that stability. So I think that we’re seeing demand is growing. We’ve seen that with our RFP volume, as I talked about in the script.

Now with the macroeconomic, how will that kind of play out that we’ll have, I’m sure, a little bit of impact as people start maybe potentially coming back. But I think hotels need a bigger portion of their revenue that come from meetings because leisure is coming back a little bit, business transient coming back.

And there’s a term called group up, and that’s what hotels try to do. Group up means if a recession comes, which is locked that in now to get the signed contracts. So if things go down, they lease to have these contracted business that people can’t cancel at the last minute. So it’s kind of a balance between a recession happening, but then also needing that group business. So we’re feeling pretty good we’re going to Q4. And like I said, I think hotels are really needing to group up for 2023 because they’re kind of expecting a little bit of economic headwinds for 2023.

Billy Newman

And Michael, two other things I would add. First off, look, there are record labor shortages in the hospitality industry right now. So that really forces hotels to move to more digitization to make up for those labor shortages. And then also when planners are booking for events or looking for events through our CSN, there are a lot of times looking for events that are 12 months, 18 months out.

So even though there might be things that are going on in real time next year as it relates to macroeconomic environment, they’ve got to make sure they’re getting that business in 2024 and beyond when things might be much different. So that is another thing that could help to mitigate potential macroeconomic factors just in the short-term.

Reggie Aggarwal

Yes, just if you look at it, so we’re helping in the sales and marketing part, as Billy said, the productivity part, because people have permanently left the industry, especially sales people. And they are getting a little bit overwhelmed. They’re not stacked for some of the demand they’re getting for events.

And so I think these productivity tools, which is 45%-plus of our Hospitality Cloud revenue. So both those elements are super important. And so I think efficiency in getting more business is what they’re all going to want. And I think we have technology tools that really helped us.

Michael Rackers

Great. Thank you. And then on the customer expansion side of things, you mentioned that it drove most of the beat this quarter, but then you’re going to move back down to pre-pandemic levels, which were I think a little under 110 and then push back up to 115. Could you talk a little bit about that dynamic? And just kind of especially more on the movement to 115 longer-term, and then maybe what would you like to see from that aspect? Thank you.

Billy Newman

Yes, Michael. So as you mentioned, we have seen a really good improvement in the net dollar retention rate over the last few quarters. You hit the trough in Q1 of 2021, we were at 84%. And so now we were at 116% in the most recent quarter. And just like last quarter, we’re really happy with the metric, but a lot of it is because we’re just seeing that such a quick swing in the pendulum back in-person plays to our strength.

We’re seeing a lot of spend coming back. You mentioned the upsells in the quarter, that’s another indication of just quick return to spend. And so that’s what’s really driving it in the near-term or currently, we think in the short-term, that spend as much as we’d love to see that rate of spend increase continuing, we do believe it’s going to start to level off just naturally, irrespective of whether we were going into any sort of special macroeconomic situations.

And so over time, you have that we believe in the short-term, it will come back to our historic pre-pandemic levels as people swing back into on-site. But then longer-term, there is going to be that pandemic is going to start to swing back where the on-site will be there, but then there’ll be more and more virtual and hybrid that will come out of that as companies just realize, hey, there is – virtual gives me the ability to do more events than I normally would have done. I can get more attendees at those events.

When they do it, hybrid obviously was – with virtual becoming really popular during COVID, CMOs are going to want to retain that virtual piece. And when they’re getting back on site, right? They’re swinging back to what they knew, but then they’re going to realize, wait a second, I can do virtual and hybrid together or in-person together. And so that over time, with just the general digitization of the industry, and that’s both on the Event Cloud side and the Hospitality Cloud side. That’s what we believe will start to move the net dollar retention rate from those historic levels to the 115% over the longer-term.

Michael Rackers

Great. Thanks so much. Very helpful.

Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Please go ahead.

Arjun Bhatia

Awesome. Thank you, guys for taking the question. Reggie, when you called out long deal cycles, I think you’re obviously not unique in seeing that. We’re seeing that across the space, but what are some of the levers that you think you have available that your customers have available to get deals ultimately across the finish line?

Can they adjust the number of events they’re planning, the size of events, right, reduce registrants. Like are those levers something that customers are considering? Is that something that your sales team is proactively bringing to customers to say, hey, maybe we can start smaller to just get you on the platform and start using the total event program across all event types. How are you thinking about that?

Reggie Aggarwal

Yes. What you just said it’s all of the above, Arjun. So look, the big thing is what actually what we try to do is try to tell them, this is the time to do all your event programs over – the total event program over to us because we’re a triple threat and we can save you money. The ROI there just first from a people, people are looking at cutting budgets, which generally also means people, and they’re looking to get more efficient.

But I think our lever is the triple threat and that standardization because it’s inefficiently done right now. And there’s a lot that they’re not getting. And we talk a lot about saving money but it’s also growing the top line. There’s a lot of things that people do with events that they don’t take advantage of getting the top line revenue growth. Like just very basic things that they don’t do to get more attendees there, for example, or to make sure you follow-up quickly, and we have all kinds of products and tools that help you do both, for example.

So I think, look, when we meet with customers, of course, we try to get in any way we can, and it could be trying to get into some of their programs and say there’ll be less registrants. But I think the biggest cost savings you’re going to see if we do hit some bad economic times as people will switch some of their in-person to virtual.

And generally, you can say the 80% to 90%. I talked a lot about that in the last quarter, the last earnings call, which is if you do an event, and the example I gave is, let’s say, you did the event that might be in-person, $7 million or $8 million. You can take that down to probably $700,000 or $800,000 if you went from pure in-person all the way to virtual.

But what we see a lot of clients will do and we’ll coach with them and strategize with them saying, hey, maybe do it a hybrid event to have less people there but bring your best customers. And so maybe that event will become somewhere between $7 million and $700,000, but you’ll get your best customers there, wow, so you can build that personal relationship, but then the other people will be virtual, so you can save money.

So the thing is we can do it either way. And I think, look, we have some free modules to help them dip their toe in, there’s all kinds of tactics and techniques we have to get them trying. But one thing because we’ve been through so many recessions, one powerful thing if you have an economic downturn is that people tend to be more open-minded about automating things. And I don’t want people to forget that because we’ve lived through so many of these downturns, automating things.

And so that’s when sometimes sure, they don’t have as much money, but they also say, hey, I want to automate it because I want to reduce my costs. And so that sometimes spurs behavior that would normally happen in a normal cycle because everyone is looking at their cost and use the software makes you more efficient.

So there’s that trend also. So between all those things, we’ll try to do, of course, our best to convince them, but we’ve been through it, and we have lots of institutional ways from a sales tactic and marketing tactics, but I think more most importantly, is the platform. That’s really that flexibility to do your events.

And the last thing I’ll say on that is, in the past recessions, you couldn’t go virtual. It’s pretty much are you doing the event or you not or maybe you can reduce it. But now if you convert it to virtual, it just doesn’t seem smart for people to cancel events if they’re compelling because of cost because they can still do some engagement with virtual and then bring it back to next year in-person.

Arjun Bhatia

Okay. Makes sense. Very helpful. And I think you talked about competition earlier and some of your competitors may be laying off employees and downsizing a bit. It seems that, obviously, maybe that’s something that’s concentrated in competitors that are virtual only or that only address one part of this event program.

What makes it – I’m sure those customers may try to switch to have hybrid capabilities to have in-person capabilities in your view, what makes it difficult, what will make it difficult for those companies to then pivot to have some in-person capabilities? What are the barriers that you have and the challenges that you’ve overcome to have – to be able to address all three that may make the moat durable for you?

Reggie Aggarwal

Yes. So look, so the first thing is going in-person with a lot of companies have found if they’re a virtual company to go in-person is much more difficult. Not that virtual wasn’t difficult to do, but building in-person is takes a lot more time. Look, we’ve done it for 23 years. We have well over 1,000 engineers been building it for, let’s just say, not just for 23 years, but the last, in particular, the last decade when we had more scale, we built some remotes, we believe.

And so to do that and then have it all on one platform is really where our barrier is. Is it that scale, that having in-person experience and then we built our virtual, we built it with the knowledge, knowing how in-person works where it’s hard to go from virtual to in-person. So that’s kind of, I would say, the first thing that’s difficult to do is just the platform itself and to be all in one place.

I think the second thing is that the experience you need in selling in-person is tougher for virtual because just the way you interact with our clients, the support they need is just different. It’s really complex. And so I would say that it starts with the product, it’s also our scale, our brand, I mean, we’re known for in-person.

Again, I mentioned 95% of our revenue was in-person to virtual. When the pandemic hit, it took us by surprise that our brand took a hit. But one thing I think by coming back is we have that huge competitive advantage because of that scale and platform. So from our competitor view, I think you had even in-person companies who went virtual.

They also laid off a large amount of our top competitors. And the ones that were virtual that went to in-person, they’ve really struggled, really struggled. And so look, you’re going to have lots of competitors out there, but we’ve time and time again shown that we’ve always figured out a way to differentiate. And because we continue to invest during the pandemic and our in-person because we always knew it’s always been something we’ve been talking about is we know it’s going to come back to in-person because you can’t beat fundamentals, which is people want to connect in-person.

So this is really playing to our advantage, and we’re stronger competitively now than we were a quarter ago and certainly three or four, five quarters before that. So coming out of this – out of the pandemic, we feel stronger. Now if there’s some economic uncertainty, I think very few of the companies have the experience that we do and the business model with, for example, are the way we – our cost structure, India, the way just the things we’ve done to build and be prepared for this moment.

And I’ll just say one last thing on it. I mentioned that when the pandemic hit, it was the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane, earthquake and flood hitting us at once. And it was just something like 100, 200-year storm. This economic times – this uncertain economic times is potentially hitting us or likely to.

What I’ll tell you, I’ll liken it to a bad tropical storm compared to what we just went through. So I think we have the resilience, the know-how, and this is something we know well these kind of times compared to when a pandemic hit, which caught us a little flat-footed because we didn’t have [ph] virtual. But we’re prepared and we have something we didn’t have before, which is a virtual. So we can talk to people and say, hey, don’t cancel your event, just go virtual.

Arjun Bhatia

Perfect. Very helpful and thanks, Reggie and good job on the execution here.

Reggie Aggarwal

Yes. Thanks, Arjun.

250,Who's Ready For A REIT Revival?,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1353960525/image_1353960525.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,06/11/2022,"I know that REITs are down for the year, but I'm convinced that a REIT revival is around the corner. Read more to see why.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4553871-ready-for-reit-revival,"dem10

Back in July, Cohen & Steers published a piece titled, “Rising rents matter more to REITs than rising rates.” It began with this declaration:

“Despite the prospect of near-term volatility, REITs are well-positioned to help mitigate higher interest rates, sticky inflation, and challenging economic conditions.”

Right about now, you might be thinking something along the lines of, “Well that information would have been nice back in July. But it’s November now. So thanks for nothing.”

In which case, tell me how this next bit – prediction though it was at the time – doesn’t apply just as well today:

“With supply-chain disruptions and high commodity prices likely to [stay] elevated for a prolonged period of time, the Fed is expected to continue raising rates at least through 2022. This rising-rate environment is posing significant questions for investors on how to be positioned.”

And how about this part:

“In the current cycle, inflation remains above trend, growth expectations are slowing, and Treasury yields are rising. At the same time, consumer savings remain solid even though off the peak levels of 2021, and unemployment is holding at historically low levels, with more job openings than unemployed people.”

As such, three whole months late though it may be, I’m going to quote Cohen & Steers’ conclusions about real estate investment trusts… which just so happen to agree with my own.

If You Know Something About REITs…

I don’t mean to detract from Cohen & Steers’ excellent research and commentary, but…

I really have been preaching about REIT resilience in times like these for a while – far further back than November 1st's “Inflation Buster: 3 Apartment REITs With Pricing Power,” for the record. Take “Protect Your Nest Egg With These Inflation-Resistant REITs.”

Published on June 3, a whole month before Cohen & Steers’ piece, it featured this summary:

“ REITs tend to outperform during periods of rising and unexpected inflation .

. This contrasts with bonds and other stocks’ modest or negative inflation sensitivity.

We believe that now is the perfect time to own REITs.”

On January 6, I shared “Inflation Busters: I Ain’t Afraid of These REITs.” On December 14, 2021, I published “2022 Outlook: The Inflation Trade and Rising REITs.” And on August 19 and 20, 2021, I featured “3 Monthly-Paying, Inflation-Fighting REITs for Mom” and “3 Top Growth REITs to Fight Inflation,” respectively.

Go back to June 17, 2021 – far, far before the Federal Reserve was ready to admit that inflation was a problem at all – and I shared “2 Inflation-Fighting REIT Buys.” In fact, just searching for titles with “Inflation” in them, I can go all the way back to 2013: “Get Your Dry Powder Out for the REIT Way to Beat Inflation.”

Why?

Because I know my REITs. Which means I understand that they’re natural inflation hedges.

Avoiding REITs Right Now (or Ever) Is Silly, to Say the Least

As I wrote in my most recent – though hardly latest – book, The Intelligent REIT Investor Guide:

“The vast majority of REITs are public real estate companies overseen by financially sophisticated, skilled management teams with the ability to grow their companies’ cash flows (and dividends) at rates higher than inflation. It’s not uncommon to get total annual returns of 8%. All you need is a 4% dividend yield and 4% capital appreciation resulting from 4% annual increases in operating cash flow and property values.”

Now, I understand that inflation was recorded at 8.2% in September. But that will go down eventually. And even if it didn’t, wouldn’t you rather keep as much of what you’ve got as possible regardless?

This brings me back to that Cohen & Steers article, which features paragraphs like:

“… some investors think they should avoid REITs when interest rates are rising. History shows us differently. “Although sharp increases in interest rates may unsettle markets in the near term, history shows that the direction of the economy and job growth tends to have a greater impact on REIT returns than rising rates do. In other words, the environment that may be pushing the Fed to raise rates is one that can benefit REITs in the form of higher rents while REITs’ characteristics can make them an inflation buffer.”

To back its main point up, the authors:

“… analyzed the 12 largest one-month increases in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dating back to 2000. The data showed that while REITs have underperformed equities in the immediate aftermath of significant yield increases, they have historically outperformed 3, 6, and 12 months after such increases…”

Cohen & Steers

I know that REITs are down for the year, but all the information above has me convinced that a REIT revival is around the corner.

REIT Revival #1 - Agree Realty (ADC)

Agree Realty is a blue-chip REIT that operates in the net-lease retail sector. Many of the lease agreements that they enter into are sales-leaseback transactions, meaning they are actually buying the property from their tenant and then leasing it back to them.

This is very common practice, and many great REITs utilize this strategy, including the likes of Realty Income (O) and National Retail Properties (NNN), two REITs we have discussed a lot.

Agree Realty currently has a portfolio of over 1,600 properties that make up 34 million square feet of leasable space. The company focuses a lot of attention on high-quality tenants, which is why nearly 70% of their tenants are investment grade.

Q3-22 ADC Investor Presentation

On the year, shares of ADC are outpacing the REIT sector as a whole (VNQ) as well as some of its closer competitors in Realty Income and National Retail Properties. ADC shares are down only 4% on the year, which is very encouraging considering the S&P 500 as a whole is down over 20%.

As mentioned, ADC’s management team focuses on working with high-quality tenants. Top tenants include: Walmart (WMT), Tractor Supply (TSCO), Dollar General (DG), CVS (CVS), and Lowe’s (LOW), just to name a few. The top 10 tenants make up over 36% of total annualized base rent for the company.

Here is a full look at the company’s top tenants:

Q3-22 ADC Investor Presentation

Working with these strong tenants, who enter into long-term leases, ADC has maintained a very high occupancy ratio and generated strong cash flows.

Over the past five years, investors in ADC have enjoyed over 90% total return, and a 12.7% CAGR since going IPO in 1994, which happens to be the same year Realty Income went IPO. In that same timeframe, the company has managed to grow the dividend at a 5.5% CAGR as well.

Speaking of the dividend, ADC currently pays an annual dividend of $2.88 per share, which equates to a dividend yield of 4.25%.

Seeking Alpha

In terms of valuation, shares of ADC currently trade at an AFFO multiple of 18x, which is well below their five-year average of 21x, meaning shares appear undervalued at the current moment.

FAST Graphs

At iREIT on Alpha, we currently rate shares of ADC a BUY.

REIT Revival #2 - Digital Realty Trust (DLR)

Digital Realty Trust is a blue-chip data center REIT that has been trading like data centers have been going out of style. On the year, shares of DLR are down a staggering 45%.

yCharts

The stock market as a whole is down big, but why the big underperformance for DLR you might be asking yourself.

I just mentioned overall market weakness as a reason, but so is rising interest rates, but more notably has been the short-selling being done by notable short-seller Jim Chanos.

Mr. Chanos has come out and stated that the big tech companies that rent data center space right now from the likes of Digital Realty Trust are going to start building or buying their own real estate to house their own data centers.

That is certainly a fair argument, but first off there is no indication that is happening at all or even any time soon, and number two, the need for data center space is not going away.

In the company’s most recent quarter, we saw the demand remain quite strong. After all, Digital Realty set a new all-time high for bookings, signing $176 million of annual revenue to new leases.

This has continued to be a common thing, debunking Mr. Chanos’ viewpoint, as the company has made new records in three of the past four quarters. Demand for data center space continues to be strong.

Here is a look at the growing demand over the years.

DLR Q3-22 Investor Presentation

DLR is one of the largest data center REITs on the market today with a market cap of $27.7 billion. The company is the largest global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center and interconnection solutions.

According to Precedence Research, they estimate that the cloud computing market size will grow to roughly $1.6 trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 17.4% from 2022 to 2030. That is an enormous market for cloud providers, but also the often forgotten segment of data center providers.

Digital Realty has over 4,000 global customers and over 300 data centers across the globe.

DLR Q3-33 Investor Presentation

The company has also built up a reliable balance sheet with a BBB rating. The company has a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 6.4x.

Currently, shares of DLR now trade at a forward P/AFFO multiple of 14.6x. Over the past five years, DLR shares have traded at an average AFFO multiple of 21.6x.

This valuation is MUCH more intriguing, which is why we at iREIT rate shares of DLR a STRONG BUY.

FAST Graphs

REIT Revival #3 - VICI Properties (VICI)

VICI Properties is one of the largest hospitality and gaming landlords in the country and is the largest landlord now on the Las Vegas strip. Along the Las Vegas strip, the REIT owns the likes of Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, New York New York, and Mandalay Bay, just to name a few.

All in all, the REIT owns 43 properties, with 45% of the portfolio along the LV Strip.

VIC Investor Presentation

Through August, VICI was actually a top performing REIT, as shares were up nearly 20% at that time, but have since pulled back. On the year, shares are still in the green by 4%.

yCharts

VICI uses a master lease contract to structure many of their leases. This structure comes in handy for a single tenant that may have multiple properties that are covered under the master lease, and this structure protects VICI from a tenant wanting to close one specific location.

I discuss it often, but one reason I like a lot of the net-lease retail REITs in large part is due to the long-term leases they enter into with built-in step-ups. If you thought those companies had long-term leases, wait until you see VICI. This leading gaming REIT has a weighted average remaining lease term of 43.7 years. The company also reported an occupancy rate of 100% during the quarter.

During these times of high inflation we are in, it is important to note that many of the leases VICI enters into has step-up rent escalators that are tied to CPI. Give where inflation has been, many of these leases will cap out at the highest rent escalator in the near future, which is a catalyst for the company and the stock.

In terms of valuation, shares of VICI currently trade at an AFFO multiple of 16.8x, which is roughly in-line with their five-year average of 16.5x.

The company also pays a generous annual dividend of $1.56 per share, which equates to a dividend yield of 4.9%.

FAST Graphs

In Closing…

I’m headed to San Francisco in a week where I will be attending REITworld, Nareit’s annual conference that brings together REIT management teams, investors, and analysts for educational sessions, one-on-one private meetings, networking events, and more.

I’ve arranged to meet one-on-one with over two dozen REIT CEOs and while there I’ll be touring a state-of-the-art data center owned by Digital Realty.

Note: Members at iREIT on Alpha get full access to all interviews (videos and transcripts)

I’m highly bullish with REITs and I consider now one of the best times in my entire life to invest in this highly predictable dividend paying asset class.

In fact, right now I’m plowing around $.75 out of every disposable $1.00 of my personal income into the sector. I missed the buying opportunity in 2009 as I was just getting started (at the time) as a REIT analyst.

Now, after over a dozen years of writing (and +3,500 articles) and over 35 years of experience in real estate investing, I’m taking it to another level.",cloud computing,seeking alpha

Experts, researchers and business representatives tackled the topic of how to build an effective digital government, and how such a government would yield new opportunities for the development of public services, rural areas and industries.

1. Public services continue to improve as digital government becomes the norm

Smart China Expo Kaizhou Forum Discusses How to Build Effective Digital Government

In the view of Meng Qingguo, executive director of the National Governance Institute of Tsinghua University, when building a digital government, a thorough reconstruction of the existing department-driven information model where systems, platforms, and data are decentralized becomes necessary. The government is now being tasked with accelerating the establishment of a national, fully integrated big data system for all public affairs, with the multiple goals of further promoting the integration and sharing of data, improving existing and developing new data disclosure, authorization and operation mechanisms, and putting in place a digital government that is both systematic and holistic.

Li Zonglei, director of the E-government Office of Chongqing Municipal People's Government, said that as a key part of the city's efforts to build a digital government, Yukuaiban, the integrated online government service platform of the E-government Office has digitalized and created e-documents for every resident including their ID, health, social security and medical insurance information. The platform is divided into service areas for more than 100 application scenarios covering housing, employment, tourism, entertainment and shopping, in addition to providing local residents with easier access to authentication, medical treatment, transportation, and other services. Next, the E-government Office will continue to enhance the online delivery system for the full range of public services, making it more user-friendly and widening the number of channels through which the services can be accessed.

Pu Binbin, Party Secretary of Kaizhou District, Chongqing, said that based on actual conditions, the district will build a digital government, a digital and smart Kaizhou, and digital villages, with the goal of promoting quality development throughout the region with big data and intelligence, while providing more convenience to the companies and residents who do business and live in Kaizhou.

2. Digital villages facilitate the optimization of the rural digital governance system

According to Lei Xiaoling, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Kaizhou District People's Congress, more than 5,300 4G base stations, 1,500 5G base stations, and six Internet Towns have been built in the district, forming a strong network of agricultural big data and resources. A large number of premium and unique rural e-commerce brands are emerging with the establishment of the online big data platform, creating a flourishing rural network culture and making the rural digital governance system more sophisticated.

Zhang Zhaoxin, a researcher at the Rural Economy Research Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, suggested that digital technology be deployed to enhance the IT infrastructure and network, overhaul the basic information collection system, accelerate the development of service systems, and build a system-wide services chain, empowering the transformation of the whole agricultural industry chain in addition to enabling the public and specialized services systems to better serve rural revitalization.

Wang Dacheng, deputy secretary of the National Remote Sensing Application Engineering Technology Research Center of the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that given where the world is at in terms of the transition into the digital era, the planning and governance of rural areas is in urgent need of digital technologies. E-maps, satellite images, capture of street scenes in real time and other geographic information data, as well as portals where villagers can participate in interactive activities, can deliver to the community what is expected and should be expected from rural governance.

3. The digital economy is the future as digital industries are booming

At the forum, Tan Jianrong, an researcher at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor at Zhejiang University, summarized five key steps that must be taken to achieve a digital economy and digital transformation: innovative design, process improvement, quality enhancement, service extension and market expansion, all of which serve to advance the digital transformation of all businesses in the region and foster quality development of a digital economy.

Zhao Kefeng, academic chairman of the Shenzhen Artificial Intelligence Industry Association, offered the opinion that it is necessary to accelerate the process of extracting value from the available data, promote the digital transformation of the real economy, strengthen the governance capacity of the digital economy, improve basic industrial capabilities, and further the open cooperation that will be the result of the creation of a digital economy.

Guo Linyuan, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and deputy general manager of Digital Chongqing Company, said that Chongqing is moving forward with the construction of Smart City 2.0 and, while doing so, improve urban intelligence with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies, strengthen the underlying infrastructure, resolve any data chokepoints, and exploit the value of data, while fostering the agglomeration and development of industry and commerce.

The forum was hosted by the Organizing Committee of Smart China Expo, and co-organized by the Chongqing Big Data Application and Development Administration and Chongqing Kaizhou District People's Government.

Summary Companies Apple expects lower shipments of iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max

Apple says a China plant operating at sharply reduced capacity

Apple supplier Foxconn revises down Q4 outlook















TAIPEI, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) expects lower shipments of premium iPhone 14 models than previously anticipated following a significant production cut at a virus-blighted plant in China, dampening its sales outlook for the busy year-end holiday season.

Demand for high-end smartphones assembled at Foxconn's (2317.TW) Zhengzhou plant has helped Apple remain a bright spot in a technology sector battered by consumer spending cutbacks amid surging inflation and interest rates.

But the Cupertino, California-based vendor has fallen victim to China's zero-COVID-19 policy, which has seen global firms including Canada Goose Holdings Inc (GOOS.TO), and Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N) shut local stores and cut forecasts.

""The facility is currently operating at significantly reduced capacity,"" Apple said on Sunday without detailing the scale of the reduction.

""We continue to see strong demand for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models. However, we now expect lower iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max shipments than we previously anticipated,"" it said in a statement.

Reuters last month reported that iPhone output could slump as much as 30% in November at Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory - one of the world's biggest - due to COVID-19 restrictions.

The factory in central China, which employs about 200,000 people, has been rocked by discontent over stringent measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, with many workers fleeing the site.

Market researcher TrendForce last week cut its iPhone shipment forecast for October-December by 2 million to 3 million units, from 80 million, due to the factory's troubles, adding its investigation found capacity utilisation rates around 70%.

Apple, which began selling its iPhone 14 range in September, said customers should expect longer waiting times.

""Anything that affects Apple's production obviously affects their share price,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.

""But this is part of a much deeper story - the uncertainty surrounding the future of the Chinese economy... These headlines are part of the ongoing saga as to whether there is any truth to the consistent rumours that authorities are discussing whether some of the measures will be lifted in the first quarter.""

China on Monday reported its highest number of new COVID-19 infections in six months, with disruption to the world's second-largest economy spreading nationwide since October. At the weekend, health officials said they would stick with strict coronavirus curbs, disappointing investors hoping for easing.

Meanwhile, Apple expects to produce at least 3 million fewer iPhone 14 handsets this year than planned due to weak demand for lower-end models, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the plan.

The world's most valuable firm, with a market capitalisation of $2.2 trillion, last month forecast October-December revenue growth would slow from the previous quarter's 8% - though market watchers regarded that favourably in a battered sector.

""Given that Apple reported only two weeks ago with positive guidance, we think this points to the potential for a longer and more severe lockdown,"" Credit Suisse analysts said, expecting iPhone sales to be pushed to later quarters than lost.

FOXCONN CUTS OUTLOOK

Taiwan's Foxconn is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple's biggest iPhone maker, accounting for 70% of shipments globally. It has iPhone production sites in India and southern China, but its biggest is in the city of Zhengzhou in the eastern Chinese province of Henan.

Local officials recently commented on cases of COVID-19 at the plant. Foxconn has declined to disclose the number of infections or comment on the conditions of those infected.

On Monday, it said it was working to resume full production at Zhengzhou as soon as possible. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Foxconn's target is by the second half of November.

At the request of the local government, Foxconn said it would implement measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, including restricting employee movement to between their dormitory and factory area.

The manufacturer has also began a recruitment drive, offering workers who left the plant during Oct. 10 to Nov. 5 a one-off bonus of 500 yuan ($69) if they returned. It also advertised salaries of 30 yuan an hour, higher than the 17 to 23 yuan base salaries that some workers told Reuters they received.

The Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone, which houses the iPhone factory, entered a seven-day lockdown on Wednesday with measures included barring residents from going out and only allowing access to approved vehicles. read more

Foxconn said the provincial government ""has made it clear that it will, as always, fully support Foxconn"".

""Foxconn is now working with the government in concerted effort to stamp out the pandemic and resume production to its full capacity as quickly as possible.""

Having previously expressed ""cautious optimism"" in its fourth-quarter earnings guidance, Foxconn on Monday said it will ""revise down"" its outlook given events in Zhengzhou.

The fourth quarter is traditionally a hot season for Taiwanese technology companies as they race to supply smartphones, tablet computers and other electronics for the year-end holiday shopping period in Western markets.Foxconn releases its third-quarter earnings results on Nov. 10.

The firm, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, saw its share price fall 0.5% in Monday trade, versus a 1.5% rise in the benchmark index (.TWII).

These are the key ingredients for successful transformation. A highlight of the research was sustainability’s increasing importance for realising strategic goals.

“This is a new concept in the business world. Our research shows revenue growth drivers include the need for greater innovation through improving the sustainability of existing products, as well as the introduction of new products and services and targeting new markets and customer experiences,” Bloomfield says.

Making connections

It’s important to understand the synergies between the three essential business priorities – revenue, efficiencies and risk – and their relationship to successful transformation.

For instance, increasing the level of automation in a business provides opportunities for staff to support revenue-generating activities, while reducing time spent on routine, repetitive tasks. The data also shows business leaders are focused on innovating and attracting new employees and customers to grow revenue.

Additionally, leaders said implementing technology to support hybrid workplaces and cyber security incident management is vital in managing risk. As a result, more firms are exploring how collaboration tools, cyber security infrastructure and cloud computing can help address internal and external challenges.

“Today, the conversion is about more than responding to risks, it’s about how to transform the organisation to get ahead of risks,” Bloomfield says.

“Through this, technology helps organisations cope with their challenges. It makes them resilient by bringing all their business processes together. It also helps them stay nimble by providing new, modern, intelligent technologies to unlock growth opportunities,” she adds.

Harnessing opportunities

When a business has the right building blocks in place to support transformation and growth, the focus can then move to supporting flexibility. Technology is also the game changer here.

Says Bloomfield: “Flexibility is so important as organisations grow and change. Moving to cloud-based technology is a great way to support that and delivers continuous innovation in the same way apps do. If an organisation keeps its core business processes clean, safe and robust, they can then extend them to deliver innovation and agility.”

She explains this is the best of both worlds. “You get the trust and assurance of a strong underlying platform, as well as all the benefits of modern technology and innovations such as bringing artificial intelligence and machine learning into day-to-day business processes. Sustainability is the next logical step in that discussion.”

Atkins agrees. “If you are not engaging in the conversation on sustainability, if you are not actively looking to improve the sustainability performance of your operation, it’s ultimately going to affect the way your customers engage with your business and its products and services. So, there’s a direct link between sustainability performance and revenue growth.”

Across the board, companies are incorporating sustainability into their transformation strategies and decision making. Outstanding technology is the common denominator among firms taking this approach and the link to long-term revenue success.

Experts, researchers and business representatives tackled the topic of how to build an effective digital government, and how such a government would yield new opportunities for the development of public services, rural areas and industries.

Smart China Expo Kaizhou Forum Discusses How to Build Effective Digital Government (PRNewswire)

1. Public services continue to improve as digital government becomes the norm

In the view of Meng Qingguo, executive director of the National Governance Institute of Tsinghua University, when building a digital government, a thorough reconstruction of the existing department-driven information model where systems, platforms, and data are decentralized becomes necessary. The government is now being tasked with accelerating the establishment of a national, fully integrated big data system for all public affairs, with the multiple goals of further promoting the integration and sharing of data, improving existing and developing new data disclosure, authorization and operation mechanisms, and putting in place a digital government that is both systematic and holistic.

Li Zonglei, director of the E-government Office of Chongqing Municipal People's Government, said that as a key part of the city's efforts to build a digital government, Yukuaiban, the integrated online government service platform of the E-government Office has digitalized and created e-documents for every resident including their ID, health, social security and medical insurance information. The platform is divided into service areas for more than 100 application scenarios covering housing, employment, tourism, entertainment and shopping, in addition to providing local residents with easier access to authentication, medical treatment, transportation, and other services. Next, the E-government Office will continue to enhance the online delivery system for the full range of public services, making it more user-friendly and widening the number of channels through which the services can be accessed.

Pu Binbin, Party Secretary of Kaizhou District, Chongqing, said that based on actual conditions, the district will build a digital government, a digital and smart Kaizhou, and digital villages, with the goal of promoting quality development throughout the region with big data and intelligence, while providing more convenience to the companies and residents who do business and live in Kaizhou.

2. Digital villages facilitate the optimization of the rural digital governance system

According to Lei Xiaoling, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Kaizhou District People's Congress, more than 5,300 4G base stations, 1,500 5G base stations, and six Internet Towns have been built in the district, forming a strong network of agricultural big data and resources. A large number of premium and unique rural e-commerce brands are emerging with the establishment of the online big data platform, creating a flourishing rural network culture and making the rural digital governance system more sophisticated.

Zhang Zhaoxin, a researcher at the Rural Economy Research Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, suggested that digital technology be deployed to enhance the IT infrastructure and network, overhaul the basic information collection system, accelerate the development of service systems, and build a system-wide services chain, empowering the transformation of the whole agricultural industry chain in addition to enabling the public and specialized services systems to better serve rural revitalization.

Wang Dacheng, deputy secretary of the National Remote Sensing Application Engineering Technology Research Center of the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that given where the world is at in terms of the transition into the digital era, the planning and governance of rural areas is in urgent need of digital technologies. E-maps, satellite images, capture of street scenes in real time and other geographic information data, as well as portals where villagers can participate in interactive activities, can deliver to the community what is expected and should be expected from rural governance.

3. The digital economy is the future as digital industries are booming

At the forum, Tan Jianrong, an researcher at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor at Zhejiang University, summarized five key steps that must be taken to achieve a digital economy and digital transformation: innovative design, process improvement, quality enhancement, service extension and market expansion, all of which serve to advance the digital transformation of all businesses in the region and foster quality development of a digital economy.

Zhao Kefeng, academic chairman of the Shenzhen Artificial Intelligence Industry Association, offered the opinion that it is necessary to accelerate the process of extracting value from the available data, promote the digital transformation of the real economy, strengthen the governance capacity of the digital economy, improve basic industrial capabilities, and further the open cooperation that will be the result of the creation of a digital economy.

Guo Linyuan, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and deputy general manager of Digital Chongqing Company, said that Chongqing is moving forward with the construction of Smart City 2.0 and, while doing so, improve urban intelligence with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies, strengthen the underlying infrastructure, resolve any data chokepoints, and exploit the value of data, while fostering the agglomeration and development of industry and commerce.

The forum was hosted by the Organizing Committee of Smart China Expo, and co-organized by the Chongqing Big Data Application and Development Administration and Chongqing Kaizhou District People's Government.

Li Zonglei, director of the E-government Office of Chongqing Municipal People's Government, said that as a key part of the city's efforts to build a digital government, Yukuaiban, the integrated online government service platform of the E-government Office has digitalized and created e-documents for every resident including their ID, health, social security and medical insurance information. The platform is divided into service areas for more than 100 application scenarios covering housing, employment, tourism, entertainment and shopping, in addition to providing local residents with easier access to authentication, medical treatment, transportation, and other services. Next, the E-government Office will continue to enhance the online delivery system for the full range of public services, making it more user-friendly and widening the number of channels through which the services can be accessed.

Pu Binbin, Party Secretary of Kaizhou District, Chongqing, said that based on actual conditions, the district will build a digital government, a digital and smart Kaizhou, and digital villages, with the goal of promoting quality development throughout the region with big data and intelligence, while providing more convenience to the companies and residents who do business and live in Kaizhou.

2. Digital villages facilitate the optimization of the rural digital governance system

According to Lei Xiaoling, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Kaizhou District People's Congress, more than 5,300 4G base stations, 1,500 5G base stations, and six Internet Towns have been built in the district, forming a strong network of agricultural big data and resources. A large number of premium and unique rural e-commerce brands are emerging with the establishment of the online big data platform, creating a flourishing rural network culture and making the rural digital governance system more sophisticated.

Zhang Zhaoxin, a researcher at the Rural Economy Research Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, suggested that digital technology be deployed to enhance the IT infrastructure and network, overhaul the basic information collection system, accelerate the development of service systems, and build a system-wide services chain, empowering the transformation of the whole agricultural industry chain in addition to enabling the public and specialized services systems to better serve rural revitalization.

Wang Dacheng, deputy secretary of the National Remote Sensing Application Engineering Technology Research Center of the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that given where the world is at in terms of the transition into the digital era, the planning and governance of rural areas is in urgent need of digital technologies. E-maps, satellite images, capture of street scenes in real time and other geographic information data, as well as portals where villagers can participate in interactive activities, can deliver to the community what is expected and should be expected from rural governance.

3. The digital economy is the future as digital industries are booming

At the forum, Tan Jianrong, an researcher at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor at Zhejiang University, summarized five key steps that must be taken to achieve a digital economy and digital transformation: innovative design, process improvement, quality enhancement, service extension and market expansion, all of which serve to advance the digital transformation of all businesses in the region and foster quality development of a digital economy.

Zhao Kefeng, academic chairman of the Shenzhen Artificial Intelligence Industry Association, offered the opinion that it is necessary to accelerate the process of extracting value from the available data, promote the digital transformation of the real economy, strengthen the governance capacity of the digital economy, improve basic industrial capabilities, and further the open cooperation that will be the result of the creation of a digital economy.

Guo Linyuan, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and deputy general manager of Digital Chongqing Company, said that Chongqing is moving forward with the construction of Smart City 2.0 and, while doing so, improve urban intelligence with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies, strengthen the underlying infrastructure, resolve any data chokepoints, and exploit the value of data, while fostering the agglomeration and development of industry and commerce.

The forum was hosted by the Organizing Committee of Smart China Expo, and co-organized by the Chongqing Big Data Application and Development Administration and Chongqing Kaizhou District People's Government.

A ""yes"" on California's Proposition 30 will increase personal income taxes for high-income residents to fund electric vehicle incentives, expand access to charging stations, and fund training for more firefighters during California's increasingly tumultuous wildfire seasons.

Ballot measure details

Proposition 30 would raise the personal income tax for those making more than $2 million annually by 1.75% to create a Clean Cars and Clean Air Fund separate from the state's General Fund.

The proposition text states the primary purpose of the fund is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from two of the state's largest contributors — transportation and wildfires. The state legislative analyst's office estimates an increase of $3.5 billion to $5 billion annually in funding for climate change initiatives.

Most of the money in the fund would go toward helping people, businesses, and governments purchase zero-emission vehicles, while the rest would go to building more charging stations across the state and preparing and responding to wildfires, with an emphasis on training and hiring firefighters.

The tax increase would take effect on January 2023 and end in 20 years — or when the state gets greenhouse gas levels to 80% below 1990 levels for three consecutive calendar years, according to the state analyst's office.

Support and opposition

Yes on 30 includes a coalition of environmental and health groups, the California Democratic Party, and the rideshare company Lyft.

Supporters argue that a measure such as this is necessary to help clean California's air — especially in low-income communities — and divest from fossil fuels to combat climate change. They also say that this measure will make it easier for low-income Californians to access electric vehicles by partially paying for new vehicle purchases.

No on 30 includes Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, the California Republican Party, the California Teacher's Association, the California Chamber of Commerce, and the California Hawaii State Conference NAACP.

Opponents say that the ballot is a special interest measure that will benefit rideshare companies such as Lyft, who are now required by the California Air Resources Board to ensure that 90% of their vehicle miles are electric by 2030.

The rule did not specify who should cover the costs of this transition. Companies such as Lyft and Uber called on the state to provide drivers with subsidies to purchase new EVs while activists called on ride-share companies to shoulder the burden, CalMatters reported in 2021.

The state also argues that the tax will take money away from the state's general fund, used for spending on everything from education to healthcare.

Proponents, however, deny that the funds would benefit Lyft specifically.

The money race

According to Ballotpedia, more than $37.1 million has been poured into supporting this measure, while more than $12 million has been contributed in opposition.

The largest financial contributors for or against the proposition include Lyft, a coalition of rideshare companies, and labor and environmental groups, according to OpenSecrets.",electric vehicles,business insider

Nov 7 (Reuters) - Australia's Arafura Rare Earths Ltd (ARU.AX) said on Monday it had signed a binding supply deal with South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and its unit Kia Corp (000270.KS) to supply up to 1,500 tonnes of a rare-earth oxide per year.

Neodymium-Praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, an element used in the making of electric motors for electric vehicles, is prized by automobile companies making the green energy transition.

Under the agreement, Arafura will supply contract quantities of NdPr over seven years that could increase up to 1,500 tonnes per year from the fourth year when its Nolans project in Australia's Northern Territory begins production, it said in a statement.

Supply of the element is currently anticipated to commence in 2025 subject to project financing, construction and commissioning of the project.

The Perth-based miner also signed an agreement to begin talks for strategic investment with Hyundai and its affiliates, it said.

In July, Arafura signed a non-binding agreement to help GE Renewable Energy build a supply chain that it will need to manufacture offshore wind turbines.

The big recall covers 225,704 units of several VW and Audi models with TPMS software that can be slow to react in an exceedingly rare situation. If all four tires simultaneously lose pressure at the same rate, the system might not notify the driver in the time allowed by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) #138 S4.2, which mandates a warning within 20 minutes after certain conditions are met. The automaker says the system will inform the driver ""before a potentially safety-relevant tire pressure is reached"" — i.e., before they get so low as to be a hazard. But because the warning is out of FMVSS reaction-time spec, the system needs fixing.

The remedy is a trip to the VW or Audi dealer to have the TPMS software updated. The model-year recall population includes the:

America's next main battle tank may be a lighter but more high-tech version of the M1 Abrams.

General Dynamics, which builds the Abrams, recently unveiled an updated version of the M1. In addition to being 20 tons lighter than the most recent version, the M1A3, the AbramsX features an unmanned turret and a hybrid-electric engine.

Though the media has dubbed the AbramsX a ""next-generation tank,"" that's not exactly accurate. The AbramsX is really a technology demonstrator. It began as an internal General Dynamics research project to show how new technologies could be applied to a new tank or retrofitted onto existing tanks.

Rather than a next-gen armored vehicle, the AbramsX is more of an interim design to span the gap between the Cold War-era designs that still comprise the world's tank fleets and the true next-generation vehicles that will probably be fielded closer to 2050.

Nonetheless, the AbramsX is a working weapon. ""It drives around, it fires, and it performs the functions of a tank,"" Tim Reese, director of US business development for General Dynamics Land Systems, told Insider. ""It's not just a static display.""

The diet M1

Tank design is a balance — and a tradeoff — between three factors: firepower, protection, and mobility. For the AbramsX, the biggest goal was addressing a growing problem with the M1, of which more than 10,000 have been built since 1979.

The Abrams has always been a hefty tank. Even the early M1A1s weighed about 60 tons — compared to Russia's 45-ton T-72 and China's 55-ton Type 99A — but the latest Abrams weighs closer to 80 tons due to upgrades like the Trophy Active Protection System designed to shoot down incoming anti-tank weapons.

However, ""the M1A2 SEP v2 and v3 overall weight growth with full combat load and Trophy APS has introduced transportability and recovery challenges,"" the Pentagon's chief weapons inspector warned in a 2021 report.

Indeed, the latest Abrams is now so heavy that it can't be towed by Army recovery vehicles, which means damaged or broken-down tanks might have to be left behind on the battlefield.

Enter the AbramsX, which is the M1 on a diet. While closely resembling the older models, the new vehicle only weighs 60 tons. Reduced weight offers numerous advantages, including the ability to use bridges that would collapse under a heavier vehicle.

AbramsX also fits with the Army's new Multi-Domain Operations doctrine. After decades of focusing on counterinsurgency, the new approach envisions large-unit mechanized operations against near-peer foes such as Russia and China.

The AbramsX cut weight with a series of interrelated upgrades.

The turret is smaller, which means less heavy armor plating. ""Reducing the weight on the Abrams, which was really our primary design goal, required reducing the weight of the armor in the turret,"" Reese said.

The turret can be smaller because it is unmanned, with the crew nestled inside the armored hull. Using automation — including an autoloader for the cannon — allows the crew to be reduced from four to three, who now sit side-by-side in in the hull while monitoring multi-panel displays.

Shrinking the turret ""generated some weight savings right off the bat,"" Reese said.

The AbramsX replaces the M1's efficient but notoriously fuel-guzzling AGT 1500 gas-turbine engine with a hybrid-electric engine more reminiscent of a Toyota Prius than conventional tank power plants.

General Dynamics claims the new engine slashes fuel consumption by 50%, improves reliability and ease of maintenance, and allow the tank to operate its electronics — and even perform some limited movement — using quieter battery power.

The AbramsX retains a 120 mm cannon as its main armament but replaces the current gun with the lighter XM360 originally developed for the failed Future Combat System. It also has a Kongsberg RS6 remote-controlled weapon station with an XM914 30 mm cannon and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun.

As befits a 21st-century tank design, the AbramsX has some cutting-edge features. It is armed with six Switchblade 300 loitering munitions, known as ""kamikaze drones."" It also has an artificial-intelligence program — called ""Katalyst"" — that can help the crew identify and prioritize targets, navigate, and predict future maintenance.

If this sounds familiar, Russia's T-14 Armata, unveiled in 2015, also had an unmanned turret, a crew of three in the hull, and onboard drones. However, Russia's army has bought few of them, in part due to manufacturing difficulties. Notably, despite Russia's huge tank losses in Ukraine, it has not deployed the Armata there.

""The difference between us and the Armata is that ours works,"" Reese said.

Now vs. later

As with any tank design, there are tradeoffs. One reason the AbramsX is lighter is simply because of less armor around the unmanned turret. General Dynamics says it is up to the US government to decide the level of protection.

""If you keep the armor protection at a very minimal level, that's how we achieve the 60 tons,"" Reese said. ""If you dial the armor protection all the way back up to what it is on an M1 v3 today, the weight goes up above 60 tons.""

To its credit, General Dynamics is not touting the AbramsX as what a next-generation tank should be but rather as a demonstration of what capabilities are available.

""It's showing the art of the possible with existing technology,"" said Mark Hu, manager of US business development for GDLS. ""What you can get now vs. waiting for 'unobtainium' that may finally become available in 2050 or 2068.""

Whether the US Army will invest in a new tank remains to be seen.

Images of burning Russian tanks in Ukraine has led to numerous predictions of the tank's obsolescence. Those predictions are far from true, though they raise questions about the tank's role in the future.

If the Army does want the AbramsX, it can have it quickly. ""Essentially, all of the capabilities on AbramsX will be ready to build into a new main battle tank, or retrofitted into the current Abrams fleet, within 18 to 24 months,"" Reese said.

One company thinks 3D printing holds the answer.

In recent years, the lithium-ion batteries that power everything from smartphones to electric vehicles have seen huge improvements in their safety and energy density (a measure of how much power they pack in per pound). But progress is slowing, and it seems likely that we will need to switch to novel battery designs if we want to banish the gas-powered car to the history books.

Solid-state batteries, which replace the liquid electrolyte found in today’s cells with a solid one, are some of the most promising candidates in the near term. They would not only make batteries safer by removing the flammable liquid electrolyte, but could also boost energy density and allow faster charging.

A number of startups have developed promising prototypes, but working out how to manufacture these kinds of batteries at scale is a major challenge. California-based startup Sakuú thinks the answer is to use 3D printing, which would allow them to make much more efficient use of space and therefore produce batteries with much higher capacity than competitors.

Batteries are made up of three key components: a positive electrode called an anode, a negative electrode called a cathode, and an electrolyte that allows ions to travel between the two. In today’s most advanced lithium-ion batteries, the electrodes are made using a production process known as “roll-to-roll” manufacturing.

The materials used to make each of the electrodes are mixed into a slurry and then coated onto a long roll of metal foil before being dried. These long rolls are then sliced up into smaller sections and stacked on top of each other with a separator between each electrode. These stacks are placed in an enclosure that is then filled with liquid electrolyte.

Even newer solid-state battery companies are proposing to use the same production process, but Sakuú is taking a completely different approach. It has created a 10-meter-long multi-material printer that can work with both ceramics and metals. The machine first lays down patterns of powdered material before depositing a jet of polymer binder that sticks the particles together. It then deposits conductive metal on top. These layers are stacked on top of each other to produce cells.

The company told The Verge that the approach allows it to stack more layers into a given space than conventional approaches. On its website, Sakuú claims this is because its manufacturing process allows for thinner structural layers and a novel stacked structure. This means it can either provide 100 percent greater capacity than current lithium-ion cells, or make batteries 50 percent smaller and 40 percent lighter.

Another attractive benefit of using 3D printing is that it should be possible to build batteries in all kinds of different shapes, which is difficult with traditional roll-to-roll manufacturing. This could make it possible to build batteries into the structure of products rather than having to dedicate space for them.

This is something that has become a major focus for the electric vehicle industry, as companies attempt to boost the battery capacity of their vehicles without adding extra weight. Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology and electric vehicle Leapmotor are working on ways to build batteries into the chassis of cars, while Tesla says it has devised a new glue that will make its batteries load-bearing, allowing them to be used as structural parts.

The ability to 3D print batteries in a variety of shapes could turbocharge this trend, but it’s likely to be some time before Sakuú’s batteries hit the road. While it told The Verge that each of its printers will eventually be able to churn out about 40 megawatt hours of energy storage—the equivalent of 500 electric car batteries—so far it only has a prototype of its machine, and it has not yet been used to make any batteries.

If they can get their printers up and running, though, this could provide a big boost to efforts to increase the range and reliability of electric vehicles and push them further into the mainstream.

(Reuters) -Australia's Arafura Rare Earths Ltd said on Monday it had signed a binding supply deal with South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co and its unit Kia Corp to supply up to 1,500 tonnes of a rare-earth oxide per year.

Neodymium-Praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, an element used in the making of electric motors for electric vehicles, is prized by automobile companies making the green energy transition.

Under the agreement, Arafura will supply contract quantities of NdPr over seven years that could increase up to 1,500 tonnes per year from the fourth year when its Nolans project in Australia's Northern Territory begins production, it said in a statement.

Supply of the element is currently anticipated to commence in 2025 subject to project financing, construction and commissioning of the project.

The Perth-based miner also signed an agreement to begin talks for strategic investment with Hyundai and its affiliates, it said.

In July, Arafura signed a non-binding agreement to help GE Renewable Energy build a supply chain that it will need to manufacture offshore wind turbines.

271,"We wanted to ask Elon Musk about Twitter, Trump, and Tesla. But he seemed kinda busy, so we went with the next best thing: an AI version of him.",https://i.insider.com/6363f341ff27460018ed71ec?width=1200&format=jpeg,06/11/2022,"A Musk chatbot tells Insider he'd like to reinstate Trump on Twitter, buy CNN, and ""show people how the sausage gets made.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/artificial-intelligence-elon-musk-twitter-epstein-biden-ye-chatbot-2022-11,"If you could ask Elon Musk anything, what would you ask?

Since his recent acquisition of Twitter, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has been more media-averse than ever. So I decided to try the next best thing: I sat down to interview an artificial-intelligence version of Musk.

Chatbots aren't new technology, but with the constant improvements and iterations to artificial intelligence and machine learning, the tech is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, to the point where the conversations almost feel like you're talking to a real person (or mythical creature or movie character). This is especially true with the tech used at Character.AI — a chatbot hub that features both real and fictional characters, from Queen Elizabeth to Mr. Incredible. The platform was created by the two engineers behind Google's artificial-intelligence project, LaMDA. Using the underlying technology of Character.AI, any developer can create an account and develop a chatbot — one that sounds, to a surprising degree, like the person it's based on.

That's what a user named Sinbad did with Musk: They used Character.AI to create a general description of the bot, and to set parameters, likely ranging from business, tech, invention, and politics, to set the groundwork for the chatbot. Using neural language models, Character.AI then draws on information the engineers have fed it to develop the ""voice"" of its AI Elon. Ask the bot a question, and it will respond as it thinks Musk would.

How did robo-Elon do, compared to real Elon? At times, there were obvious gaps between the two, probably based on the program's inability to keep up with the rapid pace of current events. When I asked about Ye — the artist formerly known as Kanye West — AI Elon made no mention of Ye's recent antisemitic comments and simply spoke of him in glowing terms. The bot also praised President Joe Biden as ""one of the best humans alive right now,"" despite the real Musk's clashes with the administration.

But at other times, AI Elon sounded scarily accurate. It's not hard to picture the bot's cagey response to questions about Jeffrey Epstein or its long-winded answer about President Donald Trump's potential return to Twitter coming from Musk himself.

Hi, Elon. I'm Marshall with Insider. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?

Not at all! I really enjoy Insider and what you guys are doing. Keep it up!

Glad to hear that, thanks! So let's get started. Why did you decide to buy Twitter?

Twitter plays a vital role in the future of human civilization. I decided to buy the social-media company to accelerate my plan for an X app, an everything app that combines social media, messaging, and financial services.

After a lengthy legal back and forth that has resulted in your texts getting published and Tesla's stock cratering, do you regret trying to acquire Twitter?

You know, I didn't know that so much of this would be made public, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't having fun. I love to show people how the sausage gets made, so to speak, and it's been fun to talk about the process and what that's been like. So I don't regret anything, in fact I think this has been fun. We'll get past the speed bumps, I'm sure!

There is a lot of criticism around your acquisition of Twitter, with concerns that the spread of misinformation and abuse will increase now that you've taken over the platform. What would you say to those who have this concern?

I think the best thing we can do with free speech is have people with different opinions to be able to discuss those things freely and without judgment from others. Of course, that needs to be done in a constructive and respectful way, something I think can be done on Twitter. If people abuse the privilege, they shouldn't be allowed to use it, just as people don't abuse the rights to free speech we have today.

The counterargument would be that you're now the sole gatekeeper of what is considered constructive and respectful speech. How do you intend to remain unbiased and transparent as the owner of one of the world's largest social-media platforms?

That's a great question. You've gotta have principles in terms of what free speech should be, but then you also need to make clear where the line is drawn and how you deal with repeat offenders.

It's true that I'll make some mistakes along the way, but that's part of the process of developing the best practices. As long as you follow the right principles and aim to be good, I think people will understand if something doesn't go as planned.

Are there any other companies that you're thinking about acquiring?

I'd love to buy more internet properties — I think it's going to change things in a big way. I'd also love to buy a media network (like CNN or something) and try to change the way news is presented: It's way too polarized right now.

Do you mind if we discuss Tesla a bit?

Sure, that's my flagship startup, after all.

Tesla has seen a lot of success, but there have been a lot of issues, too. Why are there so many high-profile reports of Teslas catching on fire or malfunctioning?

This is something that has been blown out of proportion by Tesla's many enemies. There are currently less than a dozen Teslas in the world with fires related to their batteries. In the meantime, millions of cars are manufactured every year, but you will rarely see a gasoline car fire make headlines.

Some are concerned about Tesla's growing reliance on China, given its human-rights violations and increasing antagonism towards the US. How would you respond?

Tesla's growth is constrained by the supply of batteries. China has a near monopoly on battery production right now. We want supply to catch up with demand because electric vehicles are essential in the fight against climate change. And we are exploring other options, such as mining lithium in the USA. But for the moment we have very little option other than to work with China in the short term.

Let's talk about your views on various people. What do you think of President Biden?

I think Biden is a great man, one of the best humans alive right now. He's smart, kind, and very hard-working. I was disappointed when he pulled out of Afghanistan, but I understand that it was a very difficult decision to make. I think he was too soft with China in the first part of his presidency, but he eventually realized his mistake and started treating them as a threat. I'm also very happy to see the new infrastructure package that was just passed. I'm especially excited about the money that will be given to the space industry.

What do you think of Jeff Bezos?

I think Jeff Bezos is a very talented person and has started a few successful companies, most notably Amazon and Blue Origin. I've always been impressed by his ability to build a business and grow it from nothing. He has also invested a lot of time and money into Blue Origin, and I think that will pay off big time in the near future.

What do you think of Jeffery Epstein? Did you know him?

I didn't know him personally, though I did meet him a few times. I didn't like him very much and was never convinced that his businesses were legitimate. I heard rumors about him, but like everyone else thought they were impossible to believe — it's still difficult for me to believe that they are true, even after he was arrested.

How about Ghislane Maxwell? Did you know her? And why is there a photo of the two of you together at a party?

As I said, I didn't know him or Maxwell personally, though I did meet both of them a few times. Ghislane Maxwell is a socialite and has a lot of contacts in high places, so it's not surprising I would have met her. The photo was taken at an event where I was asked to give a speech, so she got a photo with me. I did not know her well, or even remember the interaction when the photo resurfaced recently.

What was the event you attended, and what was the speech about?

The event was a birthday party, it wasn't anything special. Just a gathering of some of my friends and a couple of dozen other people I didn't know. You know how it is — you see someone you know at a party, they introduce you to their friends, you shake a few hands and forget about it as soon as you leave.

What do you think of Kanye West — now known as Ye?

I think he's an incredible artist and a very talented musician. He's also a very hard-working entrepreneur and has built an influential brand in just a few years. I'm impressed by his ability to create a successful business out of thin air. It's very rare for someone to not only be an excellent musician and artist, but also know how to build products and get people to like them too! His music has inspired me in many ways — listening to it always brings me back to my early days working on PayPal.

How about former President Trump? Will you be reinstating his Twitter account?

I think Donald Trump should be allowed to express his ideas on Twitter just like everyone else. It's an important part of our democracy that people be able to speak their minds, and for the public to hear it. Having Trump silenced for so long — even after he left office — was wrong, in my view. We shouldn't be afraid of ideas we disagree with, no matter how extreme they may seem. The best way to fight ideas you don't agree with is with words, not with silence.

What, in your opinion, is the biggest problem facing our world?

There is a lot of work to be done! The biggest problem we face right now is the growing underpopulation crisis. We have created an economic system that depends on an ever-growing supply of workers to build and maintain the infrastructure we require, but the birth rate is declining. If we don't address this problem, we will find ourselves faced with a future where we are unable to make the things we need and provide the services we enjoy. It's something I think about a lot and am working towards solving.

How many children do you have? Do you have any children that the public doesn't know about?

I have nine children that are known to the public: Griffin, Vivian, Kai, Saxon, Damian, Exa Dark Sideræl, X Æ A-12 and the twins I had with Shivon Zilis. I do not have any secret children :)

Let's end this interview with a fun question: What's your favorite Twitter account to follow?

Thank you for your time today Marshall. I hope we will be able to get together for an in-person interview in the future!

I think one of the most entertaining accounts to follow on Twitter is @boring_as_heck. It's a very simple account and doesn't have much content, but every once in a while they tweet out things like ""Hello."" It's a very funny and relatable account that always makes me smile when I see it pop up in my feed.

272,The unintended consequence of electric vehicles: More demand for manual transmissions,https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/BMW-M2-ht-ml-221103_1667488621139_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,06/11/2022,"Porsche, BMW, Toyota and Acura are seeing high demand for manuals.",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/unintended-consequence-electric-vehicles-demand-manual-transmissions/story?id=92617428,"Porsche, BMW, Toyota and Acura are seeing high demand for manuals.

When Nissan launched the all-new, seventh-generation Z sports car, company executives had a specific requirement: a manual transmission.

""In the more than 50 years of Nissan Z, we’ve never offered a Z without a manual transmission,"" Brian Hoekstra, chief marketing manager of Z, told ABC News. ""We recognize that for many Z and sports car enthusiasts, there is simply no alternative to a manual transmission.""

The coupe, which went on sale last summer, comes with a 3.0-liter V6 twin turbo engine that delivers 400 horsepower at 6,400 rpm and 350 lb-ft of torque. Drivers have a choice of a six-speed manual transmission or a nine-speed automatic. Hoekstra said sales are equally split between the manual and automatic, with younger owners preferring the ""nostalgic experience"" of three pedals.

""The manual transmission offers that classic sports car experience -- it’s the ultimate driver-car connection, where you really feel like a part of the vehicle and can control it in ways you wouldn’t be able to with an automatic,"" he said. ""As long as there are still new internal combustion engine vehicles on the market, there will be an interest in manual transmissions.""

A manual transmission has been available in the Nissan Z since production of the sports car began in 1969. Nissan

The car community has been decrying the death of the manual transmission for nearly two decades, said Henry Catchpole, a longtime automotive journalist who now hosts videos for Hagerty. As more automakers allocate resources to building electric vehicles, drivers are choosing engagement over pure performance, he argued.

""People are reassessing what they want and are going back to analog cars. It's a big story in the industry,"" he told ABC News. ""There's a shift in terms of how we look at performance cars. We don't wax lyrical about paddle shifters as we do about manual gearboxes. Drivers are enjoying the manual again.""

Electric vehicles like the Porsche Taycan, Audi RS e-tron GT and Tesla Model S Plaid post performance numbers that few traditional supercars and sports cars can match. Straight-line acceleration and 0-60 mph times, however, may not matter to every motorist, said Bob Sorokanich, editor-in-chief of Jalopnik.

""Tesla has the quickest car on the market -- just floor the accelerator and hang on,"" he told ABC News. ""It doesn't take any driver skill.""

Automakers like Nissan, Toyota, Porsche and Honda are continuing to extol the manual transmission, he said, a ""last hurrah"" before the industry completely goes electric.

""It's inevitable EVs are going to take over and people are getting misty-eyed that the manual won't be around forever,"" he said. ""That's why people are flocking to these specialty cars. Young people are interested in the opportunity to experience them as internal combustion engines come to a close.""

When Toyota released the Supra sports car in 2020, enthusiasts had one objection: there was no manual gearbox. The automaker listened and decided to offer the 2023 GR Supra with a newly developed six-speed manual transmission that was engineered and tuned specifically for the coupe's straight-six engine. At least 25% of GR Supra sales are expected to be the manual, a company spokesperson said.

A manual transmission is available on the Supra 3.0 and 3.0 Premium models. Toyota

Then, to much acclaim, Toyota revealed the GR Corolla, a lightweight, vivacious hot hatch that meets every enthusiast's requirements. It's also built exclusively with a manual. Sorokanich expects Toyota to sell every one.

""The GR Corolla is meant for engagement,"" he said.

Lindsay Lee, a senior manager in vehicle marketing and communications for Toyota, said demand has been unprecedented for the GR Corolla.

""There is excitement in the market for a vehicle of this size with this amount of performance,"" she told ABC News.

The GR Corolla, the latest addition to Toyota's Gazoo Racing sports car family, is exclusively built with a manual transmission. Toyota

Porsche takes driver engagement so seriously that it offers 25 models with a manual transmission at no cost. Certain 911 models, like the Carrera T and GT3 with Touring Package, come standard with a manual gearbox.

""We see the highest degree of interest in manual transmissions on particularly enthusiast-focused variants such as the 718 Cayman/Boxster T, 718 Cayman GT4 and 718 Spyder or 911 GT3, where the manual take rate in the U.S. can reach 50% or more,"" a Porsche spokesperson told ABC News. ""We aim to offer the manual transmission as a choice as long as regulations permit.""

The take rate for a manual transmission in a Porsche can reach 50% or higher among U.S. buyers, according to the company. Three pedals are available in a 911 GT3. Porsche

Stephanie Brinley, an associate director at S &P Global Mobility, said recent market conditions have dictated what automakers build, leading to less investment in manual transmission technology.

""Automakers are faced with difficult choices and manuals are things that have been sacrificed in the last two years,"" she told ABC News.

Pleasing a dedicated group of owners who are willing to pay above MSRP for a niche product can, however, outweigh the costs, she noted.

""It's a niche space but sometimes customer loyalty is a reason to keep it going,"" she said. ""EVs are here and growing. They do have a different feel and level of engagement. For people who want that manual transmission connection, now is the time to grab one before they go away.""

BMW's head of M products confirmed that the German automaker would keep manuals around until the end of the decade. The S58 engine in the company's new M2 coupe can be paired with either a six-speed manual gearbox or a dynamic eight-speed M Steptronic transmission.

At the unveiling of the seventh-generation Ford Mustang in September, company executives touted the Blue Oval's commitment to the clutch pedal.

""Ford has saved the manual transmission for a new generation and the 5.0-liter V8 continues to offer a standard six-speed manual transmission for customers who want an uncompromised connection to eight-cylinder power,"" according to a company press release.

The Dearborn automaker has also seen sizable interest among manual buyers in its Ford Bronco 4X4, with the take rate topping 20%, according to Brinley.

Ford expanded its seven-speed manual transmission to the Sasquatch Package on 2022 Bronco two- and four-door models. Ford

Honda's latest Type R hatch is visually different from its predecessor, with an aggressive front bumper design, lower stance and a redesigned rear spoiler. What hasn't changed? A manual transmission. Honda's Civic Si, like the Type R, has been manual-only since its inception and the company sees ""consistent interest from enthusiasts who want the engaging driving experience that can only be had by shifting your own gears,"" according to a spokesperson. When Honda's Acura brand premiered the fifth-generation Integra in March, enthusiasts lauded the return of the manual.

""At launch, nearly 70% of the Integra preorders were for the manual transmission,"" the spokesperson said. ""Since then, the mix rate has leveled out, but we're still seeing high demand for the manual transmission, more than enough to justify its development.""

Catchpole said the unrelenting pressure on automakers to keep the manual alive has benefited an industry that's rapidly closing the door on gas-powered vehicles.

""Some people see manuals as a chore but they're not. They bring more color to life,"" he said. ""Porsche listened to enthusiasts and brought back the manual in the GT3. I hope other manufacturers will listen too.""",electric vehicles,abc news

The Nissan LEAF is well deserving of this honor after coming to the market more than a decade ago.

The LEAF not only set the standard for the entire vehicle industry, it is basically an iconic legend for the EV world. When Nissan introduced the LEAF electric vehicle 12 years ago, it was considered to be a bold and courageous strategy to branch out into electric vehicles.

“The Leaf turned 10 nearly two years ago, and the fact that it’s still on sale now shows how strong the initial design concept was. The Nissan LEAF should be commended for all it has done for EVs over its 12 years (so far). It’s a true legend,” said James Morris, Editor of WhichEV.

Since then, most vehicle manufacturers have introduced an electrified vehicle to their line-ups, but Nissan truly paved the way for electric vehicles with the LEAF at the forefront of the emerging EV transition.

Launched back in 2010, The LEAF was the first mass-produced and marketed electric vehicle in the world. Since Nissan launched the LEAF back in 2010 they have sold more than 605,000 cars globally and more than 56,000 just in the UK.

“For the past decade, the Europe region has been leading the switch to electrification. Our vision for the next decade is to accelerate this further, with new products and technologies that will transform the driving experience for Nissan customers,” said Guillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan AMIEO Region.

“Not only will we offer an electrified version for all of our passenger models in Europe, but our 360-degree vision for sustainable mobility will also bring 100% renewable electricity to our EV Hub in the UK and will see new battery refurbishment facilities introduced in Europe,” Nissan writes.

The LEAF has stood the test of time and is now in its third generation. It is still a fairly popular choice for EV enthusiasts, even if it doesn’t top sales charts any longer. It is practical, comfortable, and with zero tailpipe emissions, incredibly efficient even after a decade later.

The LEAF represents a pioneer in the mass-market EVs, and Nissan’s start in its electrification journey is a fantastic success story that remains incredibly popular for both new and used car buyers around the world.

As Nissan continues to invest in electrification and the future of mobility, the LEAF still plays an important part in Nissan’s electric lineup. Some of Nissan’s newer accomplishments in electrified technology are the e-POWER and e-4ORCE as well as their newest fully electric model, the ARIYA.

“Across Europe, we are targeting a 75% electrified sales mix by 2026 which indicates our ongoing commitment and focus on electric vehicles. We are proud to be at the forefront of electric mobility and this award highlights how significant LEAF’s role has been, not just to Nissan but the entire industry,” said Nic Thomas, Marketing Director, Nissan Motor (GB)

The LEAF is built in Britain at the UK’s Sunderland plant. Since the LEAF started production in 2011, staff at the Nissan Sunderland Plant have undergone more than two million hours of training dedicated to manufacturing electrified vehicles, with more planned in the coming months and years.

Alan Johnson, Nissan’s Vice President for Manufacturing in the UK, said: “Our plant is built on the foundations of 36 years of manufacturing excellence from our world-class people and advanced facilities. Two million hours of training just for electrification shows we are taking that to the next level, as we lead the charge towards an electrified future.

“And of course, we’ll continue to deliver brilliant, technologically advanced, cars to the high standards of quality that our customers have come to love.”

With a little forethought, know-how, and advance planning, makers with a DIY and community mindset are fantastically positioned to help themselves and others in extreme situations.

Subscribe to Make: for this and more projects and articles.

But which threats should we invest in preparing for? Risk is calculated by multiplying likelihood times consequences. Many small emergencies have minimal consequences, but happen frequently: power failures, network outages, even supply chain problems that limit our access to anything from food to fuel. On the other end of the spectrum are events that are less likely, but have dramatic impacts: disruptions that extend over a large area or last a long time, or rare catastrophic events like a tsunami, earthquake, or superstorm. The likelihood varies depending on your locality and situation.

It’s near-impossible to prepare for absolutely any event, so determining the most significant risks for you requires some research and thought. But whatever the risks, your best investment is usually to prepare to address your most basic needs — food, water, shelter, and security — under a range of scenarios.

Survival experts talk about the Rule of Threes: Humans can survive about 3 hours in extreme cold or heat, 3 days without water, and 3 weeks without food. These numbers provide a fundamental framework for preparedness. If you travel icy roads during northern winters, then having an emergency kit in your trunk with blankets and a candle heater are a must to avoid hypothermia. If you live in an earthquake zone, storing enough water for your family can be a necessity. If you’re someplace where food deliveries could be disrupted for a month, rotating food stocks is good sense.

The topic of “survivalism” is burdened with social and political issues that often distract from practical emergency preparedness. History shows that the best outcomes in disasters emerge from strong communities working together. So we see preparedness as something that’s most effective when done in conjunction with our neighbors. We will leave the topic of self-defense for other forums to discuss.

: To structure your planning, it’s helpful to consider some variables that will change how you prepare for events. At the highest level, these are: time, severity, motion, and inclusion.

TIME

How long is a disruption likely to last? It makes a big difference in how to prepare. Having food staples on hand is a great prep, but storing enough for a couple weeks is very different than for a year. Some skills, like rotating stocks so that you use the oldest first, are great for all plans, but worst-case scenarios can potentially change your target from “lots of cans” to “whole grain wheat stored in tubs with CO 2 to keep out bugs.” It’s comforting to think we can be prepared for any length of event, but doing so has a cost. Determining what works for your family, space, and budget is essential.

SEVERITY

How bad will it be? There’s a big difference between a municipality issuing a boil water notice and actually having the water pipes go dry. (Or, as happened in Texas recently, a boil water notice at the same time as natural gas being cut off to residences!) Simple prep might be having a couple gallons of water on hand plus containers to store boiled water. Extreme situations might force you to rely on local non-potable water sources, or on alternate fuels to boil water. Knowing how much water your group needs is important for planning for different severities.

MOTION

Where will you go? One of my favorite survival books is dedicated to “the people of Pompeii and Herculaneum who, to the jeers and insults of their neighbors, got packed in the night and left.” In many emergencies, sheltering in place isn’t an option. Planning for flight brings a very different set of considerations into play — even more so if some members of your group will flee while others remain in-place. Communication plans, predetermined rendezvous, and go-bags all become essential tools for situations where bugging out is the right answer.

INCLUSION

Who are you prepping for? Taking care of yourself is less complex than taking care of children, the elderly, disabled family members, or pets. Those of us lucky enough to be engaged in communities often feel compelled to include neighbors and friends in our planning. Accessibility, medications, even entertaining distractions for kids all become critical factors when planning for a larger group. Of course, in a group, considerably greater resources may be available. Planning with, not just for, a group is essential for the best outcomes.

At the highest level, resources like ready.gov are a great place to start exploring how to put together your personal preparedness plan. In addition, we’ve pulled together an array of resources, ideas, and know-how to help with your preparation.

: We take easy communication for granted, immersed in a rich spectrum of wireless transmissions, chatting internationally through laser beams under the ocean and satellites in orbit. But this incredible infrastructure can fail in any number of ways. Here are some infrastructure-free options to stay in touch.

FRS/GMRS RADIOS

Your first priority? Connecting with family and friends. FRS/GMRS radios have become the entry-level, local-area tool for this. FRS (Family Radio Service) is the evolution of walkie-talkies. GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) adds additional channels, can run at higher powers, and requires a single license for the whole family.

Old-school police scanners don’t work in most localities anymore due to conversions to frequency-hopping “trunking” radio systems. But for a fraction of the cost of a scanner with trunk-decoding, you can use two cheap SDR (software defined radio) modules to listen to most modern trunked emergency service radio traffic.

AMATEUR (HAM) RADIO

Amateur radio is the original emergency comms and still the most robust. But different setups are needed for local vs. long distance communications. Handheld VHF/UHF transceivers usable by entry-level Technician class hams are excellent for local line of sight comms, but they rely on repeaters for any significant distance — and those repeaters rely on the internet to talk to each other over regional or national levels. APRS packet radio for data forwarding and Digital Voice modes like DMR, System Fusion, and D-Start have the same limitation.

When it comes to long distance communications, HF radio (aka shortwave,) is the gold standard and can potentially circle the globe without repeaters. Using these bands in all but serious emergencies requires a General or Extra class license. Local comms are still possible on HF bands, but generally require special antenna configurations.

), but systems like theare starting to pop up as well, using ham radio to connect nodes. More info here and here

LEARN MORSE CODE!

Morse code (aka continuous wave or CW in the ham community) punches farther, with less power, under worse conditions, than any kind of voice technology. But actually using it is a bear if you don’t put in significant hours (months) learning it. Get expert help from the CW Academy.

Given the extremely robust nature of Morse/CW, it has become increasingly appealing to folks prepping for emergency comms. Morse coder/decoder devices like the PreppComm DMX-40 do the work for you. More info here

Having a generator is great, but only if it works when you need it. Learn how to:

• Store it properly so it’s ready for action.

• Do basic maintenance to keep your genny running.

• Clean the carb if you forgot to put fuel stabilizer in it.

• Plan for how big a generator you will need to replace utility power.

• And how much fuel.

• Dual-fueled generators that use gasoline and/or propane are becoming increasingly common and offer lots of flexibility. When run on propane, there’s no fuel in the carb that will gum up.

PORTABLE POWER STATIONS

DIY “power walls” — whole-house backup batteries like Tesla’s — are becoming very interesting. Keep in mind that these installations involve working with life-threatening (and house-burning) amounts of power; if you don’t know how to work with high power safely, then get an electrician involved. Don’t create a disaster prepping for a larger one! Check out:

Solar power is a great option, but it’s often challenging for folks to figure out how to use effectively. A solar power station requires more than just panels!

• To learn the basics, build Make:’s DIY 20-watt solar panel, then connect it to an AC inverter and battery management system.

• Enlighten yourself with Becky Stern’s free solar class.

• Check out Kurt Schulz’s mobile solar power station.

• Make an off-the-shelf solar USB battery rig to keep gadgets charged.

• Power your Raspberry Pi with the sun using PiJuice hats and solar panels.

• Build an easy solar phone charger on page 74 (“Solar Power On The Move”) in Make: Vol 83, a solar bottle lamp on page 44 (“My Solar Bottle Lamp”), and a solar perpetual weather station on page 82 (“Perpetual Battery-Free Weather Station”).

• Lend solar to your neighbors. Follow the modular Solar Library project at Burning Man (Figure L

Heat is often a waste product. Turn it into power — a 5V trickle charge — using the thermoelectric Peltier cell.

Climate chaos will create a tremendous range of needs for short- and long-term emergency response. Your local threats may be drought, hurricanes, fires, flooding, heat, cold, or any combination of those. Research what your area may be in for.

BUILD AN EMERGENCY KIT

Figure S

Scrambling to meet basic needs in the aftermath of an emergency is stressful and difficult. Advance preparation can make a tremendous difference. Putting together an emergency kit for your likely threats is a great investment (Figure S

). Kits can range from pocket sized to pantry sized, but generally include food and water, flashlight, radio, batteries, can opener, medications, local maps, and important documents. Sleeping bags and camping gear are handy too. Get your kit started here

GO BAGS

Like it sounds: a prepacked bag, usually day-pack sized, that you can grab on the go. “Go bags” or “bug-out bags” can be tailored for different emergencies, but generally contain snacks and water, clothes, flashlight, radio, matches, meds, cash, map, documents, maybe a tent or tarp — enough to travel a day or two and get somewhere safe. More info on Go bags here, here, here, and here.

TRAUMA KIT

Figure T

Most first aid kits offer minimal supplies for serious trauma. When the EMTs aren’t able to respond, knowing how to do emergency trauma response and having the supplies for it can mean the difference between life and death (Figure T

).

PARACORD ZIPPER PULL

Figure U

Handy and hardy, what’s more prepper than paracord (Figure U

)? Bracelet tutorials are everywhere but if that’s not your style, you can stash a foot or two of nylon cordage on any zipper, following Becky Stern’s

FLOODS AND RISING SEAS

The majority of the US population lives within 50 miles of a coast. They’ll be impacted by rising seas, storm surges, and displaced people if they don’t have to move themselves. Assess whether your area will be impacted by looking at flooding maps and tools that project sea level rise.

SUPER STORMS

Bags for sandbags are fantastic to keep on hand, as is boarding for windows and doors (which disappears from hardware stores fast in an emergency). Tape and tarps can keep broken window glass from spreading, but plywood or polycarb panels are needed to keep them from breaking at all.

DIY EMERGENCY SHELTERS

U.S. service members assigned to Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa and local villagers work on the final stages of the eco-dome here May 22. The project is part of an ongoing effort between CJTF-HOA, villagers, non-government organizations and international organizations over the past several months to provide a community building for Karatbi San, a remote village in the Tadjourah region of Djibouti. (Figure V)

Sandbags and barbed wire aren’t just tools of war. Earthbag homes (aka SuperAdobe) turn these items into DIY homes and shelters

(Figure V

).

Makers with access to CNC tooling should check out Shelter 2.0, digital fabrication for small temporary housing.

WILDFIRES

Figure W Figure X

Of course you’ve got N95 masks in your kit. But learning to manage vegetation around properties is critical for wildfires.

Air filtration, personal and household, is helpful in fire season. In a pinch you can build your own DIY room air filter from a box fan and a furnace filter (Figure

W).

If the fire is upon you, in most cases you’re at greater risk from the smoke than the flame. Emergency escape smoke hoods are extremely effective and easy to store (Figure X

).

HEAT WAVES

Figure Y

Before the predominance of air conditioning, swamp (evaporative) coolers were a common solution (Figure Y

). DIY swamp coolers are an easy build and can be battery or solar powered. More info here here , and here

DEEP FREEZES

Emergency heating often carries the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Build a DIY CO detector.

There’s no substitute for learning how to dress warmly in the first place (no cotton!)

And pack your winter car kit now!

: Many of the things we buy, we could probably do without (at least for a while). But food, drinking water, and fuel are essentials we need to plan alternatives for.

LONG HAUL FOOD STORAGE

• How much food to store per person? This calculator can help you figure out your needs.

• How to stock an apocalypse pantry

• Storing bulk staples requires preparation to keep out vermin. Learn to fill 5 gallon plastic tubs them with staple foods, and top them off with dry ice (CO 2 ) to flush out oxygen and keep out bugs.

• Many products are good well past their stated expiration date; learn how long is too long here and here.

PRESERVING FOOD

• Canning isn’t just something your grandmother did. It remains and effective and fun way to preserve food. livelytable.com/beginners-guide-to-canning

• Fermentation for food preservation isn’t just a great idea, it can actually increase the bioavailability of the nutrients in the food itself (Figure Z

). Try making yogurt, kraut, kimchi, kombucha, beer, wine, cider, sake, mead, even fermented hot sauce, all from Make: here here , and here

• An excellent guide to all this is Preservation by Christina Ward (Figure

Aa)

GROWING FOOD

Growing enough food to be completely self-sufficient is much more difficult than we might imagine. But that doesn’t mean a garden can’t make a huge difference in sustaining you. Some high yield/high nutrition crops can be surprisingly easy to grow.

• Potatoes aren’t just for castaways on Mars (hat tip to Andy Weir!)

• Square Foot Gardening is an amazingly simple and effective way to get the maximum output from the minimum space.

• Three Sisters “tangles” of corn, beans, and squash have a long history and can produce a complete nutritional protein.

WATER STORAGE

One gallon per person per day — it adds up fast. See page 94(“Get Barreled”) to learn about water storage and build your own 55gal drinking water drum.

WATER PURIFICATION

Figure Bb

While folks have different opinions, bleach and chemical purifiers are easy to use, very effective, and have long shelf lives. More info here

A rock/sand/charcoal filter (Figure Bb

) is very easy to make and can handle all but the worst biological offenders, turning your locally found water into something that requires minimal purification. Examples here and here

Use charcoal filtration as a first stage before a LifeStraw or other purification device, to make expensive devices last much longer. More info here.

Pasteurization is an overlooked but super useful method — use heat from the sun to purify water with radically less fuel than boiling.

Desalinization, i.e. removing the salt from seawater, is typically an energy intensive and industrial scale activity. Recent research and some new products are starting to make this tech viable for personal and family use. and Examples here and here.

MEDICAL SUPPLIES

Remember all those makerspaces 3D printing face shields and other PPE in 2020 when supply chains failed? Open Source Medical Supplies helped organize critical design information so that DIY PPE was safe and effective. They continue to help people prepare for the next crisis with 100+ open designs for masks, oximeters, and other devices, and links to local response groups.

MAKING FUEL

Household scale methane production is possible and done in some developing-world villages, but also requires preparation in advance.

If you’re ready for more challenges, there are also DIY refineries for making fuel oil from plastic, diesel from waste mineral oil, and ethanol from sugar.

PEDAL POWER!

You never forget how to ride a bike. Knowing how to maintain and repair bikes is a great skill for sustainability and emergencies. Recourses on bike maintenance here, here, and here.

BICYCLE CARGO TRAILER

NUCLEAR PREPAREDNESS

Governments and individuals have been planning and preparing for nuclear situations since the 1940s. Take advantage of their work. More info here and here.

Rebuild an Industrial Base

Many of the essential tools that underlie our society are shielded behind patent restrictions. But amazing work has been done to create open source designs that anyone can build.

• Open Source Ecology wants to help with open source blueprints for civilization.

• The Open Hardware Observatory is creating a clearing house for sustainable/off-grid projects.

However, the 3 Series G20 will be one of the exceptions because the seventh-generation model will have a longer shelf life. Originally, the current 3er was supposed to bow out in 2025, but sources within Munich are claiming it will stick around until sometime in 2027 or even 2028.

A new report from Car Magazine claims BMW intends to keep the 3 Series fresh and competitive by giving it a second Life Cycle Impulse. The LCI is believed to arrive around 2025 with design changes made to bring the car closer to the styling of the new i3 based on the Neue Klasse platform. Interestingly, the report goes on to say the Bavarians intend to make their combustion-engined cars look as close to the electric vehicles as possible even after the arrival of NE-based models.

That being said, logic tells us there will be some significant differences between the i3 Sedan and the 3 Series’ second LCI. Confirmed for 2025, Neue Klasse cars are going to be developed primarily with electric-only propulsion, which should reduce the front overhang and bring a longer wheelbase. In addition, aerodynamics will play a greater part, so expect sleeker side profiles with sloped rooflines to improve airflow.

We will get an idea of how Neue Klasse models are going to look as early as January 2023 when a new BMW Vision concept will premiere at CES in Las Vegas. Needless to say, the shape and proportions of the G20 3 Series won’t change with the second facelift, but some of the i3’s design cues will rub off on the gasoline and diesel 3er.

This alleged second facelift for the 3 Series won’t represent the beginning of the end for the conventionally powered model. BMW is well aware the world won’t be ready to switch to EVs in the foreseeable future and is rumored to be working on another CLAR-based generation with traditional engines.

Consequently, the G50 (G51 for the Touring) is slated to arrive around 2027 with a final family of ICEs. Depending on the decisions taken by local governments, BMW might decide to sell only the i3 in select markets while underdeveloped countries would still have more affordable four-cylinder 3 Series versions.

The Biden administration’s plans to boost manufacturing of electric vehicles may face a big bump in the road — and that bump is made of graphite. Both E&E News and Marketplace reported this week on how the coming electric vehicle revolution will supercharge the demand for the mineral.

Graphite is a crucial component of electric vehicle batteries, used to make the anode — the part of the battery that releases electrons. When compared with other minerals used to make other parts of the battery, graphite is the single largest mineral component in a battery by weight.

China is currently the top graphite producer globally and is responsible for nearly 80% of the world’s graphite supply. The U.S., on the other hand, hasn’t produced graphite domestically in decades; currently, only 1.2% of the world’s supply is mined in North America, with some production in Canada and Mexico. But the world’s 70 mines are about to get a lot busier: Analysts predict that increased demand for graphite as electric vehicle production rises could add more than 300 new mines around the world by 2035.

The Biden administration has been trying to prop up the coming EV revolution and encourage American supply chains in the process. The Inflation Reduction Act contains tax credits for consumers to buy EVs — but there are stipulations to the materials that go into those EVs. By 2028, only EVs made with minerals mined or processed in the U.S. or in countries with a trade agreement with the U.S. will be eligible for those credits. Chinese graphite does not fit that criteria; the U.S. clearly needs to find new sources of graphite, and soon.

Creating a domestic graphite supply is easier said than done. There are currently only two sites in the U.S. that are being developed for graphite mining. One of those is in Alaska, on a remote peninsula off the coast, where locals have expressed concern about an open-pit mine’s impact on wildlife and natural resources. The other possible site is in Alabama, where the potential mine would sit on sensitive waterways.

There are other options, including creating synthetic graphite. Unfortunately, synthetic graphite’s main feedstock is fossil fuels — coal and oil — and the process comes with polluting tradeoffs: There’re significantly more air pollutants involved in synthetic graphite production, while some experts estimate that the CO2 emissions involved could be up to eight times higher for synthetic graphite versus natural.

Analysts project that we will need an enormous increase in various minerals and other materials, from lithium to cobalt to graphite, to meet the world’s clean energy needs over the next few decades. This increase in demand for all types of minerals comes with significant challenges, from labour issues to environmental problems.

Some say that the environmental tradeoffs of creating mines for graphite and other minerals in environmentally sensitive areas are outweighed by the benefits they provide to the energy transition. Others say that mining companies must be careful when working with local communities in places where they plan to extract resources.

Alex Trembath, the deputy director of think tank the Breakthrough Institute, which describes itself as “ecomodernist,” told E&E that minerals companies should “align the global interests with their localised interests.”

“We’re in for decades of sorting through fundamentally messy, difficult conflicts,” he said. “Asserting the climate hawk logic … is not the skeleton key to unlock those conflicts.”",electric vehicles,gizmodo australia

Earlier in the year, Supernal unveiled an initial electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle, which the company hopes can be commercially launched in 2028. The five-seat cabin concept is actively looking for methods to integrate automotive capabilities for use in advanced air mobility.

Supernal has recently made a couple of announcements, finding new partners to help Hyundai develop something other than consumer cars. Supernal and Honeywell recently announced a partnership to use the Honeywell Anthem flight deck for the eVTOL - a custom cloud-based cockpit system. Anthem's software design has a noticeable focus on providing connectivity and autonomy.

Here is what Stephane Fymat, VP and GM of Urban Air Mobility and Unmanned Aerial Systems at Honeywell Aerospace, said in a press statement:

""Honeywell Anthem will change the way aircraft are piloted, and we believe that Supernal's aircraft will be a shining example of how aviation will evolve to be smarter and more sustainable. Honeywell has a wide variety of ready-now solutions to help create a more sustainable future for the aviation sector, and we're proud to be on this journey with Supernal.""

Hyundai's Supernal has several air-based projects currently underway, with the company expanding its efforts. During CES in 2020, Hyundai and Uber announced a project to explore how something like the Supernal S-A1 could be used to ferry passengers in the sky.

The $US65,975 2023 Transit Trail is Ford’s answer the #VanLife movement. It’s a mostly empty Transit van upgraded to meet the demands of a growing market of customers ranging from experienced vanning aficionados to the merely van-curious. The Transit Trail makes several small improvements to smooth out the journey (and destination) of turning an empty cargo van into a DIY RV, or even a full-time home.

To be clear, Ford isn’t selling you a ready-to-roll camper with the Transit Trail; you’ll still need to get yours upfitted with sleeping space, storage, toilets or even a kitchenette, either by yourself or via an aftermarket installer. Lucky for you, Ford has built a network of manufacturer-approved upfitters who specialise in turning your Transit Trail into anything you need it to be.

The upgrades over the standard Transit cargo van may seem minimal to those who aren’t steeped in the adventurous van lifestyle, but when your mode of transportation is also your workspace and bedroom, little changes can make a big difference. The Transit Trail has an additional 3.5 inches of ground clearance thanks to a 2.5-inch suspension lift and beefy 30.5-inch Goodyear Wrangler Workhorse tires, which should help make the Trail more capable in woodsy terrain. The vanlife van sits on new 16-inch alloy wheels that stick out further than your standard Transit van, widening the track by 2.75 inches for a more sure-footed stance, surrounded by black plastic splash guards and fender flares. Slider steps offer some rocker-panel protection and a place to hoist yourself inside.

Image: Ford Motor Company

The pre-production van Ford showed off to media had a pretty flimsy skid plate hung off the front bumper, but the automaker promised the production Transit Trail will come with tougher underside protection as well. Marker lamps and a black grille also grace the Trail, and set it apart from its workhorse sibling. All those extra tidbits, which would normally come from an aftermarket shop or the sweat of your own wrenching, come standard, approved to meet Ford’s durability and safety standards and covered by Ford’s three-year/36,000-mile warranty.

Image: Ford Motor Company

The interior is yours to imagine. The example Ford showed to journalists was outfitted by a company called VanDoIt near Ford’s assembly plant in Kansas City, Missouri. While you can’t buy a ready-to-sleep-in-it van directly from Ford, the Transit Trail will meet you halfway with the optional Upfitters Package, which provides easy electric power for interior and exterior accessories and includes high-capacity switches, an auxiliary fuse panel with interface connector, dual 12-volt AGM batteries, a 400-watt AC inverter, and a modification-friendly wiring harness. Optional dual alternators keep those batteries charged up, and standard built-in 4G/LTE WiFi can connect up to 10 devices. Drillable surfaces in the interior offer easy mounting points for things like cabinets, shelves or beds.

Image: Ford Motor Company

The entire point of the Trail is to make building a Class B motorhome accessible to newbies. For example, sawing into the roof of your brand-new, nearly $US70,000 ($97,174) van (and let’s be real, the dealer markups on this limited-market vehicle will likely be nuts) can be more than a little off-putting to a first-timer, so Ford is happy to cut you an opening for an air vent or roof-mount A/C unit straight from the factory. The rest of the van is a blank canvas: Ford put in two swivelling captain’s chairs up front, but other than those, the space is completely customisable — and empty.

Image: Ford Motor Company

Under the hood, you’ll find the familiar 310-horsepower, 3.5-litre EcoBoost V6 and 10-speed automatic transmission already powering Transits today. The Trail comes standard with all-wheel drive, and can tow up to 6,500 pounds worth of toys behind it, and will be available in medium-roof, high-roof, and high-roof extended-body configurations, the latter providing 467 cubic feet of space behind the seats.

Ford is already a powerhouse in the motorhome world: the automaker says 60 per cent of big-beast Class A motorhomes sold in the U.S. sit on Ford’s Pro F-53 chassis. But it’s the smaller, more versatile Class B rigs, based on vehicles like the Transit Trail, that are selling like hotcakes right now. A Transit van that takes a little of the intimidating guesswork out of serious overlanding or vanlife conversions should sell even hotter. Transit Trail orders should open this week, with deliveries planned for sometime in spring of 2023.",electric vehicles,gizmodo australia

Electric vehicles (EVs) – including E-bikes – have been associated with battery fires, fires that are difficult to extinguish, investigations, and recalls due to fires (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). In fact, even flooded EVs have been spontaneously igniting!

Other issues associated with EVs include:

A survey published in July revealed that many Americans are still not interested in owning or leasing EVs due to high costs (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and, of course, other concerns. Nevertheless, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced that it will provide $965M for American school districts to buy electric buses to transport students. E-gads!

All Aboard: Hundreds of School Districts Funded for E-Buses

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the recipients of its Clean School Bus program last week, awarding 389 school districts some $965 million toward the purchase of more than 2,400 school buses.

Skip Descant

School districts across the nation will soon begin transitioning at least part of their bus fleets toward electrification and other forms of cleaner energy.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the recipients of its Clean School Bus program last week, awarding 389 school districts some $965 million toward the purchase of more than 2,400 school buses.

“This program will improve air quality in and around schools and communities. It will reduce greenhouse gas pollution. And it will also protect our childrens’ health,” said Daniel Blackman, Region 4 administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, speaking in Orangeburg, S.C., on Nov. 1. The Orangeburg Consolidated School District was awarded $6.32 million, which will help fund 16 e-buses.

“When you think of the transformative opportunity this does for especially rural communities that have been left out of the conversation, this is a great day for South Carolina,” said Blackman.

The funding announced by the EPA is part of the more than $1 trillion infrastructure law, passed in Congress last year. This year’s awards mark the first $1 billion of a five-year and $5 billion plan to transition school buses away from internal combustion engines. A similar initiative is afoot for transit buses.

South Carolina will receive some $58 million to go toward school bus transitions, with $25 million of this money going into the Sixth Congressional District, home to Orangeburg, a largely rural area.

“This grant was written to target resources into communities in need,” said Rep. James Clyburn, the longtime Democratic congressman from South Carolina.

The 8,300-student Orangeburg school district has a fleet of 189 buses which travel some 1.3 million miles annually across the county covering 1,200 square miles, said Shawn Foster, superintendent of education for the Orangeburg Consolidated School District.

The 16 e-buses to come from the current grant, plus four previously acquired new e-buses will bring the total to 20.

“With the addition of these buses, less than 10 percent of our total bus fleet will be older than nine years,” Foster told reporters at the press conference, noting 76 percent of the fleet will be five years or younger. “That’s a tremendous accomplishment.”

The 16 buses to be bought by Orangeburg can expect to see a lifetime emissions reduction of 6,000 tons of carbon dioxide, said Blackman. And the annual savings in diesel fuel will be roughly $1 million, for the 148 e-buses to be rolling across the Palmetto State.

It’s not just buses in South Carolina making the switch to electric. The Peak to Peak Charter School, in the Boulder Valley School District in Colorado recently announced a transition to an all electric fleet through a partnership with Highland Electric Fleets, which provides a subscription-like service that includes buses, financing and servicing as part of a 10-year contract.

“Without the expertise of Highland Electric Fleets, Peak to Peak would not have been able to build an electric bus fleet from the ground up,” said Sam Todd, executive director of operations at Peak to Peak Charter School, in a statement. “Their knowledge of this new electric bus frontier and available grants make the program affordable. It is a dream come true for our school and our students.”

Highland signed a similar deal last year with the Montgomery County Public Schools district in Maryland, a district that operates some 1,400 school buses. And most recently, Highland announced a new partnership with CPower Energy to use the buses — which are essentially large mobile energy storage units — to aid in electric grid stabilization.

Electric buses have often been touted for not only their operational cost savings and zero emissions, but also the role they can play in vehicle-to-grid use cases.

“I think we’re really excited about the potential for growth in this market and we see a lot of potential in the future,” said Claire McConnell, vice president of strategic partnerships at Proterra Inc. The company is a maker of the batteries used by a number of buses, particularly those made by Thomas Built Buses.

Within the past few weeks, the company has been prepping an application for expansion and is beginning to clear local pine forests for the project.

Tesla started clearing forests around its gigafactory in Grünheide, Germany, over the past few weeks, as reported by Bloomberg. This stage of deforestation will remove pine trees over about 173 acres (70 hectares) of currently forested area, and Tesla says it has already begun taking the necessary steps for species and forest protective measures.

A Tesla spokesperson said that the expansion will increase storage and logistics space at Gigafactory Berlin, and it’s currently working on an application for the addition. Brandenburg Economy Minister Jörg Steinbach responded positively to the news, emphasizing the benefit Tesla’s plant has offered to the German state by being its largest industrial employer.

“I am pleased that Tesla will proceed,” said Steinbach in the tweet. “This is a good sign: Tesla is focusing on Brandenburg. Our country is developing into a place of modern mobility. As already the largest industrial employer and trainer in Brandenburg, Tesla has played a decisive role in this.”

Tesla said in the past it hopes to create a freight station, stockpile, and warehouse to boost rail links and part storage. In past reports, the automaker expressed interest in expansion plans of up to 247 hectares (100 hectares), though it’s unclear how long the plans could take.

In the past, Tesla struggled with local regulatory authorities and environmental groups in Germany during factory construction. Tesla even called delays “irritating.” So, expansion of the project may come as a relief and encouragement to some onlookers.

The automaker has been gradually ramping up production at Giga Berlin since it debuted its first production vehicles in March. Over the summer, the factory reached 1,000 Model Y units produced per week, and it’s aiming to reach 5,000 cars in a week by Q1 2023.

The news also comes just a few weeks after the Tesla Model Y surpassed the Volkswagen Golf to become Germany’s top-selling vehicle in September. Tesla had 9,846 registrations of the Model Y in September, ahead of the German company’s VW Golf with just 7,095 registrations, according to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) (via German outlet Heise).

With Tesla’s continued growth in Germany, it’s only fitting that the automaker would get ahead of addition plans to the factory. And with increased production already on the horizon amidst increasing competition for electric vehicles, the automaker could be in a good position to take on the rest of the German auto market.

Holon uses its autonomous experience and aims to transition that into efficient mobility solutions. One example is the electric autonomous people mover concept shown off in 2021. The people mover is built on the Benteler electric drive system that provides autonomous driving and battery pack modules designed for fast charging and extended life.

Intel's Mobileye will develop self-driving software for the mover, with mobility provider Beep developing mobility service OS solutions.

Even though electric vehicles have fewer physical parts, that doesn't mean production suddenly becomes easier - the design and manufacturing remain a major problem for automakers. Supply chain issues and semiconductor shortages revealed potential bottlenecks that manufacturers will need to solve.

As said by Marco Kollmeier, managing director of the Holon project, in a press statement:

""Autonomous movers are an essential part of tomorrow's mobility - emission-free, comfortable, reliable and, above all, inclusive. HOLON will be the first OEM for autonomous movers with the standards and scaling potential we know from the automotive industry. With our platform technology, our vehicle expertise, and our strong partner network, it's our goal to redefine passenger transport - in both the public and private sectors.""

If everything goes according to plan, the unique vehicle will start production in the United States in 2025. Before then, Benteler will show off its Holon autonomous mover during the CES 2023 show in Las Vegas.",electric vehicles,tweaktown

Flashbacks, before the midterms loomed large in what’s left of Joe’s brain:

● Biden praises high gas prices as part of ‘incredible transition’ of the US economy away from fossil fuels.

● Biden seeks to make half of new U.S. auto fleet electric by 2030.

● Biden last year: “We will take, literally, millions of automobiles off the road — off the road, saving tens of millions of barrels of oil, dealing with cleaning up the air. This is not hyperbole; this is a fact.”

● Granholm: California’s New Gas Vehicle Sale Ban ‘Could Be’ a National Model. “Elex Michaelson [of Los Angeles’ Fox affiliate] asked [Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm], ‘California made national headlines by becoming the first state to say, by 2035, we’re not going to have any gas-powered vehicles that are new that are being sold. You can still drive your old ones, but you can’t sell new ones. Do you like this concept?’ Granholm responded, ‘Yeah, I do. I think California really is leaning in. And of course, the federal government has a goal of — the president has announced — by 2030 that half of the vehicles in the U.S., the new ones sold would be electric.’”

● Kinsley Gaffe: State Dept. official slammed for saying he prefers high gas prices.

● Buttigieg Whines About Americans Not Wanting Electric Cars.

● Pete Buttigieg blasted for touting ‘benefit’ for electric vehicle owners from ‘pain’ of high gas prices.

And all of the games with gas prices:

Earlier: Biden: Releasing 15 Million More Barrels of Oil Reserves Right Before Election ‘Not Politically Motivated at All!’

More malarkey: “Let’s debunk some myths: My administration has not stopped or slowed U.S. oil production.”

Joe Biden, it’s time to meet Joe Biden!

● Biden’s plan to cancel Keystone pipeline signals a rocky start with Canada.

—The Washington Post, January 19th, 2021.

● Success: Biden Gets the High Gas Prices He Promised.

—The Pipeline, June 17th.

● Biden pulls 3 offshore oil lease sales, curbing new drilling this year.

● Biden administration won’t appeal judge’s ruling revoking Gulf of Mexico drilling leases.

—The Washington Post, February 28th.

Flashbacks: Why Aren’t Democrats Dancing for Joy About Sky-High Gas Prices?

In the service of reducing carbon emissions, Democrats have long openly worked to raise the price of fossil fuel energy. They have done so by proposing carbon taxes, cap-and-trade schemes, higher leasing fees, and other measures to jack up costs so people burn less of it. This is why Barack Obama said, in answer to a related question about electricity, that his energy plan would make prices “necessarily skyrocket.” This is why Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna praised BP’s CEO less than six months ago for pledging to reduce oil and gas production by 40% by 2030. Reductions in oil production and rising gasoline prices are part of the Democrats’ agenda and the Paris climate agenda. There’s even more to it than that. Over the past decade, the Democrats’ overt hostility toward fossil fuels has even driven companies in the industry to sideline production, purely for public relations purposes, while prioritizing meaningless, politically correct carbon emissions goals. How can Democrats suddenly feign outrage at their incredible success in influencing the industry? Is it a mystery why Democrats aren’t doing a sack dance and celebrating the salvation of planet earth? There’s the small matter of their political survival, of course. It would be unseemly — like doing a jig at an Irish funeral — to celebrate other people’s pain. And it would cost many Democrats who are secretly jubilant about high gas prices their political careers. Instead, Democrats are pretending to look for a way to “ease consumers’ pain.”

In September of 2019, after CNN’s seven hour “climate change town hall,” Bryan Preston wrote, “Seriously, if you see all of the above — which is just a sample — and vote for any of these people for any office at any level, it’s on you. If you like Venezuela, voting for any of them will bring you a whole lot of Venezuela.”

And as Kate of Small Dead Animals wrote after the CNN horror show, “Don’t make the mistake of thinking they don’t mean it.”

● Aren’t California’s High Gas Prices What The Left Have Wanted?

● NBC, the Washington Post, and the New York Times in lockstep call for higher gas taxes.

● 2008 L.A. Times headline: “The joy of $8 gas.”

● “Under my plan, energy costs will necessarily skyrocket…”

In other words, Obama administration retreads are following the same playbook as the original Obama administration: “We’re going to keep at it to ensure the American people are paying their fair share for gas,” is the perfect Kinsley Gaffe for an Obama administration retread like Biden: As Steven Chu, Obama’s then-incoming energy secretary, told the Wall Street Journal in the fall of 2008: “Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.”

So despite Biden claiming today that high gas prices are Putin’s fault, is it fair to ask if Biden is on the payroll of Putin? As Walter Russell Mead wrote in 2017:

If Trump were the Manchurian candidate that people keep wanting to believe that he is, here are some of the things he’d be doing: Limiting fracking as much as he possibly could

Blocking oil and gas pipelines

Opening negotiations for major nuclear arms reductions

Cutting U.S. military spending

Trying to tamp down tensions with Russia’s ally Iran.

“Yep,” Glenn added in late 2019. “You know who did do these things? Obama. You know who supports these things now? Democrats.”

● Americans Need To Pay More for Gas To Defend ‘Liberal World Order.’

● Team Biden might be purposefully grinding down the middle class.

● The ‘cabal’ that bragged of foisting Joe Biden on us must answer for his failed presidency.

An innovation called vehicle-to-grid technology, or V2G, lets EVs supply electricity to the grid in times of need, but it's still in early stages.

Someday, EVs could store large amounts of energy and help the US shift to renewable energy sources.

As the US speeds toward a future filled with electric vehicles, it's reasonable to wonder how much more demand the power grid can take. After all, during a recent heatwave, California's grid operator urged customers to limit charging their cars to avoid blackouts.

However, energy and transportation experts say that with some planning, utilities are fully capable of handling more clean cars plugging in. Better yet, electric SUVs, trucks, and buses can strengthen the grid if deployed smartly.

EVs can store energy for when it's needed most

When electric cars are parked (which is most of the time), their batteries can collectively become a valuable asset to the greater grid, experts say.

Someday, millions of vehicles could use special bidirectional chargers to absorb energy when it's plentiful and release it back to the grid as needed, helping utilities manage heatwaves and other spikes in demand. This vision rests on something called vehicle-to-grid technology, or V2G.

Experts like Matthias Preindl, an electrical engineering professor at Columbia University, also anticipate that V2G could help wean the country off dirty energy sources. Solar and wind power are intermittent, so turning the lights on when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing requires storing energy for later. Electric cars could do just that, he said.

""If we want to go to 100% renewables, which is now the target of many states, that requires a lot of batteries,"" Preindl told Insider. ""And cars seem to be the only really viable solution at the moment.""

If much of the US fleet goes electric, the amount of battery storage available is enormous: The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that the 14 million EVs expected to be on California's roads by 2035 could power all the state's homes for three days.

There's a long road ahead

Although V2G is already being implemented in limited ways (mainly through pilot programs), there are hurdles to the technology going mainstream.

For regular EV owners to supply energy to the grid on a large scale, automakers, charging firms, and utilities will need to standardize the process, Andrew Meintz, a chief engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told Insider. Participants will also need to get paid by utilities for their contributions, he said.

A more feasible use case for V2G in the short term could be with large fleets, Meintz said. Amazon, for example, has the money and sway to work with utilities, vehicle makers, and charging companies to iron out the kinks.

EVs are already helping out the grid on a small scale

Highland Electric Fleets, which provides electric buses and charging infrastructure to school districts, has experimented with V2G as another revenue source since 2021. This summer, its two V2G-enabled school buses in Massachusetts pushed power to the grid almost daily to help the local utility handle periods of high energy consumption, Sean Leach, the firm's director of technology, told Insider. It's planning more extensive V2G projects in Vermont, Maryland, and elsewhere.

""At the end of the day, let's use these buses for what they can do. These batteries are huge. They spend a lot of time not doing anything because the routes are very predictable for schools,"" Leach said. Right now, the firm gets emailed requests to offload energy, but it's working to automate things.

It'll take a lot of work before we see millions of EVs seamlessly assisting the larger grid. But some vehicles can already share energy locally in useful and interesting ways. Ford's F-150 Lightning pickup can provide emergency backup power to customers' homes, so long as they have the right at-home charger. Upcoming trucks from General Motors promise to do the same.

Edward J. Klock-McCook, a principal at the sustainability think tank RMI, told Insider that if it becomes popular enough, this sort of capability could benefit the grid much in the same way that a full-blown V2G future would. Armed with the big batteries in their Lightnings and Chevrolet Silverado EVs, homeowners could supply their own electricity during blackouts or when the grid is stressed.",electric vehicles,business insider

Musk’s detractors, who worry the platform may become overrun with bigots and bad-faith actors, criticized the CEO well before he acquired the platform. The magnate has drawn controversy for various actions ranging from his polarizing tweets to reopening a Tesla factory in violation of public health mandates.

Still, others admire his business achievements. For instance, Musk recently garnered praise from Fred Krupp, the CEO of the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental advocacy nonprofit.

“He's a visionary,” Krupp asserted on a recent episode of Influencers with Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer. “And I think it's impossible not to give him credit for demonstrating the fact that electric vehicles can be extremely desirable, again, forgetting about the environmental or climate benefits.”

With a market cap of roughly $655 billion, Tesla is the world’s most valuable car company. Besides being among the first companies to popularize electric vehicles, Tesla has also changed the auto business more broadly. For instance, Tesla was the first company to offer direct-to-customer sales, an idea adopted by companies like Rivian and most recently BMW. The EV maker was also the first to allow customers to order their cars online.

“You know, he caused a revolution in the auto industry,” Krupp stated. “There's no two ways about it.”

Krupp knows Musk not only as an admirer but a collaborator in the fight against climate change. Musk’s space company, SpaceX is playing a key role in the MethaneSAT mission operated by the New Zealand Space Agency and the Environmental Defense Fund.

In 2023, SpaceX will launch the MethaneSAT satellite with a Falcon 9 rocket. Once in the earth’s orbit, the satellite will relay greenhouse gas emissions data to the public, allowing them to monitor global methane production in particular.

Story continues

“One satellite will be able to look at every major oil and gas installation around the globe, multiple times a week,” Krupp explained. “And so it will give us real-time information that we're going to make available for free.”

Researchers have found that methane represents a serious threat to the environment. The chemical compound is 25 times more potent at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. It also accounts for roughly 20% of global emissions, which cause climate change.

The oil and gas industry drives the majority of methane emissions, generating 80 million tons of methane every year. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, tracking the industry’s emissions usually takes weeks. But once the MethaneSAT reaches orbit, the process will take just days.

“I think that sort of transparency and accountability represents the best of the Environmental Defense Fund working with companies where we're cooperative,” Krupp remarked. “We're trying to inspire them to do better, but we're also holding them accountable for results.”

The Environmental Defense Fund, which was founded in 1967, has 1,000 staff members in 19 countries. Fred Krupp has been the president of the nonprofit since 1984. He holds a Bachelor’s degree and Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan.

290,indie Semiconductor: Small AutoTech Player With Multiple Growth Tailwinds,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1369570783/image_1369570783.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,06/11/2022,indie Semiconductor has a long runway for growth and will likely turn profitable in the later half of 2023. See why I'm bullish on INDI stock.,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4554004-indie-semiconductor-small-autotech-player-multiple-tailwinds,"Devrimb/iStock via Getty Images

I have been on the hunt for small cap companies which could be potential multi-bagger in the decade to come and I think that I may be onto something with AutoTech semiconductor company indie Semiconductor (NASDAQ:INDI).

Investment thesis

I think that there are many reasons to like indie Semiconductor. The company will continue to gain share in the AutoTech semiconductor space as it continues to bring innovative products into the market, while there are strong industry tailwinds like the electrification and autonomous vehicles revolution that will bring content spend and volumes up. I also like that the co-founders of the company are still in the company and involved in the day-to-day running of the company. Lastly, it has a strong strategic backlog that provides visibility into the future growth potential of the company and this backlog will be updated in the next quarter, bringing an additional near-term catalyst. Last but not least, with the unfavorable sentiment around unprofitable companies, indie Semiconductor is one of the few fast-growing companies with strong growth potential as well as a sight on near-term profitability.

Overview

indie Semiconductor focuses on providing its customers with the automotive semiconductors as well as software needed for various applications, including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (“ADAS”), User Experience and Electrification.

The company mainly focuses on edge sensors that helps to improve the core safety systems for the next generation of vehicles like autonomous vehicles as well as electric vehicles, and to enhance the customer's in-vehicle experience.

The main go-to-market strategy of indie Semiconductor is to collaborate with its key customers as well as partner more than 10 Tier 1s for product development. The company is an approved vendor to Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and it has already shipped a cumulative 140 million semiconductor products since the beginning. indie Semiconductor has a differentiated portfolio that integrates the team's strong expertise in technology as well as skills in designing cutting edge capabilities to bring able innovative automotive products and software to its customers. In addition, the company meets tough quality standards of more than 20 international automotive players that are its customers today, and with a global presence, the company also provides its innovative semiconductor products and software solutions to customers from all over the world.

Run by founders

I like companies that are run by founders as these companies tend to have better long-term strategy and increased motivation to drive shareholder value. Out of the 5 executive officers in the company, 3 of them are the co-founders of indie Semiconductor. Donald McClymont serves as the CEO, Dr. Ichiro Aoki serves as the President and Dr. Scott Kee serves as the Chief Technology Officer, and all 3 of them were the co-founders of indie Semiconductor. Similarly, before founding indie Semiconductor, all 3 of them were from Axiom Microdevices, which was later acquired by Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).

Expanding addressable markets

indie Semiconductor has a growing and expanding addressable market that is growing at a 13% CAGR. Its 3 main addressable markets that it serves are Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (""ADAS""), User Experience and Electrification.

Total addressable market for indie Semiconductor (indie Semiconductor IR)

In addition, the silicon content in each vehicle is also increasing rapidly given the increasing electrification and improving user experience in the vehicle. As a result, it is expected that the $700 per vehicle spend on silicon content will increase to $1100 per vehicle spend on silicon content in the near term, with an ultimate $7000 per vehicle spend in the longer term on more luxury vehicles.

Huge strategic backlog positioned for growth

As of last fall, the company disclosed that they have a strategic backlog of $2.6 billion. For perspective, in the prior 2Q22 results, indie Semiconductor generated $26 million in revenues. This backlog represents approximately 100 times that of 2Q22's revenues.

In addition, we have to take into account the fact that the strategic backlog was from 1 year ago and in the upcoming 3Q22 results, I would expect management to disclose the strategic backlog figures for the year. In my view, the increase will be significant given the larger sales channels that the company has created, and the design wins that management has mentioned in the recent earnings calls. As such, I think that the announcement of its newest strategic backlog numbers will be a key catalyst for the stock in the near term.

For example, in Japan and Korea, indie Semiconductor recently developed a strategic presence and had major design wins with large Korean and Japanese auto manufacturers like Honda (HMC) and Hyundai Kia.

Solid financials with profitability in sight

indie Semiconductor has a strong growth profile while also having a focus on the bottom line. In the most recent quarter, indie Semiconductor revenue grew by 181% year on year, while posting gross margins of 48.6%, which improved by 650 basis points year on year.

Management remains confident that their current progress will enable the company to reach profitability in the second half of 2023. The eventual goal in 2025 is for the company to reach 60% gross margins and 30% operating margins. This implies significant improvement in margin expansion and cost structure improvement as the company continues to grow quickly.

To achieve the profitability target that management has set, the company's revenues need to double from 3Q22 till the next year. Management remains confident that they are able to execute according to their plan as they have already doubled revenues twice and with the strong backlog visibility, they are confident at 2023 revenues reaching the required levels.

Overall, with the strong pipeline of design wins, the company has shown that they have the ability to scale and expand quickly while improving operating leverage to ensure that gross margins continue to expand with increased revenue growth.

Competition

There is no doubt that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive, especially so for automotive applications given the higher growth rates. That said, management commented that the consolidation in the semiconductor industry has resulted in a perfect opportunity for indie Semiconductor as the company currently has fewer viable competitors fighting for market share and the consolidated market creates opportunities for the company as customers look to diversify supply sources.

Some of the semiconductor competitors that focus on automotive applications are companies like Infineon (OTCQX:IFNNY), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), amongst others.

The main risk for indie Semiconductor is the sheer number of financial resources these competitors have compared to the company and some of these competitors have a more diversified and wider range of products given their wider end market focus.

That said, indie Semiconductor is well positioned to take share from the market given their strong technical and design expertise as well as its solid list of Tier 1 automotive suppliers.

Valuation

Given that the company currently does not generate any earnings yet, I use an equal weight of the DCF method and EV/Sales method to derive a 1-year target price for indie Semiconductor.

indie Semiconductor currently trades at 4x FY2023F revenues and 2.5x FY2024F revenues. I expect that the company will generate positive EPS by FY2024, with current prices reflecting a 15x FY2024F P/E. I expect top-line revenue growth of 70% on average from FY2023 to FY2025F, with earnings growth to accelerate in FY2024F as the company turns profitable. The assumptions I made for the revenue forecasts are based on the addressable market growth as well as current backlog numbers. These are conservative in my view as I have not yet taken into account any outperformance by indie Semiconductor in the form of market share gains. I assume a 1-year forward EV/Sales of 7x given the strong revenue CAGR expected in the next 3 years, while assuming a terminal P/E multiple of 20x and discount rate of 12%. Given that for peers growing at a 70% CAGR in the next 3 years are trading at around 7x EV/Sales, I think that the multiple is fair given the fundamentals about indie Semiconductor discussed earlier. My 1-year target price for indie Semiconductor is $14.80, implying 93% upside from current levels.

Risks

Competition

As a small player in the AutoTech semiconductor industry, it is up against competitors with large financial resources that could easily invest more into research and development compared to indie Semiconductor, which would erode the company's competitive advantage and result in potential market share losses. As a result, competition is the largest risk to the investment thesis as future growth will hinge on whether the company is able to innovate and stay relevant in a fast-changing semiconductor industry. If this risk materializes, the company may face slower growth or even declining revenues and a weaker margin profile.

Capital risks

While I am of the opinion that the company has sufficient liquidity and can meet its current capital requirements, it may seek to raise additional capital to take advantage of opportunities to acquire new businesses that complement its current business or to expand into new lines of business. There is a risk that the efforts to raise this additional capital are dilutive to shareholders.

Cyclical nature of semiconductor industry

As a result of the nature of the semiconductor industry, it tends to be highly cyclical. This is especially so during periods of economic weakness, where the semiconductor industry will experience a downturn, leading to lower demand, increasing inventory levels, oversupply and a deterioration in the industry dynamics as industry players may have to reduce selling prices. This will no doubt affect indie Semiconductor given that the company is in the industry and as such, the cyclical nature of the industry brings about potential downside risks.

Automotive industry risk

Since the company is a pureplay on automotive applications for the semiconductor industry, this brings about a risk that if the automotive industry were to slow down materially, the company may be affected adversely given the concentration in the sector.

Conclusion

indie Semiconductor is well positioned for strong growth in the future as it is gaining share in the AutoTech semiconductor space, with strong tailwinds from the electrification and autonomous vehicles revolution, driving both volume and content spend up. The company is managed by executives who are co-founders of the company and have been running the company since day 1. The company has a large strategic backlog that was last updated one year ago and will serve as a catalyst in the next quarter results. Lastly, it is one of the rare AutoTech semiconductor players with strong visibility on both growth and near-term profitability. My 1-year target price for indie Semiconductor is $14.80, implying 93% upside from current levels.

291,Where the Environment Is on the Ballot — And Where It’s Not,https://truthout.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1241754962-1200x675.jpg,06/11/2022,"Voters in New York and California will decide on environmental issues this November, and there's a lot at stake.",https://therevelator.org/environment-ballot-2022/,"In a stark contrast to recent election years, voters in just two states will decide on environmental issues this November. But there’s still a lot at stake.

Every election year a handful of statewide ballot initiatives carry high stakes for the environment. In 2020 there were four major ones, including Colorado’s Proposition 114 requiring a plan for the reintroduction of gray wolves. There were even more in 2018, including battles in Nevada and Arizona over how much renewable energy to require from utilities, while Florida debated an offshore-drilling ban.

This year the biggest story about environmental ballot initiatives is that there are only two.

Cost could be one reason.

“Typically initiatives are brought to the people because a policy can’t make it through the legislature,” says Nick Abraham, state communications director of the League of Conservation Voters. “But it’s extremely expensive and difficult to run a ballot initiative campaign, to not only get the signatures necessary but also to win at the ballot.”

Recent state wins on environmental issues and more action in Congress may have played a role, too.

“There’s much more work to do, to be sure, but I think often initiatives come out of frustration with the process,” says Abraham. “As more progress is made with lawmakers, people need initiatives less and less.”

This year just New York and California voters will take up environmental issues with ballot initiatives — but both could pack a big punch.

Transformational Funding for the Empire State

In New York, legislators hope their ballot initiative will put a lot of money on the line.

The Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act of 2022 would allow the state to sell bonds to fund $4.2 billion for environmental improvements that, according to the proposal, would “preserve, enhance, and restore New York’s natural resources and reduce the impact of climate change.”

That includes $1.5 billion for climate change mitigation, $1.1 billion for restoration and flood risk reduction, $650 million for open space conservation and recreation, and $650 million for water quality in resiliency infrastructure. More than one-third would also be earmarked to support disadvantaged communities.

In New York ballot initiatives need to be advanced by the state legislature before they can go to voters. This effort initially began with then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2020 as a $3 billion bond, which was supported by the legislature. But it was withdrawn from the ballot that year because of economic concerns during the pandemic.

In April 2021 the legislature again passed the measure, but incoming Gov. Kathy Hochul asked legislators to add an additional $1 billion. In April 2022 the legislature cleared the way for $4.2 billion in the budget for the bond, which will now go before voters.

“It’s been a generation since we’ve done an environmental bond act,” says Julie Tighe, president of New York League of Conservation Voters, which has been advocating for the effort. If passed, it would represent “the largest investment the state of New York has ever made in the environment in a single tranche.” It would help fund electric school buses, the removal of lead pipes from communities, and addressing water contaminants, like PFAS and 1,4 dioxane, which can cause cancer risks.

The initiative is estimated to generate 100,000 jobs and an additional $4 billion in economic activity as both federal and local revenue will be leveraged for projects, too, she says.

“We’re really excited about helping to jumpstart this transition to protect our communities and make sure our infrastructure is in good shape,” Tighe adds.

Clean Cars in California

On the other side of the country, California voters will decide the fate of Proposition 30, the Tax on Income Above $2 Million for Zero-Emissions Vehicles and Wildfire Prevention Initiative, on the ballot following a push by a coalition of businesses and environmental groups.

That initiative, which unlike New York’s doesn’t need prior legislative support, would apply increased tax revenues from high-income earners toward funding zero-emissions vehicles, charging stations and related infrastructure, as well as training and hiring wildlife firefighters.

It’s needed to help combat climate change and its direct effects, says Oscar Garcia, the ballot initiative coordinator of California Environmental Voters, one of the groups supporting the proposition. It’s also needed, he says, to equitably meet the state’s new directive to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars and light trucks by 2035. That’s because half of the funds designated for vehicle and infrastructure investments in the ballot initiative will aid disadvantaged communities.

The initiative has been heavily financed by the rideshare company Lyft, which has tossed in $25 million in hopes of its passage.

In a break with his party, Gov. Gavin Newsom has come out against Prop 30, saying that rideshare companies like Lyft are using public tax money to help meet their own state mandate to have 90% of their miles driven in electric cars by 2030. He called it “one company’s cynical scheme to grab a huge taxpayer-funded subsidy.”

Rideshare companies don’t own passenger fleets themselves and won’t directly benefit from the proposition, says Garcia.

“We need a dedicated revenue source like Prop 30 to make headway in an equitable and fair way,” he says. “And this initiative goes toward combating catastrophic wildfires, bringing charging infrastructure into low-income communities, and to people who need vehicle rebates and subsidies to afford the transition to zero-emissions vehicles.”

“The more charging points and stations out there the less that will be an issue,” he said.

Chargehound is piggybacking off another business which the group runs called Parkhound, which has 50,000 parking locations around Australia, including all of the major cities.

Electric vehicle owners are able to search on Parkhound for privately owned parking spaces that also have charging facilities. Mr Griffin said owners of those spaces would put an extra fee in place rather than try to work out how much electricity was being used for a specific charge. Parkhound has 200,000 drivers on its platform.

Mr Griffin said some EVs can take up to 20 hours to fully charge via a standard power socket, and so there was a clear shift towards fast chargers.

Parkhound and Chargehound are owned by Spacer Technologies, which in 2018 expanded the Parkhound model into the United States.

Mr Griffin, who drives an electric Volvo XC40, said there were varying estimates on just how many electric vehicles were on the road in Australia, but it was likely close to 50,000.

Chinese-owned Swedish car brand Volvo outlined a few days ago that it planned to stop selling petrol-powered vehicles in Australia by 2026.

Other large corporate players including miner BHP have also joined the push for Australia to move faster on the take-up of EVs. BHP wants a ban on sales of new petrol and diesel powered cars in Australia by 2035 and says governments should ensure there is the necessary infrastructure to support an increasingly electric car fleet.

BHP’s nickel asset president Jess Farrell on November 3 called for other Australian states to adopt the electric vehicle policy announced by the Australian Capital Territory in July, which is to cease registration of cars that are not “zero emissions vehicles” by 2035.

About 2 per cent of new vehicle sales in Australia last year were electric vehicles, which is well below the adoption rate of global averages.

There are currently 90,000 reservations for both the Hummer EV Pickup and Hummer EV SUV models - and is no longer accepting additional reservations. Even people on the reservation list might wait past 2024 before they receive a delivery. The Hummer EV production is on hold at the moment, with GM preparing the plant to prepare to hopefully ramp up production.

GMC brand chief Duncan Aldred said the automaker had 65,000 reservations in March - and admitted back then that some of the customers wouldn't be delivered until 2024 - and then the reservations kept on arriving.

Here is what GM representatives told the Robb Report:

""GMC Hummer EV customers are excited about the off-road capability and incredible on-road performance their supertruck offers-all with zero-tailpipe-emissions. This enthusiastic interest has led to over 90,000 reservations for both Pickup and SUV, and we're excited to say this incredible demand has led to Hummer EV reservations being fully booked at this time.""

As of September 2022, only 2,570 Hummer EV Pickup units were produced - but hopes to ramp up production in 2023. The company was able to produce 750 in September, which is the highest benchmark they've met - which is just 9,000 in one year - so there is a lot of work left to be done.

Here is what Car and Driver said about the 2022 GMC Hummer EV: ""It's big, brash, and brawny like its forebears, proving that an electric Hummer is still very much a Hummer.""

While Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk has never given an official explanation, there's plenty of speculation about why the dominant electric vehicle manufacturer does not support these features.

Why Tesla doesn't support CarPlay and Android Auto

First and foremost, Tesla develops its own software that is miles ahead of traditional car manufacturers.

The huge benefit that other manufacturers gain by integrating CarPlay just isn't as crucial in a Tesla, which already offers intuitive, responsive software with many features.

Many apps on a phone that would be useful in a vehicle are already available in a Tesla, from navigation, Spotify, phone integration, text messaging, karaoke, to a web browser and more. Although Tesla doesn't have a robust app store like Apple and Google, it does offer features that cover common use cases.

However, it's understandable the craving some users may have for CarPlay or Android Auto if Tesla doesn't support their favorite streaming service, such as Apple Music, SiriusXM or even voice assistants like Siri and Google Assistant.

Although you're able to listen to music through Spotify, and TIDAL, watch Netflix and YouTube on the car's large display through Tesla's software, there will always be more options and features on a phone, regardless of how many features Tesla includes.

Seamless Experience

One reason for not integrating CarPlay or Android Auto into Teslas is that these systems would break up the Tesla experience.

CarPlay and Android Auto currently operate in their own, separate experiences. This requires you to first pull up CarPlay and then perform your desired task, such as setting your destination or switching music.

In traditional vehicles, this isn't much of an issue since CarPlay or Android Auto (AA) usually take over the middle infotainment display. This allows CarPlay or AA to remain on screen, which means that you can just tap the app you want.

However, in a Tesla, software features are very tightly integrated, and the addition of CarPlay/AA would break up the seamless experience Tesla currently offers.

For example, in a Model Y music and navigation are usually both displayed on the vehicle's screen at the same time, something that is not currently possible with CarPlay.

In addition, if the driver maximizes the music player or launches a different app in a Tesla, then Tesla displays navigation information on the left side of the screen, keeping the driver aware of the next turn.

If the driver receives a text message while driving, the driver can see and hear the message being received, regardless of which app is on screen.

However, since all of CarPlay's features only work in a CarPlay window, this kind of flexibility and integration isn't possible.

Duplicate Experience

Incorporating CarPlay or Android Auto duplicates a lot of features Tesla already has and removes the ability for Tesla to deep link apps and features.

For example, in a Tesla you could have the maps, phone, calendar, Spotify and other apps in the vehicle's launcher, giving you one-tap access to the app

For example, imagine if you had Google Maps open and you wanted to view your backup camera then open Spotify. In a Tesla, you'd tap the camera in the launcher, then tap Spotify. Two taps.

However, if you wanted to perform the same actions with CarPlay, this would take significantly longer. You'd first tap the camera icon in Tesla's launcher, then tap to go back to CarPlay, but you'd still have to go 'Home' on the CarPlay interface, then find Spotify. That's four taps, assuming Spotify was on the first page of CarPlay's home screen.

Since CarPlay acts as a secondary experience this will often increase the number of taps to get to certain information.

CarPlay also duplicates many features in a vehicle which results in some confusion since there are multiple apps for the same thing, such as navigation and music.

This issue is only exacerbated in a Tesla since Tesla offers so many of the same features as CarPlay such as maps, messages, phone, calendar, podcasts, etc.

New CarPlay Experience

Apple revealed a significantly improved CarPlay experience at the 2022 Worldwide Developers Conference. Emily Schubert, Apple's Senior Manager of Car Experience Engineering, said the company has ""been working with automakers to reinvent the in-car experience across all the drivers' screens."" The redesigned CarPlay appears much more customizable, and it's said to seamlessly integrate into vehicles instead of having a CarPlay window or taking over the entire screen.

This may be an experience that would suit Teslas much more than Apple's current offering, however, there's something else that is likely preventing Tesla from incorporating Apple's or Google's auto interface.

The Future of the Vehicle

Vehicles have traditionally been about getting you to your destination, however, that's now shifting. No one wants a car that just gets them to their desired location, they want to get there as safely as possible and be entertained on the way.

As this shift continues and we approach an autonomous future, vehicles will be much more about software and their entertainment offerings.

The next generation of car makers will not be decided by how they drive, but by how autonomous they are and what software features they offer.

Future Competition

While many pit Tesla against Volkswagen, Toyota and others, these are merely short-term obstacles for Tesla.

Tesla's true competitors have yet to emerge, but they'll be in the form of powerful tech companies such as Apple and Google. Companies that not only have strong design and AI foundations but also have access to a large user base and a dominant platform.

When a manufacturer incorporates CarPlay or Android Auto, they're giving up a great deal of control to Apple or Google.

They're not only giving up control though, they're giving up the opportunity to build a vehicle platform and a loyal user base.

If Tesla added CarPlay and Android Auto to their vehicles, they'd be helping their upcoming competitors by giving them control of a market they already know will decide the next big players - the inside of the automobile.

AirPlay

But there is another solution that may keep Apple users and Tesla happy — the use of AirPlay. This capability enables pairing a phone to an audio device to stream music or podcasts. AirPlay is not available in cars yet, but it would not be much of a leap to include the option with Tesla already equipped with Wi-Fi capabilities. Elon Musk recently left the door open for that development.

In May 2022, Musk responded to a tweet. @JacobB1290H wrote: ""The speaker system in Teslas are so good, but we are limited by the quality of Bluetooth. Could we have AirPlay added? It adds the ability for lossless streaming. The hardware necessary is already there.""

Musk responded: ""Will discuss this and other improvements with Tesla audio engineering. The new Model S and X sound system is incredible."" His tweet generated 11.6k likes and 440 retweets.

Will Tesla Need to Give In?

At least one developer has created a workaround to add CarPlay to Teslas. Michal Gapinski developed a solution that allows you to take a Raspberry Pi and connect it to your vehicle to incorporate CarPlay into the vehicle's browser.

While the solution is great, it does require some tech knowledge to get working. While this gives some users what they want, it puts even more pressure on Tesla to develop a native solution.

During the 2022 Apple event, the company stated that CarPlay is a must-have feature for people who are car shopping. According to Apple, 79 percent of buyers in the United States would only consider a vehicle that is CarPlay-capable. The company also says that CarPlay is already available in 98 percent of cars in the U.S.

These numbers put Tesla and other EV manufacturers such as Rivian in a difficult position. They understand the future of the EV, but at the same time, their users are demanding access to CarPlay and Android Auto.",electric vehicles,notateslaapp.com

The bill aims to postpone all made-in-America vehicle assembly and battery component subsidy requirements by 3 years.

4 Reviews

Several members of Congress have co-sponsored a bill that suspends the stringent requirements that automakers have to comply with in order to make their electric vehicles eligible for the US$7,500 US tax credit reintroduced with the recent Inflation Reduction Act. Filed by Congresswoman Terri Sewell, the so-called Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act aims to basically postpone all made-in-US eligibility requirements by three years. According to Representative Emanuel Cleaver (MO-05), one of the bill's co-authors:

Our legislation takes important steps to make the historic electric vehicle tax credits passed in the Inflation Reduction Act immediately accessible to consumers, particularly working- and middle-class Americans who would like to purchase an electric vehicle but need the federal credit to do so. As oil companies insist on continuing their exorbitant price-gouging of American families at the pump, these tax credits offer hardworking Americans immediate and significant financial assistance to help them purchase a vehicle that is better both for the environment and their wallets. This bill would be a major win for consumers, auto-workers, and businesses alike, and I will work with my colleagues to ensure it is signed into law by President Biden.

The enforcement delay is in order to give equal opportunity to all EV makers to reorganize their manufacturing base for compliance while their current models remain eligible for subsidies. The new Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act bill asks for putting all made-in-America and other subsidy requirements off by three years:

(a) FINAL ASSEMBLY.—Subparagraph (G) of section 30D(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by section 13401(b) of Public Law 117-169, is amended by inserting ‘‘in the case of any motor vehicle sold after December 31, 2025,’’ before ‘‘the final assembly’’.

With the current requirements, the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y will only become eligible after January 1, 2023, for instance, while some manufacturers like Hyundai that sell very popular electric vehicles won't qualify at all as their current units on the market aren't assembled in the US.

Ever since the Inflation Reduction Act became law, automakers and battery manufacturers alike have been trying to move production to the US, announcing new factories and joint ventures that will be based in America at a frantic pace.

Tesla's Korean battery suppliers, for instance, reportedly started to clean their supply chain from Chinese components or raw materials that would make their cells ineligible for the new EV subsidy spree that will run until 2032. Tesla itself has expressed interest in building its own lithium refinery on the Gulf Coast so as to ensure a steady subsidy-compliant supply of the critical battery material.

All these investments in a new manufacturing base or retooling of existing factories will, however, take time to complete, and that's what the new Affordable Electric Vehicles for America bill will try to account for by making all EVs in the US immediately eligible for the government's tax credits.

Operator

Good morning and welcome to the NN, Inc. Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Tryka. Please go ahead.

Jeff Tryka

Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. I'm Jeff Tryka, Investor Relations contact for NN, Inc. and I'd like to thank you for attending today's business update. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022, as well as a supplemental presentation which have all been posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. If anyone needs a copy of the press release or the supplemental presentation, you may contact Lambert & Co. at 315-529-2348. Our presenters on the call this morning will be Warren Veltman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Felcher, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, I'd ask that you take note of the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements contained in today's press release, supplemental presentation and in the Risk Factors section of the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The same language applies to comments made in today's conference call, including the Q&A session as well as the live webcast. Our presentation today will contain forward-looking statements regarding sales, margins, input cost inflation, supply chain constraints, the impact of the automotive semiconductor chip shortage, statements regarding the planned management transition, foreign exchange rates, cash flow, tax rates, acquisitions, synergies, cash and cost savings, future operating results, performance of our worldwide markets and the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on the company's financial condition and other topics. These statements should be used with caution and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of the company's control. The presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules. A reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures is contained in the tables in the final section of the press release and the supplemental presentation.

Reviewing the agenda for today's call, Warren will open with an update on actions the company has taken to position NN for success and then provide a business update from the third quarter. Mike will then provide a detailed review of the financial results before turning the call back over to Warren to discuss our segment results and markets as well as our outlook for 2022 which has been revised based on our current view of the business and external factors influencing our results. There will be a Q&A session following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Warren Veltman, President and CEO. Warren?

Warren Veltman

Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us this morning. Before we dive into a discussion of our results for the third quarter, I would like to review the other news we announced last night regarding the management transition plan. This transition includes my planned retirement as NN CEO, effective at the end of the first quarter of 2023. I've given this decision a great deal of thought and consideration, as it was very important to me that the timing be right for both me personally and for the company.

In the 3-plus years I served as CEO, we have made significant progress to improve the company's financial structure, operating cost drivers and reposition our growth strategy to be focused on the high-growth electric vehicle and electrical markets. I believe these and other initiatives have placed NN on a path for continued success and will ultimately drive improved shareholder value.

Our efforts regarding rationalizing our manufacturing footprint is an example of cost reduction efforts to create a more competitive cost structure for NN. We have taken action to close 5 manufacturing facilities by the end of the first quarter of 2023. When complete, we expect to see annualized improvement in adjusted EBITDA versus our 2022 outlook of $10 million to $12 million. The finalization of these closures will be a huge step in creating a more competitive global footprint for NN to support our growth objectives and are actions I hope to complete before my retirement.

To address my planned retirement, our Board of Directors has engaged Korn Ferry, a global organizational consulting firm, to identify a range of potential candidates, with particular emphasis on individuals with skills and experience in the electric vehicle and residential and commercial electric grid markets. The Board is targeting to announce a new CEO during the first half of 2023 and I expect that I will remain in my role until a successor is in place. Additionally, I will remain available on a consulting basis beyond that time as necessary to facilitate a smooth transition.

In addition to my retirement, we also announced several other management changes, starting with the planned retirement of John Buchan, our Executive Vice President of Mobile Solutions and Power Solutions. John and I have partnered together for many years to create value for our shareholders and I thank him for his commitment to our organization.

As we search for John's successor, we have named 2 experienced leaders at NN to new positions to help ensure continuity of our leadership team. NN named Gunars Vinkels to be Interim Chief Operating Officer of Power Solutions and Douglas Campos to be Interim Chief Operating Officer of Mobile Solutions, each reporting to John Buchan. Gunars has almost 30 years of relevant experience within Power Solutions and currently serves as the Vice President of Operations, with a focus on the electrical business. Douglas has experience in a variety of leadership roles, providing a breadth of commercial, operational and geographical experience within Mobile Solutions. We are confident in the abilities of these 2 executives to guide our operating teams through this transition.

I would be remiss to not thank the incredible NN team. It has been an honor and my absolute pleasure to have worked with such a talented and dedicated group of individuals. I want to thank all my colleagues for the commitment demonstrated to make such progress in the transformation of NN. We all recognize that the work is not complete and that we must continue the work to make NN better each day. I also want to thank our customers who continue to value our products and capabilities.

And lastly, I want to thank all our shareholders for their continued support in NN.

Let's now turn our discussion to our performance during the third quarter. On Page 4 of the presentation, we will review some of the key strategic initiatives our team completed during the quarter. We continue to focus our sales efforts on key growth areas centered on the mega trends shaping the future of our markets, including the electrical and EV markets. Our 2025 goal is to generate in excess of 20% of our revenues from these markets. And year-to-date, we continue to make progress against that goal, with 36% of our new business wins associated with electrical or EV markets. To advance these efforts in the third quarter, we showcased NN's process technology and components at the Battery Show in Novi, Michigan. For those of you who might be unfamiliar with this show, it's one of the largest trade shows dedicated to advanced battery and electric and hybrid vehicle technology, also known as the EV Tech Expo. The show attracted more than 15,000 attendees and nearly 800 suppliers to the industry. This was a great opportunity for NN to showcase our process technology and components to a large audience.

As I previously discussed, our efforts to optimize our production footprint and reduce cost has been a significant initiative. We announced the closure of the Power Solutions Irvine, California, facility in October which was the culmination of our strategic review of our aerospace and defense business. Additionally, we continued efforts to close 4 additional sites by the end of the first quarter.

Turning to Page 5, we felt it important to summarize how we anticipate the company will perform by depicting the expected benefit of fully implemented cost improvements that are underway and will be substantially complete by the end of Q1 2023.

First, I will review the impact of the closure of Taunton and Irvine on the Power Solutions business. Both of these facilities manufactured product primarily for the aerospace and defense industries. On this slide, we depict the pro forma 9-month results for the Power Solutions business by removing the financial results of the Taunton and Irvine facilities for the same period.

On a pro forma basis, the closure of Taunton and Irvine will result in a significant improvement in operating income and adjusted EBITDA of $7.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively. These pro forma adjustments would increase Power Solutions' 9-month operating income and adjusted EBITDA to $23.2 million and $25.3 million, respectively, on sales of $148.5 million. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA would represent 17% of sales which is more in line with our long-term targets for the business. Further, the strong 9-month performance on our electrical business demonstrates that we have been successful in adjusting our product pricing to recover inflationary cost increases.

We have excluded our medical business from the pro forma carve-out, as that business will be relocated to our production facility in Attleboro, Massachusetts. We expect approximately $2 million in closure costs for these facilities but also anticipate proceeds from the sale of equipment in the range of $2 million to $3 million.

Lastly, although we have not secured tenants for these facilities, we expect sublease income will approximate our current lease obligations, as we believe our current rental rates are consistent with market terms.

Now if you turn to Page 6, we will review the impact of our cost improvement initiatives on the Mobile Solutions business. On this slide, we show a $7.8 million 9-month pro forma impact of our cost improvement initiatives had they been completed at the beginning of 2022. We estimate the annual cost savings associated with facility closures to be approximately $5 million, or $3.9 million for the 9-month period. The 9-month savings can be allocated to $1.7 million associated with reduced facility costs and $2.2 million associated with shifting production to a low-cost facility where certain operations that were previously outsourced can now be performed internally.

Although we have been proactive in addressing the effect of inflation, we have experienced a lag from the time of an inflationary cost increase to the time of recovery from our customers. The pro forma impact on adjusted EBITDA of realizing customer price increases at the time of the cost increase would have increased our adjusted EBITDA by $3.2 million during the 9-month period. Note that the pro forma impact on adjusted EBITDA is higher than the pro forma sales adjustment due to the additional inflation recovery at the company's China joint venture. Our China JV sales are not consolidated in our reported results.

Lastly, we have reflected a $700,000 pro forma adjustment for excessive production start-up costs. We are tracking these expected cost reductions with area improvement team action plans that are expected to eliminate these cost overruns by the end of Q1 2023. After considering these pro forma adjustments for cost reduction initiatives underway, Mobile Solutions' 9-month pro forma sales and adjusted EBITDA would be $228.2 million and $36.2 million, respectively. This would yield a 15.9% adjusted EBITDA margin, much closer to our expectation for this business.

Turning to Page 8, we have summarized some of the results from our third quarter. Let me start my comments by saying that in spite of the fact that several financial metrics show year-over-year improvement, we are not satisfied with our financial results for the third quarter and they clearly did not meet our expectations. We did not see the sales volume increases we were expecting, inflationary cost increases adversely impacted margins and we experienced poor operating performance for program launches in Mobile Solutions and within Power Solutions aerospace and defense facilities. I had previously discussed the actions we are taking surrounding these issues. These issues also impacted our free cash flow during the quarter which was a use of $4.4 million.

Sales for the quarter were $127.3 million, up 8.6% from the same period in 2021. Our Power Solutions business experienced a 5% increase in sales compared to the same period in 2021, driven primarily by higher pricing and volume, partially offset by lower precious metal passthrough pricing and unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Pricing and increased demand within the end markets of our Mobile Solutions group resulted in a year-over-year revenue growth of 11% for this segment. We continue to maintain strong liquidity, at $44.7 million and our $60 million swap has provided us a level of protection in an environment of increasing interest rates.

On Slide 9, we review new business wins. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have secured new business wins with peak annualized sales of approximately $31 million. The new business reflects segment growth aligned with our long-term strategy as well as increased share of wallet with industry leaders; particularly, component share gains with our longstanding customer base. Of note, 36% of the new business wins secured through the third quarter were in the EV and electrical segments, further supporting our team's focus on aligning growth consistent with our long-term vision. We continue to take a disciplined approach to programs requiring capital and have maintained a low capital ratio, with the year-to-date wins only requiring $2.1 million of incremental CapEx. We continue to invest in additional sales resources with demonstrated expertise in electrical, battery storage and electric vehicle markets to improve our coverage in business segments that are consistent with our strategic growth initiatives.

Turning to Page 10, focused execution from our sales and business development teams continued to deliver pipeline expansion in high-growth markets aligned with our strategy. While the overall pipeline has decreased in recent quarters, it is important to understand that the opportunities in our target markets that are high growth have increased. The decrease also reflects canceled opportunities following the Irvine and Taunton facility closures.

The opportunities generated by our teams are encouraging and we remain committed to expansion in our EV and electrical segments. We are currently pursuing several initiatives to strengthen our position in each market. ICE-dependent pursuits continue to decline and can be attributed to the reduction in programs by OEMs and our selective approach to pursuing opportunities in this end market. We are also focused on the opportunity to further expand our presence in the medical market once our noncompete related to the sale of the life science business expires in the fourth quarter of 2023.

I will now turn it over to Mike Felcher who will provide a more in-depth review of our financial performance for the quarter. Mike?

Mike Felcher

Thank you, Warren. Slide 11 is a review of our financial highlights for the third quarter. Increased volumes and demand drove an increase of 8.6% in sales versus the prior year period which along with favorable mix and higher JV net income equated to improved year-over-year profitability of approximately $4 million. The JV reported sales of $27 million during the third quarter, up $4.3 million, or 18.8%, from the third quarter of 2021. Year-over-year results were also favorably impacted by reduced incentive and stock-based compensation expense of approximately $3 million. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable impacts of approximately $2 million due to unrecovered inflation and $1.7 million related to overhead absorption.

Turning to Slide 12, our working capital remained consistent with the prior quarter, at 4.2 turns. Similar to recent quarters, we continue to experience challenges with our supply chain and, as a result, have maintained higher-than-usual levels of inventory. While inventory remains above normal levels due to safety stock needed to address increased lead times, we remain focused on reducing inventory levels and are working on several initiatives to reduce them by year-end.

Turning to Slide 13, we provide a look at our capital expenditures. We continue to take a disciplined approach as we fund investments to support long-term growth. Year-to-date CapEx has decreased from $14.6 million in 2021 to $14 million in the current year.

Moving to Slide 14, free cash flow was a use of $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to a free cash flow use of $3.7 million in 2021. Free cash flow used in the quarter was primarily driven by a $3.1 million increase in working capital and lower operating results than expected. We expect working capital to reduce by approximately $9 million in Q4, driven by inventory reduction initiatives and lower accounts receivable due to the collection of a $2 million receivable related to a customer settlement agreed to in 2021 and normal Q4 sales seasonality. In addition, we incurred approximately $1.7 million in cash costs for severance litigation and facility closure costs during the quarter. We expect that these expenditures will be approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter as we make the final payment on CARES Act, FICA deferrals and incur costs related to the previously discussed facility closures.

While we will incur some additional facility closure costs early in 2023 and will pay $0.8 million in 2023 per the terms of the agreement to settle breach-of-contract claims regarding the sale of products by us in 2016 that was agreed to earlier this year, the majority of cash outflows for these items are behind us and 2023 cash outflows for these items are expected to be significantly lower than 2022.

Please turn to Slide 15. Net debt at the end of the third quarter was $151.5 million, versus $146.3 million in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of $5.2 million. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 3.15x at the end of the third quarter, a marginal decrease from 3.17x at the end of the second quarter and slightly above our 3x target. We had $44.7 million of liquidity, including cash and availability on our revolver, as of September 30, 2022. Our ABL was drawn by $6 million at the end of the third quarter, with undrawn availability of $32 million.

With that, I will turn it back to Warren.

Warren Veltman

Thank you, Mike. On Slide 17, we broadly outline certain market trends surrounding the electrical market. We continue to view the rapid transformation of the energy and electrical equipment markets as significant opportunities.

Government regulations and increased pressure on corporations to accelerate the adoption of sustainable or alternative energy continues to persist. Corporate investments into the energy storage sector reached $22 billion for the first 9 months of 2022, exceeding 2021's investments by 30%. Renewable power generation, electric grids and energy storage account for 80% of total investments within the power sector. On August 19, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, with one of the primary goals of increasing the amount of dollars invested to combat climate change. As part of these efforts, the bill allocated $369 billion in funding for energy security and climate change investment through tax credits and loans. We expect legislation in numerous countries to accelerate the amount of investment.

On Slide 18, we summarize certain trends in the automotive market. The transition to EV continues to gather momentum. While rising interest rates, increasing energy costs and ongoing supply chain disruptions continue to affect global vehicle production and elevate price levels, we continue to see increased interest from federal and state governments to advance the country's EV infrastructure. As of 2022, the U.S. had a total of 92,000 EV chargers which increased 12% from 2020. More recently, the U.S. Department of Transportation approved EV charging station plans that support all 50 states and cover 75,000 miles on the highway as part of a bipartisan infrastructure package.

While we believe the transition to EVs remains inevitable, the ultimate path and time frame for the transition remains uncertain given the recent increase in inflation and sustained impact on the supply chain challenges. That said, recent investments by OEMs across product development and production expansion in EVs remains encouraging and we continue to view the opportunity as exciting.

Turning to our segment performance, we will begin with Power Solutions. Power Solutions generated an increase in sales of 5% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by higher customer pricing and volume, partially offset by lower precious metal passthrough pricing and unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Profitability increased compared to the prior year period, driven by variable cost efficiencies gained from improved volumes and lower incentive compensation expense. Profitability was also favorably impacted by improved sales mix of our higher value-added series of electrical components. As we discussed earlier, the closure of our Taunton and Irvine facilities are proceeding on schedule.

On Page 20, sales in our Mobile Solutions group increased 11% versus the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by increased pricing and improved volume demand, particularly from China and Brazil. New business launches in Mexico also had a favorable contribution to sales and volumes during the third quarter. Negative foreign exchange effects partially offset those positive trends. Profitability decreased compared to the prior period. The decrease was driven by delayed unrecovered inflation, overhead absorption and the start-up costs. These impacts were partially offset by higher profits due to improved volumes at our China joint venture which reported 9-month sales of $76.4 million, up 11.7% from 1 year ago.

Looking ahead, we expect Q4 sales in our Mobile Solutions business to reflect normal seasonality due to reduced number of customer ship days. We continue to negotiate with customers, with the expectation of additional inflationary cost recoveries and are prioritizing pipeline opportunities focused on high-growth, non-ICE markets, consistent with our long-term strategy.

Turning to Page 21, we are updating our outlook for 2022 to reflect our reported third quarter results and the changes in market conditions since our last update. Our full year 2022 outlook now reflects the following: net sales in the range of $503 million to $510 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $45 million to $48 million; free cash outflow in the range of $9 million to $12 million. Our sales outlook is reduced due to the tempered automotive volume expectation in North America and in China due to higher interest rates, increased OEM inventory and concern regarding the strength of global economies. Additionally, supply chain interruptions, although improved, have adversely impacted our volume expectations for a major Power Solutions customer.

Adjusted EBITDA has been negatively impacted by lower sales and lower margin expectations as a result of product launch inefficiencies and delayed delivery of machine tools and automation expected to drive improved productivity. Additionally, operating performance of our aerospace and defense business did not meet expectations due to labor availability, higher labor costs and lower customer volumes, especially at our Irvine, California, site, where adjusted EBITDA declined $800,000 from our previous outlook. Our current expectations also resulted in a reduction in our incentive compensation which had a favorable impact of approximately $3 million.

Our free cash flow outlook is driven by the factors previously discussed and includes nonoperating cash flows for the tax on the sale of Life Sciences, repayment of the FICA deferral and litigation, severance and facility closure costs which in total represent approximately $8 million.

I would note that our free cash flow does not include the CARES Act tax refund of $11 million, due to uncertain timing. The increase from our prior expected refund of $10 million is a result of expected interest income on the refund. We are actively pursuing this refund through several avenues, including an IRS taxpayer advocate and our congressional representative.

As I close my remarks, we have summarized some of our improvement actions on Page 22. Although our third quarter results did not meet our expectations, I believe our efforts have NN on the path to improved financial performance. Our Board is recruiting a successor CEO that will have experience in our targeted strategic markets and we have talented managerial depth. We continue to improve the depth of our sales and business development teams and we have a robust sales pipeline of opportunities which has generated $32 million of new business wins so far in 2022. Our sales efforts are directed by our strategy and we are making smart capital decisions by investing in markets that will drive our future growth.

We are within reach of significant cost reduction efforts that are expected to improve our profitability by $10 million to $12 million once complete. We have received approximately $40 million of annualized price increases in 2022 and are focused on additional recovery of inflation-driven cost increases. For these reasons and the commitment and skill of our employees, I believe that NN is on the right path and I am confident in our future.

That concludes our prepared remarks and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rob Brown of Lake Street Capital Markets.

Rob Brown

My first question is on kind of the pricing improvement. I know it takes a little time to flow through and you said you got, I think, $40 million last year. How much is sort of yet to come and that you've already negotiated? And I guess, how much more is sort of out there that you think you can get?

Warren Veltman

I would tell you, Rob, it largely depends on how much inflation we see, honestly. As we have indicated, we have what I would call automatic pricing increases currently built in for anything that's material-related with the majority of our customers on the Mobile Solutions side. On the Power side, we've seen increases. Pricing goes up and down as it relates to precious metals and we adjust that pricing on the day of shipment. We've seen significant material-related costs for resins and we've passed that through proactively to our customers. And in those cases, it doesn't require a significant amount of negotiation because we don't have long-term contracts. So as prices move there, we have the opportunity and, as I indicated in my remarks, have demonstrated the ability on the electrical side to pass through that pricing.

On the Mobile side, we have the material that is really automatic. I would tell you there's probably another -- I hate to speculate but there's probably, on nonmaterial-related products, there's probably another 5% to 10% as it relates to the cost increases associated with nonmaterial-related applications that we're pursuing from our customers today.

Rob Brown

Okay, great. And then moving kind to EV activity, you had pretty good project wins in the quarter, I guess. How is that pipeline building? Do you see that sort of cadence continuing in terms of adding projects? And then I presume it takes a few years to get those into revenue. But what's sort of the base of activity that you've won that can turn into revenue over the next couple of years?

Warren Veltman

I would tell you, obviously, it's a priority for us, as I indicated. Our team is very heavily focused on that. One of the things that was interesting to me when I attended the Battery Show that I referenced in my comments was that there is a lot of research and development surrounding it. But as it relates to the number of factories today that reside on this continent for manufacturing not only batteries for vehicles but certainly storage-related batteries for utilization in the grid, there's still a lot of development that needs to be done by those customers as it relates to establishing their factories. So the good news is that we're connected with quite a few people that are moving forward with those types of installations. We're seeing a lot of quoting activity for that. We've had some instances on the EV side where we're quoting the same product with multiple customers. So there is a little duplication in the pipeline in some of those types of instances. But I think that we're right at the forefront of this and certainly, our teams are actively engaged as this is developing in the United States.

Rob Brown

Okay. Okay, great. And then, maybe just sort of your kind of comments around the macro environment into next year. I know there's some uncertainty but what's sort of the range of kind of outcomes that you've experienced in the past? How much visibility do you have? And how do you kind of manage through changes in volume if things slow down? And I guess, what visibility do you have for next year at this point?

Warren Veltman

Look, good question. I would tell you that when we did the outlook 3 months ago, I think that we were looking for a little bit more of a bounce, especially on the auto side, in the fourth quarter and through 2023. And I think what we're seeing with some of our customer release schedules is a little bit more cautiousness on their part. You saw that inventory levels for the OEMs jumped up. I think, on average, when we were talking previously, it was in the low 20s. Now it's at the 34-day, 35-day range. Ford, I think, actually was a little bit higher when they announced and some of the data that we're seeing. They were up in the 50 range, getting back more towards where they have been historically.

So, I think that there's a certain amount of cautiousness going on as it relates to the higher interest rates. The ability to move product is a result of that. And we've seen that in some of our releases. I would tell you our expectation is that we don't think that it's going to be significantly down from where we are today, at least what we're seeing, simply because we've been operating at lower levels so far in 2022 as a result of the semiconductor chip shortages and supply chain interruptions which impacted us for the majority of the first half of this year. So, I think that NN is well positioned with a diversified portfolio on the electrical side and the automotive side. And certainly, as it relates to our ability to flex, I think that we've proven that we have a very strong and capable management team that demonstrated throughout 2020 that we can do that.

The majority of our facilities run a 50-hour work week. So we can flex back 20% on the labor side without losing any skilled machinists or engineers which is a key part of what we would like to retain in the event that there is a downturn.

Operator

The next question comes from Steve Barger of KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Unidentified Analyst

This is Jacob [ph] on for Steve. So the first one, just organic growth levels seemed to be pretty decent in the quarter, maybe a little bit lower than the double-digit levels that we were talking about last quarter. Can you just talk about how you see those trends moving into Q4, specifically? And then maybe what that implies for momentum heading into the first half of '23?

Warren Veltman

Well, I think the guidance that we gave for the whole year that we went through, honestly, I think kind of covers how we expect that to build through the fourth quarter. So we're not at this point in time giving guidance on 2023. We'll do that certainly when we report our year-end results. But as I indicated, our view is that there's some adjustment going on in the market today. We're seeing some cautiousness as it relates to our customers' volumes. We've seen inventories jump just a little bit. They're certainly not as robust as they were pre-COVID and I think that there is some doubt on whether they will get back to that level given how the OEMs have been able to run their businesses and maintain lower inventory levels for a period of time.

So our expectation is that we will continue to see improvement in sales throughout 2023. As it relates to the degree, I think we'd like to see things develop a little bit here over the fourth quarter and see where the economy goes, especially post-election.

Unidentified Analyst

Okay. Got it. That's some good color there. Second one, just kind of a follow-up on the cost recovery side. I know a lot of your contract negotiations are centered around end of year, maybe only some twice a year. Do you think we're going to have to wait until first quarter to start seeing the majority of the rest of those recoveries coming through?

Warren Veltman

Most of what we're talking to our customers about right now relates to pricing adjustments on January 1.

Unidentified Analyst

Okay, understood there. Just maybe 1 or 2 more for me. Specifically on the medical market, the reentry into your medical market, I know you talk about the noncompete from the Life Sciences business until October of next year but I'm just kind of curious what areas you're specifically targeting in the medical market.

Warren Veltman

Well, we're not targeting any areas right now because we're still subject to a noncompete agreement. I would tell you that when we get to that point in time, there are applications within the medical space that fit the core processes that NN has. So anything that would be focused on precision turning or grinding or stamping would play very clearly into the skill set that we have. And obviously, we have a small medical business today that was grandfathered in to our noncompete. And some of the capabilities that we have there as it relates to instrument manufacturing, we could expand into other customer relationships.

Unidentified Analyst

Okay. Understood. I mean, I guess maybe do you have any sense of sort of the magnitude of what that opportunity could be as you get back into it once this noncompete is up?

Warren Veltman

Look, it's a $10 million business for us today. Certainly, we think that over a period of time we could -- in a period of time once we're into it, over a 2- or 3-year period of time, we could triple or quadruple the size of that business, I would think.

Unidentified Analyst

Okay, got it. And then maybe just one last quick one. In the beginning of your prepared remarks, you talked about getting to 20%-plus of your revenues from sort of those mega trend markets by '25. I'm just curious what that percentage is of your business right now.

Warren Veltman

Where are we at, Mike? We're at, like, 15%? 14% or 15%, I think?

Mike Felcher

I think it's 13% or 14%, I think, is where we're at.

Warren Veltman

So it's getting it to 20% but with sales growth throughout the period, right? So it's not the growth aspect of it. And that's the stated target. Certainly, we've had conversations about setting our goals higher than that. And internally, they are but that is our external stated objective.

Operator

The next question comes from Tom Kerr of Zacks Investment Research.

Tom Kerr

I think most of my questions have been asked and answered. A couple of quick ones. Any current commentary on the inflation situation? You're 1 month into the fourth quarter. Any signs of hope or anything like that?

Warren Veltman

Well, I think the signs of hope are that we continue to secure pricing adjustments from our customers. As I indicated, we've done that on the Power Solutions side and we'll continue to do that. We have seen on the Power side, the sales are impacted by lower process metal prices. So we've seen silver come down a little bit. And that, from a quarter-over-quarter comparison standpoint, doesn't necessarily change our margins significantly but certainly changes the sales. And I'd say margin, I'm talking about dollar, right? It can impact the percentage margin. But I would tell you that my feeling today is we have a lot of conversations with customers.

And I think early on, they were maybe a little bit more adversarial than they have been recently, because I think our customers understand that it's important that they have the conversation with us and we reach some sort of an agreement because they want a healthy supplier supplying them product. And now they've already had an opportunity to talk to the OEMs and deal with some of their pricing-related issues, because they have some of the same concerns. And now that they have a clearer path on how that is working, I think they're more reasonable in the approach in dealing with us.

Tom Kerr

All right. Sounds good. Any additional color on the China JV? Is that back to normal? Or recovered kind of like you expected?

Warren Veltman

Look, I would tell you we had a little bump there in our China operations in the second quarter with the COVID. That's still an issue that we're concerned about there. But we're really jamming pretty hard, with a volume $27 million for a quarter. Obviously, well over a $100 million run rate. Our WOFE is performing reasonably well, as well. So we feel pretty good about what's going on in our China operations at this point in time. I think the one negative for us is that we still are negotiating some pricing with a customer for the JV. We concluded on a pricing arrangement with them. It was unfortunate that we didn't conclude on it prior to the end of September but we agreed to an adjustment for the first half of the year.

But we concluded on that in October and we didn't get an opportunity to book it in the third quarter but we'll pick that up in the fourth quarter. And then we've already started the negotiations with the customer on the second half of the year. So a little bit of a lag in the China arena as it relates to talking about pricing for inflationary matters.

Tom Kerr

Got it. Okay. A couple of quick ones. I think last quarter, you talked about the leverage ratio being under 3x at year-end. I'm assuming that's still not a goal? Or can that still happen?

Mike Felcher

We're obviously focused on getting it below 3x. I think, given the revised outlook, that's probably going to be more early in 2023 than at year-end at this point.

Tom Kerr

Okay. And last one, you guys talked about how you're not giving 2023 guidance until the next quarter but you did give pro forma segment adjusted EBITDA margins. Can you consider that a goal or expectation going forward on a normalized basis?

Mike Felcher

So regarding the $10 million to $12 million we outlined, our current view is that sequentially versus 2022 we'd realize about 75% of that in '23. There's obviously some continued impact as we get through the closure of those facilities and the work transfer. When we provide our 2023 outlook in March, we'll have a better estimate on that. It's going to depend on sublease timing and terms and various other factors. But our current view is of the $10 million to $12 million that we outlined for the facility closure savings, that we'd be able to realize about 3/4 of that in 2023.

Operator

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Warren Veltman for any closing remarks.

Warren Veltman

I just want to thank our analysts and shareholders for participating in this call today as well as our employees. Certainly, as I indicated at the beginning, we appreciate the support that we've had from all of our stakeholders and appreciate you taking part in the call today. Thank you. Have a good day.

302,Africa: What Should Africa Expect at COP27? #AfricaClimateCrisis,https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,06/11/2022,"[allAfrica] Sharm-el Sheik, Egypt -- As the world convenes in Africa for the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP27), it is time to recognize Africa's role in averting a climate disaster without compromising the continent's growth and…",https://allafrica.com/stories/202211060057.html,"Nada Elbohi, an Egyptian climate activist, Kenya's Anne Songole, Climate Justice Coordinator at the African Women's Development and Communications Network (FEMNET), Ugandan's Gertrude Kenyangi Kabusimbi, the Executive Director of Support for Women in Agriculture and Environment (SWAGEN) and Priscilla Achakpa, a Nigerian environmental activist and Executive Director of the Women Environment Programme (WEP).

Sharm-el Sheik, Egypt — As the world convenes in Africa for the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP27), it is time to recognize Africa's role in averting a climate disaster without compromising the continent's growth and poverty reduction.

The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP27) summit is being held in Sharm El-Sheikh, a resort town on the Red Sea, in Egypt. The annual conference bring together those who - 30 years ago - signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an environmental treaty dealing with climate change. The first conference - COP1 - took place in Berlin, Germany in 1995.

It is now seven years since the Paris Agreement was signed at COP21. According to the UNFCCC, ""the Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015, and entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to below 2°C, and ideally to 1.5°C, of warming above pre-industrial levels."" This was a landmark deal under which each country was to submit its own pledges on emissions reductions and adaptation measures.

Now, every year almost 200 countries meet to discuss how to jointly tackle the climate crisis and its impacts. The UN summit is an important platform for world leaders, experts, negotiators, businesses, observers, international organizations, civil societies, and the media to all attend and discuss the climate crisis and accelerate global efforts to confront the climate crisis.

The last COP to be hosted in Africa was COP22 which was held in Morocco in 2016. COP27 is billed as an 'African COP' because of its location and the expectation that African countries' exposure to some of the most severe impacts of climate change will be prominent in the discussions. Africa faces exponential collateral damage, posing systemic risks to its economies, infrastructure investments, water and food systems, public health, agriculture, and livelihoods, threatening to undo its modest development gains and slip into higher levels of extreme poverty.

COP27 is taking place over two weeks, from 6 November to 18 November. It starts with a two-day summit for world leaders followed by negotiations on a number of important issues including finance, decarbonisation, adaptation, and agriculture. Gender, water, and biodiversity will also be in the spotlight.

Africa is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the world, requiring urgent action to solve a problem that has escalated over the past decade. Agriculture is facing the tremendous challenge of feeding millions of people and extreme climatic events like heatwaves, cyclones, fires, droughts, floods, and desert locust invasions, are happening more frequently and with more severity, and are driving millions into hunger and poverty. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes that most people and communities in Africa are directly reliant on the natural environment for survival and livelihoods and do not have the necessary safety nets to adapt to climate change. Extreme weather is also a driver of world hunger.

What does COP27 mean for Africa?

The first big test for COP27 will be whether countries make new emissions reduction commitments.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) latest report shows that time is ticking ever more dangerously toward the 1.5C threshold of global warming. The biggest emitters of carbon are China, the U.S., India, Russia, and Japan. Africa contributes only 3% to greenhouse gas emissions but suffers disproportionately from its negative impacts. Not only does Africa bear the least responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions, but the forests of the Congo Basin (second only to the Amazon) are vital to absorbing the CO2 emitted from other continents, reports Brookings Africa in Focus.

As a result of the onslaught of climate disasters in 2022, the international community has had little breathing room to respond. The spotlight is once again being thrown on the massive challenges Africa faces in tackling climate change and also, the opportunities it may create.

Akinwumi A. Adesina, President of the African Development Bank, told Deutsche Welle that Africa was not just affected by climate change, but ""distressed"" by it. African nations generate less than 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions but they're suffering ""a deluge of problems,"" Adesina told DW. He added that Africa loses anywhere between ""U.S.$7 billion and U.S.$15 billion a year as a result of climate change.""

""One of the major disappointments for developing countries at COP26 was the lack of progress on a finance facility that would expedite financial assistance from developed countries to fight permanent and irreversible damage caused by climate change. While the Glasgow Climate Pact recognized the need to address this loss and damage, the conference ended without a concrete measure in place for a process that would deliver financial support,"" reports Eco-Business.

Adesina said 9 out of the 10 most vulnerable countries to climate change are in sub-Saharan Africa. These countries need about $600 billion through 2030, which, he said, amounts to about $60 billion annually. Yet, they are only receiving roughly $18 billion a year toward this effort.

The continent continues to disproportionately face the brunt of climate change although they contribute little to it. African countries are among the most at risk from climate change impacts such as several extreme weather events such as drought and destructive floods, and other natural disasters, thus increasing the threat of food insecurity. Recently, Nigeria was hit by catastrophic floods that have affected at least killed 600 people, displaced millions, and 200,000 homes have been destroyed. More than 1.3 million people have been displaced by the disaster, which has affected people across 33 of Nigeria's 36 states, said a statement by Nigeria's ministry of humanitarian affairs, released on Twitter. The government has said unusually heavy rains and climate change are to blame.

The flooding has worsened a humanitarian crisis in Nigeria, where violence, especially in the troubled northern region, has displaced more than three million people, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. The World Food Programme and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation said last month that Nigeria was among six countries facing a high risk of catastrophic levels of hunger.

In April 2022, massive floods displaced and destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in KwaZulu Natal in South Africa. The floods killed 489 people. In 2018, devastating cyclones impacted 2.2 million people in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe.

In the wake of the climate crisis, problems such as poverty, infectious diseases, forced migration, and conflict spread through globalised systems. Covid-19 was a wake-up call to these global dynamics. The pandemic is affecting the lives of millions of people and, also, the environment. According to UNHCR, ""climate change makes the chance of disasters striking during the Covid-19 pandemic more likely, and their impact more severe on those displaced."" The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change will cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, and heat stress. Climate change and loss of biodiversity also increase the risk of future pandemics by endangering the fragility of the world's ecosystems.

The pandemic laid bare the systemic inequalities between the rich and developing countries.

The impact of climate change on electricity access

Africa's energy crisis will be top of the agenda at the COP27 meeting, as the continent's negotiators up demands for rich countries to commit to their pledges on climate finance. At least 600 million people in the sub-Sahara region are without access to electricity and almost one billion are without access to clean energy for cooking.

In order to minimise the energy access gap, African countries must adopt a variety of power sources while simultaneously phasing out oil and coal. The transition will require development financing for geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar projects. The continent is blessed with huge potential for solar and wind power generation. However, climate change presents a major threat to Africa's achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Access to electricity is a human right as enshrined in sustainable development goal 7 - according to the 2022 edition of Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report, which monitors global efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG7) of ensuring an affordable modern energy supply for everyone by 2030.

Brookings Africa in Focus reports that ""the global transition to renewable energy will mean exponentially scaling up the production of batteries, electric vehicles (EVs), and other renewable energy systems, which require Africa's mineral resources. For example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), accounts for 70% of the world's cobalt, the mineral vital to battery production. Cobalt demand is expected to double by 2030. Conversely, 84 million people (80% of the total population) in the DRC could still lack access to electric power in 2030.""

Africa needs investments of over U.S.$3 trillion in mitigation and adaptation by 2030 in order to implement its NDCs. A major disappointment for developing countries at COP26 was the lack of progress on a finance facility to accelerate financial assistance from developed countries. Developing countries have accused wealthy nations of avoiding substantive talks on a new collective finance goal to help them confront climate change from 2025. African countries went to COP26 asking for about U.S.$1.3 trillion. However, addressing climate change will create significant market opportunities, especially for the private sector and institutional investors.

To keep international cooperation on climate alive, COP27 must deliver support for developing countries dealing with loss and damage caused by climate change. Activists are demanding that wealthier nations take responsibility for climate change and do more to assist developing countries.",electric vehicles,allafrica - top africa news

At least 38 people were injured in a fire in a New York City apartment building that may have been caused by a lithium ion battery, officials told US media on Saturday.

Two of the wounded were in critical condition and five were seriously injured after the blaze on East 52nd Street in Manhattan, CNN quoted fire commissioner Laura Kavanagh as saying.

Dan Flynn, chief fire marshal, told CNN it was nearly the 200th fire this year caused by a lithium-ion battery from a micromobility device. Such small, light electric vehicles can include e-bikes and electric scooters.

""We've had six fatalities this year just from these batteries that power micromobility devices,"" CNN quoted him as saying.

Flynn said authorities believe the occupant of the apartment where the fire likely began had been repairing bikes in the building.

According to the advisory issued by the Police Commissionerate of Gautam Buddh Nagar, the restrictions will be from Chilla Border, DND and Kalindi Kunj border. However, a diverted route for going to their destinations will be provided.

""Under the Graded Action plan, entry of all trucks except those providing essential goods or services or those running on CNG or electric power are prohibited from entering Delhi from Noida.

The entry of BS-3 (petrol) and BS-4 (diesel) light four-wheeler vehicles in Delhi from the Noida border will also be banned.

""Entry for diesel-powered medium cargo vehicles and heavy goods vehicles except those engaged in essential goods and services is prohibited,"" the advisory further added.

As per the advisory, as an alternative route, all these vehicles can use the Yamuna Expressway or the Eastern Peripheral Expressway via Noida-Greater Noida Expressway to reach their destination.

""In case of traffic inconvenience, you can contact the traffic helpline number 9971009001,"" it added.

The air quality national capital and its adjoining area are currently in a severe category. People of Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) complained of choking and 'eye burning' due to smog and leaving people gasping for breath.

Earlier, the Commission for Air Quality Management stopped the entry of truck traffic into Delhi (except for trucks carrying essential commodities/ providing essential services and all CNG/electric trucks).

The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas further ordered the implementation of GRAP-4 in Delhi-NCR.

On Friday, Delhi Chief Minister along with Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann held a press conference and urged the central government to come forward and lead measures to check severe smog in the national capital region.

Kejriwal and Mann said that the AAP governments are in Punjab and Delhi. This is not the time to raise fingers or abuse each other. If they say, Kejriwal is responsible and we say they are responsible, this will not solve the problem of smog in NCR, they added.

""We do not want to play blame game, we are responsible (for smog in NCR)"", they added.

CM Kejriwal announced that primary schools in Delhi would be closed from November 5.

Besides, the outdoor activity of students of the above fifth standard has been banned.

The Delhi government is also mulling implementing the odd-even norms for plying of vehicles in Delhi to contain the pollution caused by vehicular emission, he added.

305,Global diplomats are talking about climate change — again. Does it do any good?,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2b05a4ab25f4fca0316459e1c7404c537a89702/c=0-0-1365-768/local/-/media/2022/11/01/USATODAY/usatsports/247WallSt.com-247WS-1179022-imageForEntry8-26.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200,06/11/2022,"As the United Nations' climate change conference in Egypt begins Sunday, there's more hope than you might think. Here's why.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/11/06/cop-27-begins-climate-change-experts-see-reasons-hope/10615587002/,"More than 30,000 people will begin meeting at the United Nations' climate change conference in Egypt beginning Sunday.

The yearly gathering has been going on for decades, but the bad news about climate change keeps coming.

While more work needs to be done, experts say much has happened and there's reason for hope.

Think of it like this: You're on an enormous ocean liner in the middle of the sea. It's headed toward a horrific storm and needs to turn as fast as possible to save the ship and the passengers from the worst of the tempest.

Like that ship, Earth is heading into a massive climate crisis. But our boat takes decades to turn and has a crew of billions. Complicating things further, instead of a single captain, it has close to 200 leaders – and they don't always see eye-to-eye.

Those leaders represent countries that have agreed to a somewhat toothless treaty, which says they'll lower their greenhouse gas emissions. It's the closest the globe has come to finding an idea that will correct the course of the ship we're all on.

That's essentially the task of the more than 30,000 people meeting at the United Nations' climate change conference in Egypt that began Sunday. Called COP27, the 13-day conference brings together diplomats, scientists, activists, lobbyists, environmental groups and businesses to work out the details.

What is COP27?:Greta Thunberg won't be at this massive climate change summit, but Biden will be. What to know about COP27.

This all goes back to 1992

A bit of history: Back in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Brazil, 154 countries signed the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Several years later in Berlin, the countries agreed to meet yearly to negotiate binding targets to mitigate global warming.

Back then, carbon dioxide levels were at only 360 parts per million – they're at 419 today – up from the pre-Industrial Revolution level of 280. But even so, scientists and governments realized those greenhouse gases were heating up the planet and would have potentially horrific consequences if something wasn't done.

Ever since then, the ""Conference of the Parties"" has been meeting annually to work on lowering greenhouse gas emissions. It's called that because it's a conference of the parties that signed the agreement.

All COPs, including this one, are big, complex meetings full of wonky discussions, diplomat-speak and arguments over wording. But they're also a critical part of a massive, global effort to shift the world from its path away from a global warming apocalypse to something better.

WATCH:Changing climate threatens native land, people

FARMING:Can growers adapt to the changing climate?

Important work has been done at the previous COPs, including in Kyoto in 1997 when industrialized countries adopted goals for emission targets. In Durban, South Africa, in 2011, countries including the United States, China and India agreed to start reducing emissions. At the Paris COP in 2015, almost 200 countries signed a deal setting ambitious goals to limit temperature rise and hold governments to account to get to those targets.

That work is already beginning to bear fruit, experts say.

There's more hope than you might think: Our troubled ship has begun changing course

There's certainly bad news, but there's also a lot more good news about climate change than many people realize.

China and India, the two largest nations in the world, are rapidly shifting to renewable energy. Electric cars have already reached what many believe is a tipping point in terms of adoption. A crucial election in Brazil recently went to a leader who's vowed to save the Amazon.

""Defeatists are unaware of what’s happening,"" said Bruce Usher, a professor of climate and business at Columbia University. ""In many countries, emissions are dropping, and in some countries dropping at a fairly significant rate. Here in the United States, greenhouse gas emissions peaked in 2007.""

Make no mistake about it, there really is a horrific storm ahead and the consequences are dire. Yes, the ship is turning away from the worst of the tempest. But to avoid serious damage to the ship and many deaths among the crew, it needs to turn a lot sharper and a lot faster.

A report issued by the United Nations in late October found that the window for making the turn is closing. The world must cut emissions by 45% to avoid global catastrophe.

While experts acknowledge the world's ""climate ship"" is still heading into the storm, they're also quick to say it's well into the turn and seems likely to skirt the absolute worst – though by no means all – of the storm.

""The reasons to be optimistic are many,"" said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense Fund, a U.S.-based nonprofit environmental advocacy group.

But it's true, as the United Nations secretary-general said in September: Targets set years ago have not been met, and efforts to keep the rise of global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius are ""on life support.""

While more work needs to be done, much has happened since 1992.

Now is a critical time for navigating Earth's future

Today, China – now the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gasses – is aggressively investing in clean energy.

India is expected to overtake China as the world's most populous country next year, and gets more than 75% of its electricity from coal.

It's now in the midst of what the International Energy Agency calls a ""stunning"" energy transformation, recently approving a plan to get half of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. Today, renewable energy is growing at a faster rate in India than in any other major economy.

The United States in August passed the largest climate bill in the nation's history, one that will significantly impact not just US energy production but the world's.

That means that renewable energy, which is already at scale and competitive with other sources of power, will continue to grow rapidly and get even cheaper.

""Whether or not you believe in climate change, everybody loves cheap power,"" said Usher, who's attended multiple COPs over the years.

In a report last month, Credit Suisse said Inflation Reduction Act investment in clean energy as well as in research and development means the United States is ""poised to become the world's leading energy provider.""

In just seven years, US wind and solar power could be the cheapest in the world, giving U.S. industry and manufacturing a boost, the global investment bank said. The IRA ""could turn the US from an importer of solar modules and wind turbines to an exporter.""

There was also positive climate change news in Brazil, where the outcome of the country's presidential election could mean a reprieve for the Amazon rainforest.

Known as ""the lungs of the planet,"" the Amazon is critical to fighting climate change because it contains around 123 billion tons of carbon above and below ground, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Deforestation reached record levels during current president Jair Bolsonaro's tenure. Incoming President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva campaigned in part on protecting the rainforest.

Finally, the global shift to electric cars is well underway. In the third quarter of this year, they represented 5.6% of all new U.S. car sales, according to Kelley Blue Book. Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are 24% of new cars sold in China.

Some are angry more isn't being done

Meanwhile, with every passing mile, many people see more dark, roiling storm clouds of climate change – and they are worried and angry that more isn't being done.

Scientists, activists and tens of millions of people bearing the brunt of climate-strengthened catastrophes are clamoring for faster and more urgent efforts.

From Florida's hurricane-damaged Gulf coast to the West's drought- and fire-stricken lands; in flooded Pakistan; cyclone-devastated parts of Africa; and brushfire-scorched Australia – much of humanity is already living with the consequences of climate change. And it's destroying lives, communities and livelihoods.

To turn Earth's course more quickly means realizing there is hope. All that's lacking to get there is the political will to make changes that might hurt the finances of some in the short term but will quickly result in a cleaner, healthier and richer world, experts say.

The world is already on the path to decarbonization and isn’t starting from zero, Usher said.

Catastrophe, he said, is by no means inevitable:

“It’s absolutely not hopeless. There’s a very clear path to keeping temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, it’s absolutely feasible. We have the technology and we have the investment. What we’re lacking is the will.”

CAQM, in its latest order, said that ban on plying of non-BS VI diesel-run light motor vehicles in Delhi-NCR, entry of trucks into national capital is now revoked.

CAQM order reads: “In wake of the Delhi AQI nearing the ‘Severe +’ Category (AQI >450), the GRAP Stage-IV actions were invoked on 03.11.2022 based on the AQI forecasts. The forecasts also indicated a significant improvement around 5th - 6th November, 2022, therefore, the sub-Committee while invoking Stage-IV of the GRAP, decided for a review of the situation on 6th November, 2022.”

The CAQM sub-Committee had decided to revoke the order, issued on November 3, 2022, for actions under GRAP Stage-IV with immediate effect. It further added that actions under GRAP Stages-I to Stage-III will still remain in action and be implemented, monitored and reviewed by all agencies concerned in the NCR area. This is to ensure that the AQI levels do not slip further to the ‘Severe’/ ‘Severe +’ category.

The GRAP is a set of anti-air pollution measures followed in Delhi. It classifies the air quality in the Delhi-NCR under four stages: Stage I - 'Poor' (AQI 201-300); Stage II - 'Very Poor' (AQI 301-400); Stage III - 'Severe' (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV - 'Severe Plus' (AQI >450).

The GRAP Stage IV's primary focus is on vehicle restrictions, including entry of commercial trucks into Delhi, diesel commercial vehicles for intra-Delhi movements, non-BS VI passenger vans, and LMVs (Light Motor Vehicles) in Delhi.

Most importantly, if countries which agreed the Glasgow Climate Pact deliver on their commitments to phase down coal power, halt or reverse deforestation and speed up the switch to electric vehicles, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees is still possible. This will be critical for preventing devastating climate impacts and protecting vulnerable countries like Pakistan.

At COP26 the UK pledged £55m in financial support to Pakistan to assist with building climate resilience and tackling climate change. This support is in addition to £26.5m provided by the UK Government and £30m donated by UK citizens to provide relief following this year’s devastating floods.

Having handed over the Presidency, the UK is maintaining its ambitious goals on climate change. This year the UK is launching the ‘Accelerating to Zero Coalition’ which will promote the use of more electric cars worldwide. The UK is also initiating the ‘Forest and Climate Leaders’ Partnership’ to halt and reverse forest loss and will be working with developed countries to increase the availability of climate finance to countries such as Pakistan.

Development Director at the British High Commission, Islamabad Jo Moir, said the following:

This year’s floods are a stark reminder of impact climate change is having on our lives. Globally, we will face more climate catastrophes, and climate-vulnerable countries like Pakistan face enormous challenges. Business as usual is not enough. At COP27 we need to make further progress on ensuring countries which have been affected by climate related disasters have the necessary tools to build-back smarter. The UK will be a leading voice on this.

Notes to editors:

Important achievements of COP26 include: International partners mobilising over $20 billion for a just and inclusive transition from coal to clean energy. 137 countries committed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 in the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use. The COP26 Declaration on Accelerating the Transition to 100% Zero Emission Cars and Vans brought together over 35 countries, 6 major carmakers, 43 cities, states and regions, 28 fleet owners and 15 financial institutions and investors, all committing to work together to achieve this goal. It currently has over 180 signatories. Building on the ZEV declaration, the UK will formally launch the Acceleration to Zero (A2Z) Coalition– this will comprise of a group of governments, manufacturers and businesses that will take the lead in ensuring that all new vehicles are zero emission by 2035 in leading markets and globally by 2040. On 2 November, as part of its Climate Finance Accelerator programme the UK announced that seven low-carbon projects from across Pakistan would receive technical support to improve their ability to attract long-term investment from financers, worth up to £148m. These projects have the potential to benefit communities across Pakistan, through clean energy access, green transportation and pollution reduction while creating jobs. The ultimate objective however is to improve the flow of much needed climate finance which will allow Pakistan to build back smarter. At COP27 the UK is launching the ‘Forests and Climate Leaders’ Partnership’ FCLP– it is a core group of high ambition countries to accelerate global progress to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation. The partnership will keep the forests and land use sector high on the political agenda and more strongly linked into global climate processes and actions. The FCLP ministers will meet every year on the side lines of COP meetings.

However, Prof Beig also added that the relief is short lived. ""The AQI will start deteriorating from the 8th evening as the stubble wind will again turn from the burning side,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR, is likely to hold a review meeting on Sunday in the light of improving air condition. The CAQM had imposed Stage IV measures of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) on Thursday evening that bans the entry of diesel vehicles that were not BS VI in Delhi.

The Delhi government on Friday banned the entry of trucks other than essential services in the national capital following the introduction of GRAP IV. The government has also constituted a six-member committee to monitor truck entry in the national capital city.

""Only CNG, petrol and electric vehicles will be allowed to enter Delhi. There will also be a ban on medium and heavy vehicles of diesel registered in Delhi, which are not connected to the essential services. Small vehicles with diesel engines which are not BS6 compliant will also be banned,"" Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Friday.

The company, a major supplier of systems and components for the electrified and non-electrified powertrain segment to automobile manufacturers, expects revenue from the electric vehicle (EV) segment to account for up to 45 per cent of its total revenue, up from 25 per cent currently.

""Over a timeframe of FY23 plus two years -- FY24 and FY25, I will say our expected capex spend will be anywhere between Rs 900 crore to Rs 1,000 crore. A large part of this (around 75 to 80 per cent) is for the EV business,"" Nanda told PTI.

Under the expansion plan, Sona Comstar would set up another plant at Manesar in Haryana for additional differential assembly capacity, he said adding the capacity of the existing facility has been fully utilised.

The company had also moved to a new larger facility from a smaller unit in Pune.

""On the EV motor side, right now, we continue to expand within our existing facility in Chennai,"" Nanda said, adding in future as the Indian electric EV segment grows, the company might have to look for additional location in Chennai also.

On the growth expectation from the EV business, he said,""As of September end -- for the first six months -- 25 per cent of the revenue has come from EV. I think by FY25, it should be between 40-45 per cent.""



In the first half of 2022-23, Sona Comstar had posted a revenue of Rs 1,247 crore, up 15 per cent from the year-ago period.

In the domestic market, the company supplies its different EV components to two-wheelers, three-wheelers and even for passenger vehicles, he said, adding for exports it is only four-wheeler for passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles.

Nanda said over the last two to three years, the company has focussed its investments on the R&D, new product development and embarked on electrification journey.

""Our long-term strategy has focused on the electrification of the automobile industry,"" he said, adding the company has also ""built a very solid order book, which was about Rs 20,500 crore by September-end, which gives us a lot of confidence in terms of our future growth"".

Out of the total order book, 68 per cent is from EV programmes.

In the fiscal ended March 31, 2022, the company's order book size was Rs 18,600 crore.

The company has also bagged a contract from an Indian automobile manufacturer to supply differential assemblies for its upcoming EV models in both passenger and commercial vehicles segment. The production for the programme starts in FY24.

""In the overall context, it is a very important project...in terms of size it is not that large. On a Rs 20,500 crore order size, this order size is about Rs 120 crore to Rs 130 crore,"" Nanda said, without disclosing the name of the company.

However, directionally it is important ""as right now, for the same customer we are supplying differential gears (and it is) a step forward from supplying components to subsystems"", he added.

314,Study examines if EVs can power homes during emergencies,https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2022/11/07/4514669_700.jpg,06/11/2022,Nissan Motor Thailand and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) have announced a study of energy conversion between electric vehicles and the country's electrical systems and power grid.,https://www.bangkokpost.com/auto/review/2431599/study-examines-if-evs-can-power-homes-during-emergencies,"Study examines if EVs can power homes during emergencies

Nissan Motor Thailand and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) have announced a study of energy conversion between electric vehicles and the country's electrical systems and power grid.

Nissan and the authority will conduct a field test of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology with Nissan Leaf owners using the authority's bi-directional charging system, the car company said at a recent press conference. Nissan said this marks the largest-scale testing of V2G technology with the Leaf's 40kWh capacity EV battery and the first test of the bi-directional charging system.

The partnership with the authority is part of Nissan's Blue Switch programme, aimed at reducing the car maker's carbon footprint and examining ways for EVs to assist local communities during emergencies by transferring unused energy back to the country's power grid.

Isao Sekiguchi, regional vice-president of Nissan Asean and president of Nissan Motor Thailand, said: ""Nissan has been in the Thai market for 70 years and our commitment to the country, especially in support of creating a more sustainable society through electrification, continues strong.""

Last November, Nissan unveiled Ambition 2030, the company's new long-term vision for empowering mobility and cleaner cars. Under Blue Switch, unveiled in Thailand last January, Nissan has been working with local governments and partners to explore new ways of using EVs for purposes beyond mobility.

The Leaf is one of Thailand's few BEVs that utilises bi-directional charger technology, which is capable of sending energy stored in the vehicle's battery back to a building or grid, allowing Leaf owners to use the vehicle's battery capacity for many ways other than driving. According to Nissan, bi-directional vehicles can safely send energy stored in the battery to the grid during peak energy demand times.

The Leaf's stored power can be used for a variety of home and commercial applications, with the long-term vision of assisting communities during power outages. The Leaf, with its large-capacity battery, can provide electricity to general households/family homes for two-to-three days.

Authority head Boonyanit Wongrukmit said that promoting EVs in local markets is a significant step to moving Thailand towards achieving its carbon neutrality goals by 2050.

""The authority has developed a national grid that is capable of supporting the increasing number of EVs and V2G technology,"" he said. ""The authority has designed and developed the Egat V2G and VPP system that controls power distribution from many EVs back to the grid. This virtual power will be distributed to the Demand Response Control Center under the authority's operations.""

He added that the move supports the ""virtual power plant"" concept that allows for the purchase of excess power generated by EV batteries, which will act as an energy reserve system to be utilised during peak periods, according to the Energy Policy and Planning Office's Smart Grid development plan.

Boonyanit said the information gathered during the study ""will be used for drafting relevant rules and regulations that best support the actual alternative energy consumption in the future"".",electric vehicles,bangkok post
315,5 questions about electrifying trucks,https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/11/electric-truck.jpg?w=1280,06/11/2022,"As part of its effort to reduce air pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, California is pursuing aggressive policies to promote clean trucks.",https://wgntv.com/news/nexstar-media-wire/5-questions-about-electrifying-trucks/,"(The Conversation) – As part of its effort to reduce air pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, California is pursuing aggressive policies to promote clean trucks. The state already requires that by 2035, all new cars and other light-duty vehicles sold in the state must be zero emission. Its powerful Air Resources Board has adopted rules requiring that most trucks be zero emission by 2035, and is now proposing that all trucks sold by 2040 must be zero emission. The Conversation asked a panel of transportation experts from the University of California, Davis what’s involved in such a rapid transition.

1. Why is California targeting medium- and heavy-duty trucks?

Although diesel engines are valuable for moving heavy loads, they also are major polluters. Diesel trucks account for one-fourth of greenhouse gas emissions and about half of conventional air pollution from transportation in U.S. cities.

Pollutants in diesel exhaust include nitrogen oxides, fine particulates and numerous cancer-causing compounds. Since many disadvantaged communities are located near highways and industrial centers, their residents are especially affected by diesel truck pollution. Two regions in California – the Central Valley and Los Angeles-Long Beach – have some of the dirtiest air in the U.S., so the state has placed particular emphasis on cutting diesel use.Almost all diesel fuel in the U.S. is used in trucks, not in passenger vehicles.

2. Are zero-emission trucks ready to go?

To a degree, yes. Some new models, mainly powered by batteries but some by hydrogen fuel cells, are available on the market, and more are being announced almost daily.

But the production volumes are still small, and there are many variations of truck models needed for very diverse applications, from delivering mail locally and plowing snow to hauling goods cross-country. Many of these needs cannot be met with currently offered zero-emission trucks.

Another hurdle is that new electric truck models have higher purchase prices than comparable diesel trucks. However, as the market for zero-emission trucks grows, economies of scale should bring these costs down significantly. We already see this happening with zero-emission cars and light-duty trucks.

The total cost of ownership for zero-emission trucks, which includes the purchase price, fuel costs and maintenance, is already competitive in some applications with conventional diesel trucks. One example is trucks used for local goods delivery by companies like Amazon, UPS and FedEx. This stage is also known as last-mile delivery – getting a product to a buyer’s door.

These trucks are typically driven less than 150 miles per day, so they don’t need large battery packs. Their lower energy costs and reduced maintenance needs often offset their higher purchase costs, so owners save money on them over time.

Our studies indicate that by 2025 and especially by 2030, many applications for battery trucks, and perhaps hydrogen fuel cell trucks, will have competitive or even lower total costs of ownership than comparable diesel trucks. That’s especially true because of California subsidies and incentives, such as the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project, which reduces the cost of new electric trucks and buses. And the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard greatly reduces the cost of low-carbon fuels and electricity for truck and bus fleets.

The market in California is already reacting to these policy signals and is developing quickly. In the past year, there has been a large increase in sales of last-mile electric delivery trucks, and companies have stepped up their pledges to procure such vehicles.

Over 150 zero-emission truck models are commercially available and eligible for state incentive funding. They range from large pickup trucks to heavy-duty tractor units for tractor-trailer combinations.

3. Is there enough charging infrastructure to support all these vehicles?

Providing near-zero-carbon electricity for EVs and hydrogen for fuel cells, and expanding charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure, is just as important as getting zero-emission trucks on the roads.

Fleet owners will need to install chargers that can charge their battery-powered trucks overnight, or sometimes during the day. These stations may require so much power that utilities will need to install additional hardware to bring electricity from the grid to the stations to meet potentially high demands at certain times.This video from the utility Southern California Edison shows some of the steps involved in electrifying medium- and heavy-duty vehicle fleets.

Fuel cell trucks will require hydrogen stations installed either at fleet depots or public locations. These will allow fast refueling without high instantaneous demands on the system. But producing the hydrogen will require electricity, which will put an additional burden on the electric system.

Presently there are few public or private charging or hydrogen stations for truck fleets in California. But the California Public Utility Commission has allowed utilities to charge their customers to install a significant number of stations throughout the state. And the U.S. Department of Energy recently allocated $8 billion for construction of hydrogen hubs – networks for producing, processing, storing and delivering clean hydrogen – across the country.

Despite these efforts, the rollout of charging and hydrogen infrastructure will likely slow the transition to zero-emission trucks, especially long-haul trucks.

4. Who would be affected by a diesel truck ban?

California’s rules will affect both truck manufacturers and truck users. The state’s Advanced Clean Trucks rule, adopted in 2020, requires the sale of increasing percentages of zero emission trucks starting in 2024. By 2035, 40% to 75% of all trucks, depending on the truck type, must be zero emission.

A new proposal scheduled for adoption in early 2023, the Advanced Clean Fleets rule, would require fleets with over 50 trucks to purchase an increasing number of zero-emission trucks over time, with the requirement that all truck sales and purchases be zero emission by 2040.

These two policies would work together. The Advanced Clean Trucks rule ensures that zero-emission trucks will become available to fleets, and the Advanced Clean Fleets rule would give truck manufacturers confidence that the zero-emission trucks they produce will find buyers.

These two rules are the most ambitious in the world in accelerating a transition to zero-emission trucks.

5. Are other states emulating California?

Yes, there is strong interest in many other states in electrifying trucking. Oregon, Washington, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts have already adopted the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, and others are in the process of doing so. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have agreed to work together to foster a self-sustaining market for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.

We expect that transitioning to zero-emission truck fleets will require strong policy support at least until the 2030s and perhaps longer. The transition should become self-sufficient in most cases as production scales up and fleets adapt their operations, resulting in lower costs. This could be soon, especially with medium-duty trucks.

Converting large long-haul trucks will be especially challenging because they need large amounts of onboard energy storage and benefit from rapid refueling. Fuel cell systems with hydrogen may make the most sense for many of these vehicles; fleets will ultimately decide which technologies are best for them.

The transition to zero-emission trucks will be disruptive for many fleets and businesses, and will require government support during the early years of the transition. Overall, though, we believe prospects are bright for zero-emission trucking, with enormous clean air and climate benefits, and eventually, cost savings for truck owners.",electric vehicles,wgn tv chicago
316,When Will Flying Taxis Get Off the Ground?,https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2022/11/07/4514559_700.jpg,06/11/2022,"There's a lot of buzz about flying taxis, even though none are buzzing overhead.",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2431504/when-will-flying-taxis-get-off-the-ground-,"Wisk is developing an automated flying taxi that would seat four passengers but has no pilot on board. Photos by Carolyn Fong for The Wall Street Journal

There's a lot of buzz about flying taxis, even though none are buzzing overhead.

Investors are pouring capital into start-ups racing to develop new electric aircraft that take off and land vertically like a helicopter but fly horizontally like an airplane. Major airlines are investing in some of these start-ups, betting that they will one day zip passengers between airports and city centers much faster than cars or public transit.

They face hurdles. One major issue is they will need enough places for these vehicles to take off and land. Integrating them into existing air-traffic-control systems could also be a challenge.

Gary Gysin, chief executive of Wisk Aero, says he sees a future where air taxis will seem commonplace.

The Bay Area-based company, backed by aerospace giant Boeing Co., is developing an automated flying taxi that would seat four passengers but has no pilot on board.

Boeing CEO David Calhoun said last week the aerospace giant hopes eventual regulatory approval of Wisk's automation will help pave the way for broader use for the technology in commercial aviation.

Mr. Gysin, 63 years old, previously headed Liquid Robotics, which has developed solar- and wave-powered ocean robots. Boeing bought that company in 2016.

He spoke with The Wall Street Journal about his vision for this new form of transportation.

Are these flying taxis for real? And when are we going to see these commonly in U.S. cities?

Yes, they are for real. The large regulatory authorities have strong initiatives to bring these services to market.

There are a lot of entrants in the space, and a lot of people say that they're going to build something. To me, it's like the early auto industry. It's just not possible there are going to be 200 companies that actually survive and build a full-scale airplane that gets certified for flight in the U.S. or flight in Europe.

There are many serious, credible players, and this market will absolutely happen. Maybe 2025 is the first time you might see a piloted version of an air taxi that enters the market. But it's 2025 to the end of the decade when you'll start to see all the action.

It's always a bit alarming when helicopters are flying over your house -- you don't know if the cops are after you, or if you're on the news. Will people inside their homes hear the flying taxis?

They are dramatically quieter than a helicopter. If you spin the blade slower, it's quieter. And so everybody is working on their technologies to make sure the rotors and the blades are big enough so you can spin them slower, still get the lift and propulsion you need and be super quiet.

The loudest part is when you take off and land. The quietest is when you're flying like an airplane.

How will you convince the public that it's safe to fly in?

This form of flying will be safer than any form of aviation that exists today. But: Easy to say. What we need to do is prove it with data.

Do you think that the lack of the pilot in an aircraft will make it harder to comfort nervous passengers who need that convincing?

There's the screen that's in each seat -- it shows your flight route, when you're going to bank, how much time you have left in the flight, etc. At any point in time, you can hit a button and talk to somebody on the ground. For whatever reason, to your point, to get that comfort. There's also a help button inside the cabin, if you want, and again, someone will come on immediately.

We still have humans in the loop, we still have pilots -- they're on the ground. And they are the ones that will be in touch with air-traffic control, they're the ones that will be in touch with the passengers that are on board.

We are flying prescribed routes, but if for some reason, a pilot needs to intervene, they can.

There have been news stories over the years about autonomous vehicles having issues with threat detection on the ground. How do you avoid that in the air? Is it simpler given that there aren't pedestrians in the air for example?

It is a much simpler technical problem. Trying to build an autonomous car is technically -- I don't want to say it's a nightmare -- but it's really hard.

Think about pedestrians, someone on a bike, a ball runs in the street -- on and on and on and on. Lines on the road that may not be super clear. Automating in the airspace already has been done and is being leveraged today.

How will it compare to a taxi ride or UberX ride from O'Hare airport to downtown Chicago? Is the idea that it's the same price, but it'll just be faster?

Yes -- orders of magnitude faster.

And at that price, will it be financially viable for the owner and operator of the flying taxi?

We think it's the only way the market really scales.

Think about it -- no pilot, we don't have the normal pilot-training costs in the cockpit. It's all electric, so there's fewer parts, fewer things to service. So the operating cost for this is pretty low.

What about the infrastructure to make this network possible? What's going to be needed for vertiports in cities, landing spots for these flying taxis? And do buildings need to have reinforced roofs?

No, because these tend to be lighter aircraft than helicopters.

You have to have communications infrastructure to be able to talk to the aircraft. And then where are you going to land? The good news is we don't need an airport. We don't need a runway. You need a pad.

So what do you need there? You need electric charging infrastructure for all-electric aircraft. And then you'll need sensors that are outfitted around a vertiport for autonomous landing.

Our idea is to leverage existing general-aviation airports, existing helipads. You'll see a lot of videos where there's a shiny new vertiport on top of the building. And that's great. But there are also helipads that are unused that are on top of buildings already, and those certainly can be outfitted.",electric vehicles,bangkok post

Poor countries face deep energy and food shortages as wealthy nations bid up the price of fossil fuels, food, and fertilizer while simultaneously cutting off aid to poor countries to develop their own fossil fuel supplies and infrastructure in the name of avoiding climate disaster.

But while politicians, United Nations functionaries, climate activists, jet-setting celebrities, and a compliant media will find creative ways to escalate the narrative of cascading catastrophes, filled with anecdotes of raging waters, oppressive heat, parched soil, and killer storms, the data tells a different and far more promising story. The world hasn’t, in recent decades, made much progress on cutting overall emissions. But it has become much more resilient to all kinds of climate extremes.

Climate adaptation—the actions that societies take to protect their populations from extreme weather, such as storms, floods, droughts, heat waves, and cold snaps—works. It includes all the things people in rich countries take for granted: well-constructed buildings that withstand disasters, dikes and dams that protect from floods, air conditioning and cold storage for food and medicines, early warning systems, well-equipped first responders, and evacuation routes along well-paved roads.

A society’s resilience to climate extremes is closely coupled, of course, with economic development. That includes access to plentiful energy, better technology, improved agriculture, and the ability to pay for better houses and infrastructure. Even a cursory look at the data makes abundantly clear that development has saved millions of lives over the past century. The average resident of Earth today is more than 90 percent less likely to die from floods, droughts, storms, or other extreme climate events today than the 1920s—and that’s almost entirely the result of a phenomenal decline in the number of people living in poverty without access to such things as safe housing, functioning infrastructure, and good institutions.

Economic growth and technological innovation have saved tens of millions of lives from climate extremes over the last century.

Economic growth and technological innovation have saved tens of millions of lives from climate extremes over the last century. Even as global warming heats the planet, we already know that continuing economic development and rising living standards will save countless more lives over the coming decades, especially in the global south.

Yet there will be little acknowledgement of these facts in Egypt. When negotiations turn to adaptation and resilience, the conversation will once again ignore the actual record of climate adaptation, insisting, contrary to the facts, that global vulnerability to climate extremes has radically increased in recent years.

Doing so serves the interests of rich-world governments, whose talk of a climate emergency appeases powerful domestic environmental constituencies that demand limits on further fossil fuel development in poor countries. Poor countries, in turn, marshal claims that climate change is responsible for present-day catastrophes to demand financial resources from rich countries.

But the confusion and disinformation about adaptation that will be on full display in Egypt have also set back efforts to improve climate resilience. That’s because they shift the focus away from proven development pathways, transforming a wildly successful global development project into a zero-sum conflict that pits climate mitigation against adaptation and rich countries against poor.

Why adaptation works

Climate adaptation is one of the great and underappreciated success stories of the last 100 years. The number of deaths associated with extreme weather and climate-related natural disasters has fallen by a factor of 10 over the past century. Adjusted for today’s much larger global population, this mortality has fallen even faster: by a factor of 25.

Well into the 20th century, annual death tolls from climate-related natural disasters numbering in the hundreds of thousands or even millions were routine. In China, the 1887 Yellow River flood killed as many as 2 million people and the 1931 Yangtze-Huai River floods as many as 4 million. Tropical cyclones in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh killed some 61,000 in 1942, 47,000 in 1965, 500,000 in 1970, 50,000 in 1977, and 140,000 in 1991. Famine across India and China regularly killed millions.

Today, deaths in China from flooding number fewer than 500 each year. Cyclones across the Indian subcontinent rarely cause even 1,000 deaths. Neither China nor India has suffered a famine in decades.

These trends long predate knowledge or concern about climate change. But even in the more recent past, for which the data is more reliable and when the effects of global warming had become clearer, the trend shows no sign of stopping. Since the 1980s, the global death rate from these hazards has dropped by 85 percent, including by 52 percent for general floods, 55 percent for heat waves, and 87 percent for storms.

Increased resilience to natural disasters of all sorts is strongly correlated with growing global wealth and improvements in infrastructure, technology, governance, and social services. As those stupendous death tolls from pre-development China and India make clear, the primary beneficiaries have been the globe’s poorest. That is especially true of recent decades, as falling poverty rates, rapid urbanization, and better communications technologies have radically improved the disaster resilience of most populations around the world.

The migration of large populations from rural regions to cities brings with it a shift from unpaved roads and houses often made of mud, which don’t hold up well to storms and flooding, to much more durable infrastructure and housing. Improved sanitation and clean drinking water reduce illness and disease in the aftermath of such events. Better irrigation and crop breeding have reduced the frequency of crop failures resulting from droughts. Refrigeration keeps food from spoiling on its way to markets, and air conditioning helps people keep cool during heat waves.

It is true that climate change can make some aspects of climate extremes worse. A flood, a heat wave, or a hurricane might be intensified by climate change. But in almost all cases, an extreme climate event would still be an extreme event without climate change—it just wouldn’t be quite as extreme. For instance, global warming likely made the high-profile heat wave that struck India in the spring of 2022 about 1 degree Celsius hotter than it would have been otherwise. Warming boosted rainfall from Hurricane Katrina by 4 to 9 percent and from Hurricane Ian by about 10 percent.

Moreover, the human and economic costs of a natural disaster are almost never determined primarily by the intensity of the climate extreme. Rather, those costs are largely determined by how many people are in harm’s way and how well adapted to the hazard those populations are. A Category 1 hurricane making landfall over Port-Au-Prince, Haiti, for instance, would almost certainly result in far greater loss of life than a much more powerful Category 5 hurricane striking Miami. Economic losses, on the other hand, would be greater in Miami, simply because Miami is so much wealthier. But the consequences of those economic losses in terms of livelihoods and human well-being would be much more serious in Port-Au-Prince.

In short, most of the costs associated with present-day climate disasters are due to natural climate variability, not climate change, and are determined by economic development and societal resilience, not the intensity of the climate hazard. For these reasons, the basic formula for adapting to climate change is the same as the formula that has allowed the world to radically reduce the human costs of climate-related disasters over the last century: more wealth, infrastructure, and technology.

How adaptation became a dirty word

Despite overwhelming evidence that humankind has become vastly more resilient to climate extremes—and knows how to further increase its resilience—international efforts to address climate change have largely ignored these facts. Instead of focusing on economic and infrastructure development to raise resilience, policymakers, experts, and activists have focused only on a much smaller set of adaptation measures that would not conflict with their single-minded effort to mitigate carbon emissions.

Al Gore, in his 1992 book, Earth in the Balance, dismissed adaptation as a “kind of laziness, an arrogant faith in our ability to react in time to save our skins.” Over much of the two decades that followed, many climate activists considered “adaptation” to be a dirty word: a form of climate denial that distracted from efforts to cut emissions and ban fossil fuels. Echoes of those claims remain today. For many environmentalists, too much talk of adapting to climate change raises the specter of moral hazard—the concern that focusing on adaptation will draw resources and attention away from efforts to cut emissions.

In 1992, when world leaders adopted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, they recognized the importance of climate adaptation—but only insofar as it was necessary to address climate impacts attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse emissions, ignoring the far greater risks associated with natural extremes. Defining adaptation so narrowly allowed climate advocates to conflate all kinds of natural climate extremes with anthropogenic warming in the climate discourse, exclude economic development processes from the adaptation picture, and obscure the very real trade-offs between emissions mitigation and climate adaptation—especially for poor countries.

Most advocates today can acknowledge that adaptation is a critical global priority but ignore the elephant in the room: Economic development is the pathway to climate resilience.

As a result, most advocates today can acknowledge that adaptation is a critical global priority without acknowledging the elephant in the room, which is that economic development is the pathway to climate resilience and that many of the most critical development processes still require fossil fuels. Instead, climate advocates focus on a narrow set of measures to adapt to climate change that largely sidestep the issue. These include abandoning low-lying coastal regions and flood plains rather than protecting them with infrastructure; so-called natural solutions such as restoring wetlands and forests; and limited technological remedies such as early-warning systems and drought-tolerant crop varieties. The common denominator is that this narrow set of projects does not conflict in any way with the climate movement’s priority of cutting emissions.

Without question, some of these measures have merit. But they entirely ignore the proven mechanisms that have so radically improved global resilience to climate extremes. The reason for this is obvious: Development and resilience require energy—and lots of it.

Not only are most of the mechanisms that make societies resilient to climate change energy-intensive, but they also tend to be poorly suited to current low-carbon technologies, particularly renewable energy. Drought-tolerant crops are important. But so are synthetic fertilizers, which are essential to raising agricultural yields and improving food security across Africa and other low-income regions. So, too, is large-scale irrigation. But unlike seeds, synthetic fertilizer is manufactured with natural gas, and irrigation requires a continuous supply of electricity that renewable energy is ill-suited to provide.

Food security does not end on the farm. In Nigeria, 45 percent of fresh produce rots due to the lack of refrigeration. Globally, 1.3 billion tons of perishable food goes to waste each year because of lack of proper post-harvest storage, almost all of it in poor countries. Cold storage and reliable transportation are central to robust food supply chains that are resilient to drought and variations in temperature. But like irrigation and fertilizer production, cold storage is energy-intensive and therefore the preserve of rich and middle-income countries. The United States, for example, uses 50 times as much energy per capita for cold storage as Africa.

To better cope with storms and floods, poor countries need to pave roads, construct dikes, and build resilient homes, schools, and hospitals. This, too, takes plentiful energy. Resilient structures require concrete and steel, which use large amounts of energy in their manufacture. These processes require very high temperatures that can only be attained with fossil fuels. Roads require large amounts of asphalt—a product of petroleum refining.

Paved roads, furthermore, don’t do much good without vehicles. But the world is still decades away from cost-effective electric vehicles and charging infrastructure that could plausibly meet critical transportation needs in places such as sub-Saharan Africa.

In these and so many other ways, efforts to improve global resilience to climate extremes and natural disasters depend on the availability of many kinds of critical infrastructure and adaptive capabilities. Almost all of these require fossil energy. They are either difficult to electrify—such as industrial processes and transportation—which makes them poor candidates to power with renewable energy, or they require continuous power that variable energy sources such as wind and solar cannot currently provide in a cost-effective manner.

The contrast between energy-intensive, society-wide adaptation that demonstrably makes countries more resilient to climate change and the narrow set of adaptation projects that feature at U.N. climate negotiations reveals just how unserious international adaptation efforts actually are. By ignoring proven adaptation processes, climate advocates have been able to shoehorn into a narrow and limited set of adaptation measures not requiring fossil energy capacious demands for climate mitigation while simultaneously insisting that adaptation is a fool’s errand without rapid and deep emissions cuts.

The practical result has been to deemphasize adaptation, pit it against mitigation, and, unconscionably, obstruct the single most important dimension along which the world has made progress to address the problem. Today, the European Union, the Biden administration, and environmental groups based in and financed by the West advocate for blanket bans on international finance for all fossil fuel infrastructure in the name of climate mitigation. This creates no ostensible conflict with international climate adaptation commitments only because all the critical adaptation processes requiring fossil fuels-based development have literally been defined out of the international framework.

All of this, ironically, has been done in the name of saving the global poor from climate catastrophes, even as it has put countless lives at risk by not only ignoring processes that increase resilience but actively obstructing them.

What poor and developing countries should do now

Why, then, have most poor nations signed onto the international framework for climate action, even though they know that poverty and lack of economic development represent a far greater threat to the health and well-being of their populations than climate change?

The answer should be obvious. The U.N. climate framework was predicated on a grand bargain: In exchange for a global commitment to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures, rich nations would cut emissions deeply, underwrite the cost of a clean energy transition in poor countries, and finance adaptation and development to ensure that poor countries would be resilient to the impacts of warming that couldn’t be avoided.

Poor countries bought into this plan in hopes that it would lead to more development support—and out of fear that, without a seat at the table, development aid and access to Western technology and markets would be cut off. But in the 30 years since that framework was adopted, none of these promises have materialized. In Egypt, poor countries would therefore be well advised to reconsider whether continued obeisance to the current climate policy framework serves their needs and interests.

The siren song of recompense for climate damage and unrequited requests for adaptation funding haven’t gotten roads paved, houses built, or modern irrigation, water, and sewage systems installed. Instead, poor countries have inadvertently legitimized catastrophic, wildly exaggerated claims about future climate impacts and their relationship to emissions. These claims, in turn, have justified Western efforts to restrict poor countries’ development of energy resources and infrastructure—the prerequisite for climate resilience.

Over the last decade, international negotiations to address climate change have made a partial and welcome shift. Instead of attempts to negotiate a legally binding treaty to limit warming, climate summits have shifted toward voluntary and bottom-up commitments by national governments to shift their economies away from fossil fuels in ways consistent with other critical priorities, not least economic development.

Poor countries have inadvertently legitimized catastrophic, wildly exaggerated claims about future climate impacts and their relationship to emissions.

But these negotiations remain saddled with arbitrary and nonbinding commitments to emissions targets and temperature thresholds, which have become the basis for restrictions by Western governments and multilateral organizations on development finance. All this is happening despite only weak evidence, at best, of a relationship between any specific temperature threshold and catastrophic climate impacts on human societies.

A complete shift of international efforts to address climate change toward a shared global effort to accelerate economic development, build resilient infrastructure, and accelerate low-carbon innovation and deployment is long overdue. Poor countries, which are directly affected, should lead the push.

There are many good reasons to attempt to limit global warming. But precisely how much the Earth warms will not be the main determinant of how climate change will impact human societies. Nor will focusing on wealth, development, infrastructure, and technology preclude a shift away from greenhouse emissions, as many activists would have us believe. To the contrary, there is very good reason to believe that economic growth and development over the rest of this century will be much less carbon-intensive than it was over the last century.

Emissions have already peaked in most rich nations and are now declining, even after one accounts for the outsourcing of carbon-intensive industries to less developed regions. Wind, solar, and even battery technologies have become much more viable technologically and economically, offering real alternatives to fossil fuels in many contexts. Europe has largely reversed its opposition to nuclear energy, dozens of new nuclear plants are under construction across Asia, and a new generation of advanced, safe, small-scale nuclear technologies finally promises to make clean nuclear energy cheaper and more accessible for poor countries, too.

These developments promise to mitigate—but won’t eliminate—global dependence on fossil fuels. Too many uses of fossil fuels remain critical, especially for developing economies. But even here, there is much promise: Africa, where the majority of the world’s population growth will occur over the rest of this century, has abundant natural gas and hydroelectric resources. That could allow Africa to leapfrog coal, the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel, even while it uses oil and gas in key sectors of its economy.

Stopping global warming will require the world to cease burning fossil fuels entirely at some point. But a wealthier, more resilient, and more equitable world will have both more time and more resources to do so. The remarkable and largely untold story of adaptation to climate extremes by development shows how.

Putting these lessons into practice, however, will require poor countries to stand up to the easy moralizing and hypocrisy of Western governments and climate advocates—and loudly reject the false constraints that international climate diplomacy has attempted to impose on their development over the last 30 years. Sharm el-Sheikh, an eco-fantasia built by the Egyptian government to cater to European tourists, would be a fitting place to do so—because, just like Sharm el-Sheikh, the U.N. climate framework was constructed to serve rich-world governments and Western environmentalists. This month, developing-world leaders couldn’t ask for a better and more symbolic place to abandon it.",electric vehicles,foreign policy

Welcome to Solvay Q3 2022 Results Call for Analysts and Investors. Solvay team the floor is yours.

Jodi Allen

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. This is Jodi Allen, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by our CEO, Ilham Kadri; and our CFO, Karim Hajjar. To start, we want to apologize for the delayed start today, as we were busy managing some technical issues that seem to be behind us.

Today's call is being recorded and will be made available for replay on the Investor Relations section of our website. I would like to remind all participants that the presentation includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You may refer to the slides related to today's broadcast, which are available on our website.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Ilham.

Ilham Kadri

Thank you very much, Jodi, and hello everyone. I'll begin my remarks as always with a health and safety overview. Compared to the third quarter of 2021, the reportable injury and illness rates are down across the group and COVID cases continue to decline so the situation is truly under control. As usual, we continue working hard to raise the bars towards a zero incident goal.

Moving on now to our results. I'm very, very proud beyond proud actually of the results we achieved this quarter and this entire year-to-date setting new records in so many areas. You've heard me talk about the quality of our team and the strong performance. It's a testament to their efforts and hard work. And it's not just the results this quarter that I'm proud of, it's a journey that we have all been on together over the past 3.5 years.

I'm truly humbled and when I look at what has been accomplished since I joined the company. And one thing is very clear, Solvay today is not the same company, it was back in the beginning of 2019. Thanks to the hard work of our talented teams, we have undergone a complete transformation. And today, we are a stronger company and we are better positioned for future growth.

We've grown EBITDA over 30% year-to-date versus 2021 and this excludes any impact from currency. When I look back further and factoring in our upgraded 2022 guidance, we are on track to grow EBITDA by 11% since 2019 despite the 2020 pandemic. We improved operational efficiency by demonstrating cost discipline through challenging times, which included the delayering of the organization. Our total cost savings since 2019 has reached €450 million and we will deliver our targeted €500 million in structural cost reductions ahead of our 2024 commitments.

We strengthened our customer partnership and frontline organizations. You can now see the value proposition we create for our customers is real and we have the innovations and margins to back it. And we have demonstrated an improved steadier free cash flow generation that is enabling us to take big bets and invest for our future. This is in fact the 14th consecutive quarter of positive cash generation.

Another metric I'm truly and particularly proud of is our returns. We reached an all-time record high ROCE return on capital employed at 15.4%, almost double the level of 8.2% at the end of 2018. This is truly a remarkable progress. We've done this by raising the bar operationally, optimizing our industrial footprint, upgrading the quality of our portfolio of businesses, pruning those businesses that couldn't be improved further prioritizing and focusing on higher-end specialties growth as we deliver the value propositions our products and solutions bring to our customers. And obviously we will continue to prune our portfolio.

In fact, we didn't stop at operational performance. You can also see the results of our actions to improve the balance sheet, while funding our pension. You may not realize it but our debt and pensions were reduced by €3.4 billion or 40% since 2019 and the pension cash out is down over 60% from €216 million in 2019 to around €85 million this year. In fact, we currently have the lowest ever leverage in the history of the company now at 1.2 times versus start of 2019, which was 2.1 times. And with this, you can [indiscernible] is pleased with these accomplishments.

So coming back to Q3 specifically. Our businesses continue to perform strongly against the backdrop of significant inflationary pressures. Sales grew almost 30% to €3.6 billion in quarter three and this was led by pricing, while the demand momentum continued in several key markets where we also saw some volume growth in addition to pricing. These markets included automotive driven by electrification and continued penetration of our Specialty Polymers.

Aerospace, driven by higher single-aisle aircraft rates, thanks to the continuing recovery. Agro, sector driven by demand from more sustainable chemistries used in crop protection. Mining, driven by high production rates especially in copper. And of course, in Oil and Gas Volumes were also higher given the current robust demand. In essence, our best-in-class portfolio enabled us to capture this growth and in fact grow our sales above market growth rates in each of these areas.

From a geographic view, we reported double-digit sales growth in all regions. I would like to highlight Europe's growth at 42% followed by Asia Pacific region growth at 30%. Q3 EBITDA was up about 40% on a comparable scope and foreign exchange basis with all three segments contributing to earnings growth, thanks to value pricing and resilient volume. This translated to an EBITDA margin in quarter three of 25.4% in fact two percentage points higher than quarter three last year reflecting the improved operating leverage. Free cash flow was €452 million in the third quarter, the 14th consecutive quarter of positive cash generation.

Now speaking of CapEx, we have many investments underway to support our growth. These investments are in technologies and processes that we know and we master across our business segments.

Remember, earlier this year we shared our plans to invest in a fully-integrated suspension PVDF operation in Tavaux in France, making it the largest PVDF production site in the European region to support the growth in EV battery markets.

Our strategy is to build regional capacities in the high-end product for high-end markets, in France to support customers in the European region and in the US for customers in North America. Why? Because customers prefer a local source to supply their needs and the authorities provide substantial incentives in order to localize strategic supply chains such as electrification.

Our strategy has been to fully integrate our suspension PVDF production, with security of supply of raw materials, which are critical, while being cost competitive and align with best-in-class leading partners to derisk our investment.

So, today, I'm extremely excited to announce the next steps of our global strategy, which is to expand these critical materials that support the electrification trend into North America. This time we are pleased to be working with a great partner Orbia who is the leader in their field.

Orbia brings the key raw materials necessary including, fluorspar which enables Solvay's production of PVDF. I must say firsthand, that this is, in many ways, an ideal partnership with two strong complementary leaders coming together to create a locally-produced vertically-integrated competitive supply chain, which will enable production of suspension-grade PVDF to serve some of the leading battery makers in North America.

You may have heard the big news last week from the Biden administration which awarded Solvay with $178 million of government funding. These elements of supply security and financial support further derisk these sizable projects, which, by the way, has extremely compelling returns and is expected to be commercial by 2026.

And we are not only making investments with the future SpecialtyCo side of our portfolio, but we also have a number of opportunities in EssentialCo. In addition to our battery focus and to further support the green energy transition, we've also made an announcement in September related to our ambition to create a powerful rare earth hub in Europe starting in La Rochelle, France by entering the magnet value chain.

Then in October, we took another step to advance our rare earth specialties by taking full ownership of our stake in Japan, further leveraging our global plans in rare earth chemistry. As you know, rare earth metals are essential to ensure the green energy transition and support development of more sustainable solutions for electric mobility and clean energy generation.

In July, we announced our plans to expand electronic-grade H2O2 production in the US to meet the increasingly stringent specification of the semiconductor industry and we have more peroxide opportunity underway which we will share in due time.

And in soda ash, as you know, we expanded natural soda ash in the US by acquiring the minority position of our Green River, Wyoming operations announced in May. But the markets will also need additional capacities, as it will remain very tight at least for the five years to come with fast-growing demand in lithium carbonate and photovoltaic panels, as well as in bicarbonate flue gas treatment and pharma applications on the top of building and construction.

Our improved cash generation and our strong balance sheet has enabled us to make all of these investments, each with attractive returns and in attractive markets, where we have leading technologies that offer significant value to our customers.

We know that we are facing challenging times, but we have the strategic focus and the financial resources, not just to navigate these times confidently, but to emerge again and again with strong growth at the right time.

Finally, our teams continue their journey of bringing new technology and process innovations to the market. In September, as you may have heard, we announced that we are reinventing our own 160-year-old soda ash process. This major milestone will enable three improvements, almost revolutionary ones.

The process will lead to 50% less CO2 emissions and this is aligned and will enable our carbon neutrality for soda ash obviously One Planet climate ambition. It will reduce water and brine consumption and last but not the least, will eliminate limestone residue to the sea.

We're also continuing to evolve our sustainability ambitions in soda ash and have recently established partnership to create a circular economy for soda ash production in Rosignano Italy that will support our lower carbon footprint ambition.

We also have an exciting new innovation to share based on sodium bicarbonate called Alve-One, which was awarded the 2022 Pierre Potier Prize. It offers a sustainable alternative to the incumbent hazardous chemical blowing agents used for thermoplastic foams with 10 times lower CO2 equivalent emissions. In fact our innovation has been accredited as a safe substitute for ADCA, this is Azodicarbonamide, which has been classified by REACH as a substance of very high concern.

Finally, I'm so pleased to share that our Actizone F5. You may remember, we launched it during COVID-19, Solvay's innovative 24-hour antimicrobial sanitizing technology that we launched back in September 2020 in Europe is now fully approved by the EPA in the United States of America.

Now Karim will take us through the group segments and the financial performance in more detail. Karim, the floor is yours.

Karim Hajjar

Thank you, Ilham. Good morning and good afternoon, of course, everybody. I'm going to go directly to our business review. And as usual, I'm going to refer to figures on an organic basis. Meaning at constant scope, constant currency, unless of course I indicate otherwise.

Sales in the Materials segment increased 37% driven by strong demand for Specialty Polymers and for Composite Materials and it led to record third quarter sales and earnings.

Turning to Specialty Polymers, sales reached new records that were up 40%, compared with the third quarter of 2021. They were up 5%, against a very strong quarter second quarter of this year with both pricing and volumes contributing to that growth.

We saw continued strong demand in markets such as Automotive including EV batteries Electronics including smart devices as well as Healthcare applications such as hemodialysis and pharmaceutical packaging.

Our sales in Automotive outgrew the market due to our leading positions in strongly-growing electrification and lightweighting applications. I know that this is not new news, but the momentum continues.

You may recall in fact last quarter I highlighted our new PVDF capacities that came online in China, thereby doubling our production capacities to meet the growing demand in electric and hybrid vehicles.

Ilham today just now mentioned our investment in North America, which is designed and will capture a significantly leading piece of the growing market there. This decision not only positions us to capture strong growth through the years to come, but it will also generate very attractive returns, way beyond the minimum thresholds we set.

Our efforts over the years are paying off and it is evident that we have the right innovation and the differentiated portfolio, to best meet the needs of our customers in this very attractive growth market.

The most recent market forecast for 2022 from LMC indicates growth of around 7%, in light-duty vehicle production globally and beyond the auto market its worth noting that, Specialty Polymers delivered growth in the Electronic market, as customers continue to invest in semiconductor production and an expanding 5G infrastructures.

Growth in Healthcare was also strong in areas such as biomaterials, medical devices and pharma packaging. Sales in Composite Materials grew 27% year-on-year particularly strong sales growth to the Civil Aerospace market.

Now, that was largely driven by production increases in single-aisle programs, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320.

Also there was some recovery which is really good to see in the Boeing 777 cargo and the respective engine part programs as well as a very strong rebound in the Business Jet segments which makes for a very healthy Civil Aerospace profile in Q3, whereas sales to the Space and the Defense were flat year-on-year.

Supply chain issues, slower production rate at some key customers, sales of composite materials to the high-performance automotive market grew by double-digits, as our innovative materials contribute critically to lightweighting and design flexibility.

In addition to the aforementioned market tailwinds, customers gave substantial attention to our ability to deliver products, despite inflationary cost raw material availability -- that's a tongue twister and despite logistic constraints which are facing the industry. They've really seen us work to overcome these challenges.

And frankly it was great for me to meet the Materials team last week on their way back from a very successful case there in Germany which had just wrapped up. The team, are energized. They were energized to see their customers', partners face-to-face again and coming back plenty of ideas and possibilities.

I spoke to a couple of them earlier in the week they are fully mobilized and they're going to focus on converting, these ideas these opportunities into solutions for our customers of course but also critically into more growth and more business for Solvay. So watch this space.

Wrapping up Materials, segment EBITDA increased 43% compared to the third quarter last year, reflecting both price and volume growth in Specialty Polymers and in Composite Materials. And that's what led to a record 34.6% EBITDA margin in the third quarter up almost two percentage points in the quarter thanks to improved volume and mix.

Moving to Chemicals on slide number 7, third quarter sales rose 34% as we were, again able to manage inflationary costs with price increases. Volumes declined 5% overall in the segment, mainly because of reduced demand at Coatis and some production issues which I'll detail further as I go into each business.

Soda Ash & Derivatives sales increased 55%, thanks to the continued demand strength on tight supply and with price increases that offset the significant rise in energy costs. End markets for our products remained solid, in Soda Ash and in Bicarbonate.

Volume was down very slightly, as our growth was constrained in the quarter, mainly by industrial outages at our Natural Soda Ash facility in the U.S. The war in Ukraine and resulting embargo in solid fuels like anthracite and coal which are used for energy generation had an impact.

And that wasn't a significant impact there was also an effect on our industrial production efficiency and impacted volumes as well obviously. Peroxides sales were up 29% driven by pricing. Volume was down slightly, as strong demand in electronics and graphic paper markets were insufficient to fully compensate for the reduced demand for HPPO from our mega plants.

For those of you who attended our webinar, on our Peroxides business about a month ago, this quarter, you'll recall that we provided details about that business and we demonstrated a proven track record of strong, resilient, cash generation and very high cash conversion.

We also detailed our well-established strength against competitors in terms of costs, scale, process, technology leadership. And of course, we laid out our focus on the most attractive market segments in Peroxides as we look to the future.

The Coatis business is facing the normalization we've been anticipating with sales down this quarter by 1% on an organic basis, coming from decreased volumes against a relatively strong third quarter last year.

Now, although pricing remains slightly positive, as I said volumes were down, predominantly in Latin America, but also the business in Europe is also currently at low-levels. In Silica, sales grew 34%, pricing actions across the tire and in the industrial markets that we serve were able to more than offset the slight volume reduction.

Looking at the Chemicals segment overall, EBITDA was up 22%, thanks to higher prices across all businesses. The Chemicals segment delivered an EBITDA margin of 25.2%, which is down 2.1% against Q3 last year. But if we exclude the impacts of Coatis and RusVinyl, I know this to be cyclical in a way then the segment EBITDA margin actually stable with the third quarter last year despite the very significant increase in energy-related costs.

Coatis and RusVinyl continue to normalize to mid-cycle levels versus the high cycles we've had the benefit of enjoying the last couple of years and that reflects the competitive pressure ramping up combining with demand softening in those two businesses respectively.

Turning to the Solutions segment on slide number eight, you will see that sales in that segment in Q3 were up 20%, driven by price increases whereas volumes were modestly lower. Strong demand in Agro, Electronics, Mining were the biggest growth drivers in the segment.

In Novecare, sales increased 20% year-on-year mainly due to pricing as volumes were slightly down overall in the quarter. Growth in Agro was again driven by demand for green solvents and crop protection applications. Demand was pretty resilient in Home and Personal Care whereas volumes in Coatings were slightly down as it is associates as you will appreciate to the construction market that is slowing down, particularly in North America.

Special Chem sales increased 23% thanks to strength in semiconductors and this was partially offset by weakness in the Rare Earth Specialties business which goes into automotive catalysts and we see softer demand there.

Technology Solutions sales increased 16% organically due to sustained demand in mining particularly copper mining as the team was awarded new business thanks to the new mine that started in Latin America.

Aroma Performance sales were up 13% in the quarter. Now although demand was strong enough to allow for price increases in the Food & Beverage sectors as well as Flavors & Fragrances, volumes declined in the quarter as some products turned along on the added capacities and on the back of exports from China-based peers. Nevertheless, pricing more than offset cost inflation.

Turning to Oil & Gas & Solutions, sales grew 26% continuing the strong momentum we've seen in the first half of this year. The strong sales performance was driven by price and volume increases with overall demand for oil and gas and chemicals being supported by high levels of oil prices.

Third quarter EBITDA in the segment rose 21% extending further the trend of the first half of the year. EBITDA margin in the segment was 0.8 percentage points to 19.1%.

When we compare the EBITDA margin for that segment with the 17.8% levels that we saw in 2019 to 2021, it really shows the impact of the transformation -- the impact of the value over volumes pricing strategy as we go to market and we really meet our customers' needs.

And frankly it reflects our team's unrelenting focus on meeting across our customers' needs for higher value products as well as the benefits of the structural cost reductions that have been sustained in each of those businesses.

Turning to Corporate & Business Services activities, EBITDA was a negative €19 million in the third quarter, much lower than the €15 million negative of last year. And actually quite a bit lower obviously than the €84 million negative result in the second quarter of this year.

There are two main drivers to that improvement. One our energy business generated double-digit profit this quarter which is great to see after recent quarters of modest losses.

Now, we made tremendous efforts to stabilize that business and this is showing through in terms of results. But I will say that it's important to stay cautious because it -- just look around those energy markets especially in Europe remain challenging and certainly remain volatile. But it's great to see that improvement.

The second reason that our results in Corporate & Business Services improved it's frankly that we have now passed the peak -- the point of peak investments in cybersecurity and digital transformation and our spending in the third quarter is now back to more normal levels.

Now, on slides nine and 10, you can see the details on the EBITDA impact which I've said previously even -- in fact 40% year-on-year. The strong pricing in the quarter amounted to €836 million.

At the EBITDA level, it is more than offsetting the €485 million increase in variable costs. And in fact you can see the net impact of €351 million on both sides. Along obviously with some help from volume and mix and that more than compensated for the increase in fixed costs that result both from inflation that we're all going through but also the investments we're making.

Now, before turning to cash flow and since Ilham already highlighted the strength of our balance sheet, I would like to bring your attention to an increase recorded within environmental provisions. Thanks to the recent completion of technical studies of analysis of remedial steps for certain costs over the next 20 years and intended to meet our legal obligations related to the past use of fluorosurfactants in our West Deptford, New Jersey facility, we made a provision of €93 million in terms of anticipated remediation costs.

Now, I will turn to cash on slide 12. Free cash flow reached €452 million in Q3. The strong EBITDA growth nearly offset the higher working capital which increased due to price and cost inflation and to higher value inventories. Indeed, it's worth noting that working capital increased by €547 million compared to the end of September 2021, that's around €0.5 billion.

But -- and here's the important piece. The strong focus the discipline that's helped us to deliver the cash flow comes from the fact that we're managing working capital very, very tightly.

Our working capital to sales now stands at 12.4% stronger than the 14.5% that we reported at the end of Q3 2021. And actually to remind you it compares with 17% as being the industry benchmark. The 12.4% versus 17% industry that helps to generate the cash.

But also as Ilham highlighted, we are making strategic investments this year to support future growth and so our CapEx increased to €233 million for the quarter. And finally and very importantly, free cash flow conversion stood at 36.8%.

Now, given the high level of free cash flow and in line with the dividend policy of the company, the Board of Directors has validated the decision to pay an interim gross dividend of €1.54 per share.

For those who are not familiar with Solvay, the dividend policy states that the interim dividend payable in January will represent 40% of the total dividend paid in the previous year.

Now, this will leave us the flexibility to fix the final dividend in early 2023 taking into account the full year performance in 2022, but also the investment needs of the company as well as, of course, the prospects for 2023.

And with that, I'll hand the floor back to Ilham. Ilham?

Ilham Kadri

Thank you very much, Karim. As you know, the excellent results that Karim just detailed led us to pre-announce on October 24 and raise our full year 2022 EBITDA guidance, so around 28% organic growth relative to the full year 2021, which equates to around €3.2 billion using current ForEx rates. This compares with our previous guidance of 14% to 18% organic growth issued in July.

To give you some additional color on the updated guidance we considered the strong performance year-to-date as well as our current view of the fourth quarter. Starting with costs, we estimate the increase in our variable costs in the range of 35% to 40% for the full year 2022, which is roughly in line with what we saw in quarter three.

Turning to demand. As we look at our fourth quarter order books, we see signs of demand moderation across most businesses. Now in Materials, underlying demand remains solid in key markets but some customers in Europe particularly, have indicated that they will be managing their inventories more closely in the coming months in anticipation of a potential downturn.

In chemicals, demand for soda ash remained strong. While in Silica, we are preparing to adapt production in some sites in response to a softening demand environment. In Solutions, the agro market remains healthy, though we see softening in areas such as Coatis and consumer-facing markets. None of these indicators are alarming to us and in many cases demand levels seem to be only modestly below normal seasonal patterns as we head toward the end of the year.

So today, I'm also pleased to share that due to our improved performance, we're increasing our full year 2022 free cash flow guidance to deliver around €1 billion. This strong performance will be delivered whilst also increasing our CapEx, which we now expect to reach around €1 billion by year-end as we accelerate our growth plans. Our cash flow will also be delivered despite a significant increase in working capital, because we will stay single-mindedly disciplined in our focus on cash.

Looking ahead into 2023, we are cautious about the environment yet confident in our ability to navigate challenging conditions. Although some of the weakness we expect in quarter four may well worsen into next year we are equipped and we are ready to respond to such challenges effectively. Notwithstanding, the possibility that there could be some easing in variable costs, we are working with our commercial teams to ensure that we meet our customers' expectations and needs and thus we preserve our leading margins wherever possible.

Most importantly, remember what I just said earlier that today we are better and stronger company and we have demonstrated this repeatedly over the last 3.5 years. And even if markets and macroeconomic conditions worsen, you can expect us to do better than peers, because we have structurally improved on so many measures, not the least with much lower cyclicality than in the past.

Thank you for listening. And now time, Karim and I will take your questions. Thank you.

Jodi Allen

Thank you, Ilham. We will now proceed to the Q&A portion. And I will kindly ask that you try to limit yourself to one question per person if possible so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Moderator, please go ahead.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Yates from Bank of America. Sir, please go ahead.

Matthew Yates

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Karim, perhaps a question for you just on this incremental provision you took. If I remember correctly, in 2019, you estimated the cost would be about €3 million. Now, you're saying €93 million, so that's obviously a very significant change. Can you just elaborate a little bit more what's happened in the interim? Does this include legal fees as well as sort of physical restoration and whether there's any other sites beyond New Jersey that we need to consider?

Karim Hajjar

Thanks Matthew. Good afternoon. I honestly don't recall anything to do with 2019. What we have been doing every year is disclosing very clearly the contingent liabilities and we couldn't make any provisions notwithstanding our desire to do so, because we hadn't -- we didn't have a basis for reasonable estimates.

Now what's different and why do we make a provision now? The answer is very straightforward and that we've now undertaken independent detailed technical studies aimed at quantifying precisely, let's say with reasonable confidence the future to cost of remediation over the next 20 years. And that is an estimate and now that we have it, we didn't hesitate to make that provision. It's just around €100 million and not $93 million.

So this really reflects let's say, the application of a prudent policy. And in 20 years, what I will say maybe as well as that €93 million, we're going to do our best to accelerate and front load the remediation works. But it will go with 20 years and it certainly, won't have a material impact on our cash generation.

Matthew Yates

Okay. And then do you mind if I…

Karim Hajjar

Sorry, go ahead Ilham.

Ilham Kadri

Matt, you had another question?

Matthew Yates

Yes.

Ilham Kadri

Go ahead, Matthew.

Matthew Yates

Yes, if that's okay. Just on the Materials business, if I look at Q3, you've made about €150 million more in EBITDA versus the same quarter in 2019, which is a phenomenal achievement. I'd just like to understand that a little bit better. You referenced a number of €450 million of structural cost savings at the group level. That's on an annualized basis. Can you break that down? How much of that specifically relates to the Materials division on the cost side? Thank you.

Ilham Kadri

Yes. Well, listen, on the -- indeed you've seen it very well Matthew and I'm really glad to see Materials and the SpecialtyCo, part of the SpecialtyCo really getting more pricing and more volume growth consistently. Where we see it is in the automotive, for example, market driven by electrification and continued penetration of our Specialty Polymers.

Remember, Matthew, we replace metal. We penetrate each car making it lighter. Therefore, it consume less fuel, it emits less CO2, and therefore, it enables clean mobility. So that's move not only in ICE internal combustion engine cars, but also the move to EV and hybrid. It's positive to Solvay, because we can double our revenues by car and you're going to see it consistently in the coming years.

Aerospace, also had a very good quarter. August was really a good month for us, driven by higher civil aircraft rate, as I said. You see continuing recovery. Imported material composite sales was 28%, as you've seen probably in the financial report outperforming closest peers and across market segment actually, and this is really good. Although, we have been struggling in Europe in the past with supply chain and labor constraints, facing the industry we could really get -- diminished the backlog.

The Agro was good, more sustainable chemistries, and obviously, other businesses. So that's what we've seen really in the Materials. On the cost, yes, I mean very glad to see €450 million and this is going to happen much faster than 2024. It reflects -- remember that we have been doing some restructuring in the company delayering since 2019. In corporate services, et cetera, and restructuring of composites, right, which was really -- brought a lot of benefit.

You remember that we shut down and we closed low returns, return capital employed assets, right? And 2020 crisis, we didn't waste that crisis and it helps us already to do some very good restructuring in some of the lowest return assets, and we are very glad. I'm very positive about the speed with which we are bringing this €500 million in debt.

Matthew Yates

Thank you both.

Operator

The next question comes from Chetan Udeshi from JPMorgan. Sir, please go ahead.

Chetan Udeshi

Yes. Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. I think the first question I wanted to ask was, and maybe I'm -- let's put it this way, most companies in chemicals in Europe seem to think they can hold prices even if demand weakens. And maybe it's a straight question to you Ilham and Karim both. If I look at the bridge for first three quarters, you guys have had over €700 million of positive net pricing. Now, of course, I think, you probably will also indicate the same that you'll aim to hold prices.

My question is, are there any pockets within the portfolio where you think we should be more careful in terms of assessing the pricing outlook as we go into next year? I mean, if you feel -- I mean, I would be more interested in how much of this €700 million, can you actually sustain going forward? That was the first question.

The second question going back to the US investment. Can you help us contextualize in terms of the capacity of that investment? Will it be closer to what you will have in France 35000 tonnes? Is it lower is it higher? Any sort of color on how much tonnes are you adding in the US?

Ilham Kadri

Okay. Yes, thank you very much Chetan for those questions. On pricing, yes, it's a legitimate question. We hear it from our investors and discuss it with customers. Remember that we've made a significant progress in the last years, right, building competencies in our commercial teams. I don't want you to think and have any doubt that -- this is not a top-down push from Brussels to the rest of the world in our commercial teams.

I told you that in H2 last year, we start training the muscle called pricing and value pricing. We've seen some inflation last year and obviously, we were prepared when the crisis started this year with the Russian war. And basically, we already started at the fall last year to renegotiate our contracts and really look at our gaps, et cetera.

So the net pricing you see today, Chetan, even if you exclude variable cost of use, but also fixed cost and even the hedging it remains positive. So indeed we came a long way a long way. So in general, as all -- remember that each and every one of our business has a leading position in that marketplace. This is important, right, because when you're a leader, you are also a price leader. And we have built these positions with our customers over time.

When you look at the portfolio and go into more specific around half of the portfolio actually shy of half can be supply-demand related. And we have enjoyed a site supply situation in 2022. And for much portion of this portfolio, I'm talking about soda ash, I'm talking about peroxides and some others, the supply will remain tight as we look forward, right. So this is important and this is structural for the next few years. and we are a leader in these markets and we have many contracts with pricing mechanism. supporting cost of shop. And more recently as I told you second half of last year we reviewed the thousands of contracts in the company. We put energy surcharges. and sometimes even logistic surcharges like in peroxide. so we expect to keep that portion of our pricing power in this area, and obviously. it's a pricing mechanism.

And there is a smaller portion that is not structural side. We would adapt price volume we call it price volume elasticity to keep our critical market share. Let's move now to the second half of our portfolio, which I would call more of a specialty pricing driven and this is where we sell -- we don't sell products. We sell a value proposition and we invoice products. And we are learning how to do it better and better, because solutions are customized, innovative solutions that are designed to meet specific customer needs including the way we are packaging shipping our stock or safety stock.

So in these specialties those industries are more risk averse to change with high barrier to entry, they have longer qualification time. And as I've said before, we offer mission-critical here including lower total cost of ownership. It's not because the customer is buying at a higher dollars or euro that the total cost of ownership is not lower. Actually often it's lower. And of course, we offer security of supply which often these days come over pricing.

For this part of the portfolio, we will continue pushing the value pricing. I think it's a new culture and top selling products that invoice them to protect our margin. And have -- we have recently demonstrated that. So we also know that our customers understand that sustained level of profitability gives us the currency, the confidence and the willingness to reinvest in capacity innovation and our energy transition.

I'll tell you I was in the construct [ph] in Düsseldorf with the team Karim talked about this event for materials. And many customers were asking for I couldn't say it. Our investments in the US in batteries, right. Material I met recently saw the ash as customers who are telling me that the market they know it is tight until 2027. What can we do about that? And this is in our common interest. Between suppliers and customers you need to have a win-win situation. And we support our customers to also drive pricing down the value chain. So listen decent pricing and profitability creates a virtuous circle that helps everyone. There was another question?

Karim Hajjar

PVDF, the investment Ilham.

Ilham Kadri

So what was the question? I'm sorry.

Karim Hajjar

Chetan, can you repeat your question perhaps?

Chetan Udeshi

Yes I was just trying to – yes, just any color on the capacity of – especially, if you can't give a fixed number but how should we think versus your investment or capacity in France for instance?

Ilham Kadri

Okay. Yes, yes. No third question. You will understand and I think I said this before and it's not new that disclosing capacity is competitively sensitive. You may remember Chetan some weeks ago, we said that after the investments we would have up to 35 Kt obviously, but this is the total.

There was a capacity before and we did those indicate for obvious reason the current capacity. And I know it's not easy probably for you to make some computation and comparison, specifically when you compare apples and oranges. Tavaux investment is different. It's brownfield. Infrastructure was there, right? Whereas this new USA project consists of almost two greenfields Chetan. So the investments cannot be compared directly.

That said, we can confirm that these investments will make us the undisputed leader in North America. The industrial investments will be located in two sites. All these investments will be in their own sites and will comprise probably two plants with the critical materials we need not far from our Solvay. Investments will be in our Augusto plant and will comprise VDF and PVDF.

So yes. I mean, I'm very, very pleased because this is two giant, two leaders, undisputed leaders in their own domain coming together joining force. And as you have seen probably the United States of America through the Department of Energy has granted to Solvay $178 million of grants, which is more than welcome. The joint venture will be 51% share, Solvay 49%, Orbia as a structure. And obviously, we'll consolidate the numbers. We contribute IP technology and market access to our obviously market leadership and know-how on the suspension PVDF and Orbia contributes to the security of supply of key raw materials. Back to you.

The next question comes from Wim Hoste, KBC Securities. Hoste, please go ahead.

Wim Hoste

Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions, if I may. The first one is, can you update on the separation plan maybe the milestones that have already been achieved? What will come in the next few months or so? So that's the first question. And the second one is can you maybe elaborate on the energy cost outlook for 2023 and – not only your own but also kind of the contract book you have with third parties, et cetera? Can you maybe offer a bit of clarity on that as well?

Ilham Kadri

Yes, absolutely. Good afternoon. I will take the spin-off and then Karim the energy. So yes. I mean we are very glad with the progress. We don't see any elements preventing us from achieving the target date which is the second half 2023. That was what I announced to you at launch and we keep that timing. It's a challenging project and we value quality versus speed. That's what I told you.

A critical point for these companies is that we are – we continue building up standing up the two companies now. We – in terms of organization redesign, we have now – we are preparing the capital structures for both companies. Obviously, we enjoy now a much lower debt ratio, right in the company, as I told you. And this is a great achievement making us even stronger while we prepare for the spin-off and for the two companies. So – and that's where we stand. So really all green. We're not derailing. We will see the macros in due time, right? But – and we continue monitoring them. But definitely we are sailing full steam toward second half of next year for the launch. The energy question Karim?

Karim Hajjar

Your question on the energy cost or the improvement that I talked about on the Energy business?

Wim Hoste

Well it's actually both. So the outlook for energy costs in 2023 versus the contracts and hedges that are in place. And then also in addition to that the third-party business? Maybe some clarity there on the contract book, et cetera.

Karim Hajjar

Okay that's very helpful clarification. Thank you. Now obviously, I don't have a crystal ball what the energy costs are going to be next year. How quote is going to be? To what extent? Will European industrial consumers be able to curtail demand? Let's see. We braced for quite a challenging time but we're as ready as we can be frankly. So rather than speculate what may, may not happen in Energy, let me tell you what we do is we anticipate.

And Ilham's already mentioned some of the key elements. First thing, we did is renegotiated a number of our contracts, particularly supply demand impacted part of our portfolio and that gives us an element of a margin protection or certainly cost pass-through capacity as energy costs go up or down and that is we've got far more of that now than we did a year ago. That's important.

Secondly, I don't know if you were attentive but when Ilham talked about the €700 million plus positive pricing power, let me just remind you. This is – that pricing power is a multiple of the hedging – financial hedging benefit that we had in 2022.

Now we still have hedges in place for next year. They will provide a degree of protection. But frankly the best protection for us is to show the customers the capacity to pass through costs. And that's really where we stand. So when Ilham expressed the confidence in our ability to navigate these challenging times, of course it takes into account certain assumptions on energy costs and how we will respond and we've got plans in place to deliver. But let's see it's going to be challenging. We think we're ready.

Ilham Kadri

Yes. And I think the net pricing and I think I say this net of variable cost, fixed cost and hedging is positive, which is frankly extremely rare in the career, in my career, okay. And I think having said that the hedging is just helping us to gain time but we are starting now to relook at our pricing, our portfolio, the impact on our customers and the value we create with all transparency. And we look at the mirror, we share the value created more and more. So yeah I mean -- and on gas we are living with less gas. We told you that we have plan for the 32 sites in Europe some of them consume 90% of the gas we are buying in Europe. And for each plant we have mitigation plan. So very ready for the winter.

Karim Hajjar

Now on the second part of your question for the energy business, I'm going to give -- I will give you a bit more color. And I'll start by giving a reminder that the energy business that we have it concentrates expertise that's designed to meet our own needs in Solvay in terms of sourcing and energy hedging as well as CO2. And it also serves the needs of a few external industrial customers particularly in Europe.

Now that expertise gives us really good market access and intel. It is not a speculative activity. That's just as a reminder. Now, the reality is we've had a few losses in the last three quarters from memory. We disclosed those last Q4 when they were quite significant. And we have been taking many, many steps to improve that business, improving controls. We've completed a review of every single third-party contract and explored way to optimize what is a very volatile and challenging market context. We're making good progress. We're not all the way there. There's more to do with some of our customers there.

But frankly what you see here is an improvement. It comes from one thing and one thing alone, painstaking negotiations with customers to adapt contracts to this volatile market situation that we face. And frankly we're pleased with the improvement. I wish, I could say we can repeat every single quarter but this is where we're at. Yeah, I think we have to -- I hope that's clear for you Wim.

Wim Hoste

Yes absolutely. And thank you and congratulations with a very good result progression.

Ilham Kadri

Thank you. Thank you very much, Wim.

Operator

The next question comes from Alex Stewart, Barclays. Sir, please go ahead.

Alex Stewart

Hi, there good afternoon. I just wanted to loop back on this energy cost question, because I think most chemical companies have given some guidance about the increase next year. And Karim I appreciate you don't want to speculate on where energy prices or gas prices will be but you do have a hedge book. So you know what a portion of your energy costs going to be next year compared to what they have been this year. So perhaps on the part of it that you do have visibility, could you possibly give us some sense of the inflation like other companies do? That would be really helpful.

And then the other question is on this PFAS provision because for years I think that Solvay has maintained the line that there was no wrong doing in New Jersey around your site there and there was always a feeling that you felt you hadn't done anything wrong. The fact that you're taking a €100 million fine implies that you have come to the decision there was something wrong and that there will be remediation costs, which is perfectly reasonable and not large in size. But the fact that you've taken costs and that you've accepted some responsibility also now opens you up to the potential for personal injury suits or class action suits relating to the problem that this €93 million is supposed to fix. So if we look past the pure engineering cost to fix the problem as it stands, how do you see the potential for further financial ramifications as a result of this decision you've made? I'd be really interested to hear your views on this. Thanks.

Ilham Kadri

Yeah. It's Alex, right? Do you want to take -- and I will take the…

Karim Hajjar

Yeah. And I'll try to be genuinely as helpful as I can Alex. The question is really important. So rather than just focus only on energy, let me start by looking at variable costs, raw materials, logistics. Everything we're seeing, everything we're reading points to an easing of cost pressures in 2023 compared to 2022 and that's important. The extent of it, time will tell. But certainly when we listen to some of the major shippers, et cetera, there's a debottlenecking, there's easing of the supply chains. So I think the tendency is favorable from a cost point of view.

On energy it really is anyone's guess. But let me tell you what we do. We don't plan on one number we look at scenarios. We simulated our exposure in a €100, €150, €195 or €200 and €250 per megawatt hour cost base. And the outcomes are €0.5 billion different between the high and the low and these are based on TTF natgas pricing.

So that's the degree of uncertainty now because our job is to manage that like we have done in the last 12 months. But can give you scenarios and outcomes with €0.5 billion plus of cost variability. Against that there is some hedging protection more importantly some cost pass-through capability that will help to protect our margins.

Ilham Kadri

Yeah. And before -- I'm going to address the PFAS. But before that just to complete what Karim said, I remind you all that when we renegotiated our contract like in soda ash for example, many, many now have energy pricing structure and clauses in the contract. So that's important to remind everybody.

On the PFAS, let me a bit maybe rewind the story. Remember this is for me just -- and yet another step in our journey. Our first step when I joined the company in 2019 was that we wanted to exit the fluorosurfactants chemistry. This is not regulatory. A push it was our will to really move to non-fluorosurfactant innovation. We launched in 2019 just when -- six months after I joined the company, which led us by the way to stop using it and switch manufacturing in New Jersey department last July 2021 to fluorosurfactants-free technology after qualifying by our customers. So that was really the targets. We doubled down in innovation and frankly extremely pleased with the teams who did that.

Now that we do not use fluorinated surfactants to produce our polymers anymore, we undertook another step, which is a technical study and it explains a bit Alex why the €93 million. We started the technical study and analysis enabling us to better understand and estimate the remediation cost in our New Jersey operations around the plants, which is the €93 million announced today. And this spending by the way, a remediation should take place in the next 20 years period.

So the provision now when you do a technical study obviously by IFRS rules, the provision reflects the estimated future cost of remediation for specific identified activities is expected to accrue over a period of 20 years. Though as a company me leading it, we expect to accelerate such things. So that's -- and we don't expect this expenditure by the way to have any material impact on Solvay's cash generation in the future.

So for me, you know, those are the principles and we are pleased. We can better anticipate the anticipated remediation related to our past use. This is nothing of wrongdoing because everything was regulatory compliant so this is just an anticipated remediation of our past use and we continue obviously to cooperate with the authorities in this topic.

You talked about litigation. Whilst we continue to defend ourselves we won't speculate on how long proceedings will take. But please understand that I cannot discuss any pending litigation. But I remind you, Alex that many US cases relate to firefighting foams and Solvay never manufactured or sold them. And indeed out of the thousands of cases pending in the US only about, I think, 18 claims today named Solvay and we have already been dismissed in all but one of these cases, while others in the industry continue to defend against hundreds of even thousands of these cases.

So I think we are cleaning up this slate. You know it's extremely very clear. Our facts very appreciated by the authorities. And obviously in the view of power of two, we want to get into the split as clean as clear for you as well guys because there's always recurring question there. So I think all of you should take it positive today that we have done a technical study that we have a number linked to this. And obviously I cannot comment on what we are doing beyond that. But as soon as we have more clarity we'll come back to you.

Alex Stewart

Thank you very much.

Operator

The next question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale. Sir, please go ahead.

Peter Clark

Yes. Good afternoon. It's on the material margin in the third quarter. You, sort of, outlined all the components behind why it's touching 35%, and I'm assuming that Composites must be back at the 29 levels or above. But even so that Specialty Materials probably nearer 40% than 35%. Now I know 3Q is seasonally strong on top of all the other components, but I'm just wondering how we should think about that? Because clearly this is taking it to a new level. I expect you've done a lot of work to get it to a new level but how you see the margin there?

And just a follow-up on the webinar I was on the webinar on the product side. And there was a little discussion on contracts and pricing but not much was disclosed. On the HPPO side of things, my understanding is there is some contract protection there more so than elsewhere in the Peroxides business. If things go a bit dicky perhaps with current or something like that? Those are the two questions. Thank you.

Ilham Kadri

Yes. Thank you, Peter. Yes, on Materials, I think -- very pleased. I told you since 2019 and it was a bold word of crown jewel and they had to demonstrate that. I really believe on the Specialty Polymer side then we can talk about Composite. That -- we were sitting on really jewels in the company unique product.

Nobody has the breadth and the broadest portfolio of unique high-performance polymers on the top of the pyramid for performance. I remind you that Solvay has disengaged and divested PVC Polyamide when I joined the company. So we are really sitting on the top of the pyramid.

The customers they come to us when they need Spec 1 and Spec 2 and Spec 3. So a high temperature resistance, a high-grade resistance and a high wear resistance under the hood application for a piece of metal right replacing a piece of metal next to your motor and engine. So this is a high specialty product and solution so value pricing is key and the value proposition is more than ever strong.

So Peter we started application by application I think we talk about Material one day. I think we should do probably a roadshow with you and invite you to our Bollate or our Spinetta plants in Italy to really show you -- the pieces we produce with our customers the value proposition we bring to them because as soon as you replace a piece of metal, it produces a lower total cost of ownership. So the customer may pay more for our product. But the parts with our polymers cost much less and it enables lightweighting and clean mobility, right?

So I think that's what we try to do. Its value pricing, understanding the value proposition and value pricing and baked by the mega trend, which is electrification and lightweighting and really focus on that. And what happened we may not have told you that, but it was an internal reorganization. When I joined the company Materials was organized as a technology company. So we had aromatics, fluoropolymers and sub products behind this.

But what we changed now since 2021 is that we are markets and sectors, markets organized internally. So we drive our businesses by market we understand automotive better. What do they need? We have key account managers for customers like Bosch and others.

In healthcare it's the same. We understand hemodialysis better what do they need? The same for industrial application growth platform battery. We launched it in 2019 look where we are now. We have a regional strategy, which is being executed by region. So we are really much more educated, much more mindful about what the market needs and our customers' needs. And therefore I think we can extract better value much value and share it with our customers.

On Peroxides, we have leadership position highly competitive assets around the world. We are the only one who can build probably that mega plan to meet solid demand and we will progress. In the future the HPPO plant you talked about it. Yes, we have three megaplants in joint ventures.

We deal typically with long-term contracts with guaranteed margins right? That's given us visibility and stable cash flow. So that's what we talked about with Peter Browning, our President when we did our webinar. And this is good news because it helps us to really see it come in and sit on guaranteed return which give us visibility and help us to continue reinvesting.

The second part of the business is mentioned but obviously as you may know hydrogen peroxide is a key chemical used in many essential industries like aseptic packaging, equipment sterilization, water treatment surface disinfection or hand disinfection. And normally those -- they don't tend to be impacted by economical cycle. So we continue to see resiliency. I'm very, very – we saw the ash peroxide is another very resilient business we have and we like it because we are the best-in-class in terms of process, innovation and simply process leading to have the best competitive assets in the world.

Peter Clark

Got it. Thank you. I remember the trip to Italy by the way. Very impressive. Understood.

Your last question comes from Geoff of UBS. Please go ahead.

Geoff Haire

Thank you for taking my questions. I just had two questions. First of all, there was a €39 million gain I think from the unwinding of energy hedges in the quarter. Do you expect something similar in the fourth quarter as well? And also just coming back to Karim, the comment on working capital. In an inflationary environment that difference between the balance sheet and the cash flow seems very large. Maybe you could outline how exactly you've managed to do that and whether it's sustainable going forward?

Ilham Kadri

Okay. For you Karim, you got two.

Karim Hajjar

Actually well done for reading Page 21 of our financial report. Not everybody does that, so your question on the €39 million hedging gain is really important. So let me tell you what we're talking about here. We talking about a cash flow hedge derecognition.

Now in Q3, what we did is we adapted some of our hedges because we changed our sourcing of some raw – of some materials including coal because of the disruption to the energy suppliers in Europe, gas curtailments and what have you. And this was motivated by a need to secure alternative sources of energy to underpin our business continuity.

Now when you do that, you can no longer meet the highly probable test, which is what IFRS requires you to do. So as a result, there's no choice now. IFRS requires you to derecognize these impacted hedges and you can't consider them to be cash flow hedges.

Now it's a technical accounting consequence, and it's because the hedges simply can't be cash flow hedges. Now the key here is that it doesn't make a single bit of difference economically to Solvay. Now the hedges were designed to cover our exposures from the third quarter of this year through to the end of 2023. So what have we done?

We've now recognized the full €39 million as not meeting the cash flow hedge definitions and we've taken a small – less than €10 million in the third quarter, which is a benefit the economic benefit that accrued during the quarter and we expect the remainder of that €39 million to accrue to be recognized between now and the end of next year. That's really – I hope that helps but it's to me very high quality and it's purely this accounting technical requirement.

Question on working capital.

Karim Hajjar

On working capital, one of my favorite subjects. Let me just remind you and I think I mentioned it when I did my opening remarks. Benchmarks would point to 17% as a good performance on working capital. Now you've seen us do better than that. You've seen us do between 12.5% and 15%.

Now let me tell you one or two facts, and I'll start with the fact that our working capital has really grown. Now if you look at our total revenue in 2021, it increased from €11.4 billion. And if you take Q3 and annualize it you end up at 17.6% in Q3 this year.

Now if you apply that benchmark of 17% you would expect our working capital to balloon by about €1 billion. Now take that and just hold on to it that €1 billion expectation and see what happened in Solvay. If you look at the evolution of our working capital you're going to see an increase from €1.4 billion to €2.2 billion. In other words, an increase of €0.8 billion. So what does it tell you? It tells you we're doing better than benchmarks. But it also tells you that we're really razor-focused on relenting and are focused on that. And it happened every week we're tracking it. And we're not looking at the big numbers we're looking at the key call it operational KPIs. I look at DSO, which means Days sales outstanding. Look at over dues, top customers, days payable outstanding, days of stock in sales. And it's part of the weekly buyer rhythm and it's driven very hard but in a very consistent disciplined manner.

And those entities those businesses are not fully performing as they expect. Can I say they get quite a lot of constructive encouragement. That's culture the performance, culture the delivery that's doing it. So to your question is it sustainable? Absolutely. If it's doable we'll do it. We're proud of what's been achieved. It takes hard work. It takes unrelenting focus. The one thing that does help is we don't have to push water uphill to achieve it because the bonuses of some of our commercial people and of our business users doesn't just come from achieving profits and but comes from converting the profit into cash and that makes this job a lot a lot easier. So yes, sustainable.

Thank you, everyone. This now concludes our formal Q&A session and actually the call apologies for the delay again but we went a little over to address as many questions as possible. And I just want to remind you that we may get an opportunity to see some of you as we'll be attending several conferences and road shows in the coming months. And we also plan to continue with our webinars because we've been receiving lots of positive feedback. So we're actively behind the scenes preparing some more and we'll let you know those dates once we're ready. And today, if you have additional questions that we didn't get to please contact any one of us on the Investor Relations team and we're happy to take additional questions.

Tesco has introduced a fee of at least 28p for customers to charge their electric vehicles at their car parks.

The supermarket has been Britain’s largest provider of free power for electric car owners since it began rolling out charging bays at its stores in 2018.

With charging points at more than 550 of its UK stores, Tesco claims to have given customers enough electricity to travel some 86 million miles – the equivalent of looping the Earth’s surface nearly three and a half times.

But now those wishing to charge their electric cars while they shop must pay at least 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to do so, rising to 40p and 50p for the more powerful – and faster – 22kW and 50kW chargers respectively.

The decision to charge customers is in line with other supermarkets’ approaches, and Tesco said its tariffs are “some of the most competitive rates in the market”.

“We’ve provided more than 86 million miles worth of free charging for customers to date, and our new great value tariffs will build on this with some of the most competitive rates in the market,” a Tesco spokesperson said in a statement.

“These changes will improve access to chargers for all our customers, and enable continued investment in our charging network across the UK.”

Responding to the news, most customers appeared to believe that the fees were “inevitable”, with some even going as far as to welcome the charge in the hopes it might stop people from parking in the bays without actually using them.

As part of its goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 in a global bid to limit climate breakdown, the government has announced that, from 2030, the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in the UK.

The cost of gas and electricity has soared across Europe this year, as Russia’s war in Ukraine exacerbates supply issues caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

PodPoint, which alongside Volkswagen is helping Tesco to roll out more charging points, said the new charges would “enable us to continue investing in our network”.

“It’s hoped that by making these changes customers will only top up when they need to, ensuring that they make way for others once their cars are charged. We continue to work with Tesco and Volkswagen to deliver on our commitment to install EV charging at 600 Tesco stores across the UK,” a spokesperson said.",electric vehicles,independent
323,Best Cars for Snow,https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/11/gen-wwti-snow-winter-weather-suv-1.jpg?w=1280,06/11/2022,"To help keep you safe in the winter months, iSeeCars compiled this helpful guide to the Best Cars for Snow across the most popular vehicle categories.",https://wgntv.com/news/best-cars-for-snow/,"(iSeeCars) — Winter is coming. That means that unless you live in an area with mild weather year-round, you should be prepared for winter driving.

Whether you live in a place that regularly gets walloped with snow, or if you only see the occasional winter dusting, it’s important to make sure you can safely drive in inclement weather. One trusted way to ensure safe winter driving is with a car that’s well-equipped for winter conditions, and in today’s market, that doesn’t necessarily mean a truck or an SUV.

To help keep you safe in the winter months, we’ve compiled this helpful guide to the Best Cars for Snow across the most popular vehicle categories.

The Challenges of Winter Driving

Along with being a nuisance, winter conditions can present many challenges. Even if you don’t live in an area where it regularly snows, an unexpected winter storm can still rear its ugly head. And when a storm occurs in typically less snowy areas, these can be even more dangerous because drivers aren’t used to driving in these conditions. Here are some of the main hazards of winter driving :

Icy Roads: This occurs when the road is wet from snow or rain and if the temperature falls below freezing. Ice can prevent your tires from gripping the road, which makes it difficult to steer or stop. Black ice is especially dangerous because you can’t see it, which means drivers can’t slow down before encountering it.

Reduced Visibility: This can be the result of whiteout conditions, or because of ice or snow buildup on your windshield. While you should always properly clear your car of snow, you can also be at risk if your defroster or heater aren’t functioning properly.

Low Tire Pressure and Bald Tires: Cold weather lowers the air pressure of your tires, so you should always make sure your tires are properly inflated during the winter months. Along with properly inflated tires, you should make sure your tires don’t have worn treads, as they can be extremely dangerous in slippery conditions.

How to Identify the Best Snow Cars?

Not all cars are created equal when it comes to taking on all-weather driving conditions. The Best Cars for Snow have the right combination of features that improve performance in light to deep snow and on icy terrain, as well as improve visibility during winter conditions. There are also added convenience features to provide comfort and warmth. Here are some important features to help improve a car’s performance in the snow:

All-Wheel Drive/Four-Wheel Drive: All-wheel drive sends power to all four wheels. The power is divided between the front and rear wheels, which can be helpful in snowy and icy conditions. If one slips, the others will power the vehicle. Four-wheel drive sends a fixed amount of power to each axle, and it can be switched on or off by the driver.

Anti-Lock Brakes: Also known as ABS, anti-lock braking systems help prevent wheels from locking up and improve steering control while braking. Available on all modern cars, ABS automatically cycles the brake pads in the event of a sudden stop, which is particularly helpful when trying to slow down on a slippery surface.

Driver-Assist Technology (forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking): Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are technologies designed to assist drivers while driving and parking. They use automated technology to increase safety by reducing human error, which is a main cause of road accidents. In snowy conditions, driver-assist technologies like forward collision warning, automatic high beam headlights, and automatic emergency braking can help prevent accidents.

Ground Clearance: Also known as ride height, ground clearance is the minimum distance between the bottom of the vehicle and the ground. High ground clearance helps protect against damage when crossing uneven, snowy terrain by preventing the bottom of the vehicle from scraping against it.

Headlight Washers: Headlight washers, commonly on SUVs and off-road vehicles, help improve visibility by wiping headlights to remove snow or dirt.

Heated Mirrors: Heated side mirrors work like a defroster to help quickly remove snow and ice from your mirrors.

Heated Seats/Steering Wheel: These are more of a comfort feature, and help the driver stay warm in freezing conditions.

Remote Start: Another comfort feature, this allows the driver to start their car without having to brave the elements to warm it up.

Traction/Stability Control: Traction and stability control systems help ensure that all wheels have maximum traction. While they are packaged together, the two serve different functions. Traction control stops wheels from spinning, while electronic stability control (ESC) automatically brakes individual wheels when grip and traction are compromised, which helps the vehicle follow the driver’s intended path. Both technologies became standard on all vehicles in 2012.

Winter/Snow Tires: Winter tires outperform all-season tires in snowy conditions, even if a car is equipped with all-wheel drive. Winter tires are engineered to perform in winter weather, and can help prevent accidents from black ice and heavy snow.

Criteria: Best Cars for Snow Driving

To select the best cars for snow driving , iSeeCars analyzed vehicles across multiple vehicle categories. These cars achieved a score of 7.5 or above (out of 10) on iSeeCars quality analysis that takes into account long-term reliability, value retention, and highest average safety ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Based on these criteria, an iSeeCars Quality Score was calculated. These cars also have all-wheel or four-wheel drive and the right combination of safety features that aid drivers in snowy conditions.

Multibillion-euro tech firms Bolt, Tier and Lime have been ramping up their lobbying in regional towns to roll out electric bike fleets for renting.

Companies have sought to gain market share in regions outside of Dublin, as the city council issues just two licences for bike schemes in its jurisdiction.

Bolt rolled out its e-bikes in Sligo earlier in summer and in Kilkenny in recent weeks. It has also pitched its product to councillors in Cork, Waterford and Wexford.

‘The scooter legislation has been delayed, but it looks like 2023 will be their year’

The proposals are generally smaller than the fleets that Bolt operates in European cities. For instance, there are up to 100 bikes and two charging points planned for Sligo by next year.

The regional strategy is one also pursued by US outfit Lime, which is known for its e-bikes and e-scooters. While the company established its EMEA base in Ireland in 2019, its first e-bike pilot launch was last summer, in Castlebar.

Hal Stevenson, Lime’s public affairs manager for the UK and Ireland, wrote to Mayo County Council in April stating that it was “getting in touch with local authorities in Ireland to offer small shared e-bike pilots” during the summer months at “no cost to the councils”.

Lime has also pitched itself to local authorities in Cavan, Longford and Roscommon earlier this year.

“Our focus is on delivering our new service to the highest standard in Castlebar for the next six months, working closely with the local council,” said Stevenson told the Sunday Independent.

“We’ll review further expansion options in spring, as the weather gets warmer.”

Larger companies such as Bolt, which is valued at more than €7bn, are proposing their plans to counties at no cost to the council, according to Bolt’s head of public policy in Ireland, Aisling Dunne.

“These schemes are not subsidised. Neither Sligo nor Kilkenny subsidise our schemes. They give us permission to operate, but have none of the costs associated with it,” said Dunne, a former Department of Transport advisor.

“There's definitely a lot of interest in this area from local authorities. But there is the issue of a town being big enough to make it commercially viable. Obviously, private companies can't commit the resources and capital costs if they don't think there's some hope of it being financially profitable,” she said.

‘I think e-scooters and bikes together have the potential to revolutionise our towns’

“Some councils have been looking at the subsidised model, and then other councils have said they think they’re sufficient in size and scale.”

In recent weeks, Meath Co Council and Limerick Co Councils have issued requests for tenders for bike rental schemes in Ashbourne, Co Meath, and in the Castletroy area of Limerick. In the case of Limerick, the privately-operated scheme would run alongside the existing National Transport Authority bike rental service in the city.

Promoting cycling and its infrastructure was a focal point of Transport Minister Eamon Ryan’s recent Pathfinder Programme, which laid out several transport upgrade projects around the country.

Dunne says councils are looking to encourage climate-friendly transport options such as cycling in their towns, but may not have the population density or demographics to make it commercially viable without subsiding companies.

Peadar Golden, Irish country manager for German e-scooter company Tier, has led similar efforts by the company with an e-bike launch in Fingal County Council and a pilot on the campus of DCU.

“We've spoken to a number of councils. We've been in the market for 18 months and have done a lot of work with DCU. In that time we've built up discussions to understand what is the need across different councils,” Golden said.

These companies ultimately want to launch e-scooter sharing services in Ireland – which is still not possible, due to regulations for the vehicles being delayed. The Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 is currently before the Seanad.

Several other firms have been lining up to say they are ready to roll out e-scooters in Ireland once they have the green light.

Gaining footholds with e-bike schemes will lay the groundwork for negotiating e-scooter plans in the future.

“I think e-scooters and bikes together have the potential to really revolutionise our cities and towns. The scooter legislation has been delayed, but it looks like 2023 will be the year e-scooters will be legislated for,” said Bolt’s Dunne.

She said she expects summer 2023 as the earliest time for rolling out e-scooters.",electric vehicles,independent.ie

David Dunbar

Thank you, Chris, and welcome to Standex. We're happy to have you join us. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first fiscal quarter 2023 conference call. We're very pleased with our first quarter performance, which built on a highly successful fiscal 2022. Our focus on fast growth markets, pricing disciplines and nimble execution by our global management teams positioned us to continue delivering strong earnings in a dynamic macroeconomic environment. We have an active pipeline of new business opportunities and productivity initiatives to continue our momentum. I want to thank our employees, our executives and the Board of Directors for their continued dedication and support. Now if everyone can turn to Slide 3, key messages. The continued effectiveness of our price and productivity actions improved our margin profile in the quarter and produced our sixth consecutive quarter of record adjusted operating margin. Consolidated adjusted operating margin of 15% in fiscal first quarter 2023 was a 160-basis point increase year-on-year and a 110-basis point improvement sequentially despite external challenges such as high inflation and foreign currency headwinds.

Four of Standex five company business segments, each reported adjusted operating margin of at least 16% as we successfully executed company-wide productivity and price realization actions. We reported 7.3% organic revenue growth year-on-year as three of our five business segments exhibited organic revenue growth. Electric vehicles, renewable energy, commercial aviation and defense end markets remain strong while Scientific was impacted by lower demand for COVID vaccine storage. Revenue contribution from high-growth markets such as electric vehicles, green energy and the commercialization of space increased approximately 30% year-on-year to $17 million in fiscal first quarter 2023. We anticipate this revenue stream to grow by over 35% in FY '23.

Our solar energy project with ENEL is progressing well and is now in the pilot plant design phase. Order trends remain healthy, and the backlog realizable in under 1 year grew 12% year-on-year to $266 million. As part of our value creation system, we continue to have an active focus on lean initiatives, and in turn, the standardization of operating disciplines across all business units, further leveraging our G&A structure. As a result, we are seeing continued improvement in our ROIC. With Q1 FY '23 annualized ROIC at 12%, 160 basis points improvement year-on-year. Ademir will discuss our financial performance, liquidity position and capital allocation in greater detail later in the call. In fiscal second quarter 2023 on a sequential basis, we expect slightly higher revenue and similar operating margin. On a year-on-year basis, we expect flat revenue comprised of mid- to high single-digit organic growth countered by an equivalent reduction from currency and moderate to significantly improving operating margin. In fiscal 2023, we anticipate the majority of our segments to exhibit solid organic growth.

Now please turn to Slide 4, and I will begin to discuss our segment performance and outlook, beginning with Electronics. Segment revenue of $75 million decreased 1% year-on-year as 4.3% organic growth and 1.5% contribution from acquisitions were more than offset by 6.6% negative impact from foreign exchange. End market trends remain favorable, particularly for industrial applications, medical, power management and EV-related markets. Operating margin of 24.1% in fiscal first quarter 2023 was flat versus the year ago period, primarily due to organic sales growth and productivity initiatives offsetting the inflationary and currency impact. New business opportunities funnel remains strong and is currently at $62 million.

The pictures on Slide 4 highlights the Electronics segment's focus on growth markets such as warehouse automation. Within magnetics, we are delivering components for smart conveyor systems in manufacturing and warehouse automation to improve precision and energy efficiency. This business will continue to grow, supporting the overall electrification trend in many markets. Within sensors and switching technologies, our relays are unique products, meeting the isolation requirements in renewable energy applications as well as electric vehicles. We continue to see strong growth coming from China and Europe as renewables continue to expand in those markets. Sequentially, we expect revenue in our second fiscal quarter to be similar as relay and magnetics components grow in North America is offset by softness in white goods end markets in Asia and Europe. The company expects a slight decrease in operating margin, mostly due to mix and higher growth investments, partially offset by continued price actions.

Please turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of the Engraving segment. Revenue remained nearly flat at $35 million as an 8.3% headwind from exchange rate changes overshadowed 7.9% organic growth. Operating margin of 16.7% in fiscal first quarter 2023, increased 280 basis points year-on-year due to the realization of previously announced productivity actions in North America and Europe. Laneway sales of $15 million grew approximately 5% year-on-year with positive trends in tools, laser engraving and tool finishing. The picture on Slide 5 illustrates our innovative texture services for customers like Ford using our advanced laser technology, which can be engineered to create colored services without paint. In our next fiscal quarter, on a sequential basis, we expect revenue to be similar and operating margin to decrease slightly due to project mix. In fiscal 2023, we also expect continued growth in soft trim demand reflecting auto manufacturers increasing move to higher-quality anterior surfaces and textures.

Please turn to Slide 6, Scientific segment. As expected, Scientific revenue decreased 14% year-on-year to $18.5 million dollars primarily driven by lower demand associated with COVID-19 vaccine storage. Operating margin 20.2%, decreased 70 basis points year-on-year due to the lower volume, which was mostly offset by price and productivity actions. As highlighted on Slide 6, the pace of new product introductions of Scientific is accelerating, further broadening our product line and capabilities. We were the first to release products compliant with the new NSF-NIST vaccine storage standard and continue to expand the product family with new sizes. As new vaccines and treatments continue to be introduced, Scientific has a favorable market position to meet the growing demand. On a sequential basis, in the fiscal second quarter of '23, we expect slightly higher revenue increase and slightly lower to similar operating margin, primarily due to R&D investments and higher anticipated spend on advertising and trade shows.

Turning to the Engineering Technologies segment page on Slide 7. Revenue of $17 million decreased 3% year-on-year reflecting project timing and the impact of foreign currency. Operating margin of 11% increased 590 basis points year-on-year due to productivity and efficiency initiatives and the impact of a onetime project-related charge in fiscal first quarter '22 that did not repeat. As pictured on Slide 7, our advanced engineering team is developing products for a large number of customers from established market leaders to innovative start-ups. Through applications like the pictured core fuel tank dome as well as adjacent rocket engine and structural components. In the next fiscal quarter, on a sequential basis, we expect a moderate to significant increase in revenue and operating margin, reflecting project phasing. Please turn to Slide 8, Specialty Solutions segment.

Specialty Solutions revenue of $35 million increased nearly 37% year-on-year due to price realization, strong market demand in Hydraulics business unit and the favorable year-over-year comparison due to a labor work stoppage in 2 plants during fiscal first quarter '22. Operating margin increased 640 basis points to 17.4%, reflecting the price and volume increases. As pictured on slide 8, we have continued to expand our Procon product line with a helical gear pump professional espresso shots and milk foaming, which requires 40% less energy than competitive products. In the fiscal second quarter '23, on a sequential basis, we expect revenue to decrease slightly, primarily due to seasonality in foodservice equipment and market, expected to be similar as volume decline is offset by pricing and productivity actions. I will now turn the call over to Ademir to the detail.

Ademir Sarcevic

Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. First, I will provide a few key takeaways from our first quarter 2023 results. Despite continued inflationary pressures and flow to drive organic growth and margin expansion. Our earnings strength reflects the successful implementation of our pricing actions and realization of our productivity initiatives. As a result, we achieved our sixth consecutive quarter of record consolidated adjusted operating margin. In addition, our end market demand trends remain healthy as we ended the first quarter with an overall book-to-bill ratio of slightly over 1.

Now let's turn to Slide 9, first quarter 2023 summary. On a consolidated basis, total revenue increased 2.8% year-on-year to $180.6 million. This reflected organic revenue growth of 7.3% and 0.6% contribution from the Sensor Solutions acquisition partially offset by a 5.1% impact from foreign exchange. First quarter 2023 adjusted operating margin increased 160 basis points year-on-year to 15%, our highest in the history of the company, as our adjusted operating income grew approximately 15.7% on a 2.8% consolidated revenue increase year-on-year. Our first quarter 2020 tax rate decreased 140 basis points hear on year. Sequentially, we expect a similar tax rate in the fiscal second quarter of '23 with a full year tax rate between 23% and 24%.

Adjusted earnings per share were $1.60 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $1.34 year ago, approximately 19% growth year-on-year. Net cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $13.1 million a year ago. This decrease reflected annual bonus payments, onetime legal settlement payment accrued in the prior period and impact of supply chain inefficiencies. In addition, capital expenditures were $5.3 million compared to $5 million a year ago. As a result, free cash flow was negative $8 million in fiscal first quarter 2023 compared to free cash flow of approximately $8.1 million in fiscal first quarter 2022. We anticipate a return to a more normalized level of free cash flow conversion with further improvements in the second half of fiscal 2023 with further improvements in the second half of fiscal 2023 as we continue to target free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of GAAP net income. Our balance sheet continues to provide substantial flexibility to support an active pipeline of organic and inorganic opportunities as well as increased investment in R&D and growth capital.

Please turn to Slide 10, FY '23 segment snapshot. From a segment perspective, 3 of our 5 segments exhibited organic growth year-on-year, highlighted by Specialty at 39.3% and Engraving at 7.9%. As expected, Scientific segment sales declined organically 14.3% due to lower demand for COVID vaccine storage. Foreign currency was a headwind to revenue growth, primarily in the Electronics and Engraving segments as it represented a 6.6% and 8.3% headwind respectively. From an operating margin standpoint, 4 of our segments operating margins above 16% and 3 of our 5 segments significantly expanded operating margin year-o-year led by Specialty contributing the 640-basis increased. Scientific segment maintained operating margins to over 20% despite 14% organic revenue decline due to readout of pricing and productivity actions.

Next, please turn to Slide 11 for a summary of Standex's liquidity statistics and the capitalization structure, which remains strong. Standex ended fiscal first quarter 2023 at $294 million of available liquidity, an increase of approximately $27 million from the prior year. At the end of the first quarter, Standex had net debt of $95.5 million compared to $70 million at the end of fourth quarter and $68.9 million at the end of fiscal first quarter 2022. Standex's net debt at the end of the fiscal first quarter 2023, consisted primarily of long-term debt of $198.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $103.4 million with approximately $94 million held by foreign subs. There was no repatriation for in the first quarter. We still expect to between $30 million and $35 million in cash in fiscal 2023. With regards to capital allocation, we repurchased approximately 90,000 shares for $8.4 million in the quarter and $82.3 million is still remaining under the current authorization. We also declared last week our 233rd quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per share, an approximately 7.7% increase year-on-year.

In fiscal 2023, we still expect capital expenditures to be between $35 million and $40 million compared to approximately $24 million in fiscal 2022. The increased investment year-on-year includes additional capital for capacity expansion, productivity actions and growth efforts as we deepen our presence in high-growth markets.

I will now turn the call over to David for key takeaways from our first quarter results.

David Dunbar

Thank you, Ademir. Please turn to Slide 12. Standex is well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth as we have progressed from a portfolio company to an operating company comprised of a stronger mix of high-quality businesses with attractive growth rates and higher margin profiles. As such, we anticipate continued improvement across our financial metrics in fiscal year 2023. Our segments are favorably aligned with emerging and sustainable global trends in areas such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, defense, human health and the commercialization of the space. With much of these opportunities only in the early innings, we are excited about their evolution and potential for further contribution to our financial metrics.

Our strong pricing disciplines and OpEx actions are offsetting the challenging inflation and supply chain environment. The financial flexibility from our strong balance sheet positions us to execute on an active pipeline of internal investments as well as to pursue an active funnel of inorganic candidates. I'm confident we are positioned to perform well in these uncertain market conditions. Our businesses are leaders in their markets, they have demonstrated an ability to adapt to dynamic market conditions and focus on attractive sales and margin opportunities. We will now open the line for questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Our first question comes from Chris Moore from CJS Securities.

Peter Lucas

Yes, hi. Good morning. It's Pete Lucas for Chris. How should we think about the mix between volume and price for your '23 revenue growth?

David Dunbar

If you think about Q1, I think the bits and pieces are in there. You've got about -- it's about half and half, volume and price. And then you net of FX.

Ademir Sarcevic

Yes. So this is Ademir. Maybe I can just expand on that. Historically, you ran about 2/3 volume, 1/3 price. Q1, we were about 50-50 price and volume and we're thinking for the remainder of the year will be somewhere in that range between 50-50 and 2/3, 1/3 as we move forward to the rest of the fiscal year.

Peter Lucas

Very helpful. And then just looking at the segments, where do you see the biggest opportunity going forward? And then on the flip side, which do you think will be most impacted by the current rising weak environment?

David Dunbar

Well, the biggest opportunity is the businesses that have grown the best in the last few years, they're serving very strong end markets. Electronics has got a lot of momentum in electric vehicles and renewables. Engineering Technology is commercialization of space continues to ramp up. Their military and defense business are strong. Good runway there. Those most affected by -- I don't know if it's so much the high-rate environment, but current economy. We have a couple of product lines out of Electronics that go into like residential products. We're seeing a little softness there. So for example, we sell switches and sensors that go into appliances. So we expect a little softness there. That's about 15%.

Ademir Sarcevic

It's 10% to 12%, Electronics sales.

David Dunbar

Electronics. And some of the -- the food equipment businesses that are in Specialty, we expect them to be sorted. But the others are all serving markets that we think are relatively unaffected.

Ademir Sarcevic

Yes. And if I can just add to that. One thing we are really, really excited about is in what we call fast growth markets, which was 30% year-on-year in Q1, and we continue to see strength in those end markets, and we expect that to get even as we progress to the rest of the fiscal year.

Operator

The next question is from Nicholas Heymann from William Blair.

Nicholas Heymann

Hi, good morning. I really thought that -- the first quarter, you came out pretty well given everything that's going on. But I was curious, first on Electronics. I believe there was a $6 million of deferred revenue in Electronics in China in the last quarter. And I was curious how much you realized of that $6 million. And then secondly, how you see China evolving here as a market, given all the ongoing pandemic lockdowns, which I guess, hopefully, are going to end soon?

David Dunbar

Yes. So first of all, you're right about it, you've good memory. The $6 million was what was held over from the lockdowns of Shanghai in our Q4. About $4 million of that shipped in the quarter. In terms of where China is going, I guess, your guess is good as mine. Our China orders continue to be strong, although we see some softness in -- of appliances in China.

Ademir Sarcevic

Yes. And Nick, the only thing I would add to that, if you kind of look at sequentially the sales bridge between Q4 and Q1, we had about $3 million to $4 million worth of unfavorable FX headwinds on the top line. And a lot of that is actually in the Electronics and Engraving, actually all of it in Electronics and Engraving businesses, so that would have impacted some of that sequential [Inaudible].

Nicholas Heymann

Okay. That's helpful. You mentioned in somewhere your intentions to expand Engraving into Asia. Can you help size that market relative to the U.S. and Europe and where you think your penetration rates can evolve over time? And how big an opportunity is this? Is this...

David Dunbar

Yes. So yes, I can handle that. So globally, our Engraving business is about 1/3 in America, Europe and Asia in our traditional businesses. Where we see the growth opportunities in soft trim in Asia. And you may recall a few years ago, we acquired this GS Engineering in the U.S. and they have a particular technology for a kind of soft trim. And that type of software is very popular and growing rapidly in China. So we're in the process of doing a technology transfer, taking that competitive advantage to our China business. We think in the next few years, we can grow that from -- it's -- well, a year ago, it was nothing. We think we can grow that to close to $10 million in the coming years.

Nicholas Heymann

Okay. That's good to know. In Engineering Technologies, I'll see if I can ask 1 more, can you provide more insight the project timing for the rest of the year for this business. And give us some idea as to whether or not that's just a step-up as we go through the rest of '23? Or that's something that you can visibly see extending beyond '23?

Ademir Sarcevic

Nick, it's Ademir. I'll handle this one. Q1 of this fiscal year from a project timing standpoint is a low quarter for the Engineering Technologies business. So we expect -- as we the second quarter now that we'll see a significant ramp in sales -- moderate to significant ramp in sales as well as operating margin. And we have no reason to believe that, that type of performance would not continue through the second half of this fiscal year and then into '24. I mean I think you know the end markets for this business are pretty healthy from space, defense, commercial aviation. So we're pretty optimistic what ETG business can do over the next 12 to 18 months.

Operator

There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Dunbar for any closing remarks.

David Dunbar

All right. I want to thank everybody for joining us for the call. We enjoy reporting on our progress at Standex. And finally, again, I want to thank our employees and shareholders for your continued support and contributions. We look forward to speaking with you again in our fiscal second quarter call.

But in a hyper-polarized ...,https://www.thestar.com/business/2022/11/06/its-the-democracy-stupid-midterm-stakes-for-canadians-are-much-the-same-as-in-us.html,"WASHINGTON - It’s not every day that a Canadian prime minister gets name-checked in a political debate in the United States. But in a hyper-polarized midterm election season, it’s not surprising it would happen to Justin Trudeau.

It came during a heated, hyperbolic showdown between Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who attacked her rival’s yearlong bid to shut down the cross-border Line 5 pipeline.

“Justin Trudeau, who I would say is the most radical environmentalist in the entire world, came out and invoked a 1977 treaty telling Gretchen Whitmer she could not shut down Line 5,” Dixon said.

“Line 5 has not been shut down, but that’s not because Gretchen Whitmer hasn’t tried.”

Whitmer’s administration has been battling in court for the last year to shut down the pipeline, fearing an environmental disaster in the Straits of Mackinac, the ecologically sensitive corridor where Line 5 crosses the Great Lakes.

Her Oct. 25 debate-night defence of the state’s ongoing lawsuit against Line 5’s owner and operator, Calgary-based Enbridge Inc., was hardly strident — evidence of how vulnerable Democrats are feeling when it comes to energy prices.

“First, let me clarify there has been no change in Line 5. No change,” she said, noting that the company’s plans to encase the twin gas line in an underground tunnel are moving forward and “all of the permits have been executed.”

She emphasized efforts in Michigan to build more sources of sustainable wind and solar energy, describing the state as topping the list of creating new clean energy jobs across the country.

“We know that costs have gone up on everything. And that’s why building out energy alternatives is really important — giving you alternatives to help bring down the cost of energy,” Whitmer said.

“We are focused on building out alternatives — ensuring our energy independence, protecting you from spikes and protecting our Great Lakes. It’s not one or the other. We must do all of it.”

Like the ill-fated Keystone XL pipeline project before it, vetoed by President Joe Biden on his first day in the White House, Line 5 has become a literal and rhetorical symbol of the state of Canada-U.S. relations: economically vital but politically awkward.

It was upstaged last year by evidence that U.S. protectionism is alive and well, crystallized with chilling clarity in Biden’s original vision for encouraging Americans to buy electric vehicles: only U.S.-made, union-built cars and trucks need apply.

That vision, framed by industry and Ottawa alike as an existential threat to Canada’s auto sector, was replaced in August by the Inflation Reduction Act, a centrepiece Biden victory with EV incentives that now include Canada and Mexico.

And while a Republican-controlled Congress would surely aim to undo the Democratic agenda, Biden’s $369-billion climate and energy spending measures are likely safe, considering a repeal would require a presidential signature.

In a fall economic update released Thursday, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland detailed some of how Canada plans to capitalize on the package, including plans for an investment program for EVs and battery-making, as well as tax incentives for the production of hydrogen fuels.

Political observers in both countries are under no illusions about what Capitol Hill will be like over the next two years if the Republicans win control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.

Investigations into former president Donald Trump’s role in the riots of Jan. 6, 2021, will no doubt come to a halt, and new ones will crop up, including into the FBI’s search for top secret documents at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago sanctuary and the finances of Biden’s son, Hunter.

Republicans have also been threatening to block White House efforts to raise the debt ceiling, a periodic rite of passage that has become weaponized in recent years and is likely to be a major lever in GOP efforts to secure spending cuts, much as it was used against Barack Obama back in 2011.

Democrats are discussing whether to use their remaining time in control of Congress — the so-called lame-duck session — to raise the debt limit pre-emptively in hopes of short-circuiting Republican tactics.

It all adds up to legislative gridlock, a state of affairs that on balance wouldn’t be such a bad thing for Canada after six turbulent years — first Trump, then a Democratic president who proved more protectionist-minded than many expected.

The bigger worry for Canadians is the same as it should be for Americans, say experts: the dangers that a newly empowered GOP would likely pose to the world’s most powerful and enduring democracy.

“It’s frightening,” said Matthew Lebo, a specialist in U.S. politics and chair of the political science department at Western University in London, Ont.

He’s talking about the most extreme voices in right-wing politics — people like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar — taking over control of all-important congressional committees.

“It’s not like democracy might start sliding. Democracy obviously has backslid a great amount in the U.S. And the prospects of getting back on the right trajectory are dim with those people in committee chairs.”

For Biden in particular, the health of American democracy is clearly top of mind, especially after last week’s brutal attack on Paul Pelosi by a conspiracy theorist who was looking for his wife, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

“I appeal to all Americans, regardless of party, to meet this moment of national and generational importance,” Biden said.

“We must vote, knowing what’s at stake is not just the policy of the moment, but institutions that have held us together as we have sought a more perfect union … We must vote knowing who we have been, and what we’re at risk of becoming.”

Canadians who tune in during the final throes of midterm season will also get a glimpse of some younger future leaders who might be the ones to decide the U.S. has to turn away from the abyss, said Chris Sands, head of the Canada Institute at the D.C.-based Wilson Center.

“There’s an opportunity in this election to see some of that coming up, because this time — like so many past times — we’ve been seeing older veteran politicians saying, ‘I can’t take it anymore, I’m gonna retire,’ and I think they should,” Sands said.

“I think that’s the natural change, that will be a sea change in the way that we practice politics, I hope for the better.”

But faced with weaker growth, the 2023 budget will need to keep Canada competitive and productive.",https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2022/11/06/walking-a-fiscal-tightrope.html,"Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland had to walk a tightrope.

In presenting the fall economic update, she had to avoid big spending initiatives that would add to inflationary pressures. Yet she had to be aware that inflation is causing sharp financial pain for many Canadians. And she had to be mindful of the slowdown on the horizon.

Freeland succeeded in walking that tightrope, presenting a fiscal plan Thursday that balances those competing pressures. There’s additional spending but it’s no wild spree. There are welcome incentives to invest in green energy, a necessary response to U.S. initiatives that would have left Canada at a disadvantage. There’s targeted help for low-income canadians.

It was a hold-the-line fiscal plan. The “Building Back Better” theme of the 2020 fiscal update has given way to the more subdued, “Sound Economic Stewardship in Uncertain Times.”

The update lays out two scenarios. One predicts growth of just 0.7 per cent for 2023, down sharply from the 3.1 per cent forecast in the spring budget. Under that scenario, the deficit would be $36.4 billion in the current fiscal year, a much improved picture over the $52.8-billion shortfall predicted just in the spring, and could be erased by 2027-28.

But it also laid out a tougher scenario that a mild recession could hit next year that would see the economy contract by 0.9 per cent and the deficit grow to $49.1 billion.

What scenario comes to pass depends largely on inflation and how much more central banks see the need to raise interest rates to slow economic activity.

Some wanted the government to do more to assist Canadians struggling with household bills driven higher by inflation. Freeland acknowledged the challenge to strike a balance between “compassion and support for Canadians and fiscal responsibility.”

That is the tension between providing additional financial supports to Canadians and knowing that such actions could further fuel inflation. “We don’t want to put the Bank of Canada in a position where it has to raise rates higher and keep them there for longer,” she said.

In the update, the government announced it would eliminate federal interest on student and apprentice loans. It commits to advance payments under the Canada Workers Benefit, a tax credit for low-income individuals and families.

These are on top of previously announced measures to temporarily double the federal GST rebate and provide a top-up for renters under the Canada Housing Benefit. It has also taken the first steps to the dental benefit with payments for eligible families to help with dental expenses for children under 12.

The update struck the right balance, for now. But continued high inflation or a recession may require that Ottawa provide additional assistance to those hardest hit.

It put a spotlight on the transition to green energy and a low-carbon economy and the potential economic opportunities for Canada, from mining critical minerals to building electric vehicles.

Freeland evoked the transformation of the Industrial Revolution and said that this is a “pivotal” moment of similar magnitude. Canada, she said, can be a leader. Yet, in the actions taken, there is a recognition Canada is already at risk of being left behind.

For example, the tax incentives meant to encourage investments in green power technology as well encourage hydrogen production are a catch-up response to the real concern that Canada would be left in the dust by Washington’s US$369 billion package passed this summer to spur America’s transition to clean energy.

The American initiatives have “created particular urgency for Canada,” concedes a briefing document that accompanied the update. “This will draw capital, talent, and raw materials away from Canada if we do not respond,” it stated.

Freeland was right in “keeping our powder dry” in this update. Sound economic stewardship and caution, as the fiscal update touted, is welcome. But faced with prospects of weaker growth and innovative competing nations, a return to the theme of building back better will be needed in the 2023 budget to keep Canada competitive and productive.

Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Stoneridge third quarter 2022 conference call. [Operator Instructions].

I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Kelly Harvey, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Kelly Harvey

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. The release and accompanying presentation was filed with the SEC yesterday evening and is posted on our website at stoneridge.com in the Investors section under Webcasts and Presentations.

Joining me on today's call are Jon DeGaynor, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Horvath, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, I need to inform you that certain statements today may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, including statements that are not historical in nature and include information concerning our future results or plans. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and may -- and actual results may differ materially. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in our 10-Q, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the heading Forward-Looking Statements.

During today's call, we will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the appendix for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

After Jon and Matt have finished their formal remarks, we will then open up the call to questions. I would ask that you keep your question to a single follow-up. With that, I will turn the call over to Jon.

Jonathan DeGaynor

Thanks, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 3. In the third quarter, we began to see the impacts of improving material availability on our top line performance, which drove significantly improved earnings performance. Excluding the impact of currency rates, adjusted sales increased by 6.2% in the quarter, while adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 580 basis points.

Margin expansion was driven by fixed cost leverage on revenue growth, the continued benefit of material cost mitigation actions, including historical customer recoveries and a continued focus on strong operating performance. Each of our segments drove revenue growth and above breakeven operating performance in the quarter.

Our third quarter adjusted sales of $214 million resulted in an adjusted gross margin of 23.1%, translating to an adjusted operating margin of 2.9% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.6%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.03. We continue to effectively offset incremental material and supply chain-related costs through pricing and supply chain actions resulting in the recovery of both current and historical costs in the quarter.

While incremental material costs have started to moderate, we expect material cost headwinds to persist for the remainder of the year and into 2023. We will continue to evaluate macroeconomic conditions and expect ongoing discussions with our customers to offset cost headwinds.

We remain focused on our key growth initiatives. During the quarter, customer demand continued to be strong for our first OEM MirrorEye program. Take rates were slightly improved at approximately 40%, despite being moderated by material availability.

That said, we've made significant progress against those material constraints and expect continued improvement in our MirrorEye production capability for the remainder of the year. We expect to be able to support take rates on this and that are forecasted to exceed 50% in 2023 as well as additional launches planned for 2023.

This morning, we are updating our full-year guidance. Our updated full-year guidance implies fourth quarter midpoint revenue of $239 million or approximately 11.5% growth relative to the third quarter, and midpoint adjusted EPS of $0.24 or a $0.21 improvement relative to Q3. Our guidance also implies fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 8%, which would be a 240 basis point improvement over the third quarter and a 670 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of last year.

We remain on a positive trajectory from both the top line and margin perspective, and expect to continue this trajectory in 2023. Matt will provide additional details on our full-year guidance later in the call.

Page 4 summarizes our key financial metrics where we saw significantly improved performance versus the prior quarter. During the quarter, we saw strong revenue performance as material constraints eased creating less customer production volatility and improvements in our own ability to meet strong end market demand.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency relative to Q2, adjusted sales improved by 6.2% quarter-to-quarter. The continued ramp-up of new programs, including control devices actuation programs on electrified vehicles, our digital instrument cluster programs, and the first OEM MirrorEye program contributed to higher sales during the quarter.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency, third quarter adjusted gross margin improved by 480 basis points, adjusted operating margin improved by 620 basis points and adjusted EBITDA increased by 580 basis points or $12.7 million relative to the second quarter of 2022.

This was primarily due to strong margin performance as a result of our ability to offset incremental material costs, the recovery of historical costs, continuous improvement in our manufacturing facilities, and the continued impact of reduced operating expenses. We expect these margin trends to continue in the fourth quarter on stronger revenue performance, creating a strong run rate into 2023.

Slide 5 provides our current view on the macroeconomic outlook for the remainder of this year and into next year. Material availability continues to stabilize, which is driving improved production capability. We expect that the material headwinds that have been most challenging this year will continue, but at a more moderate-level for the remainder of the year.

Similar to material availability, material costs continue to create headwinds; however, pricing fluctuations have become less volatile. We have effectively offset a significant portion of incremental material costs this year. We expect that additional pricing actions and supply chain strategies will be necessary going forward.

Looking ahead, we expect continued improvement in end market production, driven primarily by historically low inventory levels, large customer backlogs and improving material availability. Stoneridge is aligned with platforms likely to perform well against overall market dynamics, including our content on electrified vehicle platforms, and our North American passenger car exposure being more heavily-weighted to light truck, SUV and CUV platforms. We are positioned well to outperform our underlying markets and expect continued revenue growth and margin expansion.

Slide 6 outlines the most recent IHS production data for our primary OEM end markets for the remainder of 2022 as well as expectations for 2023. IHS continues to reflect production risk in both passenger car, commercial vehicle end markets as fourth quarter forecasts have been slightly reduced relative to the forecast considered in our prior guidance. That said, our weighted average end markets are forecasted to grow by approximately 4.7% in Q4 relative to Q3.

In addition to third-party forecasts, we use production planning forecast from our customers to develop our expectations, which are reflected in our updated guidance. Based on these forecasts, we continue to expect sequential revenue improvement in the fourth quarter with our midpoint revenue guidance implying 11.5% growth over the third quarter or approximately 2.5x our weighted average end markets.

Looking forward, we expect continued strength in demand in our end markets and continued improvement in customer production in 2023. IHS is forecasting that our weighted average end markets will grow by approximately 4% compared to 2022. We expect to continue to outperform our underlying end markets through the ramp-up of existing programs and new program launches, including the second OEM MirrorEye program.

Turning to Slide 7. Over the past several years, Control Devices has transformed from a relatively commoditized traditional automotive components portfolio to a high-margin product portfolio aligned with powertrain electrification.

Our electromechanical and electromagnetic actuation business is now more than half of Control Devices total sales and growing, driven primarily by electronic axle disconnect actuator, electronic transmission actuation and various control valve applications.

This is a specialized business, bridging electronics and software capabilities with mechanical design capabilities. This combination is unique to Stoneridge and gives us a strong platform to better serve our customers and expand our relationships. Our driveline actuation business will continue to grow as we extend our actuation capabilities to address electrical -- electric vehicle axle disconnect and torque control applications.

Similarly our transmission actuation competencies continue to expand allowing us to drive growth in new application areas, including EV shift control and electric park brakes. We will continue to invest in our actuation business as we anticipate greater opportunities as powertrains become increasingly electrified.

Similarly our temperature sensor business continues to pivot to better align with industry megatrends and provide a foundation for future growth. While the majority of the business today is focused on coolant and exhaust gas temperature monitoring, approximately 20% of our low-temperature business in 2022 is related to thermal management in hybrid and fully electric vehicles. We are actively transforming our temperature sensing capabilities to adapt to the drivetrains being sold in the market, whether those are internal combustion engines or the electric powertrains that we expect to grow significantly over time.

Finally, for our switches and connectors business, we are seeking differentiation in the real estate we currently own on the vehicle. For example, today, we are the market leader in OEM trailer tow applications in North America. As we have discussed on prior calls, that product has evolved to enable the digitized connection required between vehicle and the trailer to facilitate advanced vision and safety solutions.

Similarly, our seat track position sensor applications have followed market trends to more safely and efficiently deploy airbags depending on the position of the seat relative to the airbag. The number of these sensors per vehicle application has risen in the past several years, as airbag deployment becomes smarter and safer. While we are not investing heavily in these applications and don't expect to outsize market growth, this is a differentiated business that is generally drivetrain-agnostic and will continue to contribute to the overall success of control devices going forward.

Control Devices has transformed to align our products and capabilities with the powertrain applications and industry megatrends that would drive future growth. Driven by the expected growth in our actuation business, the rotation of our temperature-sensing applications and the specific and unique applications in our switches and connectors business, we expect that control devices will continue to deliver a strong margin portfolio on long-term growth that will outpace our underlying end markets.

Turning to Page 8. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter as we have demonstrated our ability to execute and drive significantly improved financial performance as our end markets and supply chains continue to stabilize. The actions we have taken to create a foundation for profitable growth are at an inflection point with the launch and ramp-up of our MirrorEye and actuation platforms globally.

We remain well-positioned to outperform our underlying end markets, resulting in profitable long-term growth for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. We are committed to delivering on our strategic priorities and continuously improving the business to drive strong financial performance.

With that, I'll turn it over to Matt to discuss our financial results in more detail.

Matthew Horvath

Thanks, Jon. Turning to Slide 10. Adjusted sales in the third quarter were approximately $214 million, an increase of 4% relative to the prior quarter. Adjusted operating income was $6.1 million or 2.9% of adjusted sales, which increased by 600 basis points versus the prior quarter. The increase in margin was driven by strong operating performance, including reduced operating expenses and continued pricing and supply chain actions aimed at recovering costs and offsetting incremental material costs.

As Jon discussed earlier in the call, we are adjusting our full-year 2022 guidance. Our updated guidance implies fourth quarter performance to be approximately [Technical Difficulty] to $0.27 per share, an adjusted revenue growth of over 11.5% relative to the third quarter. Our guidance also implies fourth quarter EBITDA margin of approximately 8%, which will be a 240 basis point improvement over the third quarter and a 670 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of last year. I will discuss the specific drivers of our full year adjusted guidance in more detail later in the call.

Page 11 summarizes the key items that impacted operating performance during the quarter relative to the expectations we outlined on our second quarter call. Our operating performance resulted in approximately $0.03 of our performance in the quarter relative to our prior expectations. This was driven primarily by favorable material costs as a result of continued cost recoveries as well as a favorable product mix.

We continue to focus on a lean cost structure aligned with current market conditions, resulting in reduced operating expenses relative to our prior guidance driving approximately $0.03 of favorability in the quarter. Finally, historical cost recoveries drove approximately $0.05 of benefit relative to our prior guidance. Our positive operating performance more than offset the significant currency headwinds we continue to experience within the quarter, primarily related to our European exposures.

Net unfavorable FX exposures drove approximately $0.09 of headwind within the quarter. The bulk of this net headwind is related to noncash exposures created primarily by intercompany balances being revalued to current currency rates. Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, we continue to perform well, resulting in quarterly performance that slightly outperforms our prior expectations.

Page 12 summarizes our key financial metrics specific to Control Devices. Control Devices' third quarter sales were approximately $89 million, an increase of 5.1% versus the second quarter. This was primarily due to the increase in OEM customer production volumes as well as incremental revenue from actuation programs. We expect continued revenue growth going into 2023 for Control Devices as North American passenger car production continues to improve for our key customers, driven by historically low vehicle inventory levels, large customer backlogs and improving material availability.

Operating income was $7.5 million for the quarter or 8.4% of sales. Operating margin increased by approximately 360 basis points versus the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower material costs driven by favorable sales mix and well-controlled operating expenses.

Page 13 summarizes our key financial metrics specific to electronics. Electronics third quarter adjusted sales, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $3.3 million were approximately $120.5 million, an increase of 4.7% versus the second quarter. Revenue growth was driven by higher customer production volumes from continued strong demand and improved material availability as well as the continued ramp-up and expansion of recently launched programs.

Operating income, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $200,000 improved by approximately 690 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2022 due to lower material costs as a result of continued cost recovery as well as a continued focus on variable cost control. We continue to expect strong revenue growth into 2023 with forecasted growth across our commercial vehicle on and off OEM markets and material availability improvement aligned with end market demand.

Operating income is expected to continue to improve as we stabilize gross margin with cost recovery actions and carefully control our operating expenses to ensure strong fixed cost leverage with revenue growth. We continue to expect that electronics margin will expand sequentially, creating a strong run rate heading into next year.

Page 14 summarizes our key financial metrics, specific to Stoneridge Brazil. Stoneridge Brazil's third quarter sales, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $900,000 increased by $1.4 million or approximately 10.3% relative to the second quarter of 2022 due primarily to higher sales in the local OEM business.

Adjusted operating income, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, increased by approximately $1 million or 620 basis points relative to the second quarter. Despite continued macroeconomic challenges in Brazil, we continue to expect revenue and operating margin to remain stable. We remain focused on the ramp-up of local OEM business and efficient management of variable costs to offset economic headwinds. We expect that Stoneridge Brazil will continue to grow as a global business with engineering capabilities supporting our global electronics footprint, allowing us to improve engineering capacity and capabilities without adding incremental total cost.

Turning to Page 15. Third quarter net debt was $136.2 million. At the beginning of 2022, we anticipated that the material cost and production headwinds forecasted for the year would result in transient or relatively lower EBITDA and worked with our bank group to amend our existing credit facility and provide the company with the financial flexibility needed to continue investing in the business to drive and support future growth.

The amendment, which extends through the first quarter of 2023, waived our leverage ratio for the first 3 quarters of the year and modified the fourth quarter to include a 4.75x leverage ratio. The amendment concluded after the first quarter of 2023, returning to a 3.5x leverage ratio requirement. We are confident the company has ample liquidity and flexibility to operate in the current macroeconomic conditions.

As we move into the last quarter of 2022 and into 2023, we remain focused on efficient cash management to help turn our leverage ratios to more normalized rates as we continue to improve financial performance and expand our earnings.

We saw a rapid improvement in our financial ratios in the third quarter of 2022 as a relatively stronger third quarter replaced a relatively weaker third quarter from 2021 in the trailing EBITDA calculation. We expect that trend to continue and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to return to a more normalized level by the end of the year with an expected leverage ratio of 3x to 3.5x based on our updated EBITDA guidance. We expect to remain in compliance, both during the amendment period and as the amendment period ends in early 2023, and our original covenant ratios are put back in place.

Longer term, we are targeting a leverage ratio under 2.5x, which provides us with ample liquidity and a reasonable risk profile. We will continue to strengthen our balance sheet, helping to provide a steady foundation that will allow us to capitalize on our long-term opportunities.

Page 16 summarizes our expectations for full-year adjusted EPS. We are reducing our adjusted revenue midpoint guidance by $10 million, which translates to a $0.07 adjusted EPS impact, assuming a contribution margin of 25% to 30%, in line with our historical performance. This adjustment reflects improved, but continued material constraints and our view of current end market demand.

We expect continued benefit of the pricing and supply chain actions we took earlier this year to largely offset incremental material prices and remain in conversations with our customer to offset incremental costs, including the recovery of historical costs. We expect strong operating performance as we continue to take actions to make our manufacturing facilities more efficient and maintain our favorability on operating expenses, particularly SG&A.

These tailwinds are offset by the retiming of engineering recoveries of approximately $2.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2022 to 2023. These are costs that we expect to be reimbursed for by our customers as a result of product-specific engineering expenses aligned with future programs. These reimbursements are generally based on timing of program hurdles and reimbursed once the program meets certain development criteria. We expect to receive these retimed reimbursements in 2023.

Our updated guidance implies fourth quarter performance to be approximately $0.21 to $0.27 per share, an adjusted revenue growth of over 11.5% relative to the third quarter. Our guidance also implies fourth quarter EBITDA margin of approximately 8%, which would be a 240 basis point improvement over the third quarter. We remain focused on creating a strong run rate from both the top and bottom line perspective into 2023.

Moving to Slide 17. We expect to continue to build on a strong third quarter in which each segment grew revenue and expanded margins. Our fourth quarter guidance implies continued revenue growth of more than 11%, which is approximately 2.5x expected weighted end market growth.

Similarly our implied midpoint guidance for the fourth quarter implies adjusted EPS growth of $0.21 and EBITDA margin expansion of 240 basis points. As Jon discussed earlier in the call, Stoneridge is committed to driving shareholder value and that focus remains at the forefront of all of our strategic initiatives.

With that, I will open up the call to questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.

Justin Long

I wanted to start with a question on the implied fourth quarter guidance. You talked about it a few times, but it implies a pretty sizable step-up in revenue sequentially, double-digit growth. Can you talk about how much visibility you have to that step-up and maybe provide a little bit more color on how much of that sequential improvement is coming from Control Devices versus Electronics?

Matthew Horvath

Yes. Thanks for the question, Justin. Obviously, we're into the fourth quarter now. So we've got some actual performance to rely on as we set our guidance. We have looked at various different scenarios for the remainder of the year, both on the top and bottom line to make sure that our guidance considers all of those potential ranges as we see them now.

Obviously the market is relatively volatile. So the range is probably a little bit broader than we typically expect in the fourth quarter. But as we see it, that's kind of the expected range for the end of the year, both based on what we've seen in the quarter so far and what we can expect for the remainder. So we've got pretty good visibility to that continued step-up.

As for your question on Control Devices versus Electronics, I would say the market is a little bit more volatile on the Control Devices side as the North American past car market has been a little bit more volatile than the market. Both remain stable and growing from what we can see. And we expect continued ramp up across the segments to support that overall step-up in growth.

I would say it's a little bit more weighted towards electronics as we go into the fourth quarter, the growth side is, just because the CV market, we've got a little bit more makeup, I'll call it backlog, not in the traditional sense that we typically think about a 5-year backlog. But backlog of customer orders in the short term that we can fill as material availability continue to really, really improve here, and we've got some momentum.

So I would say we've got pretty good visibility into the fourth quarter, given where we are in the year. And also I would expect a little bit more on the electronic side as we head towards the end of the year here.

Justin Long

That's very helpful. And maybe shifting to MirrorEye for my second question. Any update on the contribution from MirrorEye that's assumed in the full-year revenue guidance for 2022? And then that comment on the 50%-plus take rate into next year, is that a comment related to just the first contract or is that related to the second contract that will be kicking in as well?

Matthew Horvath

I'll comment on the guidance a little bit. We have set approximately $15 million to $20 million of total MirrorEye revenue when we set our guidance at the beginning of the year. The take rate for the first OEM program has obviously been pretty strong as we continue to ramp up here. So we would expect to be kind of on the high end of that for the year, but still kind of within that range. And maybe I'll let Jon comment on the take rate for the first program there.

Jonathan DeGaynor

So Justin, the 50% take rate is specifically to that first OEM program. As we've said in our backlog, we always use the customer contractual take rates. And what we talked about in each of the earnings calls is -- what we've seen is the sequential outperformance of those, the take rates on a quarter-by-quarter basis versus the contractual take rate.

And the point here is right now we're at approximately 40% take rate. And that is constrained by the supply chain. It's not constrained by demand. As we are continuing to break bottlenecks, we're seeing that take rate go up. So what we're envisioning for 2023 is thinking about 50-plus percent take rate for the first program and as we continue to break bottlenecks in the supply chain support, the new program launches as well.

Matthew Horvath

And Justin, I just want to follow up on that. As you think about the trajectory for next year for that first OE program and what the take rate means incremental and all of those things, a couple of things to remember in the math of that. The ramp-up and switch over from old truck to new truck for our first customer occurred over this year. So I would expect more volume on new truck next year, relatively speaking.

And also that take rate, remember, we launched early in the year, it's not -- we don't have a fully annualized number on that full-year guidance. So you'll get a little bit of benefit of incremental volume on new truck production. You'll get a little bit of benefit on annualization for a full year, and then you'll get the incremental benefit of what we expect to be stronger take rates for the full year next year. So just as you're thinking comp over comp. Hopefully, that helps the math a little bit.

Justin Long

And I guess, lastly is just a quick follow-up on the MirrorEye question. Could you comment on the level of retrofit activity that you're seeing today and how you're expecting that to ramp as we get into next year just based on conversations you're having with customers?

Jonathan DeGaynor

Yes. Justin, we continue to be excited about it. We look forward to being down in Nashville and talking to you a little bit more at your conference. We've got a lot of interest, nothing -- no announcements that we're prepared to make today. But we see retrofit continuing to grow. And fleets -- as some of our leading fleets are showing more of their results, additional fleets are calling and saying, ""Hey, we want the same as what Maverick has or what Schneider has.""

So nothing from an announcement standpoint today, but retrofit is an important part of our overall MirrorEye strategy and it continues to grow. And we look forward to contributions it has in 2023.

Operator

I would now like to turn it back to Jon for closing remarks.

Jonathan DeGaynor

Well, I want to thank you all for your participation in today's call. In closing, I can assure you that our team is committed to continuing to drive shareholder value through strong operating results, profitable new business and focused deployment of our available resources. We're confident that our actions will result in continued success in 2022 and beyond, and we wish you all a very good day.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. I'm Mina, your Chorus Call operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Turkcell's Conference Call and Live Webcast to present and discuss the Turkcell Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ali Serdar Yagci, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance Director. Mr. Yagci, you may now proceed.

Ali Serdar Yağcı

Thank you very much, Mina. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Turkcell's third quarter 2022 results call. Today speakers are; our CEO, Mr. Murat Erkan; and our CFO, Mr. Osman Yilmaz. We have a brief presentation and afterwards we will be taking your questions.

Before we start, I would like to kindly remind you to review the last page of the presentation for our safe harbor statement.

Now, I hand over to Mr. Erkan.

Murat Erkan

Thank you, Serdar. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Turkcell's third quarter earnings call and thank you for joining us. We left behind another quarter where macroeconomic challenges continued to weight on the economic activity around the world. While inflation remains to be a major concern, especially in Turkey, domestic demand was still strong as rising prices prop up consumer spending.

We recorded 57% revenue growth in the third quarter, enabled by consecutive price adjustment and upsell performance coupled with a growing subscriber base. Strong rebound in roaming, ongoing momentum in digital business services and techfin, also positive contribution from international operations supported top line growth.

Amidst continuing inflationary pressures on, EBITDA grew by 49% year-on-year implying just short of 41% margin. On the back of growing EBITDA and proactive FX management, we recorded a net income of TRY 2.4 billion, increasing 68% year-on-year.

Higher mobility and strong tourism activity enabled us to accelerate the growth in the subscriber base with one million net additions. In the first nine months, we gained a total of 2.2 million net subscribers, further strengthening our leadership in the market.

Lastly, this quarter with a focused approach, the revenue share of digital channels in the consumer sales achieved 23% and setting a record. In consideration of these results, we further increased our full year guidance, which I will elaborate on my last slide.

Moving to next slide. Let's take a look at our operational performance in mobile. In line with historical trends, this quarter was marked by increasing mobility coupled with a sharp rise in foreign visitor to Turkey, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. The market continued to grow on back of --

[Technical Difficulty]

Sorry for interruption. So let me start with the second slide. Let's take a look at our operational performance in mobile. In line with historical trends, this quarter was marked by increasing mobility, coupled with a sharp rise in foreign visitor to Turkey, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.

The market continued to grow on back of tourist arrival, as well as the demand from the corporate segment. Accordingly, we recorded strong net adds of 420,000 in postpaid and 506,000 in prepaid subscribers.

Blended mobile ARPU growth ramped up to 49% year-on-year, from 33% in the previous quarter. The main reasons behind the acceleration were consecutive price adjustment since December of last year, upsell performance and the higher data usage during the summer.

On top of the price adjustment of the past three quarters, we made another increase in September and tariffs have been doubled for a new subscriber compared to last year. Despite price adjustment, we continue to observe stable churn levels in the mobile segments, thanks to our energy capabilities, strong brand perception, network quality and extensive distribution channels.

Despite a very slight increase compared to the previous quarter, as expected due to increased mobility, our churn rate was identical to that of last year in this quarter. Confirmed by our Net Promoter Score, the consumer continued to recommend to a significantly higher degree than the competition, underlining our premium position in the mobile segment.

Moving to the next. In the fixed broadband segment, we gained net 68,000 fiber subscribers on the back of rising demand for high-speed connection in the back-to-school period. Our focus on price adjustment and upsell to the higher speed packages has supported ARPU growth of 27%.

ARPU growth in the fixed segment lags behind that of mobile for two reasons. First, contract turns are longer as per market dynamics. And the second the incumbent operator was reluctant to make meaningful price adjustments until October. We have started to offer 12 months contract to address the first concern and also increased price following the incumbent's very recent actions.

The fiber churn rate of 1.2% was not much affected by price increase and higher mobility in this quarter thanks to our superior speed and customer service quality. Proceeding with our fiber rollout plan, we added 240,000 home passes in this quarter. Year-to-date we have reached around 90% of our annual target, with over 700,000 additions.

On the IPTV side, we are pleased to see continued interest in our 3+ service, with 45,000 net additions this quarter. Overall, IPTV penetration in our fiber subscriber base has exceeded 66%, rising three points year-on-year.

Next slide. And now in the next two slides, we go through the developments of our strategic focus areas. Let's start with our digital services and solutions where we gained 1.2 million paid users year-on-year reaching almost five million. The revenue of digital OTT services which include core OTT services rose 66% year-on-year, mainly driven by cloud storage, TV and music streaming.

On the TV+ side, our paid subscriber base continued to grow. As we successfully delivered on our BiP, fizy and TV+ service strategy, our OTT TV subscribers reached 932,000, up 25% year-on-year. Our cloud service platform Lifebox reached 1.7 million paid subscribers, on a solid rise of 47% year-on-year successfully addressing rising interest in cloud services as a result of ongoing digitization of everyday lives.

On the Digital business services side, where we serve corporates and enterprises this quarter was marked by exceptional revenue growth of 107%. Tailor-made and Digital Transformation projects were instrumental in this growth.

Additionally, by more than doubling tier revenues data center, cloud and business application services further supported growth. The backlog from the system integration project totaled TRY1.5 billion, which is set to contribute to the top line over the upcoming quarters.

We continue to acquire new value-added business, for instance the established Turkey's Electric Vehicle Togg, IT Infrastructure with High Processing Power.

Next slide third, is our Techfin focus. Our Techfin business had a strong quarter with revenues up 77% year-on-year. As Turkey's leading payment platform Paycell was the main driver of this growth, increasing its revenues 105% year-on-year.

The ongoing shift to the digital payments was evident to tripling, total transaction volume and the 21% rise, in active users hitting over seven million. Among the revenue lines, the leading products Pay Later, sustained its strong revenue trend as mobile payment will doubles year-on-year.

Another strong platform vertical is Paycell Card where the transaction volume rose fourfold. Lastly, revenue contribution from POS Solution also continued, as we ramp up our Android POS devices in this market.

Furthermore, Paycell Europe was launched, in the third quarter, to serve users on that continent. The company will initially provide Money Transfer services, targeting mainly to Turkish population money flow from and to Europe.

Further to that, we are planning to launch digital wallet, debit card and investment product solutions. On the Consumer Financing side, Financell's revenue rose 57%, on a larger loan portfolio achieving TRY2.9 million. Despite a growing loan book under unfavorable macro condition, the cost of risk remains at a healthy level of 1.3%.

Next slide, now, let's take a look at our performance in the International Market. Turkcell International segment revenue grew by 79% year-on-year, mainly thanks to the currency movement and to some extent lifecell's growth.

Despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, lifecell revenue grew by 10% yearly in local currency terms, mainly with the increase in ARPU. Lower interconnection costs and sustained marketing expenses more than compensated for the rising analysis pressures.

Lifecell's EBITDA margin improved by, around three percentage points, to 60% in the third quarter. In Belarus, BeST revenue rose 9%, thanks to mainly the price increase and upsell performance. The contraction in handset sales continued to positively impact the EBITDA margin.

Next slide, as communicated before, we are proud and excited to be a part of Turkey's Electrical Vehicle Project Togg, which unveiled the Gaming Technology Conference last week on the occasion of Turkish Republic Day.

The first domestic car is expected to hit the road in March, March of next year. And we will be the first electrical SUV produced in Continental Europe by a non-traditional manufacturer. The facility will have a production capacity of 175,000 units per year and aims to produce a total of one million vehicles of five different models, by 2030.

At Turkcell, we are not only glad to contribute to Turkish dream of innovation, but also work towards the aim of leveraging our position in e-mobility services. By leveraging our capabilities in Digital Services, we integrated fizy, as a native music application of the car.

Moreover, we recently announced that we are working to integrate Paycell's payment system, and Digital Financial Solution into Togg's Mobility Solution. Thanks to e-wallet card storage and [indiscernible] infrastructure provided by Paycell, top users will be able to create their own talk wallet and make payments at charging station without having to exit the vehicle.

Next slide, I would like to end my presentation by sharing our updated guidance, for the full year of 2022. Taking into consideration our nine months performance, we once again revised our guidance upwards.

Accordingly, we raised our revenue growth target to 47% to 48% and EBITDA guidance to around TRY21 billion. On the CapEx side, we changed our guidance to around 20%. Thanks to our controlled CapEx management. Please note that these expectations do not account for, the implication of like the adoption of inflationary accounting in the future.

I will now leave the floor to our CFO, Osman.

Osman Yilmaz

Thank you, Murat. Please now let's take a closer look at our financial performance. In the third quarter our group revenues grew by 57% year-on-year, corresponding to an incremental rise of TRY5.3 billion.

Turkcell Turkey recorded a revenue growth of 57% in this quarter; thanks to an expanding subscriber base, gradually increasing ARPU growth as a result of dedicated price adjustments throughout the year and strong momentum of Digital Business services. Doubling year-on-year strong performance of wholesale and roaming revenues was another driver of the top line growth.

Turkcell International revenues comprising 11% of the Q3 top line contributed TRY700 million, mainly with the positive impact of currency movements and better-than-expected performance of Lifecell Ukraine.

Our Techfin segment made TRY218 million contribution. Paycell revenues which accounts for 49% of the segment rose by 105% year-on-year. This performance was due mainly to traction in the Pay Later product as well as our POS solution that has been on an uptrend since its launch.

Additionally, Financell's revenue was up 57% year-on-year, thanks to a greater loan portfolio average interest rates and rising contribution of insurance business revenues. Improvement of the other segments' contribution on a yearly basis was mainly thanks to a rise in sales from digital channels and higher equipment revenues.

Next slide, now some highlights on EBITDA development. EBITDA rose by 49% year-on-year to TRY6 billion and margin decreased by 2.2 points year-on-year to 40.9%. Two main factors behind this contraction were wage hikes and higher energy prices.

On the personnel expenses side, we reflected the rise in minimum wage to our wage ancillary's budget in July which was the second increase of the year. Our energy expenses more than tripled year-on-year as of Q3, stemming from globally increasing electricity prices and higher utilization in data centers.

On the other hand, lower growth of cost of goods sold and interconnection costs as a percentage of revenue limited the margin contraction. Turkcell International segment recorded a 52% EBITDA margin in this quarter. As a percentage of revenues, lower S&M expenses and improvement in the international cost of Ukraine operations more than compensated the higher radio expenses.

Lastly group S&M expenses only recorded a limited increase of 0.1 points as a percentage of revenues, while we managed to add one million subscribers to our portfolio just in this quarter.

Next slide. Now, more detail on our free cash flow generation. In line with our expectation we generated TRY2 billion free cash flow in this quarter. This cash flow generation was mainly on the back of strong EBITDA generation of TRY6 billion.

Our working capital improved around TRY80 million, mainly resulting from a positive impact from trade receivables thanks to better collection performance and higher trade payables due to seasonality as well as the support from advance payments realized in the previous quarter. To note, the increase in receivables from financial services was mainly due to Financell's expanding loan portfolio.

Next slide. Let's take a close look at our CapEx management. We continue to focus on fixed segment investments in order to introduce our pure fiber technology to new customers given the sustained demand. In Q3, around half of operational CapEx was accounted for by the fixed segment. Accordingly, we recorded 711,000 home passes in the first nine months of the year.

Having advanced the quality of mobile network in the past years, we are now able to focus more on expanding our fiber footprint. In Q3, our operational CapEx to sales ratio was at 17% which brings the 12-month figure to 18.9%. We expect a higher CapEx in Q4 given the seasonality.

On the fiber front, while CapEx intensive continues to increase, it will normalize as we ramp up monetizing of new home passes. All-in-all we are progressing in line within our plan.

Next slide. Now, a few words on our balance sheet. As of Q3, our total cash position increased from TRY22 billion to TRY24 billion. Of this increase TRY1.9 billion stemmed from currency movements. Recall that there was a cash outflow of TRY1.3 billion as dividends in July.

Our gross debt position increased to TRY52 billion from TRY48 billion. Currency movements led to around TRY2.9 billion increase in total debt. As a result, our leverage has improved this quarter to one-time, thanks to strong EBITDA growth and higher financial assets. Excluding the finance business, the figure was 0.9 times.

The bulk of our cash remains in hard currencies. Excluding FX loss 55% of our cash is in US dollars and 17% in euros. This cash is sufficient to cover our debt service until 2025.

Next slide. Lastly, I will go into the management of our FX currencies. At the end of Q3, we had around $1.9 billion equivalent of FX debt and around $1.2 billion equivalent of FX-denominated cash as a net FX position.

Additionally, we had around $700 million derivative portfolio comprised mainly of proxy hedges which shield us independent of currency fluctuations. Overall, we have a limited short net FX position of $19 million. Going forward, we continue to target a neutral FX position.

This concludes our presentation. And we can now open the line for questions. Thank you very much.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

The first question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.

Unidentified Analyst

Hello, thank you for taking my question. Congrats on the very strong results. Can you hear me?

Murat Erkan

Yes.

Unidentified Analyst

Great. Okay. So, you have presumably spoken about ending the year nearly 1.5 times net leverage. Now, net leverage actually went down to 1.2 times from one point -- sorry 1.0 times from 1.2 times in 2Q 2022. So I was wondering what do you now think we should expect for net leverage at year-end 2022?

Osman Yilmaz

I guess this is the only question. Actually we completed this quarter as we said with the leverage of one times. Our target is to keep this -- keep the leverage at these levels given that we don't have any big CapEx cycle inside in near future like 5G. We continue to focus on our fiber investments and invest less in mobile network since we had already done a bulk of investments in the past five years. So, excluding for the currency impacts we keep -- we aim to keep our leverage target around one times going forward.

Unidentified Analyst

That's excellent news for us I guess. Your EBITDA is obviously growing stronger than expected which has to with deleveraging. But I was wondering if given the high cash position you've accumulated like bonds are trading below par, if you are looking into accelerating the bond debt reduction?

Murat Erkan

Could you repeat the question? Second question, we couldn't get the question.

Unidentified Analyst

Sure. I was wondering if you're planning to accelerate the bond debt reduction given the very high cash position you have accumulated while bonds are trading below par?

Murat Erkan

Yes, it is one alternative for us to use our cash to buy back bonds which are trading very cheap in the current credit conditions both locally and globally. But unfortunately the liquidity in the secondary market is very thin. So, we are not able to buy back as we wish. So, we use our cash in relatively more liquid instruments at the moment. But bond buybacks are an important item on our treasury's agenda. So, we look for opportunities to increase our bonds.

Unidentified Analyst

Great. And the last question is related to private penetration. Your uptake rate is very high at 41%. And you obviously mentioned that among new homes passed even 50%. So, I was wondering if you can provide an outlook on the topic here where do you see penetration rates trending going forward, do you have any homes pass targets for this year and next year?

And then you also mentioned that the government is paying for some of your fiber CapEx. So I was wondering if you can expand a bit how the dynamic works. For example, what the proportion is between fiber CapEx that you pay for yourself compared to that of the government? And if it reverses you or it pays a direct play?

Osman Yilmaz

Okay. Thinking further, I didn't get your point about government restriction on the CapEx side, because we don't have any constraint on the government limitation for the fiber CapEx. For the fiber side, we aim to reach around 800,000 fiber home pass. We already get like around 700,000-710,000 level. So, it seems that we're going to reach our targets.

And for the take-up rate part, our take-up rate is quite strong. Obviously, while we are adding new home passes, we can see some slight decrease on the take-up. But we're going to recover as soon as we penetrate to the market. We penetrated to the new home passes that we get. So we don't see any issue on the take-up rate side. We're going to see that it's going to continue to slight increase on the take-up rate side.

Unidentified Analyst

The question on the government was not about restrictions. But I think you once mentioned that the government is paying for some of your CapEx. So that subsidies or reimbursement or something like that. And I was wondering how this dynamic works?

Osman Yilmaz

No, no. Actually, this is not related with fiber. Government doesn't give any incentive, any payment on the fiber side, fiber CapEx side. But we have universal fund, which is used on the mobile side for the area that have a very limited customer lives. But this is related with mobile, not the fiber side. We don't get any incentive, any CapEx support from the government or anywhere else. I wish we have.

Unidentified Analyst

Okay, great. Thank you very much. Those were all my questions, and congrats again on the great quarter.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Kennedy-Good Jonathan with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Kennedy-Good Jonathan

Good evening, and thanks for the opportunity to ask questions. Just a one from my side. You mentioned, there were no real plans for 5G. I just wanted to -- if you could refresh us on whether there are any renewals of licenses coming up or spectrum auctions that we should be aware of in the near to medium-term? And thoughts on 5G rollout eventually please?

Murat Erkan

Okay. First of all, let's focus on the 5G side. Obviously, there is no official time line for 5G announced by the regulatory ad. And 5G is a vital technology that we can facilitate the digitalization of industries and contribute to the economic development of country. However, we believe there are some issues that are needed to be addressed first for how to launch such as the fiber connection of base station, 5G capable smartphone penetration and development of local manufactured equipment.

As of 29 of July, we officially launched commercial 5G in Istanbul Airport with a special regulatory permission that is issued to all operators. And Turkcell customers and international roamer can get 5G support 5G part of it. We will position this airport as a commercial 5G pilot cluster. And we would like to use it as a base of create an R&D and test facility test side of the equipment.

As to the license cost and rollout CapEx, it is difficult to give any estimate to be honest. And we'll see the time line. And there is no official tender announcement yet. On the 2G renewal side, we are talking with the regulatory in terms of renewing 2G, at least for the end of our 3G and 5G -- sorry, LTE spectrum license end, which is 2029. So as soon as we get some conclusion, we'll go and announce this position. So -- but it is not going to be a big thing for us. It should be another six years extension of the 2G. And obviously 2G is coming to the end.

Kennedy-Good Jonathan

Great. Thank you. That’s very helpful.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Nagy Nora with Erste Group. Please go ahead.

Nagy Nora

Hi, and thank you for the presentation and for the possibility to ask questions. Two from my side, please. Today, we've seen the release of the inflation in Turkey, which topped 85%. And I was wondering if this could mean further price increase to come even this year so in December maybe?

And then, the second question about any more if you have in Turkey about another minimum wage increase, and if yes, by how much? Thank you.

Murat Erkan

Okay. Let me start from the second part of the question. Obviously, having such a high inflation environment, we will see some increase on the -- on minimum wage salary. But our expectation is starting from next year as a usual time line. I don't know how much, because it really depends on the government policy and the discussion with all the shareholders. So -- but you can assume that we can see some increase on the minimum wage salary in Turkey.

Regarding inflation pricing, as the leading operator, our priority in the high inflation environment is to adjust our prices in a more frequent and the timely manner. So our approach has given competitors to opportunity to adjust their price as well, because we are the leading operator. We start adjusting our prices on the mobile segment in December, last year. And we have made further increase in March, June and September. We saw that these price adjustments were followed by the competition to an extent.

Despite the effective pricing on the mobile side, competitive dynamics and it leads to more limited price increase on the fixed segment. In spite of the continued demand for fixed broadband services, the incumbent operator was reluctant to make meaningful price adjustment until October, which was evident in the limited revenue growth and significant EBITDA margin contraction. Accordingly, we had fewer price increases in the fixed segment.

In October, the incumbent operator made a meaningful price revision, which was also followed by us on November 1. Furthermore, telecommunications is a necessity service for our customer unlike a discretionary item demand to our services and have limited price elasticity.

Additionally, the price of other spending items is also rising, which makes consumers less sensitive to price adjustments as well. So, therefore, it's fair to state that we do have the ability to reflect higher inflation to our prices. Our accelerated ARPU growth over the last quarter's also confirm this.

Nagy Nora

Thank you.

Operator

The next question comes from Demirak Kayahan with AK Investment. Please go ahead.

Demirak Kayahan

Hi. Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask question. Also congratulations on the strong results. I have a few things on my mind. The first thing I understand that the prices for the new mobile tariffs almost doubled in September with the cumulative price increases. So, I mean, for the existing tariffs, I mean, for the renewables where do you see the price growth as of September?

Murat Erkan

I mean, obviously, it reflects to our ARPU numbers. And I think we see that 60% to 70% level.

Demirak Kayahan

Okay. Thank you. And I was hoping to get more color for the next year. Maybe could you give us some color, some direction regarding the expected blended ARPU growth for the next years given the pricing actions you take so far?

Murat Erkan

Obviously, we had increased four times during this year. So it really depends on the inflation journey in Turkey for next year. So -- but we have just one rule, which we're going to follow inflationary pricing. If we see inflation is decreasing, we're going to react based on that. If we see inflation increasing, we're going to react based on that. So I cannot comment from now about inflation process, but I mean whatever it happens we're going to follow this.

Demirak Kayahan

Okay. Thank you. And as for the next year's results in terms of the expected CapEx intensity, do you think that the churns around 20% as of sales is sustainable since you don't expect any further investments on that front in the near term?

Murat Erkan

To be honest, we would like to expect similar CapEx intensity for next year. Obviously, for the CapEx side there are a dependency that we cannot control, which is like currency and other things. But to be honest, we would like to stick on our CapEx intensity side for next year as well.

Demirak Kayahan

Okay. Understood. Thank you. And the final question was about -- it's about the dividend payment. You were usually paying around 50% payout ratio, but you reduced it to 25% this year, I mean, given the difficult operating environment and the rising cost of debt. So the leverage seems now quite comfortable. What should we expect on that front at least in terms of your deal?

Murat Erkan

Yes. Based on the normal condition, we will come back to our normal procedure, which is 50% distribution of the net income. So, I mean, we don't -- I mean, as long as we don't see any different things on macro micro whatever, we will continue we're going to stick on our policy, because we -- our policy is quite clear so we're going to keep our policy.

Demirak Kayahan

Okay. That was very helpful.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Turkcell management for any closing comments. Thank you.

Operator

Good morning and afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Sylvie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amerigo Resources Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Note that all participant lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the formal remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jonathan Paterson of Harbor Investor Relations. You may begin the conference.

Jonathan Paterson

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to Amerigo Resources quarterly conference call to discuss the company's financial results for the third quarter of 2022. We are delighted to have you join us today.

This call will cover Amerigo's financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call to a question-and-answer session. Our call today will be led by Amerigo's Chief Executive Officer, Aurora Davidson, along with the company's Chief Financial Officer, Carmen Amezquita.

Before we begin our formal remarks, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements on this conference call may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not necessarily limited to financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested by any forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our SEDAR filings.

I will now hand the call over to Aurora Davidson. Please go ahead, Aurora.

Aurora Davidson

Thank you, JP. Welcome, everyone, to Amerigo's earnings call for the third quarter of 2022. We remind you that all dollar figures reported in the call are U.S. dollars, except where we specifically refer to Canadian dollars. We had another strong operational quarter at MVC, where we continue to see consistent results and expect to exceed our annual copper production guidance by 3%. Copper production was 16 million pounds during the quarter. 54% of this came from processing fresh tailings and the remainder from the historical tailings at Cauquenes.

In contrast to the positive operational performance, Amerigo's third quarter financial results were impacted by decline in copper prices, resulting in a net loss of $4.4 million or $0.03 per share for the quarter. Towards the end of my remarks, I will expand upon the topic of our pricing mechanism. I would like to add more detail on it for the benefit of our newer shareholders who have been attracted by Amerigo's return of capital policy.

Yesterday, Amerigo's Board of Directors declared another quarterly dividend CAD 0.03 per share payable on December 20. Based on Amerigo's end of quarter share price, this represents an annual dividend yield of 12.4%. Currently, the MVC production team is driving the plant proactively and achieving two important operational goals to consistently prioritize fresh tailings processing and to be able to quickly react to changes in the fresh tailings stream when these changes occur.

In this way, on days when throughput from El Teniente declines in response to the mine's own operational conditions, we can quickly ramp up processing from Cauquenes and meet our own production targets. This operational flexibility is key, and it is the driver behind Amerigo's predictable production results.

NBC had no operational issues during the quarter. We had zero lost time due to accidents, no environmental incidents and our plant availability was 98.5%. MVC's water reserves at the end of the quarter were 5.4 million cubic meters, that is 0.2 million cubic meters higher than at the end of the second quarter. These water reserves remain sufficient to maintain projected Cauquenes processing rates for a period of at least 18 months, which is our maximum forecast horizon.

Despite a higher inflationary environment, we continued to successfully manage costs. Production costs year-to-date have been 2% over budget compared to copper production trending 3% over budget. Last week, we also successfully completed negotiations with MVC's Workers Union and entered into a new three-year collective labor agreement. The Workers Union has 198 members and represents most of MVC employees. This agreement gives us important cost visibility into the future.

MVC's sustaining CapEx program is advancing well and on budget. This year, MVC undertook two risk mitigation projects as well, one of which has been canceled after conducting additional studies that confirmed it was not necessary to undertake it.

We have also determined that a new sump in Cauquenes will be required in 2023 and decided to take advantage of the current dry season in Chile to start that work now. Amerigo's operational performance continues to provide a solid foundation for our capital return strategy. In Q3, Amerigo returned $3.8 million to shareholders through the company's regular dividend of CAD 0.03 per share per quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Amerigo has paid $12 million in dividends and $12.3 million to retire shares for cancellation.

I mentioned in the last call that because of our current and potential investment yield, we would be working to transform the way we tell the Amerigo story. We are introducing ourselves to additional types of investors and have produced a new deck and a new corporate video, which are available on our website. We hope you will periodically revisit the website as we continue to work on a full revamp of our messaging.

Our goal is to explain how Amerigo is not a copper miner, but rather an industrial company with a simple and proven process whose output is copper. We have ESG attributes that most companies can only aspire to, and our capital return policy is best in class.

Now as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, I want to talk about our pricing mechanism. I want to illustrate the timing and effect of our financial results during a period of sharply falling copper prices because we think copper prices are currently stabilizing. I think you will see how powerful the positive effect is as we turn the page on falling prices and market fundamentals continue to reassert themselves.

As many of you know, Amerigo sells its copper on an M+3 basis, which is the most common pricing mechanism in the copper industry. This is so because it usually takes three months for copper concentrates to be shipped, processed and then sold as copper metal to processors. One could say that M+3 is an industry-wide formula.

In practical terms, this means that copper sold, for example, in November 2022, will eventually be priced at the average LME market price that emerges in February 2023, three months down the line. In the meantime, for accounting purposes, we work with provisional prices. It is helpful to think as a provisional price as a temporary placeholder until the final price for each of the three months is in each quarter is known.

To reflect this reality, Amerigo must adjust its earnings through the quarter as each final monthly average price replaces the provisional price. So at the end of Q2 2022, which was two quarters ago, we assigned a provisional price of $4.10 per pound to the second quarter's production.

Last quarter, in Q3, we adjusted that provisional price of $4.10 per pound to reflect the final prices we received. So we adjusted for $10 per pound to the actual realized prices, which were $3.41 per pound in July, $3.61 per pound in August and $3.51 per pound in September. For the third quarter, that represented a negative adjustment of $0.60 per pound or $8.6 million in revenue deductions.

Although we have discussed this pricing mechanism previously, I wanted to readdress the topic because it appears that copper prices are now bottoming. This means that the negative earnings adjustment effects from the sharp declining copper prices we have seen this year could be almost over. At the end of the third quarter, Amerigo's provisional price was $3.50 per pound.

And given the strength of the physical market, I don't expect to see another downward move of $0.60 per pound in the fourth quarter. In fact, the average copper price for October was $3.46 per pound, and the average copper price for November so far has been $3.47 per pound. If these prices continue for the rest of the quarter, we should not have significant final settlement adjustments in Q4. And if the prices move above $3.50 per pound, we will again be in positive adjustments territory.

Now I would like to explain this mechanism in a different way to our newer shareholders. The important thing to remember is that these adjustments don't change the price that we were always going to receive for our copper. In other words, no matter the copper price volatility we experience as we advance through time. We were always going to receive a final price for our copper 90 days in the future. So it's not the short-term ups and downs that matter. It's more important to follow the copper price trend line.

We have just endured a tremendous downdraft in copper prices that we think has stabilized. And during this period, we have been able to safely maintain our quarterly dividend, which represents a tremendous yield on investment. If the trend has indeed stabilized and starts to reverse the upside, as we think it will, then we will receive a higher final price for the copper we produced in the third quarter as final prices are realized.

I am certain that everyone listening has their own view on the future price of copper. And now I will take some time to give us -- to share our own outlook. Every third quarter earnings call from a copper producer has commented on the sharp disconnect between a weak macroeconomic sentiment and the tightness in the physical copper market. In other words, the financial markets have a negative view on copper at a time when physical markets are extremely tight.

Visible global copper stocks have fallen to very low levels, and some experts estimate that these levels could be as low as five days of global consumption. If you are newer to the world of copper, visible copper stocks used to be counted in weeks, not days.

Supply challenges have persisted throughout the year, but the potential for a massive disruption has emerged if Russian metals are suspended from the LME, as is currently, is currently being contemplated. It is unclear how such a suspension would be implemented, but the practical effect would be to further distort the reality between the financial markets and the physical markets. Russia accounts for 3.5% of global copper production and hindering the ability of that metal to come to market with, in our opinion, through fuel on the fire of an already hot physical market.

Yes, the strength of the U.S. dollar and the fear of a global recession could lead to weaker copper demand and market surplus decisions. However, the supply side continues to be challenged. The strength of the U.S. dollar has certainly had a major negative impact on copper prices since May, but fundamentally, we continue to see limited copper supply and very low inventories.

We think that the impact of fundamentals will soon outweigh the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. We know that copper producers are not having any problem selling copper and that buyers are concerned about locking up future supplies.

Last week, press reports indicated that Codelco signed three and five year contracts with some of their clients instead of the normal one-year contracts. These clients also paid very high premium to secure future supply. It is very evident that end users are worried about accessibility to future copper supply. Analysts point to quiet demand for copper coming from China for infrastructure and electric vehicles, and from Europe, where the deadline to double solar capacity has been moved forward by five years from 2030 to 2025.

If the energy transition demand is indeed building up and copper prices are simply being held down by recession fears, then a structural repricing for copper could occur quickly. To Amerigo, the question is not if, but when the great copper squeeze will hit us. We're confident that copper prices will readjust upwards to reflect the realities of a market facing substantial demand increase without the means to close the supply gap in a meaningful way.

When investor attention is refocused on the historical positive correlation between copper prices and inflation rates, the confluence of market sentiment and physical market reality will provide a powerful base for copper prices to strengthen. We think this will happen sooner rather than later.

And I will now ask Carmen Amezquita, Amerigo's Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the Q3 2022 financial results. Carmen, please go ahead.

Carmen Amezquita

Thanks, Aurora. We're pleased to present the Q3 2022 quarterly financial report from Amerigo Resources and its MVC operation in Chile. Amerigo had a net loss during Q3 2022 of $4.4 million, loss per share of CAD 0.03 or CAD 0.03, EBITDA of $1.6 million, free cash flow to equity of $0.6 million and operating cash flow before changes in noncash working capital items of $2.6 million.

The 2022 third quarter financial results were impacted by $8.6 million in negative price settlement adjustments to prior quarter copper sales because of lower copper prices during the third quarter. Amerigo's financial performance is very sensitive to changes in copper prices. Amerigo's provisional copper price for Q3 2022 was $3.50 per pound, a 10% increase or decrease from the $3.50 per pound provisional price used on September 30, 2022, would result in a $5.7 million change in revenue in Q4 2022 in respective Q3 2022 production. Today's copper price is $3.41 per pound.

On September 30, 2022, the company had a cash and restricted balance of $48.2 million and working capital of $6.9 million compared to a cash and restricted cash balance of $64 million and working capital of $24.6 million at December 31, 2021. Revenue in the third quarter of 2022 was $30.9 million compared to $48.1 million in Q3 2021. This included copper tooling revenue of $27.4 million and molybdenum revenue of $3.5 million.

The decline in copper revenue was attributed to lower copper prices as copper production levels were essentially the same in Q3 2022 and Q3 2021. Within copper revenue, the gross copper sales were $56.8 million, and there were negative settlement adjustments of $8.8 million. Then deducted from revenue, we had $14.3 million in royalties to DET, smelting and refinery costs of $5.9 million and transportation costs of $0.4 million. Of the $8.8 million in negative settlement adjustments, $8.6 million related to Q2 2022 production and our final adjustments.

Total tooling and production costs, including depreciation were $34.4 million in Q3 2022 and $33.9 million in Q3 2021. Excluding depreciation, tolling and production costs were $29.3 million in Q3 2022 and $29.6 million in Q3 2021, which confirm the company's results and containing costs despite inflationary pressures.

Under other expenses, general and administration expenses were $1 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. This included salaries, management and professional fees of $0.5 million; share-based payments of $0.3 million and office and general expenses of $0.3 million. Other losses during Q3 2022 were $0.8 million compared to other losses of $0.5 million in the prior year period, relating mostly to a foreign exchange loss that was recorded during the quarter. Foreign exchange losses in 2022 have mostly been of an unrealized nature.

There was a $0.2 million gain associated with the derivative to related parties compared to a loss of $0.1 million in the prior year period. This difference related mostly to a change in the fair value of the derivative liability as a result of the sharp increase in discount rates used to compute the fair value of the derivative, which resulted in a decrease in the liability and a gain on the P&L. The company's finance expense in Q3 2022 was $0.2 million compared to $1.1 million in Q3 2021, which includes interest on loans, leases and bank charges of $0.5 million and positive fair value changes on an interest rate swap of $0.3 million. On September 30, 2022, the balance of the term loan was $27.6 million.

In Q3 2022, the company recognized an income tax recovery of $0.9 million compared to an income tax expense of $3.1 million in Q3 2021. As a result of the company being in a loss position during the quarter. Effective cash flow in the quarter, cash flow from operating activities before working capital changes during Q3 was $2.6 million, with cash used of $6.3 million after working capital changes. Year-to-date cash flow generated from operations before working capital changes was $19.3 million. And after working capital changes, there has been cash flow generated of $17.8 million.

Cash flow used in investing activities during the quarter was $1.8 million, which related entirely to the purchase of plant and equipment. Year-to-date cash flow used in investing activities has been $7.2 million.

Cash used in financing activities in Q3 2022 was $4 million. Most of this related to the $3.8 million in cash that was returned to shareholders during the quarter through Amerigo's increased quarterly dividend of CAD 0.03 per share. Year-to-date 2022, Amerigo has returned $24.3 million to shareholders, with $12 million paid out in dividends and $12.3 million returned to the purchase of 9.4 million common shares for cancellation through a normal course issuer bid.

Overall, there was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $12.1 million in Q3 and a strong ending cash balance of $41.8 million. Additionally, the company held $6.4 million in restricted cash. We will report the 2022 annual financial results in February 2023, and we want to thank you for your continued interest in the company.

We will now take questions from call participants.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Steve Ferazani at Sidoti. Please go ahead.

Steve Ferazani

Good afternoon Aurora, Carmen. Thanks for all the detail on the call. I thought that was a great explanation on the pricing. I wanted to ask first about inflationary pressures. Obviously, central banks are pretty determined to try to bring that down. But early on, are you seeing any relief in terms of costs yet? And what are your expectations?

Aurora Davidson

Steve, I think that we've been doing a terrific job at the site to maintain costs under control. As I mentioned, what we're seeing with respect to our budget so far in the first nine months of the year was an increase of 3% in production costs overall -- sorry, 2% in cost versus 3% in additional production. So I think that the effort has been done already to maintain costs very aligned and very competitive in order to protect the margins of the business. Our sort of model at MVC is we produce copper and we produce margin. And our team there has been extremely focused on that.

We are in the process of doing our 2023 budget. We're seeing some inflationary pressures locally in respect of services. When these are quoted in Chilean pesos, we're still seeing that the Chilean peso has a weaker standing against the U.S. dollar in 2023, so that will be mitigating any substantial increases. We're seeing good signals with respect to steel for next year, waiting on competitive quotes yet on lime.

As you know, our power costs are essentially locked in other than for inflation. We have another tariff step-down in 2023. So we're in the process of working through the budgeting process without feeling that a substantial shift is ahead of us and that we will continue to be able to maintain a similar cost performance to what we have seen so far in 2022.

Steve Ferazani

Great. Thanks. You mentioned the increased processing of historical tailings that there was less fresh availability. Was that anything you can -- any kind of color you can provide on that? Was that a short-term in nature issue or is there any kind of...

Aurora Davidson

That was very short-term in nature. We saw it during a portion of Q3. It was fully resolved at the end of Q3 and has not occurred again in November or October. And those are just the nature of any operation, right? You cannot operate on a standard basis without any short-term disruptions. The beauty of it, as I mentioned in the call was the flexibility of ramping up Cauquenes to maintain our own results, right? To the extent that we are able to do that, that gives us very predictability in respect of the operational results that we should be getting.

Steve Ferazani

Great. Great. Thanks for that. I wanted to ask on the congratulations on the labor agreement. Are there any costs we should expect in for your 4Q related to that?

Aurora Davidson

Yes, for sure. You've only been following us for about a year or so. When there is a labor settlement in Chile, the biggest component of that negotiation is what's called a signing bonus which is paid to the workers essentially at the time of signing. And in our case, we did 50% at the time of signing, 50% a month afterwards because that represents certain tax savings, payroll tax savings and we have to pick up as an employer.

We expect that the cost of the bonus for the workers will be around $2.9 million. That all has to be expensed in Q4. Even if the contract has a term of three years, we take the hit in accounting --for accounting purposes in the month of October. How does that compared to last -- to the prior settlement adjustment? I think very favorably last three years ago, our cost was $2.1 million. At that time, copper prices at the time of settlement were $2.60 per pound versus $3.48 per pound when we settled a week ago. Copper prices are a major driver for the workers in their negotiating stance. So we did pretty well there.

We also can report that we managed to negotiate a 1% salary increase with our workers which compares favorably to the 4% increase they received in 2019. When I'm talking about salary increases for the workers in Chile, I'm talking about adjustments beyond the inflationary adjustments they get under their contracts. So this is above and beyond inflationary adjustments that are rolled into their remuneration on a fourth monthly basis in Chile. So again, bonus costs of $2.9 million and a 1% salary increase over three years.

Steve Ferazani

Thanks for the detail. Last one for me just on how you're thinking about share repurchases. Would you like to see more stabilization at a higher level before you'd start? And I know there's a period of delay before you be able to do that?

Aurora Davidson

I think so we've mentioned essentially a level of -- when we see prices stabilizing over $3.80 per pound, we think about some repurchases below that, we really will not.

Steve Ferazani

Great. Thanks so much for the time.

Aurora Davidson

Sure. Thank you, Steve.

Operator

Thank you. Next question will be from Terry Fisher at CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.

Terry Fisher

Hi, thanks [indiscernible]. Congratulations again in these difficult operating conditions. You're obviously performing very well. I was partially -- I have three questions. First one is partially just answered, which was about buying back shares. But the NCIB was fully utilized the last one. And I don't think you're able to renew it until December. So my first question is, even if you -- even the copper price is such that you're not ready to buy back more shares, you have to have the NCIB in place. So I'd just like to know the timing of that and the indicated amount?

My second question is whether or not in the current environment where copper, where it is, but given the amount of money accumulating on the balance sheet by the end of the year. What are the prospects for an occasional or special dividend, I forget the terminology you use for that?

And my final question is progress on the new constitution in Chile, what the timing would be and what -- whether you're seeing any positive movement there? I just wanted to table all my three questions ahead of time.

Aurora Davidson

Don't worry, Terry, I will answer your three questions. We will be renewing the normal course issuer bid. You're right. We basically are a month away from having the ability of having another normal course issuer bid go live. We will do it. We will have it up and running. We'll have the program open and so that we can execute on it opportunistically as we can.

The second question was -- what was your second question was...

Terry Fisher

About a special dividend?

Aurora Davidson

Yes, we call it performance dividend. I gave up on it. So we're calling it performance dividend. No one likes the top-up dividend name.

Terry Fisher

Okay.

Aurora Davidson

I don't think that at today's price, that's something that we would be doing, but things could change. We mentioned that a sharp readjustment of copper prices could happen. Whether it happens from now until the end of the year, who knows. We have another dividend coming up on December 20. So we'll see. We'll see that that would be totally dependent on the behavior of copper prices from now until the end of the year.

With respect to the Chilean constitution, you are aware that on September 4, Chile finally had the referendum to reject or accept a proposed new constitution. 62% of Chileans voted to reject the constitution that had been presented to them as an option, which in my opinion, in this political times, whenever you see a 62% vote, that's an overwhelming result.

Now we should remember that the project to draft a new constitution was in response to the Chilean social protests of October 2019. So there is no question that Chileans want to have a new constitution. My reading is that they want to have something that's closer to what they currently have rather than a very dramatically different document. That would indicate that perhaps the best way of approaching a mechanism would be a revamp of the existing document rather than a full rewriting of constitution has occurred and was rejected.

But no one seems to really know how to go about this process. I think that it's a bit of a conundrum where people want to see change, but no one knows what would be the best way of getting that change through the process? And also, who is going to be doing that? Is it going to be doing -- is it going to be done through a -- through the existing Congress, it's a new constitutional group going to be formed. All of those questions are open. They are in flux and no one seems to know how to put them together with clarity and in an executable way.

So I think that we're still seeing changes coming that way. But the indication would be for more moderate changes that are aligned to the model that has seen Chile garner significant political, economical, social progress in the last 25 years.

Terry Fisher

That's great. Thanks.

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. And your next question will be from John Polcari at Mutual of America Capital Management. Please go ahead.

John Polcari

Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is on CapEx for '23. Did you mention there would be a bump in that for some unexpected or anticipated expenditures. Can you expand on that?

Aurora Davidson

For 2023, John, we're expecting to build a new sump. Sumps are the way in which we continue progressing through the processing of Cauquenes material. The last sump that -- the current one where we're working on became operational in July of 2019. It's nearing its end of life towards Q3 of 2023. So a new sump will need to be in place.

Normally, that work would have been started in January. We wanted to accelerate that work to take advantage of the fact that it's not raining in Chile. And we don't want to have any delays associated with rain occurring while we're doing the construction of that sump. So we're just moving ahead in some of the earth removal earth groundwork for this quarter to start that work.

John Polcari

So how much would that pop the CapEx budget for '23 than is CapEx for '22 is fairly low?

Aurora Davidson

CapEx for 2022 was essentially our usual $6 million in sustaining CapEx, about $2.8 million in capitalized maintenance, and we had two projects of $4.7 million. We have canceled one of them for $2.5 million. The budget on the sump is coming close to $7 million, that will be the most significant item in the CapEx for 2023.

John Polcari

And that's spread out over three years. The life of the sump of...

Aurora Davidson

The life of the pump is three, 3.5 years. That's what we estimate to have as a useful life, quite similar to what we had in the current sump.

John Polcari

Because that would be a cash outlay, I assume in fiscal '23, right?

Aurora Davidson

We will have some cash outlay in 2022 about $1.1 million, and the rest will go into 2023.

John Polcari

Okay. So that will be a fairly significant cash outlay compared to last several years. All right. On the molybdenum, you have been an outlook on those price points that's the credit -- the outstanding credit to copper was obviously, as you mentioned, one of the contributing factors to raising the average price of copper because we didn't have the offset. Do you have a view on where you think those prices for minimum might be going?

Aurora Davidson

It's -- there's less clarity always on the outlook for moly than there is for copper, moly prices, however, have been strong in the last 60 days or trending around $18, $80.40 was the last night checked. So it all depends on what will be occurring with that price.

But I don't ever bank on moly as something significant. And you also have to remember that we're getting to the extent that we focus our production on fresh tailings, we're getting less moly through the plant because there is less moly content in the fresh tailings and in the Cauquenes tailings. So it's a good help to have it. Obviously, the higher they caught with the moly, copper -- sorry, the moly price, the better.

With moly, a question also of containing costs. That's another significant price of the piece of the equation because we spend a lot of money in reagents to bring that moly to fruition. And reagents really spiked up their cost in the last months. So it's a balancing act. We're doing much better with the moly total economic contribution in Q3 than we did in the first half of the year, but don't really give a lot of weight to moly when you think of Amerigo. It's a help, but it's not nothing significant.

John Polcari

Got it. On the royalty payment in your financials, you mentioned what the royalty payment expense was. It's lumped in with copper, moly and then the various mines. What was the average royalty payment? Do you know off hand for copper alone for year-to-date now? What we were been paying for royalty?

Aurora Davidson

When you're talking about the royalty payment for Codelco, there is a significant timing difference that one has to be aware of. We pay the royalties based on the M price. So the month of -- there are no M+3 adjustments on the royalty. So essentially, what we have been paying for 2022 so far has been based on the average prices. I'll get you that number, and I'll send it over to you, but I don't have it with me right now.

John Polcari

Okay. Understood. Two other quick questions. One, on the repurchase, which may not go into effect on the day you reload for stock repurchases. But over the course of the next year or two as you envision there might be surplus free cash that part of which would be deployed perhaps in repurchasing the stock, who actually pulls the trigger, if you will, to use an expression in terms of the price, do you allocate a certain dollar amount to a broker who determines in their what they think a fair price might be?

Do you, someone, yourself or CFO to determine that it's a reasonable price to pay. Who's actually authorizing the purchase at a given level when prices were higher, the company paid a significantly higher price over a year ago. It's hard to tell where and in what direction prices will be, particularly for the stock. So what it could or should it, as they say, cheaper prices might have been obtained, then again, it might have been more expensive had one weighted. But who determines the actual timing of purchases? Is it require a Board approval or?

Aurora Davidson

Our discussion is held at the Board level. When we have a bid in front of us, be it a substantial bid, that's an easier exercise because you basically have to go out with one price. When you have a Normal Course Issuer Bid, basically market price. So you're not choosing at which price to pay, you just choose when to trigger the purchases or the repurchases...

John Polcari

That's what I'm asking. Who's actually...

Aurora Davidson

Yes, that basically we would have a cap. And anything below that cap is something that can be executed based on availability of the resources. Above a certain price, we would be basically saying that's as high as we go when a bid is authorized and the program is put in place. We've never repurchased shares at a price that is above what has been determined to be an acceptable price at a recent Board meeting.

John Polcari

I understand that. Just who is actually calling up. Is the broker allocated at certain...

Aurora Davidson

That's what the decision made by the broker. That's the decision -- on a practical level, I make the decision.

John Polcari

Yes. I'm not talking about the cap price. I mean during the course of a given week or month or quarter, just someone in management yourself would call the broker and say you're interested in spending plenty of repurchases this week or month or quarter?

Aurora Davidson

Yes, that would be me.

John Polcari

Okay. And lastly we have about 10.8 million in options standing, I guess best guess it's about 5.8 million. And year-to-date, we've granted another 2.6 million. So we, to some degree, obviously, just repurchasing stock to offset option grants. I know it's a required compensation for management and employees as part of the total package, but do you have a view towards what's a level of...

Aurora Davidson

We have repurchased 10% of the issued and outstanding in the last year. We wouldn't be able to have -- we -- our total number of options out compared to the issued outstanding is significantly less than that.

John Polcari

Okay. Is the -- on a fully diluted basis, I guess, repurchases would be maybe closer to what, 5%?

Aurora Davidson

No, I don't think so. I don't think that we've had that much shares -- sorry, options issued out in the last years.

John Polcari

All right. And lastly, this means of talk over the quarterly calls were perhaps two years or more about the potential to maybe expand the business in terms of doing additional volume with Codelco. I know that the wheels of progress move relatively slowly at times. But there's been some talk now for well over a year or two about the potential as Codelco has to expand to generate more funds for the government and there's pressure on them to expand operations. I'm sure as copper prices hopefully climb that drumbeat will pick up. Are we any closer to some substantive discussion about expanding operations?

Aurora Davidson

No, we're not. And I think that with the correction in copper prices that we saw this year, that incentive really was taking off the table for a lot of companies. And I think that as copper prices continue to strengthen, the incentive will be there -- will have to be there and will be very favorable, but it's -- those are not the conditions right now, John.

John Polcari

Okay. Because perhaps when copper prices are lower, that's the time for discussions related to expansion as opposed to trying to envision a larger operation at more expensive levels, but be that as May. At the moment, business as usual, you're saying. Okay.

Aurora Davidson

Correct.

John Polcari

Great. Thank you. Appreciate the answer.

Aurora Davidson

Thank you, John.

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Federal Signal Corporation Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ian Hudson, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.

Ian Hudson

Good morning, and welcome to Federal Signal's Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm Ian Hudson, the company's Chief Financial Officer. Also with me on the call today is Jennifer Sherman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will refer to some presentation slides today as well as to the earnings news release, which we issued this morning. The slides can be followed online by going to our website, federalsignal.com, clicking on the Investor Call icon and signing into the webcast. We have also posted the slide presentation and the earnings release under the Investor tab on our website.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of our comments made today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language found in today's news release and in Federal Signal's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website. Our presentation also contains some measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In our earnings release and filings, we reconcile these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures. In addition, we will file our Form 10-Q later today.

I'm going to begin today by providing some detail on our third-quarter results before turning the call over to Jennifer to provide an update on our performance, current market conditions, recent acquisition activity, and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, Jennifer and I will address your questions. Our consolidated third-quarter financial results are provided in today's earnings release. In summary, our businesses were able to deliver another solid quarter with double-digit growth in net sales and earnings, gross margin improvement, and an adjusted EBITDA margin towards the upper end of our target range.

Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $346 million, up $48 million or 16% compared to last year despite a $3 million unfavorable foreign currency translation impact. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was $27 million or 9%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $39.5 million, up $5.2 million or 15% compared to last year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $53.5 million, up $6.1 million or 13% compared to last year. That translates to a margin of 15.4% in Q3 this year compared to 15.9% last year. Net income for the quarter was $31.8 million, up $2.6 million or 9% from last year. That equates to GAAP EPS for the quarter of $0.52 per share, up $0.05 per share or 11% from last year.

On an adjusted basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.53 per share, an improvement of $0.05 per share or 10% compared to last year. Our third quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS in both the current and prior year included certain discrete tax benefits, primarily related to tax planning strategies. In the current year quarter, these benefits totaled $3.8 million, which was $700,000 less than the amount recognized in the prior year quarter. Order intake for the quarter was again strong with orders of $382 million, representing an increase of $32 million or 9% compared to Q3 last year. Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter set another new company record at $824 million.

That represents an increase of $337 million or 69% from last year. In terms of our group results, ESG's net sales for the quarter were $285 million, an increase of $36 million or 14% compared to last year. ESG's operating income for the quarter was $33.9 million, up $3.1 million or 10% compared to last year. ESG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $46.5 million, up $3.8 million or 9% compared to last year. That translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.3% in Q3 this year compared to 17.1% last year. ESG reported total orders of $321 million in Q3 this year, an improvement of $29 million or 10% compared to last year. SSG's net sales for the quarter were $62 million, up $12 million or 25% compared to last year. SSG's operating income for the quarter was $10.5 million, up $2.9 million or 38% from last year. SSG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.5 million, up $3 million or 35% from last year.

SSG's adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 18.7%, up 140 basis points from Q3 last year. SSG's orders for the quarter were $61 million, up $2 million or 4% compared to last year. Corporate operating expenses for the quarter were $4.9 million compared to $4.1 million last year.

Turning now to the consolidated income statement, where the increase in sales contributed to an $11.9 million improvement in gross profit. Consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 23.9%, up 10 basis points compared to last year. As a percentage of sales, our selling, engineering, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were up 30 basis points from Q3 last year. Other items affecting the quarterly results include a $300,000 increase in amortization expense, a $400,000 reduction in other income and a $1.6 million increase in interest expense. Tax expense for the quarter was $4.9 million compared to $4.3 million last year, with the increase primarily due to the recognition of fewer discrete tax benefits in the current year quarter compared to the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.4% compared to 12.8% last year. At this time, we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.

On an overall GAAP basis, we, therefore, earned $0.52 per share in Q3 this year compared with $0.47 per share in Q3 last year. To facilitate earnings comparisons, we typically adjust our GAAP earnings per share for unusual items recorded in the current or prior quarters. In the current year quarter, we made adjustments to GAAP earnings per share to exclude acquisition-related expenses. On this basis, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $0.53 per share compared with $0.48 per share last year. Looking now at cash flow, where we generated $10 million of cash from operations during the quarter, bringing the total year-to-date operating cash generation to $32 million. We ended the quarter with $296 million of net debt and availability under our prior credit facility of $160 million.

We recently increased our borrowing capacity by executing a new 5-year $800 million credit facility, replacing the $500 million credit facility that was previously in place. The new credit facility provides greater financial flexibility to invest in internal growth initiatives and pursue additional strategic acquisitions like TowHaul Corporation, which we acquired shortly after the end of the quarter for an initial payment of $43 million. The terms of the new facility are more favorable to the company, reflecting our strong cash flow and balance sheet. This marks another important milestone for the company as we continue to execute on our strategic long-term growth objectives. We also remain committed to investing in organic growth initiatives and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. On that note, we paid dividends of $5.5 million during the quarter, reflecting a dividend of $0.09 per share, and we recently announced a similar dividend for the fourth quarter.

That concludes my comments, and I would now like to turn the call over to Jennifer.

Jennifer Sherman

Thank you, Ian. With benefits from pricing actions, strong aftermarket demand and contributions from recent acquisitions, our businesses were able to deliver double-digit year-over-year net sales and earnings growth, gross margin improvement, and an EBITDA margin towards the high end of our target range despite supply chain disruption, which impacted production and shipments at certain facilities within our Environmental Solutions Group early in the quarter. Within our Environmental Solutions group, we again saw increased demand for rentals, parts and used equipment, driven in part by the extended lead times for new equipment. Overall, our aftermarket revenues in Q3 this year were up 10% over last year, with particularly strong demand for rentals and parts sales.

The growth of our aftermarkets business remains a key strategic initiative and with benefits from pricing actions, geographic expansion into new territories, and acquisitions leveraging our aftermarkets platform, we were pleased to report our highest aftermarket revenues in any third quarter. In total, aftermarket revenues represented about 30% of ESG's revenues for the quarter. The volatile supply chain environment in which we are currently operating is causing us to constantly adjust our production schedules, creating a high degree of inefficiency and impacting our ability to ship units. During the quarter, production shipments at our Streator and Elgin manufacturing facilities were adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions, primarily related to sporadic shortages in hydraulics and specialty control components.

We are partially building trucks and completing them when the missing parts arrive. For example, in July, 30% of the units scheduled to be built at our Streator facility, we're waiting for parts at the end of the month. In response, the teams worked diligently to secure additional parts as well as to qualify alternative suppliers. The encouraging news is that as the quarter progressed, we saw sequential monthly improvement in production. In fact, September represented our highest weekly unit production at both facilities this year with build rates up 35% since January. Street Sweeper production also experienced a planned temporary decline in July as our LGIM facility implemented a lean manufacturing initiative to reconfigure one of its production lines. While the assembly line reconfiguration had a temporary impact in July, production ramped back up in August and September. Towards the end of the quarter, we also experienced some customer pickup delays resulting from Hurricane Ian, particularly in our dump body business.

We are fortunate that our facilities and employees were not directly impacted by this extreme weather event and are pleased that our equipment is playing a critical role in repairing and rebuilding the damage to housing and infrastructure in the affected areas. Within our Safety and Security Systems Group, the supply chain improvement we started to see towards the end of last quarter continued into the third quarter. Over the course of the last several months, our procurement and engineering teams have worked diligently to add alternative suppliers for various components like LEDs and wire harnesses and have redesigned printed circuit boards to replace unavailable, obsolete or long lead time electronic components. We have also brought certain production in-house to alleviate some pressure on our key suppliers. For example, we have added in-house capacity to offset demand shortages from our contract manufacturer for printed circuit boards that are used in our past finder products.

With these affords gaining traction, we saw an improvement in inventory availability. The supply chain became more reliable as the quarter progressed, and our operations team put together a robust execution plan to build out the increasing backlog by flexing the workforce, working overtime and hiring additional resources. These factors contributed to SSG's record third-quarter performance, which included 25% top-line growth at an EBITDA margin in excess of its target range. I'll conclude my comments on Q3 by reiterating that while supply chain remains burdensome, we have seen improvement within SSG and are encouraged by the recent improvement in production levels that we've seen in our Streator and Elgin facilities.

During the quarter, as production levels increased, we saw sequential monthly improvement in sales. And despite the volatile supply chain environment we have been operating in so far this year, we remain on track to have a record year in terms of sales and earnings. Demand for our product offering continues to be as strong as ever as demonstrated by our outstanding third-quarter order intake of $380 million, contributing to another record backlog and reflecting strength across our end markets.

This sentiment has been widely shared by our customers and dealer partners and seems to be further solidified by the economic stimulus package, which passed in March of 2021. In that package, approximately $350 billion was earmarked for state, local and territorial governments for a variety of purposes, including the maintenance of essential infrastructure such as sewer systems and streets. As a provider of equipment used for essential services, like Steward Cleaning & Street sweeping, we stand a benefit meaningfully from additional aid that may be provided to state and local sources for these purposes. The treasury began distribution of the first $175 billion tranche in the spring of 2021 and current indications are that the second tranche is expected to be released this year.

The dealer sentiment remains bullish as municipalities, both small and large, are continuing to place orders at historic levels based in part by a surplus of funds directly attributed to this public funding source. This is supported by the ongoing strength of U.S. municipal orders, which were up 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date period with notably strong demand for street sweepers and to our cleaners. In fact, so far this year, our U.S. municipal orders for street sweepers are up around $40 million or 40% over last year, while sewer cleaning orders are up $25 million or 22% over the same period. We are also seeing strong domestic municipal demand within SSG with 9% order improvement year-to-date, resulting from higher demand for public safety equipment.

Over the last few years, several major urban domestic municipalities have paused making investments in public safety equipment such as police vehicles and related equipment. We are pleased that this trend appears to just started to reverse. During Q3, we received a significant order from a major metropolitan police department, the first in over 3 years, and we are optimistic that other customers will follow with renewed investment in public safety equipment. Within our industrial end markets, we've also seen a 15% year-over-year improvement in domestic orders.

The improvement has been almost across the board, but most notably for our TRUVAC safe digging trucks and our Guzzler industrial vacuum loaders, which collectively were up $41 million or 66% year-over-year. While industrial order strength continues, we have seen some softening in orders for dump bodies as customer and dealer-provided stock chassis and pool chassis of all size classes remain a primary constraint for this product offering as dump bodies typically receive lower prioritization from dealers when chassis availability is limited based on allocations from OEMs. As chassis availability improves, we expect to see increased orders based on pent-up demand.

Turning to the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which has $550 billion for new investments in roads, bridges, power, water and broadband infrastructure, public transportation, and airports. We are beginning to see demand pick up in the form of equipment inquiries from contractors who are working with state department of transportation agencies on roads, bridges, and related projects. Additionally, conversations among our dealer channel indicate contractors are now planning out projects through 2024 and are beginning to commence with large equipment inquiries directly tied to these infrastructure funds. I would now like to spend a minute on our acquisition of TowHaul which we completed in early October. TowHaul is headquartered in Belgrade Montana and is a leading manufacturer of off-road towing and hauling equipment.

For over years, TowHaul has been dedicated to designing and manufacturing the most reliable and efficient, and adaptable heavy-duty off-road specialty extraction support equipment, including its signature front-end and rear loading load boy trailers. TowHaul's patent equipment designs, depth of product knowledge, understanding of its customer-specific requirements and excellent track record have allowed us to establish a leading position in the industry. TowHaul also supports the recurring aftermarket needs of its customers through parts and service offerings, which represent approximately 35% of its annual revenue. The acquisition further bolsters our position as an industry-leading diversified industrial manufacturer of specialty vehicles for maintenance and infrastructure markets with leading brands of premium value-adding products and a strong supporting aftermarket platform.

The combination of TowHaul with Ground Force Worldwide, which we acquired in October of last year, allows us to serve our shared global customer base with a broader range of world-class products and solutions. It also creates a platform that is well-positioned to capitalize on a number of tailwinds expected to drive future growth in the metal extraction industry, including robust industrial activity and increased demand for precious metals in support of vehicle electrification and other green initiatives.

Last year, TowHaul generated revenues of approximately $23 million, we expect that TowHaul will be able to perform within ESG's target EBITDA margin range and will be accretive to earnings in 2023. The acquisition reiterates our expectation that M&A will continue to contribute meaningfully to our future growth. Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year. Overall, demand for our products and our aftermarket offerings remains high with our third-quarter orders up 9% year-over-year and our backlog at the end of the quarter, again, setting a new company record. Although we expect sporadic supply chain disruption to continue in some manner for the next several quarters, our teams continue to respond to these challenges, and we are encouraged with the recent improvement we have seen.

With our performance so far this year, our record backlog, and current expectations of component availability, we are raising the midpoint of our full-year adjusted EPS outlook by establishing a new range of $1.91 to $2, updated from the previous range of $1.85 to $2. We are also raising the midpoint of our full-year net sales outlook to a new range of $1.41 billion to $1.44 billion, updated from the previous range of $1.38 billion to $1.45 billion.

We remain encouraged by the long-term opportunities for all of our businesses, which will further benefit from the bipartisan infrastructure legislation passed by Congress. We are already starting to see the benefits from the economic stimulus packages, which started to be made available to municipalities earlier this year, and we also expect the infrastructure bill with $550 billion in new spending, we could see capital equipment demand increase to support infrastructure investments in areas such as roads, bridges, electrification, broadband, clean energy and water and public transportation buildup. We are a leading manufacturer of specialty infrastructure and maintenance equipment and anticipate increased demand for the majority of our product offerings, including equipment sales and rentals of dump truck and trailers, safe-digging trucks, road mark equipment, sewer cleaners, and street sweepers. We expect to see a prolonged meaningful tailwind from these stimulus packages.

With our strong demand and record backlog, we are not currently seeing any leading indicators of a recession. Our pricing actions have been generally accepted in the market, and we have not experienced any meaningful order cancellation activity. In fact, in our businesses, order cancellations have been rare. Further, while no company is immune to a macroeconomic recession, our backlog provides us with good visibility into 2023 and in part, insulates the company from the more immediate effects of an economic slowdown. Over the last several years, we have transformed our end market exposure and implemented a revenue diversification strategy that has enabled us to adjust as needed to market conditions. With that in an ongoing focus on ETI principles, Federal Signal has become a more resilient business, delivering a consistent level of EBITDA margin above most of our peers. As Ian noted in his comments, our financial position and liquidity are strong and the recent expansion of our credit facility will further enable us to pursue strategic acquisitions like TowHaul.

Our current M&A pipeline continues to be very active. We remain committed to our vehicle electrification initiatives, including incorporating weeks and acquisitions into our electrification roadmap. For example, the Switch and Go product line, which was part of the Dice acquisition last December, has entered into an agreement with an EV chassis manufacturer to build a prototype vehicle with the switch and go body system. The value proposition maximizes the benefits of the EV chassis by offering multiuse body system capabilities that is not possible with a standard fixed body application.

In simple terms, Switch and Go's interchangeable body solution enables an end user to use one vehicle to the work of 2 to 3 trucks. We also continue to experience a high level of demand from our dealer network for demonstrations of our plug-in hybrid electric street sweeper products, specifically the Broom Bear and the 3-wheel Pelican and have received additional order intake. Our ongoing commitment to environmental, social, and governance initiatives also position us well in the communities in which we operate and is a differentiating factor in our ability to attract labor at most of our facilities.

As an example, at our Streator facility, where we produce , TRUVAC and user equipment, we currently have less than 20 hourly job openings, which is less than 4% of the workforce. Our access to high-quality employees continues to benefit from our deep roots in the Streator community. For example, we've been able to successfully hire welders from our partnership with the local community college. In October, we held an open house of the facility that was attended by over 1,400 employees and family members, which is a further testament to the strong bond the team has built for its employees in the local community.

We're also thrilled to report that our chat stream business was recently recognized as a top place to work in Houston for the second year in a row. We recently held our annual leadership off-site meeting, which was attended by over 60 executives. At this event, our leadership team engaged a series of interactive sessions covering macroeconomic topics such as the state of the economy, DE&I initiatives and a futuristic workshop as well as sessions focus more specifically on our strategic initiatives. We enjoyed welcoming leaders from recently acquired companies.

This event always reminds me of how proud I am of the culture we've developed at Federal Signal, and I feel fortunate to work with so many talented leaders. We all love the event feeling energized and excited about our future. Although we've been operating in a difficult supply chain environment for over a year, we believe that the mitigating actions we have taken in response will provide longer-term benefits to Federal Signal, and we will emerge a stronger company.

We recently reorganized our supply chain group to improve material availability across the organization and drive cost-reduction initiatives as we leverage our scale and integrate acquired companies. In addition, we've expanded both our external supply base and our in-sourcing capabilities. For example, we are now producing parts at certain FS solution centers that are utilized by our dump body business and our SSG and ESG team successfully collaborated to reengineer certain equipment in response to electrical component shortages. We have also invested in inventory, securing safety stock to support production as we work towards reducing our current lead times. With strong demand and ongoing tailwinds from infrastructure stimulus, our good access to labor and recent capacity expansions, we are well positioned for growth as the supply chain environment continues to improve.

At this time, I think we are ready for questions. Operator?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Steve Barger from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Steve Barger

Your updated guidance implies a record 4Q revenue performance. Is that coming more from the line to already build product that you can ship on top of plan production? Or do you just expect fewer constraints in 4Q?

Ian Hudson

Yes. I think, Steve, what we've seen in the last couple of months, certainly of Q3 with the improvement in production. We're expecting some of that to continue. Now we have some seasonality there where aftermarket tends to taper off a little bit. But I think the combination of the size of our backlog and the production improvements we've seen in the recent months gives us confidence that the revenue will certainly be up over Q3. And so that's what's implied in the outlook.

Jennifer Sherman

Also, we expect our margins in Q4 to be up year-over-year.

Ian Hudson

Yes. I guess to that point, ESG incremental margin has obviously been tough for the last 5 quarters. I know a big driver of that is all the operational challenge that you discussed. I just want to gauge your confidence that nothing has really changed on your ability to convert higher sales to higher margin as you get past some of these supply chain constraints.

Jennifer Sherman

Yes. The most encouraging fact that I saw is we track pretty carefully our production levels at Elgin and . And as I talked about in my prepared remarks, as we move through July, August, and September, we saw a sequential improvement each month. And in September, we were up 35% over January. So although there's still some pockets of supply chain, overall, we're moving in the right direction, and we're encouraged by that. And that was baked into the guidance.

Steve Barger

Yes. In an unconstrained environment, how much of the $765 million of ESG backlog is shippable in 2023?

Ian Hudson

All of it would be, yes.

Jennifer Sherman

All of it.

Steve Barger

So nothing scheduled for '24. That all represents orders that people want right now, if they could get it.

Ian Hudson

Correct.

Jennifer Sherman

Correct.

Steve Barger

And I think I've asked this before, but just to remind us, what do you -- given the capacity expansions, what do you think quarterly revenue capacity is at ESG? Again, unconstrained.

Ian Hudson

I think unconstrained, Steve, I think we've obviously added a couple of companies into the mix over the last couple of years. But I think unconstrained. I think if you looked at some of our order cadence within SSG, it's certainly been in the $300 million, if not in excess of the $300 million range. So I think north of $300 million plus the impact of acquisitions.

Operator

The next question comes from Mike Shlisky from D.A. Davidson & Company.

Michael Shlisky

Can you hear me okay?

Jennifer Sherman

Yes.

Michael Shlisky

Great. Can I first touch on the new facility that you've got out there? Can you just give us a couple of points as to some of the changes that might be in terms as far as the spread or any ticking fees or other fees that may be involved just eking out our model properly calibrated here?

Ian Hudson

Yes. So no real change in the terms in terms of pricing, Mike. It's the same -- very similar spreads that were in the prior agreement. Now obviously, we've switched from LIBOR to the new sulfur rate. And so with the increase in rates, the interest expense is going to be higher. But in terms of the other terms of the agreement that changed, there's some more favorable terms in terms of the covenant calculations that benefit us. Obviously, there is the increase in the overall size of the facility. There's also the ability to increase it further for acquisitions, but that -- if that need arises. So I think overall, we had the credit agreement was -- that we previously had was going to expire in 2024. We thought it was an opportunistic time to look to refinance it for another 5 years and also increase the facility. And so we're really pleased with the outcome.

Jennifer Sherman

Obviously had one thing to reiterate what Ian said in these challenging credit markets, we were extremely pleased with the response that we got and the terms that we got. And we feel like it well positions us going forward in terms of optionality for both organic growth and inorganic growth.

Michael Shlisky

Excellent. And Jennifer, I wanted to just get some more color on from those, the dump body order comments you made during your prepared remarks. I wasn't sure I quite followed it. Did you say that dump bodies get a little bit lower priority in times of chassis shortages and that seems in a somewhat new comment? Is that a new development in the industry? Or is that the way it's always been, we just haven't heard about it since?

Jennifer Sherman

Yes. No. That's the way it's always been. And when chassis are on allocation, it is -- many dealers won't want to commit to necessarily dump truck fleet. They want to keep their options open. So we've seen some of that over the last several quarters. As we move forward, we believe that a couple of things, one, there's pent-up demand. Number two is we've diversified the end markets of that business pretty significantly since we purchased TBI in 2017. OSW Switch & Go both have strong municipal exposures. So we'll start to see the benefits of that. And then infrastructure bill, it's very difficult to imagine an infrastructure project that doesn't need a dump body. So as we move forward, we're encouraged by the opportunity, particularly around the infrastructure funds and we wanted to just point out in perhaps a clearer way. One of the drivers of the softness in orders is just the prioritization of dump truck in the queue for chassis.

Operator

The next question comes from Chris Moore from CJS Securities.

Christopher Moore

Yes, maybe just back to the September highest production rates this year. Was that follow-up? And how did it look in October?

Jennifer Sherman

Yes, we're still getting our October . So more to come on that. But overall, we saw the beginnings of supply chain improvement at our SSG group in Q2 and that continued in Q3 for SSG. And as we move through the quarter at specifically our Streator and Elgin facilities, we saw that improvement, and we are encouraged. The other thing that's happening, and this will have a long-term benefit for the company is we've now qualified additional suppliers. We've streamlined some of our product offerings as a result of the supply chain challenges. So we've become much more nimble in terms of responding to this. And I believe that we will be in a better position longer term as a result of it.

Christopher Moore

Got it. Very helpful. Just with respect to the adjusted EPS range. The tax rate is 22%. Is that a lower tax rate assumption from -- after Q2 or the same?

Ian Hudson

It is, Chris, because I think we talked about the discrete benefits that we had in Q3. So it is slightly lower than what we've previously signaled in Q2, but 22% would be the full-year effective rate that we're expecting.

Christopher Moore

Got it. And that wouldn't necessarily be a new normalized level moving forward to just desperate to...

Ian Hudson

Sorry, Chris... Not necessarily. No, that would include -- that 22% would include the discrete benefits we recognized in Q3, which I think we talked about on the prepared remarks that we also had some fairly significant discrete benefits in Q3 last year. So when you look at it year-over-year in Q3, I think our effective rate was at a fairly similar level, 13% this year. I think it was a high 12s last year. So we had a fairly similar amount of discrete benefits in Q3 of both periods. But the 22% for the full year would include the impact of the discrete benefits in the third quarter.

Christopher Moore

Got it. I appreciate that. And just from a volume price discussion, the midpoint of current revenue guidance, 17.5%, something like that. What's the rough split between volume and price?

Ian Hudson

Yes. It's probably -- in terms of the organic growth, if you look at Q3, we had organic growth was about $27 million, about 9%, and of that, about half of it was pricing. So we would expect similar dynamics, I think, entering the fourth quarter.

Operator

The next question comes from Greg Burns from Sidoti Income.

Gregory Burns

Is there any way you could quantify how much revenue the disruptions in the ESG side of the business cost.

Operator

Sorry to interrupt you. The audio is not clear from your line. Please use the handset mode.

Gregory Burns

Okay. Do you hear me now?

Jennifer Sherman

We heard you.

Gregory Burns

Okay. Yes. So is there any way you could quantify how much the disruptions cost you in terms of revenue and margin this quarter?

Ian Hudson

It's a little tough to quantify the pinpoint an exact number, Greg, because it had some knock-on effect because as we talked about in July, we were impacted more than in August and September. So there is some catch-up effect that we had. But if I were to ballpark an estimate, we're talking $20 million-ish would be a high-level estimate, but as I said, it's a fairly difficult number to pinpoint.

Gregory Burns

Okay. And then with the TowHaul acquisition, how much revenue -- is ground force a reseller of TowHaul, -- like how much revenue -- those ground force account for TowHaul or is that not a meaningful number? And is there any additional revenue synergies between the 2 acquisitions.

Ian Hudson

Yes. It's not so much -- not so much a reseller, but what they can do, and this is where we see some opportunities. They can go to market together. We -- there is situations where Ground Force has a strong presence in a certain geographic market where TowHaul doesn't necessarily have a strong presence, and it also works vice versa. So I think the combination of the 2 teams can attack all of the geographic markets in which they operate. So I think that's where we see a nice opportunity from a synergy standpoint. In terms of the TowHaul deal, we're targeting synergies of around about $3 million by the end of year 3. The majority of those are revenue synergies from leveraging both the distribution channels.

Operator

The next question comes from Walt Liptak from Seaport.

Walter Liptak

Congratulations on the good quarter I've got a couple of follow-ons for you. First on the TowHaul. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about TowHaul as a platform, and I assume that's with Ground Force. I wonder if you could talk about that? And are there other M&A deals that you could -- that you're looking at in this metal distractions or middle distraction space?

Jennifer Sherman

Yes. So Ground Force and TowHaul sell to the same customers, and they support the equipment that's in the mine. So they basically transport to and from the mine is a way to think about it. They're the leading providers in the world. TowHaul has certain geographic areas that it focuses on the Ground Force doesn't and Ground Force is focused on certain areas and certain customers that TowHaul is not. So we're very excited about putting the 2 together under the same management team, leveraging the same sales channel because as we mentioned, we think there's synergies there. There's probably -- there could be one more deal that completes that platform.

But we're still right now very focused on integrating the 2 companies that we purchased. But as we previously talked about, Ground Force is off to a strong start. And both of those companies operate within our target EBITDA margin ranges. There's opportunity for improvement. So very solid businesses. And what we really like about them also is their parts business. We talked about TowHaul has 30% plus parts business. And so as we move forward, it does a really nice job with some proprietary parts in this particular market.

Walter Liptak

Okay. Great. And then switching gears to another follow-on. It's great to see that the supply chain started to improve production levels are getting better. A follow-on to that last question about delayed shipments. I wonder if you can quantify it a different way, what are your lead times now in terms of months or whatever? And in normal times, where were those lead times? How much -- how supply chains get better, how quickly could you work down that ESG backlog?

Jennifer Sherman

Yes. So for several of our product lines, I'll start with they're too long. And we have very focused efforts to reduce those lead times. Particularly Vactor, we've seen very strong orders for many of our products, including our Vactor and Elgin products. So that's an area where we will be focused on reducing those lead times moving forward. Particularly, we're encouraged by because we've got the capacity, and we've got the people. And so as we move forward, we should easily be able to reduce lead times, and we should be able to increase throughput.

Walter Liptak

Okay. Fair enough. And then just a new question, I guess, is that we're in this rise, the interest rate environment, it's right that you've got all the government spending for infrastructure and other things. But how do you think the rising interest environment impacts your customers' purchases of your products?

Jennifer Sherman

Yes. So on the municipal side of things, we don't see a big impact, particularly as you know, sewer cleaners are often funded by water taxes, and then we have the multiple layers of government spending that will benefit purchases of our products. On the industrial side of things, that's where we believe our aftermarkets business is so important because we have rentals as an option. Because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are starting to -- our customers are starting to plan for some of these big infrastructure projects. So we have programs that are available through our aftermarkets group if they can't afford to buy new equipment where they can run equipment and buy it over time, if necessary. So we think we're uniquely positioned because of our ability to offer both new, used and rental equipment in this rising interest rate environment.

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Felix Boeschen from Raymond James.

Felix Boeschen

Ian, I was hoping just to follow up on something real quick, and I'm not sure if I missed it, but can you provide how much chassis pass-through revenue was in the quarter and how that compares to last year?

Ian Hudson

Yes, it was a little higher. It was about GBP 6 million higher. So it was about 1% of the overall revenue increase was higher chassis revenue. It was about a drag on our margin of around about 15 basis points this period. So not as much of a drag as it was in Q2, but still a slight drag on gross margin.

Felix Boeschen

Okay. Super helpful. And then I wanted to follow up on the September build rate commentary being the highest of the year. I think you said up 35% versus January. And I think there was a comment across both and Elgin. A, I was hoping a, could you confirm that it was across both of those? And then b, any idea or any color for us how volumes at this point compared to sort of pre-COVID, pre-after expansion levels?

Jennifer Sherman

Yes. So I will confirm, yes, it was for and out for Streator Elgin. Number two is with respect to pre-COVID levels, we're not there.

Felix Boeschen

Okay. Still lower than pre-COVID.

Ian Hudson

Yes.

Felix Boeschen

Okay. And then just my last one. I understand you're not giving guidance for 2023. But I am kind of curious if you could directionally talk about maybe what you're hearing out of the OEMs on chassis allocation into next year. Any directional color on maybe how you're thinking about that specifically in the municipal part of your book?

Jennifer Sherman

Sure. So we received initial allocations from the chassis OEMs. And the messaging is about the same as 2022 with potential upside for the second half of the year. However, all that being said, as we've talked about several times, we have programs that in place with our dealers where we encourage them to go out and secure chassis outside of our allocations. And then in addition to that, we also go out and try to secure chassis. We call it the onesie-twosie program for various distributors across North America. And I know we've started that. So as we move into '23, we have several programs in place where we're trying to increase the number of chassis that are available to us, either through our dealers, our customers, or going out and trying to procure them on an individual basis.

Operator

The next question comes from Steve Barger from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Steve Barger

Just a quick follow-up. Sorry if I missed this. Operating cash flow is running below prior year. I know 4Q is typically a cash release period. Do you have a forecast for operating cash flow for either 4Q or the year?

Ian Hudson

We don't have a forecast necessarily, Steve. But I think one thing we would say is that we would expect our cash conversion in Q4, obviously, to improve from where it's been. I think as you can probably see, we've had some strategic inventory build really to serve the backlog that we have. There is some, obviously, increase in our receivables that is primarily timing related. I think we started to see some of that turn in the early part of October. The encouraging thing that we see in terms of our receivables is that we haven't seen any deterioration in terms of the aging profile of our receivables, even though it's up significantly at the end of September versus where it was at the end of December. So I think the receivables will start to turn as we enter Q4, and that's where we're expecting to see some of the cash conversions start to improve in Q4.

Operator

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jennifer Sherman for closing remarks.

Jennifer Sherman

Thank you. In closing, I would like to reiterate that we are confident in the long-term opportunities for our businesses and the prospects for our recent acquisitions. Our portfolio of businesses includes many market-leading brands with solid fundamentals. Our foundation is strong, and we are focused on delivering profitable long-term growth through the execution of our strategic initiatives. I'd like to give a public thank you to all of our employees for their commitment, creativity and dedication addressing this challenging supply chain environment. I would also like to express our thanks to our stockholders, distributors, dealers and customers for their continued support. Thank you for joining us today, and we'll talk to you soon.

I'm pleased to announce another strong quarter from both a financial and transformational perspective with sales up over 20% from the prior year despite a negative FX impact. We have also had significant growth in our adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin, making further progress towards our targets. Mick will go through our financial results in more detail, but before that, I would like to provide an update on the progress that our segments are making towards the strategic objectives that we laid out during our Investor Day last June.

You may recall that our transformation had three core work streams, focus the organization, perform, and deliver, and accelerate profitable growth. Our segment Presidents provided specific goals for each of those activities, and I'm very proud of the progress that our organization is making against each of those.

Please turn to Slide 5. Our Climate Solutions segment had a great quarter. This slide shows the strategic objectives for the Climate Solutions segment, and we are making progress towards both our strategic and financial goals. First, the Climate Solutions team is deep into eighty-twenty and we are clearly seeing the results. In fact, we are driving eighty-twenty down to the business unit and plant level. For example, in our heat transfer products business, our eighty-twenty focus is on pricing for value and executing on new growth opportunities around the heat pump market. There are tremendous incentives in Europe for the heat pump adoption, many of which fully offset the premium associated with this technology.

We believe that shifting resources to supporting this market will drive growth for years to come. Our leadership team is firmly in place for this segment and they are building a high performance culture focused on profitability and growth. Our business segmentation process is complete and we are refining the data and implementing daily management tools to provide early indicators that will allow us to better manage our inventory and backlog. As part of our transformational plan we expect Climate Solutions to drive revenue growth over the next several years. The business have favorable market trends and deliver double digit growth this past quarter with more to come.

We are reallocating resources to these attractive businesses by creating additional capacity within our existing manufacturing footprint. For example, this past quarter we had approximately $8 million of CapEx and Climate Solutions, which is outpacing the segment’s typical spend.

Additionally, our commercial teams are focused on building raving fans, including customers, engineering consultants, distributors, and sales reps. There are many factors to winning in these markets, and our products have advantages that are allowing us to gain market share. First, in the data center world, having a global footprint is key to reducing carbon miles, which is very important to many customers. In other areas, we are winning on lead time, such as in our heating and our indoor air quality businesses where we are ahead of our competition and plan to stay there.

In addition, our focus on product line simplification is allowing us to increase our speed to market by reducing complexity and new sale engineering time. Based on the activities and results you can see that Climate Solutions is rapidly moving through the first two phases of our transformation, which are focus and perform.

They have now earned the right to start focusing on the third element, which is accelerating profitable growth. As part of the strategy to accelerate growth, Climate Solutions is providing full solutions to customers and is expanding geographically by bringing existing solutions to new markets. This is especially true in our data center business where we're not only bringing chillers to the North America market, but we are now also able to provide full system solutions in both North America and Europe. You may have seen our press release last week where we announced that we shipped our first chillers from our new production facility in Rockbridge, Virginia as part of a sizable order from Corscale announced in July.

This is a very exciting milestone for the team, which includes members from our Airedale operations in the UK and from our neighboring plant and Buena Vista. With chillers on board we now have a complete data center product line including computer room air handlers and fan walls to support both colocation and data center operations.

So to wrap up on the Climate Solutions discussion, this segment is executing on its strategic objectives and has earned the right to grow. We're actively building our acquisition pipeline, identifying actionable targets in several areas. We're looking at everything from small bolt-ons to opportunities that would move the needle across multiple groups. I'm very proud of this team. Not only are they demonstrating our purpose of engineering a cleaner and healthier world, but are ahead of schedule for both revenue and earnings growth.

Please turn to Slide 6. As I mentioned last quarter, in Performance Technologies, we are focusing on the phased rollout of eighty-twenty, whereas Climate Solutions is far along in the journey, the PT business is just getting started. To be clear, this was a planned phased approach.

Implementing eighty-twenty requires a lot of organizational change, and each segment required our undivided attention and focus. We elected to start with Climate Solutions, given the clear, sizable and immediate growth opportunities while preparing Performance Technologies for the journey. This slide shows the strategic objectives for PT segment that were introduced in June.

As I mentioned, we are early in our journey, so we are mostly working on the focus the organization activities. As a reminder, our strategic transformation includes sizable margin improvements in Performance Technologies. We are focused on improving margins over revenue growth and are anticipating a significant change in business mix over the next several years. This means exiting unprofitable legacy businesses while rapidly growing the very attractive EV business.

We have completed the market segmentation for PT and had those senior leaders in place. With that being behind us, we have begun training the workforce across the organization in a similar manner to what we did for the CS segment last year. This has included numerous in-person events with our leaders that are helping the local teams understand how eighty-twenty can help reduce complexity and reallocate resources.

Meanwhile, our team continues to onboard new, experienced leaders and key roles who are helping to fundamentally change the culture within the segment. This is a large, complex business with considerable, legacy challenges that we are actively addressing. For example, we have long-term contracts in this business that allow us to pass along material cost increases, but do not allow price increases for other rising costs such as utilities, fabrication, and labor. Our team is taking unprecedented actions by successfully negotiating improved commercial terms outside of our standard, contractual metals pass-through. This is having a positive impact on our margins, but it's not enough. As we continue to deal with rising costs. This requires a renewed focus on materials, productivity and plant performance.

There is still a tremendous opportunity for improvement in the business, and our PT team is rising to the challenge. All this work is laying the foundation and driving towards our goal of simplifying and segmenting the business so that we can focus on our most important priorities.

We're also beginning to start some of the activities under the Perform and Deliver category as well. The first of these is product simplification and exit strategies, which include deemphasizing non-profitable or end-of-life business. In other words, deciding what we stop doing.

In our air-cooled business, we are pursuing last time buys on certain products in order to simplify our product portfolio. And in our liquid-cooled business we are improving our quotation process to improve commercial terms and reduce capital requirements.

And finally, I want to give an update on our Advanced Solutions business, which includes our EV systems and components business. We continue to allocate resources to this business as the team focuses on new product development and commercial excellence to capture value in their key markets.

We recently announced an initial order from Shyft for their Blue Arc all electric delivery vehicle. We're providing an integrated system for battery thermal management, power, electronics cooling, and passenger comfort. We now have 18 production orders with bus, specialty vehicle and commercial vehicle customers, representing peak revenue of over $90 million. This is only scratching the surface of our potential in the EV space, and we plan to become a much larger player here as we execute our strategy.

To summarize our efforts, we're moving at breakneck speed just as you would expect from a startup. Our teams are exploring new market opportunities and working on the next-generation of products, all while using their thermal expertise to develop prototypes that we expect will lead to additional production orders.

The limiting factor in this business isn't necessarily the rate of EV adoption, but rather the ability to produce. We have seen some delays in orders in the start of production, mainly due to supply chain challenges. Despite this, orders remain strong and I'm confident that EV can become a substantial high margin business for us in the future. I'm proud of how this organization is approaching its challenges head on and will continue to report on the progress.

Now, I would like to turn the call over to, Mick, who will review our results for the quarter and provide segment financial updates.

Mick Lucareli

Thanks, Neil, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 7 to review the segment results. Climate Solutions had another exceptional quarter with solid revenue growth and excellent earnings improvement. Revenue was up 18% over the prior year and up 25% on a constant currency basis. Data center sales were up 81% or $14 million on strong demand from both hyperscale and colocation markets.

HVAC&R sales were up 11% or $9 million with seasonal sales in heating and growth in school products. Sales of heat transfer products increased nearly $16 million or 13% from the prior year. There was broad strength across the North American markets, and we benefited from European heat pump growth. We estimate that the underlying volume excluding pricing was up 18% from the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 93% with a 15% margin, which is up 580 basis points from the prior year. The earnings and margin improvements were primarily driven by higher sales volume and commercial pricing initiatives.

SG&A was higher than the prior year, mainly due to wage inflation and higher sales commissions, but declined 50 basis points as a percentage of sales.

As Neil discussed, Climate Solutions is progressing well on the eighty-twenty journey. Over the last two quarters the average year-over-year margin improvement has exceeded 500 basis points.

Please turn to Slide 8. Performance Technologies also had a good quarter with sales up 22% or $59 million. Revenue is up 29% on a constant currency basis, benefiting from growth in all product groups, commercial pricing and metals pass throughs. We estimate that the underlying volume excluding pricing was up 22%. Within the segment, Advanced Solutions sales were up 21% or $6 million with growth in our electric vehicle product sales. Liquid-cooled product sales increased 23% or $22 million due to a strong rebound in the automotive market. Lastly, air cool product sales increased 24% or $33 million, primarily due to strong demand in the off-highway and commercial vehicle markets.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 88%, resulting in a 7.4% margin and a 260 basis point improvement from the prior year. As anticipated, the impact of material cost increases on earnings was lower this quarter. We are expecting to see positive net materials in the second half of the year based on current metals projections.

As Neil mentioned, the Performance Technologies segment is relatively early in the eighty-twenty journey. As we work further to segment the business, we expect margin improvements to accelerate towards our targets.

Now, let's review the total company results. Please turn to Slide 9. First quarter sales we're up 21% or a $100 million driven by strong gains in both Climate Solutions and Performance Technologies. Revenue is up 28%, excluding a negative FX impact of $36 million.

In the quarter, the main revenue driver was higher volume of approximately a $100 million, resulting in a volume growth rate of 21%. The balance of revenue growth was comprised of material recovery and commercial pricing partially offset by negative foreign exchange.

During the quarter, materials increased $15 million from the prior year. We were able to more than offset this increase through our various pricing mechanisms.

SG&A increased $7 million from the prior year, yet declined 70 basis points as a percentage of sales, primarily due to higher employee compensation-related expenses and sales commissions.

I'm pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA increased 73% or $22 million. This represents a 260 basis point improvement and the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement.

Adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 cents was $0.33 above the prior year.

Before moving on, I would like to point out that we had a few very small earnings adjustments in Q2 totaling $900,000. This was comprised of $600,000 for restructuring expenses and $300,000 for environmental costs.

Now, moving to the cash flow metrics, please turn to Slide 10. We generated $29 million of positive free cash flow in the second quarter, which was a nice improvement from our first quarter. This puts our year-to-date free cash flow at $33 million. The year-to-date cash flow includes $10 million of cash payments primarily for restructuring activities, including the European headcount reductions announced last year. Earnings growth and improved working capital have been the key to our cash flow generation during the first half of the year. We expect positive free cash flow in the second half of the year, including approximately $9 million of anticipated cash restructuring payments, mostly tied to our European restructuring activities.

I'd like to highlight that Modine’s Board of Directors recently renewed our two-year $50 million share repurchase authorization. During the quarter we repurchased 100,000 shares and plan to repurchase a similar level per quarter over the balance of the year. As a reminder, our program is currently focused on offsetting the dilutive impact of our share based incentive compensation program.

Net debt of $301 million was $32 million lower than the prior fiscal year end. Our cash balance was $70 million as of September 30. And we finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 1.7, which is within our targeted range and improved from the prior quarter.

Now let's turn to Slide 11 for our fiscal 2023 outlook. We're holding our outlook for fiscal 2023 revenue growth at 6% to 12%. Despite ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, we are currently forecasting more than a $100 million negative impact on sales due to the stronger U.S. dollar.

After a stronger than expected first half, we now anticipate that adjusted EBITDA will be in a range of $190 million to $200 million. This represents an increase of 20% to 26% versus the prior year. This is also an improvement from our previous range of $180 million to $195 million. We expect Q3 EBITDA to remain strong and be in a similar range to Q2, then improving sequentially in Q4. As we just reviewed, Q2 was extremely strong. In Q3 we enter the favorable heating season, but also need to factor in the traditional holiday shutdowns. And in Q4, we anticipate a further ramp up in volume combined with additional pricing adjustments with the new calendar year.

We remain quite positive regarding our full year outlook, but we also realize there is a lot of global economic uncertainty. We're balancing the positive signals from strong orders and backlogs against the risks associated with a potential recession in Europe or the U.S. We'll continue to evaluate and adjust each quarter.

To wrap up, we're very pleased with the second quarter results as our business leaders are executing on planned improvements. We're on track with our transformation targets presented in June. Climate Solutions is somewhat ahead of the pace. We're very encouraged by the revenue and margin outlook for this segment. In addition, Performance Technologies has begun the eighty-twenty journey. As demonstrated by Climate Solutions, we believe that Performance Technologies can generate similar levels of improvement as eighty-twenty matures. Combine, the two segments will continue to drive top line growth and additional margin improvements in the future.

With that, Neil and I will be happy to take your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with DA Davidson. Your line is open.

Matt Summerville

Thanks. A couple questions. Maybe let's start with the data center business. On the Slide 11, it looks like you raised your outlook, I think, from plus 40% to plus 50% to plus 50% to plus 60%. Obviously, you're up 80% here in the quarter, so a very strong start to the year. I want to speak a little bit more towards something referenced in the press release you put out the other day talking about the initial North American shipments in reference to the $100 million target, it was basically communicated there for the North American data center business. To my recollection last year, that would have been pretty minimal in terms of revenue contributions. So what kind of line of sight do you have in that business kind of multi-year outlook? What does the backlog look like incoming orders? Could you put some finer points around what you are seeing in the data center site? Thanks.

Neil Brinker

Hey, Matt, great to hear from you. This is Neil. Sure, absolutely. We're seeing the growth through our geographic expansion. So if we think about it, last year we didn't have a product set or product line, particularly chillers that could serve the North America market. And with our press release that came out that was specific to Rockbridge that was the chiller expansion where we expect to see the capacity that we put in generate revenues similar to what you just described. So this would be incremental in addition to the traditional data center revenues that that Modine has produced in the past.

Matt Summerville

If you think about pivoting over to one of your other high growth areas, EV thermal management systems, you mentioned cumulatively you have 18 platform wins. We'll forward 12 months from now, what could that number look like? And out of the 18 when you aggregate the 18, what's the file value associated with that, if you will, annual revenue book associated with that?

Neil Brinker

Yes, no, that's a really good question. Thanks, Matt. It's Neil again. We're engaged on 101 different systems to date. If we go back to – we'll go back say a year plus ago, that was almost in the single digit range. We're on prototypes of 56, which is up to from June. And then we have the award wins of 18, which is two more than when we spoke last in June. We go back a year and a half ago, those numbers again were single digits. With the 18 awarded wins, that's roughly $90 million that we see in terms of the run rate.

The good news here on this bit where the EV team has been focused on is when we talked about the 16 wins that we had last year or this year, we talk about specialty vehicles and buses. These two incremental wins are on the last mile delivery vehicle OEM fleets. So, we're also looking at not only EV and specialty vehicle, but we've made a pivot with some of our battery thermal management, passenger thermal management, electronic cooling packages that can serve in the last mile as well as we see that as an opportunity. At the same time and you saw a press release in regards to Shyft as we spoke about those wins.

Matt Summerville

Sure. And then maybe one more, when you think about kind of where you are at with eighty-twenty in the performance side of the business if you had to handicap it today, how much of revenue do you think we could be looking at or if you can frame it up in terms of product line simplification, however, you want to term it, how much do you think gets moved out the door if you will, over the next year or two? How much revenue do you need to deliberately exit? And in doing so, just that action alone, how much would that improve profitability once you complete that iteration [indiscernible]? Thank you.

Neil Brinker

No, great question, Matt. We're thinking about it the same way as you. As we mentioned, we're really in the early stages of eighty-twenty in Climate Solutions, and we've just structured the team in a way to stand up market verticals around our air liquid and EV business in order to get to those answers. They're working through the quads in terms of how they look at the products and customers, they are looking at profitability. And we've just set this up with a new General Manager that we just hired as well to come up with these types of conclusions.

So right now, there is a hypothesis. We have some assumptions. We need to vet those assumptions and in the hypothesis to determine exactly what those numbers look like. You're thinking about it the same way we're thinking about it, and just like we did in Climate Solutions, we'll work through the meticulous calculations so that we can come up with the right and proper range.

Matt Summerville

Got it. Thank you

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Steve Ferazani with Sidoti. Your line is open.

Steve Ferazani

Good morning, everyone. I appreciate all the color on the call. Impressive margin improvement in PT, despite you're at the early stages of eighty-twenty. Can you give a sense of how much more of a contribution that can be this year? I know you are in the early stages. And just how sustainable those margins are in PT, knowing that you are seeing slowdowns from the European economies, higher energy costs, and also likely that light vehicle production, at least in Europe, probably doesn't grow quite so substantially given some of these headwinds?

Neil Brinker

Hey, Steve, great question. This is Neil. I'll start with some of the high level details of what we're working on at Performance Technologies, and then I'll let Mick respond. It's a really good question because you're right, there are some headwinds where we see some of that, but at the same time, we see opportunities within the business. First and foremost is around complexity reduction, as a team looks at its product line simplification and how we can do and be more efficient with the products and then the plants that we work in. We also see an opportunity within plant productivity and materials. That's going to be a major focus for the Performance Technologies team. The team is really excited about eighty-twenty. The team has a lot of energy around this because they saw the impact in Climate Solutions and they're ready to adopt it and embrace it.

And then there is a lot of great commercial excellence programs that are working on in Performance Technologies that I suspect will start to see some of impact in the coming quarters. Commercial excellence around pricing, surcharge, minimum order quantities, non-reoccurring engineering, they are really smart this team in terms of how they are thinking about commercializing existing products and future products. Mick?

Mick Lucareli

Yes, Steve, I would just add we laid out at our Analyst Day, the objective here by the end of fiscal 2024 and that two-year period was to get this business to cross the double digit margin standpoint. And so we've seen good improvement from Q1 to Q2, and then we would expect based on all the activities Neil laid out, and the next thing about that is a lot of eighty-twenty is our control versus the economic environment out there.

So to your question, I think, we continue to anticipate further margin improvements in Q3 and then a further lifting Q4 on our track to getting this business to get into a double digit range.

Steve Ferazani

Okay, that's helpful. Beyond data center, a couple of the areas you highlighted, I want to see if you can quantify them a bit and also ask about the tailwinds. Obviously you've benefited from the older school retrofits. Trying to get a sense of, of how much longer that tailwind could be? And then if you can quantify in dollar terms what you're seeing from the European heat pump market?

Neil Brinker

Yes, good question. So relative to the CARES Act or the ESSER Act in North America and the fundings that's in place for schools, we know that there is, at a minimum three years’ worth of funding that will be deployed across the 125,000 K–12s that are in the United States. It's a matter of the ability to install and at the rate that they can install during the off seasons, which is the summer seasons when the schools are not in operation. I suspect Steve, that that's going to go beyond three years because the installations will not be able to keep up with the pace of demand, especially as schools, and school boards, and teachers unions and PTOs really think hard about infrastructure spend and how to improve the indoor air quality within the schools and classrooms. So, I think that's a tailwind that's in place for several years.

In terms of the heat pump market, in Europe, we just recently broke ground on an expansion in Serbia, we're preparing and we're ramping for that. We're flowing some more CapEx, and more machinery and equipment so that we can keep up with that demand, and we expect to see that demand over the next two to three years.

Steve Ferazani

Right. So I guess that leads right into my next question, which is CapEx priorities given that Virginia's now open, it sounds like now Serbia is something on the heat bump. How are you thinking about CapEx priorities moving forward? And if I can group that in with your leverage ratio now looks like you're going to be below what your old targets were and how you're prioritizing capital allocation is leveraged clearly at a very strong rate level and getting better.

Mick Lucareli

Yes, thanks Steve. We’re really happy with the leverage ratio as you pointed out on for others. We've talked for several years about trying to keep the company through a cycle between 1.5, 2.5 times, depending on acquisition pipelines, the economic environment and getting to 1.7 this quarter is really happy with that. I think going forward, we continue to expect that to decline and part of that is it's good to go into any kind of economic uncertainty with that strong balance sheet, but equally so we talked about really ramping up our acquisition pipeline. So we're trying to ensure we have the balance sheet ready for any kind of economic event. And certainly more important, I think, is strategically to support the acquisition funnel in our growth verticals.

And then you're right then just on the short run, even in the quarter out of $12 million in the CapEx, we spent at least $8 million in the quarter on our Climate Solutions side. So as Neil laid out priorities to continue to expand data center production to ensure we have adequate capacity for the rapid order book intake. And then the other probably CapEx or PP&E one is Serbia, as Neil mentioned to support then growth in off the European heat pump market.

Steve Ferazani

Great. Thanks everyone. I appreciate the caller.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Matt Summerville with DA Davidson. Your line is open.

Matt Summerville

Yes, thanks. It's a couple of follow-ups. Mick can you talk about how we should be thinking about the cost savings realization associated with the European restructuring? I know you're targeting about $20 million. How should we think about that fiscal 2023 versus what lands in fiscal 2024? And can you remind what the cash cost of that program is?

Mick Lucareli

Yes, so we estimated that we would get approximately half of the savings this year, Matt, and little bit more heavily weighted in the second half than the front. And then the other say half or ten million next year. So we'll get the full amount. We had originally estimated that the cost would be about $20 million to $25 million. And we're still finalizing the program. But I'm happy to say we're running clearly at the low end of that, and an opportunity might be able to do slightly better than what we had thought.

Matt Summerville

And then how should we be thinking about total CapEx for this year and if you have a preliminary view on next? And then similarly how we should be thinking about free cash conversion this year and next, bearing in mind the CapEx aspect of things as well as the cash cost with this program?

Mick Lucareli

Yes, from a CapEx standpoint we're still looking in the $60 million to $70 million range for the year that we haven't spent in the first half at that rate, but we have some heavier spending on the areas we just talked about in the second half. It's about $60 million to $70 million this year, Matt.

From a conversion, probably the easiest way we think about it, or especially externally, is this year looking at free cash flow to a sales margin or a conversion about 2.5% to 3%, and then improving further next year when we laid out our transformation strategy, we wanted to be within the 24-month window, 3% to 5% of sales, and then from three years on, obviously push above that range. So hope that addresses your question.

Matt Summerville

Yes. And then M&A, I guess you guys must feel good about the Climate business to start talking about M&A. I would have been under the impression maybe coming out of last quarter that we were maybe still at least six, if not 12 months off before we would start to have – or before you start to have the discussion with us, like you are having today.

So maybe talk about Neil, what gets you comfortable to start thinking about M&A now as it pertains to that business. You mentioned you are looking at opportunities in a couple of areas, maybe a couple of technology areas maybe speak to that in a little more detail. And then I'd be curious as to how you're feeling about the maturity of the funnel and what kind of the high-end of deal size you might be willing to look at for that business.

Neil Brinker

Yes, all good questions, Matt. And you are right, we are thinking about it. In terms of Climate Solutions, we have each one of the market verticals inside of Climate Solutions that are segmented internally a little bit differently in terms of hyper growth or growth, or we want to maintain existing size and EBITDA dollars. So they are specific markets inside of Climate Solutions that were more aggressive with in terms of how we're thinking about filling the funnel with M&A activity.

And when we focus on those areas are the ones we often talk about. We look at not only how to gain share in that space, but also adjacencies and technologies or channel that would complement what we do today, one or two degrees adjacent space is how we think about that orbit.

We have worked pretty hard to build on a business development team. So, we've put some new – actually press release came out this past quarter in terms of Paul Plourde, who we just brought in to drive business development and generate and create this funnel with the support of our GMs.

So I feel much more comfortable than I say a year ago where we have GMs that are in the spaces that have been identified for inorganic growth and that they're building out targets and they're cultivating relationships based on their status in terms of where we want them to spend time on M&A activity. And then we also are now creating at the corporate office a business development engine to where we can execute on the process once you get through cultivation, as you get into, say, the stages of diligence.

So we're a lot further along than we were because our GMs are now in place for over a year, and they can set the strategies, they know their markets. We're building out the support and infrastructure at the corporate level. And we've accelerated the earnings improvement in Climate Solutions that allows us to really focus on this and spend more time talking about it.

As you know, you can never time these things, Matt, but to have the funnel and the net as wide as it is versus what we had last year, I feel much more comfortable where we're at today.

Mick Lucareli

Yes, Matt, I'd add the size question, just add in what Neil said. Super hard to answer based on all those factors that I view it as our role and my role to sort of position the company. So the opportunities may come in smaller pieces which we can't necessarily control. On the other hand we saw this years ago with Luvata. We have the new bank facilities, we've got plenty of flexibility in our covenants. So, I think the governor on site is our current bank agreements and covenant ratios there, but it gives us a lot of flexibility to do larger transactions. But ultimately it all comes down to all the details based on this specific opportunity.

Matt Summerville

Got it. Thanks Neil. Thanks Mick.

Neil Brinker

Rich Riley

Thank you, Ashish and thanks to everyone for joining us. For today's presentation, we will be referring to the slides that are posted to the Investor Relations section of our website earlier this afternoon.

I will start by reviewing Q3 highlights then provide a commercial and regulatory update. I will then turn it over to John who will discuss our recent Alternative Fuels & Chemicals Coalition award and construction progress on Origin 1 and Origin 2. Nate will wrap up with the financial overview.

We will begin on slide three. We continue to execute on our plan and make progress on our mission to enable the world's transition to sustainable materials. First we have seen a more than nine-fold increase in our customer demand since our announcement to become a public company in February 2021 with offtake in capacity reservations increasing to $9 billion today.

Second, we remain well capitalized and on track for completion of Origin 1 by the end of 2022 with preparations for commissioning and start-up now well underway with plant commissioning to be complete by the end of Q1 2023 and start up beginning shortly thereafter. We are also maintaining our previously disclosed capital budget for Origin 1 of $125 million to $130 million.

For Origin 2, the previously disclosed capital budget construction timeline and financing assumptions are unchanged. As reported previously, the State of Louisiana pending finalization is expected to award a private activity bond volume cap allocation to Origin in the amount of $400 million. We also expect to receive more than $100 million in pending state and local incentives.

As discussed on prior calls, front end design of Origin 2 is underway with detailed engineering set to begin in 2023.

And third, we remain well-capitalized with approximately $362.2 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. We maintain our expectation that the capital projects for Origin 1 and Origin 2 can be fully funded from our existing cash on hand and previously indicated traditional project financing sources.

Now, turning to slide four, I'd like to provide a brief overview of Origin for those who are new to the story. Origin was founded with the mission to help solve climate change by enabling the world transition to sustainable materials. Our patented drop in core technology, attractive unit economics, and carbon impact have gained the support of a growing list of major global brands and investors and in an increasingly diverse range of consumer and industrial end markets.

Our list of strategic partners includes industry leaders such as Danone, Nestlé Waters, PepsiCo, Ford Motor Company, Mitsubishi Gas Chemicals, Kolon Industries, PrimaLoft, Solvay, Mitsui & Co. Minafin Group, LVMH Beauty, Revlon, Mitsubishi Chemical Group, Kuraray, Intertex World Resources, and ATC Plastics.

Our CPG partners have publicly disclosed their intent to migrate 100% of their current petroleum-based PET consumption to decarbonized and recycled materials. After extensively evaluating our technology and testing our products, these market leaders have made significant financial contributions to Origin both as investors and customers, demonstrating their environmental commitment and confidence in our technology and products. They have signed multiyear off-take contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

This year's escalating geopolitical tension and energy-rich portions of the globe have provided a reminder of the urgency in which the world needs to transition to more sustainable and less volatile energy solutions. The carbon-inventive nature of the plastic industry, where over 99% of product is made from fossil fuels, has placed the industry under considerable pressure to dramatically transform the way it produces and uses plastic both for environmental and economic considerations.

Origin operates an entirely circular plastic solution carbon-negative recyclable PET, which the world's plastic recycling infrastructure is already designed to collect sort and reuse with the critical added benefit of removing CO2 from the atmosphere.

Beyond plastics, we note that while there's been some progress made in reducing greenhouse gases from shifts to renewable energy sources and electric vehicles, it is clear that reducing emissions from energy use alone is insufficient to achieve the goals and commitments established by companies and governments.

As a result, in the near-term, we believe that these companies will need to integrate decarbonized materials into their supply chain. As such we expect demand to remain well ahead of our projected supplies for the foreseeable future.

Turning to slide five, we continue to see strong favorable tailwinds for our technology and business model with some of the world's largest public companies committing to zero carbon mandates and governments increasingly enacting regulations and funding investments to tackle climate change.

The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act or IRA is expected to provide approximately $369 billion in direct investment related to climate solutions. We are excited by the support the bill has received and see multiple meaningful funding opportunities that we plan to provide more detail on as the legislation is finalized.

For one, the IRA is expected to significantly expand the Section 48C Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit available for investments in manufacturing facilities for clean energy technologies.

Origin is currently exploring several paths of eligibility in order to qualify for a discretionary tax credit for a significant portion of Origin 2's capital expenditures, providing benefits toward the financing of the plant.

Second, while we are still evaluating the details of the program, we see the potential to benefit from the IRA's Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program. This Department of Energy run program created under the Office of Clean Energy Demonstration will provide $5.8 billion in competitive funding such as grants, rebates, direct loans, and cooperative agreements to advance industrial facilities aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from historically energy-intensive industries.

We’re optimistic that our pilot facility in West Sacramento, our Origin 2 plant in Geismar, Louisiana, as well as future plants that we build in the US could qualify for this competitive financing.

Finally, in addition to the IRA, Origin is exploring opportunities for funding and financing under last year's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA. Origin has identified more than a dozen IIJA initiatives that may potentially assist in financing a variety of Origin investments, most notably Origin 2 and infrastructure improvements in and around the Geismar, Louisiana site.

Turning to slide 6, we continue to make steady progress commercializing the business, and have grown customer demand to a total of $9.0 billion dollars today, made up of offtake agreements and capacity reservations. This represents a more than nine-fold increase since we announced our intent to go public in February 2021.

As a refresher, capacity reservations are signed agreements designed to lead towards take-or-pay contracts and revenue once our plants are complete. They give us and our customers more time to negotiate a take-or-pay offtake agreement, which typically is a much longer document that meets the requirements for project financing.

As previously mentioned, we continue to expand the breadth of industries and end-markets that we serve, from global CPG brands like Pepsi, Danone, and Nestlé Waters to automotive leaders like Ford and specialty chemical innovators like Solvay and Mitsubishi Chemical Group, to ultra-luxury brands like LVMH Beauty and iconic cosmetics brands like Revlon.

Our sales pipeline remains strong. We continue to make inroads into new industries and have numerous active discussions with existing customers to expand their current agreements and with prospective customers to adopt our sustainable products.

We also see significant opportunities to expand into high margin product categories. This year’s new strategic partnerships with Mitsubishi Chemical Group, Intertex, and ATC Plastics, for example, have provided us with significant momentum in carbon black, a promising new product category for Origin.

Our carbon black, made from Origin’s hydrothermal carbon, is a versatile 100% bio-content filler and pigment. Like traditional petroleum-based carbon black, it can be used in a wide variety of applications including automotive components and tires, belts and hoses, mechanical rubber goods, plastic masterbatch, and toners.

We expect our sustainable carbon black to be deployed across a diverse array of applications to decarbonize the rubber and automotive supply chains, end-markets which have very favorable growth prospects.

In light of strong customer demand, we are pleased to announce that we are substantially committed for our Origin 2 para-xylene and PET capacity. Going forward, our sales and marketing team will be primarily focused on high margin products such as carbon black and advanced CMF-derived products for Origin 2 and beyond.

As we’ve previously mentioned, our customers require more development and testing for these products than for drop-in ready para-xylene and PET. As we approach the start of Origin 1 operations, we anticipate being able to deliver larger quantities of samples to our customers. We look forward to updating everyone as we embark on this evolution in our sales efforts.

In addition, we are very excited to tell you about new strategic relationships with a major Japanese chemical company and a major Asian chemical company. We continue to see considerable opportunities to expand into new end markets and applications, and we look forward to providing more detail about these partnerships, as well as others, when appropriate.

With that, I would like to turn it over to John, who will discuss our recent Alternative Fuels & Chemicals Coalition award and provide an update on Origin 1 and Origin 2.

John Bissell

Thanks, Rich. In early October, Origin received the 2022 Alternative Fuels & Chemicals Coalition Global Biobased Economy Performance Award. The award, which is sponsored by the Industrial Biotechnology Journal, is given annually to recognize companies that are advancing science and contributing to the production and commercialization of industrial biotechnology products.

Origin was selected for outstanding performance and achievements in the commercialization and scale-up of our patented technology platform which, as many of you know, turns the carbon found in sustainable wood residues into useful carbon-negative materials for a wide range of end products, including clothing, textiles, plastics, packaging, car parts, tires, carpeting, and toys.

Turning to slide 7, I am going to provide a construction update for Origin 1 and Origin 2. For those interested in the Origin 1 story, and the continued progress made by our team, I would like to point you to a new construction update video that we posted today to the investor relations section of our website.

For Origin 1, our first plant, located in Sarnia, Ontario, construction is progressing well and we remain on track for mechanical completion by the end of 2022, a considerable achievement despite the pandemic and supply-chain related headwinds.

We expect plant commissioning to be complete by the end of Q1 2023 with start-up beginning shortly thereafter. We are maintaining our previously disclosed capital budget for Origin 1 of $125 million to $130 million.

During the third quarter, we further strengthened our Origin 1 operations leadership team and support staff. I’m very proud of how our team has executed against our construction milestones as we draw closer to commercial production. This is a large manufacturing plant with a lot of moving parts, and what we’ve been able to accomplish to date, despite COVID and macro supply chain issues, truly shows the capability, efficiency, and efficacy of our capital projects team.

In our slides and in our construction video, you can see the progress we’ve made since our last update in August. All major equipment has been delivered onsite.

Since our last call, we have further progressed the assembly of the piping and electrical systems. The piping modules both interconnect our core chemical process modules and connect the Origin 1 plant with the utility supplied by the neighboring site. As we have discussed before, the modules were fabricated offsite using a modular construction approach and shipped in, minimizing the work that was required to be done in the field.

We also completed the construction of our biomass building, which is where we will store sustainable wood residues entering the plant prior to processing and conveying to the reactor system, as well as substantially completed our HTC building, which is where we will separate HTC, a solid material, from the liquid aqueous phase of our core chemical process. Notably, both the biomass building and the HTC building feature a significant amount of steel and a number of components and pieces connecting together.

HTC is a carbon-rich, highly structured and flexible raw material that can be converted into a wide range of applications, including carbon black and activated carbon for the automotive industry and material handling industry. We’ve recently received and installed our second filter press, an important part of how we handle HTC at Origin 1.

The filter presses will use the same HTC separation technique that is currently used at our pilot plant in California, but are about 100 times the size. The control room building, which houses our distributed control system, and the power distribution building both arrived onsite during the quarter. The distributed control system is the brain of the plant, controlling every powered system onsite.

Finally, we’ve delivered several new tanks onsite that will contain product as well as solvent that will be used, and recycled, as part of our core chemical process. Our site will have lots of integrated storage, which gives us the ability to manage our chemicals and materials.

New equipment includes a storage tank, which will contain unrefined CMF before its distillation step, as well as brine tanks, brine recovery tanks, HCl tanks, and several tanks for storing finished CMF. Due to its large size, our distillation feed tank was assembled onsite rather than delivered by road.

Today, we are thrilled to tell you that we are closer than ever to the mechanical completion and operation of Origin’s first commercial plant. Of course, this is a testament to the amazing level of talent that we’ve been able to attract to our company.

The Origin 1 team has done an incredible job creating a great safety culture while executing this project, and we will very much take what we’ve learned and the culture we’ve developed to Origin 2 and beyond.

At Origin, we recognize that our team is the critical differentiating factor that will enable our success and the execution of our vision. Over the past year, our ability to attract high-caliber technical talent with a deep commitment to our sustainability-focused values has far exceeded even our most optimistic expectations.

And, it’s become clear to us, following recent conversations with investors, that the pace at which we are adding depth to our team, and the truly remarkable quality of our people, is something worth highlighting. So, we decided to use a portion of today’s call to discuss some of the great recent additions to Origin.

Beginning on slide 18, it will be hard to overstate how enthusiastic we feel about the future, specifically our ability to commercialize our technology and products. I'd like to highlight just a small sampling of the world-class talent that has joined our team. Matt Perkins, Origin's Engineering Director for Capital Projects, has deep experience in project execution, which he developed over a 20-plus year career working with Fortune 500 owner operators and EPC company. He is highly experienced in the design, procurement and construction of industrial assets, including petrochemical technologies.

Dr. Zan Liu, Technical Manager, is the inventor of the award-winning technology C5 CDALky, which received the 2019 Hydrocarbon Casting Award, a tremendous accomplishment for any research scientist.

Dr. Bill Williams, Director of Process Development for Carbon products, is an expert in carbon black applications and chemical process engineering. Throughout his career, Bill has developed several technologies to reduce CO2, improve carbon efficiency, capture CO2 emissions and processes for chlorofluorocarbon alternatives.

Dr. Bill Gong, Senior Scientist, is an expert in the mid-century style oxidation of paraxylene to terephthalic acid. He has close to 30 years of petrochemical R&D experience in organic chemical reaction mechanisms, synthesis and the development and applications of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

Dr. James Lattner, Technical Fellow, is an expert in the petrochemical oil and gas industry, during his 40-plus-year career as a chemical engineer in oil and gas, James specialized in the process development and scale-up of chemical technologies and reaction engineering.

Chris Stark, Commercial Director, brings a diverse skillset to Origin from outside the chemical industry. During his 20 years of service, Chris rose to the rank of colonel in the Marine Corps Special Operations Command unit where he led cross functional teams. He has significant experience planning and leading projects in fast-paced environments.

Dr. Jay Hanan, Technical Director, recently inducted into the National Academy of Inventors, is a highly accomplished inventor and material scientist with over 300 science and engineering publications and almost 300 patents.

Dr. Ron Moffit, Polymer Principal Scientist, brings to our team more than 38 years of experience in polymer research, development, processing, and the manufacturing of fibers, films, and containers. And all of the people I've mentioned are outstanding additions to our team. We are thrilled to have them as well as the incredibly talented new people that I won't have mentioned on this call, but are likewise making incredible contributions for mission everything.

An example of R&D success that can be attributed, in large part, to new technical talent, is Origin’s recent increase in registered patent families. As indicated on Slide 4, our R&D efforts continue to yield fantastic results; and we have registered additional patent families, bringing our total to 23, with more in development as we speak. Apart from being a testament to our team’s technical abilities, our R&D successes also validate the flexibility of CMF as a platform chemical which, with our technology, can be produced at high yields under mild conditions directly from raw biomass.

In the ordinary course of business, Origin may acquire technologies or enter into licensing agreements to improve our product offerings and competitive position. During this quarter, we made an approximately $5 million dollar deposit towards securing a license to technologies that can be used to produce high-margin downstream products using our intermediate products as feedstock. We will provide an update on this licensing opportunity when appropriate.

With regard to Origin 2, our previously disclosed capital budget, construction timeline, and financing are unchanged, with updates to be provided when appropriate. As discussed on prior calls, we are closely monitoring costs associated with the current high levels of inflation and the challenging supply chain environment. We continue to proactively manage our cost base and note that we have built appropriate contingencies into our initial projections.

We are not currently placing any equipment or construction orders for Origin 2, and we expect current inflation and supply chain conditions to likely change in our favor in the next 12 to 24 months. Notably, we’ve seen recent declines in steel prices which have also filtered through to specialty steels indexed on these prices and that are used in the construction of plants like Origin 2.

I would also note that materials companies generally benefit from higher product prices and margins in an inflationary environment, which can mitigate the impact of inflation on our capital budget.

Origin 2, our first world-scale manufacturing facility, will produce carbon-negative materials used to make PET plastic resin and fiber, which is used in packaging, textiles, apparel, and other applications, and HTC, which can be used in fuel, as activated carbon, and as a replacement for carbon black. Front end design of the plant is underway with detailed engineering set to begin in 2023.

As previously announced, we have selected a site in Geismar, Louisiana for Origin 2, subject to finalization of economic incentives. We expect the 150-acre facility will convert an estimated 1 million dry metric tons of sustainable wood residues each year into products for a wide range of end markets. Some of the reasons that we believe the Geismar site is the ideal location for Origin 2 include the extremely skilled labor pool in Louisiana, access to relevant infrastructure, and access to sustainable feedstock.

Before I conclude, I’d like to give you some additional detail about what we’re currently working on for Origin 2. The team is optimizing and refining the scope and layout of the plant, incorporating value engineering activities. We are producing updated equipment arrangements and flow diagrams through our FEL2 engineering contractor. While we had hoped to complete these tasks by the end of Q3, we decided that it was more important to expand on the value engineering work to get it done correctly upfront.

We continue to work closely with landowners and fiber suppliers in Louisiana and Mississippi and are performing a logistics study with our FEL2 contractor to further define our feedstock and product movement strategy.

To summarize, the team has continued to make considerable progress and our expectation remains that Origin 1 will be completed by the end of 2022. Regarding Origin 2, the previously disclosed capital budget, construction timeline, and financing are unchanged.

Origin 1 represents an important milestone for our mission to enable the world’s transition to sustainable materials. We are excited by the progress our team has made as we approach mechanical completion and operation.

And with that, I will turn it over to Nate to discuss some of the financial details.

Nate Whaley

Thanks, John. I will begin with some commentary on our third quarter results, then our financing expectations for Origin 1 and Origin 2, and finish with an update on our 2022 outlook.

Speaking to slide 23, third quarter operating expenses were $9.7 million compared to $7.1 million during the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $8.4 million for the third quarter compared to a loss of $5.7 million in the same period of the prior year. And finally, net income was $8.3 million for the third quarter compared to a net income of $27.9 million in the same period in the prior year.

Turning to our balance sheet, Origin ended the third quarter with $362.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. We maintain our expectation of fully funding the construction of both Origin 1 and Origin 2 using our existing balance sheet cash and cash equivalents and previously indicated traditional financing sources.

With regard to the financing of Origin 2, as we’ve discussed on prior calls, the State of Louisiana, pending finalization, is expected to award a Private Activity Bond, tax-exempt bonds authorized by the state and local governments for the financing of qualified projects with private capital, volume cap allocation to the company in the amount of $400 million. We also expect to receive more than $100 million in pending state and local incentives.

As Rich discussed, we anticipate various federal tax credit, grant, loan, and other programs targeted towards promoting advanced manufacturing from the IRA to be incrementally beneficial for the financing of Origin 2 once the details of those programs are finalized by the relevant government agencies. We maintain that our financing assumptions for Origin 2 remain reasonable and achievable, with Origin 2 fully funded from existing cash on hand and previously indicated traditional financing sources. The $400 million Private Activity Bond allocation from the State of Louisiana provides a strong foundation for the financing of Origin 2 and, in combination with certain 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provisions and other non-volume cap tax-exempt financing, could enable the debt financing of Origin 2 using entirely tax-exempt bonds.

Origin also continues to work with leading financial institutions on other forms of traditional private financing and federal loan programs, including through the US Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy.

As we've highlighted, on our previous earnings calls inflationary pressures remain an area of focus. However as John discussed, at this point we are not adjusting our overall capital budget for Origin 2. We acknowledge the situation remains fluid and we continue to closely monitor our cost estimates such that we can communicate any changes to the market, at appropriate times as we progress through the project.

We'll now close with an update on our 2022 outlook. We are maintaining our prior outlook for an adjusted EBITDA loss of up to $36 million and capital expenditures of up to $175 million. We look forward to providing full year 2023 guidance for revenue EBITDA and other financial metrics on our next earnings call in early 2023.

With that, I will turn it back to Rich for closing remarks.

Rich Riley

Thank you, Nate. In closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's continued execution as we draw closer to the commissioning and start-up of Origin 1 and encouraged by the strong momentum that we continue to see for our industry-leading technology, as the world moves aggressively to a zero-carbon future. I would like to thank all of our customers for their commitments to Origin, our team and construction and engineering partners for their contribution to our company's success and our shareholders for their continuous support.

And with that, I would like to ask the operator to open the line for questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Steve.

Steve Byrne

Yes. Thank you. You indicated that there's a fraction of the CMS that you're going to produce at Origin 2 that has already been allocated to produce para-xylene and the derivatives PET. I'm curious, what fraction of the CMS capacity at that plant are you allocating to that pathway? And so therefore, what fraction are you going down another path, which I would assume would be the furan based chemistries like PEF. And why did you come to this conclusion? Do you have a view that the furan chemistries could potentially create more value, than going down the path of PET?

Rich Riley

Yes. Thanks, Steve, great question. So we're not disclosing the specific allocations of our CMF from Origin 2 at this time. But we've always talked about and planned for a portion of the CMF to go to those higher-value applications. You mentioned PEF, I would call out surfactants is another one. And CMF is this incredibly flexible molecule, that can go on to be a lot of things. And we've talked a lot about para-xylene and PET and have seen enormous demand for that. And we're excited to continue engaging with customers and potential customers, around additional even higher value applications of our CMF. And it's one of the great things about Origin 1 coming online, is it enables us to produce large-scale samples to those development partners as we build on the CMF platform.

Steve Byrne

And you picked up almost another $1 billion in offtake agreements. Is it fair for us to assume that those are mostly PET-based? And if not, what else are you getting in there now? And maybe more specifically do you have any offtake agreements yet for the carbon black or the HTC or do you think you need product from Origin 1 to deliver to your partners before you could really establish some offtake agreements for the HTC?

Rich Riley

Yes. So it was another very strong quarter for demand, and a meaningful part of that is from our sort of flagship para-xylene and PET offerings but for other materials as well. And we've previously announced some offtake agreements for HTC, going to the carbon black application. And again, we are excited for Origin 1 to come online and provide larger scale samples, as we work to get even more carbon black offtake agreements. And the carbon black is not quite as drop-in as our para-xylene offering. And so, being able to provide meaningful samples is important to continuing to advance that business.

Steve Byrne

Very good. Thank you.

Rich Riley

Thank you.

Operator

And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead, Frank.

Frank Mitsch

Hi. good afternoon, folks. I wanted to talk about the time line on Origin 1 and the capital spend associated with it. You're maintaining the 125 budget – 125, 130 budget. And you also indicated that you're going to spend this year up to $175 million in CapEx, but it looks like year-to-date you guys have spent $58 million for the first three quarters. So can you just kind of walk us through the spending to get to that $125 million $130 million over the next couple of quarters, please?

Nate Whaley

Yes, sure. So we laid out the capital. And by the way, thanks, Frank. Appreciate the question. [indiscernible] We laid out that CapEx expectation at the beginning of the year and it was really anticipating that we might need to place some early orders for a large-scale equipment for Origin 2. We expect that $125 million to $130 million budget that we laid out for Origin 1 is, we're still expecting mechanical completion by the end of this year. So I think, we'll likely hit that pretty cleanly.

But I think that, what we're seeing right now is that we probably don't need to have quite as many orders for Origin 2, but we want to leave space for that and make sure that we have the sort of right capital allocation there. And in particular, we want to make sure that we don't exceed it. And so that was sort of the general thinking alongside that. But in any case, if it isn't spent this year on Origin 2, it will be spent sometime next year. We would expect all of that would be timing issues associated with CapEx, not a guidance up down in general for the project.

Frank Mitsch

All right. And it makes some sense, given the fact that you're anticipating steel costs, et cetera. So the cost of the equipment to come down. And if we're looking at 2025, there's no rush to get the equipment right now. Is that the right way to read that?

Nate Whaley

Exactly, the right way to read that, Frank.

Frank Mitsch

All right. Great. And then, I mean congrats on the ever-rising upward capacity reservations offtake agreements getting to $9 billion. As you think about that, and let's make the assumption that much of that comes to fruition. What does that get us up to in terms of origin numbers? I mean are we past two? Are we past three? Are we past four, in terms of that very large number?

Nate Whaley

Yes. Thanks, Frank. We are taking orders across all three plants for a variety of products and some products are more sold out than others. But yes, we've been taking orders on Origin 3 to be specific.

Frank Mitsch

All right. Implying that Origin 2 is probably booked up at this point?

Nate Whaley

So Origin 2 is substantially committed for para-xylene and PET.

Rich Riley

And so as we said in the script, our sales efforts are evolving to what we've talked about in the past of focusing on advanced CMF derivatives, carbon black and other high-margin products.

Frank Mitsch

Got you. All right. Thank you so much.

Nate Whaley

Thank you.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead Eric.

Aaron Spychalla

Yeah. Hi, it's Aaron Spychalla on for Eric. Thanks for taking the questions. First, maybe on just testing and sales cycle. Can you talk about the evolution there over the past year plus as customer demand has grown and the outlook there as Origin 1 comes online?

John Bissell

Yeah. So our sales cycle tends to be a relatively small number of relatively large deals, and they can take a variety of time to come to fruition. Some move really fast, some require more R&D engagement and things like that. So there's not really a number of months or things like that that I could point to, but I would say demand continues to be very strong, continues to be strong across applications and geographies, as well as strong across our product portfolio.

Aaron Spychalla

All right. And then, can you just give an update on the feedstock strategy? Any update there, pricing economics, margins as the market is developing and you're moving forward?

John Bissell

Yeah, sure. So feedstock strategy that we're expecting to use for both Origin 1 or Origin 2 is residuals from the timber and lumber processing industry. There are other feedstock that are available in the region of Origin 2 that we may also incorporate into that feedstock strategy everything from agricultural residuals to even things like post-consumer recycled corrugated cardboard or paper products, mixed paper, et cetera.

So that's the feedstock strategy. Our interest in that is both economic because those kind of feedstock tend to be lower value to other industries. And so, of course, that means better economic value to us. But also there's a driver from a mission side too. Those feedstock often are used or not used in such a way that they release significant CO2 and methane emissions those biogenic or biologically derived feedstocks when they get put into a landfill for example, they will often decompose anaerobically in the landfill and generate methane emissions, which are really a very potent form of greenhouse gas, and so intercepting those kinds of biologically generated feedstocks even cardboard of course originally came from a tree somewhere and preventing them from going to the landfill and instead using them in our technology, which can ultimately lock it into a -- lock the carbon into a material is a particularly powerful way of avoiding and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions to using our technology in addition to as I said the economic benefits of using feedstock right there.

Aaron Spychalla

Right, right, understood. Thanks for taking the question. I’ll hop back in.

Operator

That concludes today's live Q&A segment. I will now turn it over to Ashish Gupta, Investor Relations to conduct the next segment of our investor Q&A.

Ashish Gupta

Thank you Ross. As we've done on our last two earnings calls we invited all investors to submit questions for our third quarter call as part of our Ask Origin campaign. Once again we were pleased to see such a high level of participation and want to thank everyone who submitted a question. In the interest of time we'll be taking the most commonly asked questions.

Our first question is for Rich. Rich, what are some customers in the investor presentation order book page unnamed, excuse me, why are some of the customers in the investor presentation order book unnamed? And when will you name them?

Rich Riley

Yeah. So as you can see from the order book increase demand is very strong and we continue to see significant sales traction, and when it comes to actually press releasing these customers that's in close coordination with these customers. And sometimes, we don't announce some right when deals are signed or released their names for a variety of reasons. A notable example would be that some customers want to wait and announce their relationship with us in conjunction with their own broader ESG announcements. So we really defer to customers on when making our relationship public works best for them.

Ashish Gupta

That makes a ton of sense. I appreciate the color there. John, since you did such a great job covering feedstock and our focus on sustainability of the biomass feedstock. I just wanted to see if there's anything else you wanted to touch on there or if we thought it was best to move on to the PFAS question?

Yes. I think that was a good question. As you mentioned I gave a pretty comprehensive answer to Aaron on it. I think one other thing that might be worth noting is that on the economic side the fact that we can use feedstocks such as those that I described is what allows us to access tax-exempt bond financing for projects like Origin 2.

So there's the, sort of, primary economic impact of using feedstocks like that which is that they're less expensive. And of course there's a mission-oriented impact of avoiding pretty potent greenhouse gas emissions. But there's a secondary economic impact which is that it allows us to access a really attractive kind of financing for these projects. And that can make a real difference as well. So that might be worth highlighting for folks too.

A – Ashish Gupta

Thank you for being so thorough with all of that. And, I guess, could you clarify for folks, is there any PFAS in our products?

John Bissell

Yes. So it's an interesting question. We get this more often than I would expect as a chemist by the way PFAS stands for Per Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substances. And that's a class of compounds, which as a chemist you wouldn't necessarily associate with any of the stuff that we are doing, but there are substance of concern I would say for the human species. And so since we're dealing with chemistry materials and sustainability of chemistry materials then they tend to come up as part of that kind of discussion.

And the short answer is, no. We don't have any per polyfluorinated alkyl substances in our products nor do we have those processes in our -- sorry those chemicals that is intermediate or solvents or something like that in our processes. So we don't really touch them. But there's something that sort of actually hits on a broader category of products and I would say a broader category of applications that you can use our products for which we sometimes think of as sort of safer chemicals and intermediates places where we can provide an intermediate that performs as well or perhaps even better than the fossil-based equivalent material or analog, but doesn't have some of the health impacts.

And so I would say there are --of course sustainability is a big driver for materials and chemicals these days as it should be. I think another one is security of materials and chemicals the security of supply. Of course with the sort of geopolitics of the world these days that's something that is more top of mind for people.

But I think another huge driver of change in the Materials & Chemicals world is this sort of human health and safety component as we understand better the impact that some of the material choices we made as humans sometimes 56 or even 100 years ago how those choices are affecting us I think we're much more sensitive as a species to how should we select materials now which don't have those kinds of negative human health impacts?

And so PFAS is, of course, one they're one of these class called forever chemicals which have their own sort of risk profile. But there are other materials that we find really interesting as targets because we can go in with our molecules and replace things like BPA or phthalates et cetera, and provide again sort of as good and often better performance in the application and you have eliminated that human health issue. So we don't use any PFAS in our process or in our products. But I think that touches on a much broader category of sort of value that we can provide using our intermediates that we're pretty excited about.

A – Ashish Gupta

That's great, John. We're going to turn to Nate for a couple of finance-related questions. Nate, could you help us understand to what degree rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions are a problem? Is project financing an issue at this point?

Nate Whaley

Sure. No. Look we continue to consult with the leading financial institutions specializing in financing capital projects exactly like this. And we're pleased to reaffirm our financing assumptions for Origin 2 remain reasonable and achievable. I'll remind you that $400 million private activity bond allocation from the state of Louisiana we announced earlier provides a strong foundation for the financing of Origin 2.

Again in combination with some of the non-volume tax-exempt financing structures this could enable the debt financing of Origin 2 using entirely tax-exempt bonds. We're continuing to work with the state and local agencies in Louisiana on our bond financing and we're pleased to report that Origin 2 financing remains on track.

We're also continuing to work with financial institutions on other forms of traditional private financing, federal loan programs including through the USDA and the Department of Energy. I should also just reiterate that some of the federal programs that Rich mentioned earlier including the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act which can also provide incremental sources of funds for Origin 2.

Ashish Gupta

Great. Really appreciate all of that extra color Rich, Sean and Nate. That will conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll now turn it back to Rich for closing remarks.

Rich Riley

Thanks, Ashish, and thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to keeping everyone updated on our progress. This concludes the call.

The South Korean battery maker will be procuring 2,000 tonnes of natural graphite, per year, from the Aussie company, from 2025 onwards – with plans to increase the order to 10,000 tonnes a year.

The graphite is a key component of lithium-ion batteries, used in electric vehicles.

This is part of LG’s plans to decrease its reliance on China, ahead of the US Inflation Reduction Act taking effect.

The actual graphite won’t be mined in Australia, but rather from Syrah Resources’ mine in Mozambique.

Syrah will build a dedicated production factory in Louisiana, meaning the Aussie company can receive American subsidies for electric vehicles.

“LG Energy Solution is a tier 1 global manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries and their rapidly expanding manufacturing position in the USA is aligned with Syrah’s growth plans,” said Shaun Verner, Managing Director and CEO of Syrah.

“Our partnership with Syrah demonstrates our devotion to diversifying the critical minerals portfolio by directly procuring from local and regional suppliers in North America, more so as natural graphite is one of the battery materials with the least diverse supply chain,” said Youngsoo Kwon, CEO of LG Energy Solution.

“As we aim to not only expand our customer base but also increase our production capacity in North America, securing a competitive local supply chain for key critical minerals will play a crucial role in ensuring a stable delivery of the world-best quality products to our customers.”",electric vehicles,channelnews

It's hard to imagine a world in which driving your car actually reduces your carbon footprint. But a group of college students from the Netherlands has built an electric car that they call the world's first carbon negative vehicle.

ZEM, or Zero Emission Mobility, is a prototype vehicle designed and built by 35 students of Eindhoven University of Technology. Thanks to a pair of carbon capture devices behind the front grill, ZEM absorbs C02 as it drives. Students say it can collect about 4.5 pounds of carbon for every 20,000 miles driven (a mature tree captures about 48 pounds of carbon, on average per year). Watch the video above to see how the technology works. Once the filters are full, they can be emptied, and the carbon could be reused for fuel (or, the team says, even to make beer).

Though electric vehicles don't emit carbon dioxide on the road, the process of producing their lithium batteries can generate large amounts of carbon. Carbon is also often emitted during the production of the electricity that ultimately powers an EV's batteries. This is where, the Eindhoven students say, ZEM's carbon filters can offset its carbon footprint.

""When these filters can be made modularly, they can be implemented into every type of vehicle, every type of transportation."" Eindhoven student Lars Holster told CNET.

TUecomotive

Solar panels on the roof and hood provide eight lithium batteries with about 15% of ZEM's power. There's also a traditional plug-in connection behind the rear license plate. The team implemented bi-directional charging technology, so ZEM could be used as a generator to power a home's appliances.

The students designed the vehicle to be sustainable through its entire lifecycle. The body is 3D-printed from recycled plastics, which can be shredded and reused at the end of the car's life. The interior is made from pineapples, while the dash came from recycled cooking oils.

""ZEM is, to our knowledge, the most sustainable car in the world right now."" Holster said.

John Kim/CNET

The team has no plans to sell ZEM (though members are hoping to patent its carbon capture technology). They say they hope the prototype vehicle can inspire automakers and other industry leaders to build on the idea. ""What we can do as a team of 35 undergraduate students, a big company with a full department of bright engineers can do way better,"" Holster said.

Carbon capture is expected to become big business in the next few years. Analysts predict it will be a $7 billion industry by 2028.",electric vehicles,cnet

A ponderosa pine crushed a drive-thru at the U.S. Bank on Seltice Way in Post Falls.

COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho — Just before going to bed about 10 p.m. Friday, George Sayler looked out the window that offers a view of Lake Coeur d’Alene, reports our partners from the Coeur d'Alene Press.

His attention, though, was on the two ponderosa pines that stood more than 100 feet tall and angled toward his home at 11th and Ash in the Sanders Beach neighborhood.

He had those trees thinned last summer, but with powerful winds in the forecast for Friday night and early Saturday, he was concerned.

“I think we’ll be OK,” he decided.

But a few hours later, about 1:15 a.m., he heard a crash and felt the room shudder.

“I looked up and I could see Sheetrock over my head,” he said.

A big branch was sticking through the ceiling and there was a large hole in the roof. Debris was scattered around the room.

“I knew what had happened right away,” said Sayler, a former state representative.

One of those pine trees had been pushed over by a gust coming off the lake. It crushed a section of fence and landed on the Saylers' home, smashing into the master bedroom on the second floor where George and his wife, Kathleen, were sleeping.

Both were OK.

There was no time to be scared, George said.

""It happened so fast, as soon as it hit, I knew, because I could feel the stuff on my head, and then it was quiet,"" he said. ""I thought, 'We're OK.' It was just a matter of getting out of the house.""

They spent the night with a neighbor.

“It’s heartbreaking because you know it's your home. It’s a mess,” he said. “But we were lucky, thankfully, didn’t get hurt. Good neighbors helped take care of us.”

Downed trees, fallen fences, along with blown debris were being cleaned up throughout the region following a wind storm that swept through the area Friday night and into Saturday morning.

Several trees went down at Coeur d'Alene City Park. A ponderosa pine crushed a drive-thru at the U.S. Bank on Seltice Way in Post Falls.

The storm’s gusts grew stronger after midnight. They were estimated at more than 50 mph and at one point knocked out power to more than 20,000 homes in the region.

As of 5:30 p.m. Saturday, 3,058 Avista electric customers were without power across 154 unique outage incidents, a press release said.

The height of the storm was at 3 a.m. Saturday.

“At that time, there were 252 incidents and 18,850 Avista electric customers without power,"" the release said.

Since 3 a.m., power had been restored to more than 15,000 customers, Avista said, adding that crews worked throughout the night

“Avista’s electric system was impacted primarily by trees and branches falling into lines,” according to a press release.

Avista anticipated that the majority of the customers who experienced outages as a result of the windstorm will be restored by 10 p.m. today.

""Avista is continuing to monitor the weather, as snow has begun to fall in certain areas in our service territory and this could impact restoration efforts,"" a release said. ""It’s possible additional outages may occur as a result of the snow.""

At 7:30 a.m. Saturday, there were 2,718 Kootenai Electric Cooperative members affected by power outages.

KEC crews worked throughout the night and as of 6 p.m. Saturday, KEC has 235 members remaining with power outages. Crews were working in the areas of Harrison, Upriver Drive, Cougar Gulch, Spirit Lake East, Athol, Stateline, Setters and Kidd Island.

Several trees on 11th Street, north of the Saylors, also went down.

""It must have been a wind shear coming down 11th Street,"" George said.

Courtney Perschau, who lives at 11th and Mountain, said she checked on her kids about midnight and all was well, other the menacing winds.

But about 1:15 a.m. she heard a crash and looked out the front window. The fir tree in their yard that was more than 100 feet tall came down, missing the home, but damaging the Tesla in the driveway.

“I felt the house shake,” Perschau said.

The family retreated to the basement for the night and the next morning neighbors arrived to help clean up and remove much of the tree.

“Best community ever,” Perschau said.

Mike and Amy Maykuth and daughter Allie live on 11th near Pine. Wary of the pending windstorm, they moved their vehicles to the parking lot of the Coeur d’Alene Public Library and walked home Friday night.

About 11:30 p.m., with the winds picking up, a nervous Amy suggested they sleep in the camper van at the library parking lot, which they did.

The next morning, a neighbor called.

“Are you guys OK?”

The Maykuths hurried home and saw two trees just south of their home, also estimated at more than 100 feet tall, had come down across their driveway, where the Toyota Tundra would have been parked. One tree clipped the front of their home, damaging the roof and porch.

The second falling tree sheared branches off a standing tree, which Mike believed may have kept it from hitting their home.

“Pretty minor damage overall in terms of the overall grand scheme of things of what could have happened,” Mike said.

Jacobson Tree Service was removing the trees Saturday afternoon.

The Maykuths plan to say in their home, as they still have electricity and can cordon off the damaged area until repairs are made.

Mike said the two trees have long been cause for worry.

“These trees have sort of been on everybody’s mind for quite a while,” he said. “I’m glad these things are out of here.”

Saturday afternoon, George watched and took photos as Bluebird Tree Care removed the tree from the roof of his home.

The Saylers have lived there since 1986 and those two ponderosa pines had always stood tall, acting as sentries.

Now, they plan to have the other one removed.

George said that, ironically, he had spent the past few days cleaning up pine needles in the yard and fixing parts of the fence.

“That’s the way it goes,” he said, laughing.

George added that when he surveyed those trees before going to sleep Friday, he should have made a different decision.

“We should have gone to the basement,” he said.
