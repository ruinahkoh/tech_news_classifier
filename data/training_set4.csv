One of the most challenging and valuable domains for AI is medicine. Both the opportunities and the dangers are great in applying the technology to healthcare overall.

The value of improved medical care is immediate, especially for people suffering from diseases that cannot presently be adequately treated. Artificial intelligence (AI) may have the potential to see what humans cannot and provide a level of care that is otherwise beyond our reach. And when AI algorithms work well, they can be shared widely in cost-lowering ways.

Risks and rewards

There are, however, both risks and rewards to medical AI. In a 2020 survey of medical professionals, 79% of respondents reported believing that the technology could be useful or very useful. But 80% completely or partially agreed that the risks to privacy could be very high, while 40% completely or partially rated the potential risks “more dangerous than nuclear weapons.”

AI has enabled the development of technologies that go beyond natural human processes, among other risks. Nanotechnology, gene editing, in-vivo networking (INV), the Internet of Bodies and amalgams such as the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are among the technologies that offer both promise and potential harm.

What are the challenges of medical AI?

Scientists approaching medical AI want to leverage the technology’s natural abilities while limiting the potential harm. All applications of AI come with challenges, but using this technology to improve health is particularly complicated. Here are some of the challenges:

Imperfect sensors: Data gathered from medical sensors is often noisier and less precise than in other domains such as photographic classification. This is especially true when sensors penetrate a living, breathing human being. CT or MRI scanners return pixelated and blocky images with many artifacts that can cloud or obscure the details in question. X-rays may be better but they, like CT or MRI scanners, can detect some types of body parts better than others.

X-rays may be better but they, like CT or MRI scanners, can detect some types of body parts better than others. Chaotic systems: The parts of living things are often changing, sometimes dynamically. They’re not fixed targets for algorithms. In many cases, sick people have more complex and dysfunctional systems that are harder for algorithms to analyze because they are not behaving normally.

In many cases, sick people have more complex and dysfunctional systems that are harder for algorithms to analyze because they are not behaving normally. Privacy: Medical information is often protected by stringent laws and regulations because patients are sensitive about their personal data being shared with the larger world. While several clever and useful approaches can protect people’s identities, these require more work, can inject potential error and hold inherent risk.

While several clever and useful approaches can protect people’s identities, these require more work, can inject potential error and hold inherent risk. Limited knowledge: While the medical profession has accumulated a reservoir of understanding about human bodies, there are still many areas that are a mystery. Although AI algorithms can sometimes be useful when we don’t know much about the topic, there are still limitations. Sometimes we don’t even know the right questions to ask.

Although AI algorithms can sometimes be useful when we don’t know much about the topic, there are still limitations. Sometimes we don’t even know the right questions to ask. Cautious approach: Because doctors and nurses understand that there could be dangers, they are often quite careful and hesitant to try new techniques.

Because doctors and nurses understand that there could be dangers, they are often quite careful and hesitant to try new techniques. Tight regulation: Governments tightly regulate medical devices and software. Levels of testing and development that are acceptable for other domains often do not meet the standards for medical technology set by the governing U.S. agencies, for example.

What are the opportunities for medical AI?

While there remain deep challenges to using AI in medicine, there are also many opportunities for improving care. The technology can offer solutions that humans aren’t able to duplicate. Here are a few ways it can help:

Chaotic systems: The human body is quite complex and human caregivers often have trouble seeing complex or chaotic events. Noise or random extraneous events can cloud their vision. AI algorithms focus on data and learn to extract valuable insights from hundreds of data readings. They may be able to do a better job of focusing than humans can.

AI algorithms focus on data and learn to extract valuable insights from hundreds of data readings. They may be able to do a better job of focusing than humans can. Better sensors: AI applications may have access to information that humans can’t see. Some sensors pick up infrared or other wavelengths that the human eye can’t perceive. The technology can identify small changes with more precision than normal human perception. Better information can lead to better decisions.

While there can be biases in the data itself, this blind focus still offers us the opportunity to eliminate confounding variables that can trigger human bias.

Indefatigable: As long as electrical power is available, AI apps can see patients and render opinions. This can be extremely valuable late at night or at times when human caregivers are tired or not available.

As long as electrical power is available, AI apps can see patients and render opinions. This can be extremely valuable late at night or at times when human caregivers are tired or not available. An assistant, not a replacement: In most cases AI is not in direct competition with human caregivers. The technology can offer advice to humans, who decide how much of the advice to accept. This hybrid approach can ultimately capture the best of both human and machine intelligence.

What are some of the best roles for AI in medicine?

VentureBeat has elsewhere covered the 10 top AI applications in the healthcare sector more broadly, and here in brief are the medical areas addressed there:

Research

Training

Professional support

Patient engagement

Remote medicine

Diagnostics

Surgery

Hospital care

How are the major companies handling medical AI?

Leading tech providers that are investing heavily in AI are targeting the medical market as well.

Oracle has invested heavily in medical informatics in part by acquiring Cerner, a leading medical records company. Its product line will leverage Oracle’s investment in data science and AI to optimally treat patients at medical centers that use Cerner medical records. Its Integrated Behavioral Health, for instance, watches patient data to help prevent patient suicide.

Microsoft’s Azure cloud supports various medical applications. Its internet of things (IoT) software support can absorb data from hospital medical devices, then connect the data with the various AI packages. Its software for analyzing images can unlock details in radiological data. It is also investing in specialized tools for analyzing the vast sets of data captured by genomics research.

Amazon is creating specialized versions of its various AWS products to support medical practice and research. Its SageMaker AI platform can work with HIPAA-protected patient records stored in its HealthLake service. The algorithms support forward-looking research by searching for connections and patterns and can decode some of the unstructured text data by using natural language models.

Google’s Healthcare Data Engine allows researchers and care providers to track and query the information gathered from patients and research subjects. This HIPAA-compliant space offers direct connections to all of Google’s data analytics and artificial intelligence options such as VertexAI.

IBM offers a cautionary tale about the challenges facing the application of AI to medicine. After significant investment, the company recently sold its IBM Watson Health assets to Francisco Partners, which has launched it as Merative. The software links algorithms under one brand for helping researchers, regulators, doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and patients. Its Clinical Development product, for instance, manages the coding and data storage needed for tracking patients across studies and visits. MarketScan Treatment Pathways searches large patient databases to identify optimal options for providing care.

How are some startups delivering medical AI?

Thousands of startups want to use the power of AI algorithms to change medicine. Summarizing them in a short article like this can’t be done. Still, it’s possible to offer a brief list with some examples for illustration.

Some startups are working on the front lines of care. Sensely, for example, is creating a bot that can offer patients automated advice. This can save nurses time while bringing faster answers to patients.

Others are working deeper in the labs. Atomwise, for instance, wants to improve drug discovery by helping chemists and pharmacologists evaluate the many different potential drugs for efficacy.

A common use case is the analysis of medical images produced and interpreted by radiologists. Medical Harbor, AetherAI, ButterflyNetwork, Enlitic and RadLogics are just a few of the startups creating platforms that help radiologists capture and interpret images. They are focused on improving productivity, limiting mistakes and in some cases enabling earlier and more detailed findings.

Molecular Devices and PathAI are examples of companies bringing similar algorithms to the work of pathologists, who often use imagery to analyze blood and tissue samples. The algorithms can speed up and automate repetitive tasks like counting cells that match criteria that indicate malignancy, for example.

Companies that specialize in capturing and storing medical records are also working to integrate artificial intelligence algorithms. Roam Analytics and Sopris are integrating AI techniques to automate medical records by improving accuracy, automating classification and increasing the accuracy of any internal data science studies of this information.

Is there anything that medical AI can’t do?

Some obvious limitations of medical AI are similar to those that confound all AI algorithms: If the training data is spotty, biased, noisy or limited, the resulting model will echo all of these problems.

Gathering data is often more challenging in healthcare than in other domains. Between regulations, sensitivity of information, and difficulty in gathering information in a clinical setting, the datasets will naturally be less comprehensive and more prone to error. There is also not the same opportunity to redo the data-gathering that is possible in some other fields.

In many cases, medical datasets are much too small for training AI. While some AI models are based upon millions or billions of data elements, some medical studies include only a handful of patients. The scale is markedly different and there’s not the same opportunity to rely upon large datasets to squeeze out error.

Medical AI is also limited by the power of medicine itself. If human intelligence doesn’t have a workable solution, then AI can’t provide one either. If the medical science is unclear or imperfect, the AI will be too. As reflected in the survey of medical professionals referenced above, both the potential and the risks of medical AI are great. The challenge is to maximize the former, while keeping the latter within an acceptable range.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo















OAKLAND, Calif., Oct 13 (Reuters) - Used by two-thirds of the world's 100 biggest banks to aid lending decisions, credit scoring giant Fair Isaac Corp (FICO.N) and its artificial intelligence software can wreak havoc if something goes wrong.

That crisis nearly came to pass early in the pandemic. As FICO recounted to Reuters, the Bozeman, Montana company's AI tools for helping banks identify credit and debit card fraud concluded that a surge in online shopping meant fraudsters must have been busier than usual.

The AI software told banks to deny millions of legitimate purchases, at a time when consumers had been scrambling for toilet paper and other essentials.

But consumers ultimately faced few denials, according to FICO. The company said a global group of 20 analysts who constantly monitor its systems recommended temporary adjustments that avoided a blockade on spending. The team is automatically alerted to unusual buying activity that could confuse the AI, relied on by 9,000 financial institutions overall to detect fraud across 2 billion cards.

Such corporate teams, part of the emerging job specialty of machine learning operations (MLOps), are unusual. In separate surveys last year, FICO and the consultancy McKinsey & Co found that most organizations surveyed are not regularly monitoring AI-based programs after launching them.

The problem is that errors can abound when real-world circumstances deviate, or in tech parlance ""drift,"" from the examples used to train AI, according to scientists managing these systems. In FICO's case, it said its software expected more in-person than virtual shopping, and the flipped ratio led to a greater share of transactions flagged as problematic.

Seasonal variations, data-quality changes or momentous events - such as the pandemic - all can lead to a string of bad AI predictions.

Imagine a system recommending swimsuits to summer shoppers, not realizing that COVID lockdowns had made sweatpants more suitable. Or a facial recognition system becoming faulty because masking had become popular.

The pandemic must have been a ""wake-up call"" for anyone not closely monitoring AI systems because it induced countless behavioral shifts, said Aleksander Madry, director of the Center for Deployable Machine Learning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Coping with drift is a huge problem for organizations leveraging AI, he said. ""That's what really stops us currently from this dream of AI revolutionizing everything.""

Adding to the urgency for users to address the issue, the European Union plans to pass a new AI law as soon as next year requiring some monitoring. The White House this month in new AI guidelines also called for monitoring to ensure system ""performance does not fall below an acceptable level over time."" read more

Being slow to notice issues can be costly. Unity Software Inc (U.N), whose ad software helps video games attract players, in May estimated that it would lose $110 million in sales this year, or about 8% of total expected revenue, after customers pulled back when its AI tool that determines whom to show ads to stopped working as well as it once did. Also to blame was its AI system learning from corrupted data, the company said.

Unity, based in San Francisco, declined to comment beyond earnings-call statements. Executives there said Unity was deploying alerting and recovery tools to catch problems faster and acknowledged expansion and new features had taken precedence over monitoring.

Real estate marketplace Zillow Group Inc (ZG.O) last November announced a $304 million writedown on homes it bought - based on a price-forecasting algorithm - for amounts higher than they could be resold for. The Seattle company said the AI could not keep pace with rapid and unprecedented market swings and exited the buying-selling business.

NEW MARKET

AI can go awry in many ways. Most well known is that training data skewed along race or other lines can prompt unfairly biased predictions. Many companies now vet data beforehand to prevent this, according to the surveys and industry experts. By comparison, few companies consider the danger of a well-performing model that later breaks, those sources say.

""It's a pressing problem,"" said Sara Hooker, head of research lab Cohere For AI. ""How do you update models that become stale as the world changes around it?""

Several startups and cloud computing giants in the past couple of years have started selling software to analyze performance, set alarms and introduce fixes that together intend to help teams keep tabs on AI. IDC, a global market researcher, estimates spending on tools for AI operations to reach at least $2 billion in 2026 from $408 million last year.

Venture capital investment in AI development and operations companies rose last year to nearly $13 billion, and $6 billion has poured in so far this year, according to data from PitchBook, a Seattle company tracking financings.

Arize AI, which raised $38 million from investors last month, enables monitoring for customers including Uber, Chick-fil-A and Procter & Gamble. Chief Product Officer Aparna Dhinakaran said she struggled at a previous employer to quickly spot AI predictions turning poor and friends elsewhere told her about their own delays.

""The world of today is you don't know there's an issue until a business impact two months down the road,"" she said.

FRAUD SCORES

Some AI users have built their own monitoring capabilities and that is what FICO said saved it at the start of the pandemic.

Alarms were triggered as more purchases occurred online - what the industry calls ""card not present."" Historically, more of this spending tends to be fraudulent and the surge pushed transactions higher on FICO's 1-to-999 scale (the higher it is, the more likely it is fraud), said Scott Zoldi, chief analytics officer at FICO.

Zoldi said consumer habits were changing too fast to rewrite the AI system. So FICO advised U.S. clients to review and reject only transactions scored above 900, up from 850, he said. It spared clients from reviewing 67% of legitimate transactions above the old threshold, and allowed them instead to focus on truly problematic cases.

Clients went on to detect 25% more of total U.S. fraud during the first six months of the pandemic than would have been expected and 60% more in the United Kingdom, Zoldi said.

""You are not responsible with AI unless you are monitoring,"" he said.

Register here.

Climate change, biodiversity and other environmental concerns; social issues such as diversity, equity and inclusion; as well as worker well-being are woven into broader environmental, social and governance (ESG) discussions — discussions that every enterprise needs to have to achieve sustainability goals and meet ESG compliance requirements.

However, an overwhelming amount of data and a lack of technology can make it difficult for organizations to make data-driven decisions related to ESG. Additionally, due to existing knowledge gaps, corporations have to rely on expensive consultants to bring the necessary expertise into their organization.

“With the rapid momentum around ESG, teams are stuck manually organizing an enormous amount of data to understand how to identify and manage non-financial risks and stakeholder requirements. Because of this, the majority of time is spent collecting data and building reports rather than implementing solutions,” Beeri Amiel, CEO and cofounder, Continue AI, told VentureBeat. Amiel says Continue AI uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze millions of data points to deliver insights that provide action plans that enterprises can implement across their organizations.

Founded in 2021, Continue AI — which today announced $5.7 million in seed funding — aims to harness data to provide a new layer of sustainability intelligence that business leaders never had before to mobilize companies into sustainable action and create meaningful change.

Embedding intelligence into ESG measures

“My cofounders, Alon Arad, Yonatan Maor, and I have spent our careers building big data products and deeply understand the importance of using data to drive corporate decision-making,” said Amiel. “Through our work, we found out that one of the biggest challenges corporations are facing today is around being able to actually make data-driven decisions regarding sustainability.”

Continue AI also claims to empower their customers’ ESG teams with data to make decisions on their own and build a sustainability practice internally. They do this with publicly available data, without requiring lengthy internal integrations, and provide insights that make a difference to corporate sustainability programs from day 1. Along with the strategic data analysis, Continue AI also enables companies to continuously stay ahead of stakeholder expectations while navigating the ESG cycle from start to finish.

The way to a sustainable future

ESG is in its early stages, going from a voluntary activity to mandatory as regulations begin to come into play in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world.

“Most companies today are working to figure out what data they need to look for and then figure out how to bring in the solutions that help them get to where they need to be. On both fronts, it’s still the early days, but companies across the board are beginning to understand how important this is for the way they manage their business,” said Amiel.

“We are planning to continue to develop our technology and expand our go-to-market, actually getting in front of as many sustainability teams as we can and getting the product in their hands.

“Overall, we want to enable sustainability leaders to truly focus their resources on what is most important — creating a better future,” said Amiel.

Continue AI’s client roster includes multiple Fortune 500 and public companies including Royal Caribbean, Amiel says. Today’s funding round was led by Grove Ventures and Maple Capital, with participation from Ride Ventures, Liquid2, and Kindergarten Ventures.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

From the T-800 in The Terminator franchise to David in Prometheus to Annabelle in The Conjuring Universe, the robots seem to always break bad more often than not and turn on their creators. The latest robot set to terrorize humans is an overprotective doll in M3GAN, the first trailer for which was released moments ago.

Gemma (Allison Williams), a gifted robotic developer, suddenly becomes the guardian of her 8-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw). With no parental experience, Gemma introduces Cady to M3GAN, a robotic doll programmed with artificial intelligence to bond with and care for children. Things start off well as Cady and M3GAN form an instant connection. However, M3GAN begins to strongly defend Cady and the robot resorts to violence against those who question its tactics. It’s up to Gemma to shut down M3GAN or face severe casualties.

M3GAN - official trailer

The trailer includes M3GAN committing sinister acts like physically assaulting Gemma and wielding a knife toward unsuspecting employees. M3GAN creepily states it won’t let “anyone harm Cady ever again” before firing a nail gun into the hand of a woman and stomping on her head.

M3GAN is directed by Gerard Johnstone, the mind behind 2014’s Housebound, and written by Akela Cooper, who penned 2021’s Malignant. Me3GAN is based on a story by Cooper and James Wan, with the latter serving as a producer on the film alongside Jason Blum. The ensemble cast includes Ronny Chieng, Brian Jordan Alvarez, Jen Van Epps, Arlo Green, and Stephane Garneau-Monten.

In standard models, memory storage and computing take place in different parts of the machine, and data must move from its area of storage to a CPU or GPU for processing.

The problem with this design is that movement takes time. Too much time. You can have the most powerful processing unit on the market, but its performance will be limited as it idles waiting for data, a problem known as the “memory wall” or “bottleneck.”

When computing outperforms memory transfer, latency is unavoidable. These delays become serious problems when dealing with the enormous amounts of data essential for machine learning and AI applications.

As AI software continues to develop in sophistication and the rise of the sensor-heavy Internet of Things produces larger and larger data sets, researchers have zeroed in on hardware redesign to deliver required improvements in speed, agility and energy usage.

A team of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Engineering and Applied Science, in partnership with scientists from Sandia National Laboratories and Brookhaven National Laboratory, has introduced a computing architecture ideal for AI.

Co-led by Deep Jariwala, Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE), Troy Olsson, Associate Professor in ESE, and Xiwen Liu, a Ph.D. candidate in Jarawala’s Device Research and Engineering Laboratory, the research group relied on an approach known as compute-in-memory (CIM).

In CIM architectures, processing and storage occur in the same place, eliminating transfer time as well as minimizing energy consumption. The team’s new CIM design, the subject of a recent study published in Nano Letters, is notable for being completely transistor-free. This design is uniquely attuned to the way that Big Data applications have transformed the nature of computing.

“Even when used in a compute-in-memory architecture, transistors compromise the access time of data,” says Jariwala. “They require a lot of wiring in the overall circuitry of a chip and thus use time, space and energy in excess of what we would want for AI applications. The beauty of our transistor-free design is that it is simple, small and quick and it requires very little energy.”

The advance is not only at the circuit-level design. This new computing architecture builds on the team’s earlier work in materials science focused on a semiconductor known as scandium-alloyed aluminum nitride (AlScN). AlScN allows for ferroelectric switching, the physics of which are faster and more energy efficient than alternative nonvolatile memory elements.

“One of this material’s key attributes is that it can be deposited at temperatures low enough to be compatible with silicon foundries,” says Olsson. “Most ferroelectric materials require much higher temperatures. AlScN’s special properties mean our demonstrated memory devices can go on top of the silicon layer in a vertical hetero-integrated stack. Think about the difference between a multistory parking lot with a hundred-car capacity and a hundred individual parking spaces spread out over a single lot. Which is more efficient in terms of space? The same is the case for information and devices in a highly miniaturized chip like ours. This efficiency is as important for applications that require resource constraints, such as mobile or wearable devices, as it is for applications that are extremely energy intensive, such as data centers.”

In 2021, the team established the viability of the AlScN as a compute-in-memory powerhouse. Its capacity for miniaturization, low cost, resource efficiency, ease of manufacture and commercial feasibility demonstrated serious strides in the eyes of research and industry.

In the most recent study debuting the transistor-free design, the team observed that their CIM ferrodiode may be able to perform up to 100 times faster than a conventional computing architecture.

Other research in the field has successfully used compute-in-memory architectures to improve performance for AI applications. However, these solutions have been limited, unable to overcome the conflicting trade-off between performance and flexibility. Computing architecture using memristor crossbar arrays, a design that mimics the structure of the human brain to support high-level performance in neural network operations, has also demonstrated admirable speeds.

Yet neural network operations, which use layers of algorithms to interpret data and recognize patterns, are only one of several key categories of data tasks necessary for functional AI. The design is not adaptable enough to offer adequate performance on any other AI data operations.

The Penn team’s ferrodiode design offers groundbreaking flexibility that other compute-in-memory architectures do not. It achieves superior accuracy, performing equally well in not one but three essential data operations that form the foundation of effective AI applications. It supports on-chip storage, or the capacity to hold the enormous amounts of data required for deep learning, parallel search, a function that allows for accurate data filtering and analysis, and matrix multiplication acceleration, the core process of neural network computing.

“Let’s say,” says Jariwala, “that you have an AI application that requires a large memory for storage as well as the capability to do pattern recognition and search. Think self-driving cars or autonomous robots, which need to respond quickly and accurately to dynamic, unpredictable environments. Using conventional architectures, you would need a different area of the chip for each function and you would quickly burn through the availability and space. Our ferrodiode design allows you to do it all in one place by simply changing the way you apply voltages to program it.”

The payoff of a CIM chip that can adapt to multiple data operations is clear: When the team ran a simulation of a machine learning task through their chip, it performed with a comparable degree of accuracy to AI-based software running on a conventional CPU.

“This research is highly significant because it proves that we can rely on memory technology to develop chips that integrate multiple AI data applications in a way that truly challenges conventional computing technologies,” says Liu, the first author on the study.

The team’s design approach is one that takes into account that AI is neither hardware nor software, but an essential collaboration between the two.

“It is important to realize that all of the AI computing that is currently done is software-enabled on a silicon hardware architecture designed decades ago,” says Jariwala. “This is why artificial intelligence as a field has been dominated by computer and software engineers. Fundamentally redesigning hardware for AI is going to be the next big game changer in semiconductors and microelectronics. The direction we are going in now is that of hardware and software co-design.”

“We design hardware that makes software work better,” adds Liu, “and with this new architecture we make sure that the technology is not only fast, but also accurate.”

A new podcast that's entirely generated by Artificial Intelligence has attempted to show what Steve Jobs would sound like on the Joe Rogan show.

There's been a Fake Steve Jobs account on Twitter before, but a new podcast from Play.ht wants you to believe the man himself is alive and guesting on a Joe Rogan podcast.

Every word on podcast.ai's ""Joe Rogan interviews Steve Jobs"" is created by AI, which the developer says is an example of how artificial intelligence can learn about people.

""For example, the Steve Jobs episode was trained on his biography and all recordings of him we could find online so the AI could accurately bring him back to life,"" says the company's official site. ""At Play.ht, we believe in a future where all content creation will be generated by AI but guided by humans, and the most creative work will depend on the human's ability to articulate their desired creation to the machine.""

The podcast attempts to mimic what Jobs would say and sound like, and the results are mixed. If you don't happen to know either Rogan or Jobs's voices, you could initially believe they were said by humans, at least.

However, even the first moments of Jobs' dialog sounds like it is being pulled together from a small collection of stock phrases. The voice is identifiable as Jobs, but the rhythms and the cadence are off.

Still, this is just the first episode of what the company hopes will be a series of entirely AI-generated podcasts.

""We hope others are inspired by this work and start creating even more creative audio and video content using generative AI,"" says the company.",artificial intelligence,appleinsider

Podcast.ai describes how the process works.

Podcast.ai is a weekly podcast that explores a new topic in depth, entirely generated by artificial intelligence. The episodes are rendered using play.ht’s ultra-realistic voices, and transcripts are generated with fine-tuned language models. For example, the Steve Jobs episode was trained on his biography and all recordings of him we could find online so the AI could accurately bring him back to life.

The company explains why it chose Steve as the first “guest.”

We wanted to push the boundaries of what is possible in current state of the art speech synthesis, we wanted to create content that can inspire others to do the same, and there was no one who inspired and impacted the technology world more than Steve Jobs, that’s why in the first episode we brought his voice back to life.

The voices have a number of flaws. There’s a slight robotic edge to them, the intonation sometimes doesn’t match the content, and there’s not enough variation in the pacing. The laughter is also pretty terrible! All that said, it’s still remarkable how close the voices sound to the real thing when you aren’t actively listening for these things.

Describing the content as AI-generated is, I think, a real stretch. It’s very clear that the system is lifting the text of entire paragraphs from recordings, rather than generating completely new content. It’s effectively picking up on keywords and then looking for actual quotes on that topic, rather than truly generating new responses.

The impact, then, is that it sounds a bit like a collection of Steve soundbites rather than a real interview. Despite that, it’s still a somewhat eerie experience listening to it!

The company’s vision could certainly be said to be pushing the boundaries, though I’m not sure whether Steve would have approved of it.

At Play.ht, We believe in a future where all content creation will be generated by AI but guided by humans, and the most creative work will depend on the human’s ability to articulate their desired creation to the machine. We are building that future, starting by a major building block of it which is the emotional and expressive human-like synthetic speech generation and ability to clone any voice with perfect resemblance. We hope others are inspired by this work and start creating even more creative audio and video content using generative AI.

So far, AI systems are writing simple content with a predictable format, such as sports news and financial reporting, where names and numbers are plugged into a tried-and-tested template. But the idea of a future where “all content” is generated by AI seems as far-fetched as it is unappealing.

Register here.

Accelerating machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) development with optimized performance and cost is a key goal for Google.

Google kicked off its Next 2022 conference this week with a series of announcements about new AI capabilities in its platform, including computer vision as a service with Vertex AI vision and the new OpenXLA open-source ML initiative. In a session at the Next 2022 event, Mikhail Chrestkha, outbound product manager at Google Cloud, discussed additional incremental AI improvements including support for the Nvidia Merlin recommender system framework, AlphaFold batch inference and TabNet support.

Users of the new technology detailed their use cases and experiences during the session.

“Having access to strong AI infrastructure is becoming a competitive advantage to getting the most value from AI,” Chrestkha said.

Uber using TabNet to improve food delivery

TabNet is a deep tabular data learning approach uses transformer techniques to help improve speed and relevancy.

Chrestkha explained that TabNet is now available in the Google Vertex AI platform, which makes it easier for users to build explainable models at large scale. He noted that Google’s implementation of TabNet will automatically select the appropriate feature transformations based on the input data, size of the data and prediction type to get the best results.

TabNet is not a theoretical approach to improving AI predictions; it is an approach that shows positive results in real-world use cases already. Among its early implementers is Uber.

Kai Wang, senior product manager at Uber, explained that a platform his company created called Michelangelo handles 100% of Uber’s ML use cases today. Those use cases include ride estimated time of arrival (ETA), UberEats estimated time to delivery (ETD) and rider and driver matching.

The basic idea behind Michelangelo is to provide Uber’s ML developers with infrastructure on which models can be deployed. Wang said that Uber is constantly evaluating and integrating third-party components, while selectively investing in key platform areas to build in-house. One of the foundational third-party tools that Uber relies on is Vertex AI, to help support ML training.

Wang noted that Uber has been evaluating TabNet with Uber’s real-life use cases. One example use case is UberEat’s prep time model, which is used to estimate how long it takes a restaurant to prepare the food after an order is received. Wang emphasized that the prep time model is one of the most critical models in use at UberEats today.

“We compared the TabNet results with the baseline model and the TabNet model demonstrated a big lift in terms of the model performance,” Wang said.

Just the FAX for Cohere

Cohere develops platforms that help organizations benefit from the natural language processing (NLP) capabilities that are enabled by large language models (LLMs).

Cohere is also benefiting from Google’s AI innovations. Siddhartha Kamalakara, a machine learning engineer at Cohere, explained that his company has built its own proprietary ML training framework called FAX, which is now heavily using Google Cloud’s TPUv4 AI accelerator chips. He explained that FAX’s job is to consume billions of tokens and train models as small as hundreds of millions of parameters to as large as hundreds of billions.

“TPUv4 pods are some of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world, and a full V4 pod has 4,096 chips,” Kamalakara said. “TPUv4 enables us to train large language models very fast and bring those improvements to customers right away.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

If you think artificial intelligence (AI) is moving at a breakneck speed and it’s almost impossible to keep up, you’re not alone. Even if being on top of all things AI is part of your job, it’s getting increasingly hard to do that. Nathan Benaich and Ian Hogarth know this all too well, yet somehow they manage.

Benaich and Hogarth have solid backgrounds in AI as well as tons of experience and involvement in research, community- and market-driven initiatives. AI is both their job and their passion and being on top of all things AI comes with the territory.

Benaich is the general partner of Air Street Capital, a venture capital firm investing in Al-first technology and life science companies. Hogarth is a cofounder at Plural, an investment platform for experienced founders to help the most ambitious European startups.

Since 2018, Benaich and Hogarth have been publishing their yearly State of AI report, aiming to summarize and share their knowledge with the world. This ever-growing and evolving work covers all the latest and greatest across industry, research and politics. Over time, new sections have been added, with this year featuring AI safety for the first time.

Traditionally, Benaich and Hogarth have also been venturing on predictions, with remarkable success. Equally traditionally, we have been connecting with them to discuss their findings every year upon release of the report. This year was no exception, so buckle up and let the ride begin.

State of AI: Evolution

AI research is moving so fast, it seems like almost every week there are new breakthroughs, with commercial applications quickly following suit. Case in point: AI coding assistants have been deployed, with early signs of developer productivity gains and satisfaction.

Coding assistants

OpenAI’s Codex, which drives GitHub Copilot, has impressed the computer science community with its ability to complete code on multiple lines or directly from natural language instructions. This success spurred more research in this space, including from Salesforce, Google and DeepMind.

Codex quickly evolved from research (July 2021) to open commercialization (June 2022) with (Microsoft’s) GitHub Copilot now publicly available for $10/month or $100/year. Amazon followed suit by announcing CodeWhisperer in preview in June 2022.

Google revealed that it was using an internal machine learning (ML)-powered code completion tool, which Benaich and Hogarth note in the State of AI report could soon lead toward a browser-based AI-powered IDE (integrated development environment). Meanwhile, Tabnine has more than 1 million users, raised $15M and promises accurate multiline code completions.

Text-to-art

And if you think that is old news, or not massive enough, then how about some diffusion-powered AI art? In 2021, diffusion AI models were overtaking GANs, the previously dominant AI models for image generation, on a few benchmarks. Today, diffusion AI models are used to power the likes of DALL-E 2, Imagen, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, spreading to text-to-video, text generation, audio, molecular design and more.

This meteoric rise has given birth to both opportunities and open questions. It seems anyone can now create stunning imagery (and more) with the click of a button. Does that mean everyone is an artist now? Does that mean graphic designers will be out of work soon? And who owns the AI-generated art? These are just some of the questions that pop up, the answers to which seem to be “no,” “no,” and “we don’t know,” respectively.

Benaich pointed out the obvious: this is an evolving topic and it will take a while for people to figure it out. There will be goofs and controversies, like people winning art contests with AI-generated art, while others are forced to take down AI-generated images. Some art communities are banning AI art altogether, while some artists are not at all happy that their art is included in datasets used to train those AI models.

Benaich thinks we’ll see more formal partnerships between AI companies and generators of these models and corpus owners, especially large corpus owners. Ultimately, it’s a question about the incremental value of additional data points in this broad dataset:

“It’s not clear that an individual contributor to a broad dataset really moves the needle on model performance and to what degree can an individual really influence this debate,” said Benaich. “Or would there have to be an en masse demand to not have work be present in a training dataset to influence this question of ownership?” Long term, he said, “If these systems are trained on everyone’s data, they shouldn’t necessarily be owned by a single party.”

Hogarth, for his part, noted that the economic model around monetization and ownership is currently massively in flux, as a result of alternatives that are popping up fast. “If you were planning to have an API that monetizes a generative image model and you have that behind a paywall, and then suddenly there’s an open-source project that offers the same quality experience in a self-service, non-commercial way, you’re going to see a real tension,” he noted.

Similar questions have also been raised for the case of AI coding assistants. This points toward a so-called “distributed” modus operandi for AI. What remains beyond question, as Benaich and Hogarth’s work in the State of AI report reveals, is the dominant player in the hardware used to generate AI models for all types of applications: Nvidia.

State of AI: Distribution

Compute infrastructure, the substrate that’s enabling all the progress in this field, as Benaich put it, is also seeing lots of innovation. However, he went on to add, despite the fact that there has been a lot of investment and willingness in the community to try and dislodge Nvidia as the giant in this space that powers everybody, that has not really happened.

Nvidia is still the AI hardware leader

It has always been hard to put numbers on that feeling, but this is precisely what Benaich and Hogarth tried to do this year. They scanned academic and open-source AI literature for papers that mentioned the use of a specific hardware platform to train the models that they reported in the results. They enumerated those papers and the results were both expectable and impressive.

What Benaich and Hogarth’s work showed was that the chasm between the sum of papers that mentioned using any form of Nvidia hardware and papers using TPUs or other hardware created by the top five semiconductor companies is sometimes 100 times or 150 times in favor of Nvidia. This, Benaich noted, hasn’t really changed that much in the last few years.

Nvidia has had a head start compared to the competition and they certainly made the best of it. Nvidia has created a massive ecosystem and partnerships around its hardware, investing heavily in its software stack as well. Nvidia also shows a startup-like attitude despite being the incumbent, as Benaich noted. They keep improving their hardware, using techniques such as ML to design new architectures, and their latest H100 generation of GPUs is said to bring a 10 times improvement in performance over their previous A100.

The tipping point for other challengers

On the other hand, GPUs come with certain baggage, as they were never really designed to accommodate AI workloads. It’s easier to innovate if you build something from the ground up and you don’t have backward-compatibility to worry about. That may well mean that eventually there will be a tipping point at which the challengers will start seeing substantial adoption.

Benaich was adamant: “I would like to see that happen. I think the industry would like that, too. But the data doesn’t suggest that. I think the question is always — how much better can a new design be and how much better does it have to be if its software is less well understood and the learning curve is higher? And you’re also fighting with a massive install-base that many companies already have.”

Benaich added that it’s “a really hard uphill battle” that has been fought for at least five years. “We would have thought that the chasm would be narrower than where it is if the future would actually look more distributed than pure Nvidia,” he said. “Despite there being a busting up of centralized ownership of models at the software layer, that hasn’t really happened at the hardware layer.”

This “busting up of centralized ownership” that Benaich spoke of at the software layer is another takeaway from the State of AI report. As Benaich noted, the last couple of years the central dogma in ML has been that of centralization. The hypothesis was that the entities that will profit and advance the most are those that can acquire the most resources, whether that’s money, talent, compute or data.

While that still rings true in many ways, it’s also being challenged. For example, Meta concluded that “while the centralized nature of the [AI] organization gave us leverage in some areas, it also made it a challenge to integrate as deeply as we would hope.”

Distributed research collectives

What we have been seeing in the last 12 months or so, Benaich added, is that there is an emergence of what he called “distributed research collectives” such as Adept, Anthropic, Inflection, Luther and Cohere. Benaich referred to these as being “broadly defined as either not even companies, or Discord servers that emerge, or nonprofit institutions or startups that are fundamentally open source.”

Benaich and Hogarth see those as another pole to do AI research, specifically work that focuses on diffusing and distributing inventions in centralized labs to the masses incredibly quickly. The report includes various examples of open-source alternatives for models — including text-to-image, language and biology models — being released faster than anyone expected.

Benaich believes that this will become the norm: first, closed-source models will appear and then within a matter of a year we’ll start seeing the first open-source models. He thinks this grants access to a broader community of people that otherwise wouldn’t participate [in AI]:

“That is because to get jobs in some of these big tech companies, you need to have a Ph.D., you need to be extremely technically literate and check certain boxes. These open-source collectives care a lot less about that. They care more about the value of each person’s contribution and the contributions can be different,” he said. At the same time, which ones of those initiatives can be viable and how, exactly, is an open question.

There are lots of dynamics at play there. Top-tier talent from the Googles and DeepMinds of the world is breaking loose and becoming entrepreneurial. At the same time, investment in startups using AI has slowed down in 2022 compared to 2021, along with the broader market, but is still higher than 2020. Investment in the USA accounts for more than half of the worldwide venture capital and unicorns, while private valuations are on the rise.

State of AI: Safety

Last but not least, the somewhat forward-looking introduction of AI safety. The report’s section on AI safety starts by quoting AI pioneers like Alan Turing and Marvin Minsky, who warned about the dangers of machine intelligence surpassing human capabilities as early as the 1950s.

AI safety is currently used as an umbrella term that captures the general goal of making powerful AI systems aligned with human preferences and values, as Hogarth noted. Some of the challenges are nearer term, such as taking a computer vision system used by law enforcement and trying to understand where it exhibits bias. Benaich and Hogarth included work on related topics in previous years.

Preventing AI armageddon with alignment

What’s new in 2022, and what made Benaich and Hogarth dedicate an entire section to AI safety, is the other end of AI safety. This is what Hogarth referred to as AI alignment: ensuring that an extremely powerful and superintelligent AI system doesn’t ever go rogue and start treating humanity badly in aggregate. The 2022 State of AI report is very much biased toward that end of safety because, according to Hogarth, the topic is not receiving enough attention.

“We’re seeing exponential gain in capabilities, exponential use of compute, exponential data being fed into these [AI] models,” Hogarth said. “And yet we have no idea how to solve the alignment problem yet.” It’s still an unsolved technical problem where there are no clear solutions, he added: “That’s what alarms me — and I think that the thing that is probably the most alarming about all of it is that the feedback loops now are so violent. You have huge wealth creation happening in AI. So there’s more and more money flowing into making these models more powerful.”

There’s more geopolitical awareness of the significance of this and there’s competitive dynamics between countries accelerating, he went on, as well as more social prestige. “You get kudos for working at DeepMind or OpenAI,” he said, “so there’s a lot of these powerful feedback loops that are kicking in and making the systems [have] more increasing capabilities at a greater rate and we don’t have the same feedback loop starting to kick in on safety.”

It’s a forward-looking concern, but the thinking in the report seems to be “better safe than sorry.” Many AI researchers share Hogarth’s concern as well. The report quotes a recent survey of the ML community, which found that 69% believe AI safety should be prioritized more than it currently is.

A separate survey of the NLP community was also quoted, which found that a majority believe AGI (artificial general intelligence) is an important concern we are making progress toward. Over 70% believed AI will lead to social change at the level of the Industrial Revolution this century, and nearly 40% believed AI could cause a catastrophe as bad as nuclear war during that time.

The report’s key findings are that AI safety is attracting more talent and funding, but remains relatively neglected and underfunded. Some initial progress had been made toward alignment, via approaches such as learning from human feedback, red-teaming, reverse-engineering neural networks and measuring moral behavior in artificial agents.

Focusing on the AGI angle

The State of AI report also highlights Conjecture, which it notes is the first well-funded startup purely focusing on AGI alignment. Conjecture is a London based startup, led by Connor Leahy, who previously cofounded Eleuther – the organization that kicked off decentralized development of large AI models.

Conjecture operates under the assumption that AGI will be developed in the next five years, and on the current trajectory will be misaligned with human values and consequently catastrophic for our species. It has raised millions from investors, including the founders of GitHub, Stripe and FTX.

Of course, all of that only makes sense if you believe that we are moving toward AGI. Not everyone shares this belief. Different schools of thought are aptly exemplified by Meta’s Yann LeCun, and prolific AI scholar, author and entrepreneur, Gary Marcus. Besides the debate on how AI could move forward, Hogarth finds that Marcus’s criticism of the capabilities of AI models is “extremely unhelpful … kind of the opposite of ringing the fire alarm.”

Hogarth believes that in order to carve a safe path toward the advancement of AI, there should be more funding of AI safety, as well as some regulatory oversight. He mentioned gain-of-function research as an example of research that is only allowed under certain conditions and AI should be modeled after. For Hogarth, the distinction of what should be regulated cannot be done on the basis of applications, as all applications have potential for misuse, but rather on the basis of capabilities: anything above a certain threshold should be subject to scrutiny.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Watch for their articles in the Data Pipeline.

As the global datasphere continues to grow, companies of all sizes — from startups to enterprises — are aggressively migrating to the modern data stack and leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics to gain insights across key business functions. The shift has been rapid and such that the global market for big data analytics alone is expected to touch $68 billion by 2025.

Now, while this is good for business, the growth in the volume of data and the number of data consumers is also creating a complex data environment. Essentially, data teams are having a hard time managing complex data pipelines, covering aspects such as data quality, discoverability, reliability, cost and governance.

During their stints with various data companies, Dan Mashiter and Martin Sahlen also encountered similar challenges. As a data engineer, Sahlen was frustrated at learning of errors in the data pipelines via Slack, when it was already too late, while Dan, as a data consumer, found it increasingly difficult to trust data, with metrics looking off and dashboards breaking.

They both traced the problem down to poor tooling for tracing data lineage and identifying errors and inefficiencies that affected data quality.

Alvin to the rescue

To address the challenge, the duo came up with Alvin, a plug-and-play data lineage platform that lets enterprises map their entire data architecture — starting from how the data is connected to how it is transformed and how it is consumed — to track data quality inefficiencies.

Today, Alvin announced it has raised $6 million in a seed round of funding.

The core technology behind Alvin’s toolkit, which also launches today, automatically builds and maintains a highly accurate graph dataset representing the connections between columns, tables, dashboards, SaaS platforms and people. Then, using this dataset, the platform gives teams an automated way to detect and trace pipeline errors/bugs, reducing data downtime. It also automates regression testing, providing a detailed report of downstream impact before code deployment, as well as cost optimization by identifying unused assets and pipelines and safely removing them.

“By automatically mapping data flows within and across systems, and how it is consumed throughout the business, Alvin is building the operating system for the modern data stack. Alvin gives data teams the tools to measure and improve the key metrics they will now be judged on, and ultimately maximize their impact,” Mashiter said.

Impact analysis on Alvin platform.

The solution connects to enterprise data tools in minutes and starts producing the graph dataset to trace lineage and address data quality issues. It saw organic interest from over 400 companies in the beta stage and is already in use by many of them, Mashiter told VentureBeat.

“Using Alvin, companies succeeded in significantly reducing the time they spent on important data engineering workflows such as removing unused data assets and diagnosing pipeline errors. Alvin has already secured [its] first commercial contracts ahead of [its] full product launch,” he added.

Heated data quality space

A number of companies are already looking at data quality issues, including Monte Carlo, Datafold and Altan. However, as Mashiter said, most of these players see automated data lineage tracing as an added capability.

“Whilst other companies see data lineage as a feature where 70% accuracy and manual curation is acceptable, we see it as the foundational dataset needed to solve many of the challenges facing modern data teams. The accuracy of the automated lineage and usage dataset we are able to generate is market-leading, allowing us to tackle the operational use cases our competitors can’t,” he said.

With this round of funding, which was led by Project A Ventures, the company plans to expand its engineering team and strengthen its product. The roadmap for the platform includes increasing the number of tools it can integrate with to serve more companies and become more integrated into data pipelines and workflows; building out SDKs and CLIs to help engineers build their own tooling and pipelines on top of Alvin; and expanding the feature set of the product, particularly in the area of observability.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

The challenge of assuring identity is becoming more and more difficult. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), there were almost 1.4 million reports of identity theft in 2021.

In an era where identity theft is so common and passwords are openly sold on the dark web, biometric authentication is becoming critical for verifying user’s identities.

Biometric authentication providers like IronVest, which today announced it has closed a $23 million seed funding round led by Accomplice, are turning to biometric authentication and artificial intelligence (AI) to verify the identity of users online.

IronVest’s solution provides enterprises with a biometric password manager, and uses AI to continuously verify employee identities post-login to ensure security. The approach provides enterprises with a definitive response to account takeovers, credential theft and social engineering attempts.

Stopping identity theft with AI

With upwards of 15 billion passwords exposed on the dark web per year, it’s becoming increasingly clear that traditional login credentials aren’t effective at keeping out unauthorized users.

“Consumers and employees increasingly face sophisticated cyberattacks such as SimSwap, business email compromise, personal info theft/identity theft, and malware, all designed to enable fraudsters to take over their accounts,” said Avi Turgeman, cofounder and CEO of IronVest.

Turgeman added that, “Enterprise approaches to security focus on protecting the infrastructure and network, but not the employee. Password managers are designed for convenience, not as a security solution — they can be easily bypassed. As a result, the number one reason for data breaches is compromised account credentials.”

IronVest aims to address these challenges by eliminating critical vulnerabilities in enterprise defenses, by decreasing reliance on passwords in favor of biometric authentication factors, which can’t be harvested by threat actors. The vendor’s biometric authentication is based on a proprietary technology called AuthenticAction.

AuthenticAction uses decentralized biometric AI and other capture techniques to guarantee the authenticity of users’ digitally performed actions, and monitors user activity post-login for signs of malicious activity. This means it can detect if an attacker starts to act maliciously, like by harvesting sensitive data.

Evaluating the biometric authentication market

Biometric authentication is emerging as an increasingly popular solution for addressing the rise in identity theft, with researchers anticipating the biometric system market will grow from $42.9 billion in 2022 to $82.9 billion by 2027.

Even traditional password management providers like LastPass have started to experiment with biometric authentication, enabling enterprises to combine two-factor authentication against extra biometric authentication steps.

Elliott Management’s private equity firm and Franceso Partners spun out LastPass after taking its parent company, LogMeIn private for $4.3 billion in December 2021.

Another competitor setting its sights on biometric authentication is identity access management (IAM) provider Okta, which offers integration with HYPR to provide passwordless authentication. The company recently announced raising $383 million in revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022.

Despite the competitive landscape, Turgeman believes that IronVest’s proprietary biometrics AI differentiates it from other password management providers on the market, as it is not just able to secure online accounts — but also a user’s digital identity.

“We believe tools that manage passwords are not sufficient to truly protect employees from fraudulent account access,” Turgeman said. “IronVest is focused on protecting the individual and on being more secure than the accounts it protects.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Register here.

DALL-E 2 is coming to Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service by invitation, allowing select Azure AI customers to generate custom images using text or images. The company made the announcement today at Microsoft Ignite 2022, a conference for developers and IT professionals.

“Mattel is actually already using this for their Hot Wheels cars,” said John Montgomery, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s Azure AI platform. “Designers can actually give it prompts and quickly get ideas and tweak modifications.”

A Microsoft blog post gave an example of Mattel designers typing in a prompt such as “a scale model of a classic car” and DALL-E 2 will generate an image of a toy vintage car, perhaps silver in color and with whitewall tires. Then, the designer could erase the top of the car and type, “Make it a convertible” and DALL-E 2 will update the image of the car as a convertible, and then tweak it to add “pink top.”

In the blog post, Carrie Buse, director of product design at Mattel Future Lab, said she sees artificial intelligence (AI) technology such as DALL-E 2 as a tool to help designers generate more ideas.

“Ultimately, quality is the most important thing,” she noted. “But sometimes quantity can help you find the quality.”

The Azure OpenAI Service is currently available in preview with limited access and has been used by customers and partners to access powerful GPT-3 models for common use cases including writing assistance, natural language-to-code generation and parsing data.

Microsoft says it added a responsible AI layer

Adding DALL-E 2 to Azure OpenAI Service will allow customers to generate creative content backed by Azure’s cloud AI infrastructure, enterprise-grade security and compliance features. Microsoft also claims its built-in responsible AI features will help prevent DALL-E 2 from delivering inappropriate outputs.

The company says it removed images from the model training dataset that contain sexual or violent content. It also maintains Azure OpenAI’s filters remove harmful content from prompts and prevent DALL-E 2 from creating images of celebrities and religious objects, as well as “objects that are commonly used to try to trick the system into generating sexual or violent content.”

On the output side, the Azure AI team added models that remove AI-generated images that appear to contain adult, gore and other types of inappropriate content.

“We’re taking the model, putting it on Azure and bringing all the enterprise credibility and technologies we have there — the security, the compliance, the regional rollouts, everything else, we’re adding a layer around it, kind of our responsible AI,” said Montgomery. “OpenAI has its layers and then we have additional layers on top.”

Addressing DALL-E ownership issues

The Microsoft blog post also emphasized that the Azure OpenAI Service terms today “does not claim ownership of the output of these services.” Other than for its acceptable use policies, “Microsoft’s terms do not restrict the commercialization of images generated by these services, although customers are ultimately responsible for making their own decisions about the commercial usability of images they generate.”

Those comments come as users and experts continue to raise questions about who owns DALL-E images. When OpenAI announced expanded beta access to DALL-E in July, the company offered paid subscription users full usage rights to reprint, sell and merchandise the images they create with the powerful text-to-image generator. And in late September, OpenAI announced that the research laboratory was removing the waitlist for its DALL-E beta, allowing anyone to sign up — citing improved safety systems and lessons learned from real-world use.

Bradford Newman, who leads the machine learning and AI practice of global law firm Baker McKenzie, in its Palo Alto office, said the answer to the question “Who owns DALL-E images?” is far from clear. And, he emphasized, legal fallout is inevitable.

“If DALL-E is adopted in the way I think [Open AI] envisions it, there’s going to be a lot of revenue generated by the use of the tool,” he told VentureBeat in August. “And when you have a lot of players in the market and issues at stake, you have a high chance of litigation.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Using artificial intelligence (AI) as part of a larger business process can often be a complicated exercise.

That was the experience that Gero Keil and Thilo Hüllmann had as they were trying to build a tool focused on creating ease for sales professionals, by using AI to help with lead generation and validation. The process wasn’t easy, and the two developers realized there was a need for a tool that is accessible by non-technical people to build intelligent business workflows.

“We started building out some initial tooling that would make our own lives easier,” Keil told VentureBeat. “As we spoke to other companies in our network, we realized that having a platform that makes it very simple to build machine learning models and integrate them into the business workflow is something that actually a lot of companies would benefit from.”

Keil and his cofounder, Hüllmann, have developed the Levity no-code automation platform, which provides organizations with a modular approach to building business workflows. The company announced today that it has also raised $8.3 million in seed funding. A beta version of Its platform is now available.

Using AI blocks to enable a modular approach

The concept of no-code tooling is gaining widespread adoption across the IT landscape. With no code, rather than an organization needing to have developer skills to write application code, instead, there is a visual interface that enables users to build an application without coding.

There is no shortage of vendors using some form of no-code or low-code approach to enable different aspects of AI. For instance, Cogniteam, has a platform for robotics and the company Regie, uses a low-code approach to enable a sales and marketing content creation service.

Levity provides its users with AI blocks, which provide a modular set of capabilities that can be used to build out an application workflow. Keil explained that an AI block is a component that enables a user to create a deep learning model based on their own data. The models have all been pre-trained, but can be fine-tuned by users as needed.

While there is an opportunity to fine-tune the AI models, a large part of what Levity also does is educate its users so they understand what can be accomplished.

“More than 95% of our users do not have any technical background with AI,” Keil said. “We produce quite a good amount of educational pieces that you help inform people of what’s possible and what isn’t.”

How to build an AI workflow with Levity

Levity has a focus on business workflows and how to automate them.

Keil explained that a user can use Levity to build out basic and advanced workflows.

A basic workflow can be for email sorting such that when an email arrives in Gmail the AI block will automatically read that email and its attachments, figure out what should be done with the email and then put it into the proper cloud storage folder or in the right system. Going a step further, Levity’s no-code interface provides integrations with multiple tools including Zapier and Make (formerly Integramat) for automation.

Levity can also be used to help an organization automate the process of sorting through support tickets in different systems, including Zendesk and Intercom. The AI block approach has a pre-trained model that enables users to identify urgency and sentiment to help sort and prioritize issues.

Among the more unique use cases where Levity is being used, in one case an organization is actually using its system to help automate a lab process.

“We have one customer who automates a laboratory process where they analyze dog poop samples,” Keil said. “In their case, their workflows are a bit different than most customers.”

He explained that what is similar across all use cases though is that organizations will bring their own data and decide which labels they want Levity’s system to automatically identify. Once that data is loaded, the user clicks on a button that says ‘train model.’ Then, when the user is confident that the model works as expected, it can be integrated into whatever workflow an organization needs.

Looking forward, Keil said that Levity will be expanding the AI blocks to support more capabilities and integrations.

“As of today, the platform covers text, image and document classification,” he said. “We’re aiming to introduce new types of AI blocks on our platform that can solve different kinds of tasks and expand the range of AI technologies that are simple for people to use.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat
16,Vectara’s AI-based neural search-as-a-service challenges keyword-based searches,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-search_search-engine_connected_network_1400992296-e1665532643283.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,12/10/2022,"Vectara, formerly ZIR AI, has emerged from stealth with $20M in seed funding, offering AI-based neural search-as-a-service technology.",https://venturebeat.com/ai/vectaras-ai-based-neural-search-as-a-service-challenges-keyword-based-searches/,"To further strengthen our commitment to providing industry-leading coverage of data technology, VentureBeat is excited to welcome Andrew Brust and Tony Baer as regular contributors. Watch for their articles in the Data Pipeline.

Is there a better way to build a search tool that produces more highly relevant results than just using keyword-based techniques?

That’s one of the many questions that former Google staffers Amr Awadallah (CEO), Amin Ahmad (CTO) and Tallat Shafaat (chief architect) wanted to solve with their new startup, which has been in stealth under the name ZIR AI. Today, ZIR AI is emerging from stealth under the name Vectara, with the help of $20 million in seed funding, and availability of the company’s neural search-as-a-service technology.

The foundational premise of Vectara is that artificial intelligence (AI)-based large language models (LLMs) combined with natural language processing (NLP), data integration pipelines and vector techniques can create a neural network that is useful for multiple use cases, including search.

“At the heart of what we have built is a neural network that makes it very simple for any company to tap that power and do something useful with it,” Awadallah told VentureBeat. “Large language models and neural networks have transformed how we understand the meaning behind text and the first offering that we’re launching is neural search-as-a-service. “

How Vectara combines multiple AI techniques into something new

LLMs and neural networks in general use vectors as a foundational element. “One of the key elements of doing large language models and neural network inference is a vector-matching system in the middle,” he said.

Awadallah explained that neural networks input information, and the output of the network are the vectors that represent the learnings that the neural network generates. He stressed that Vectara’s platform isn’t just about analyzing vectors, rather his company’s platform covers the whole data pipeline.

There are multiple vendors in the market today that provide vector-database technologies such as Pinecone. A vector database is only one part of what Vectara is providing.

Awadallah explained that when a user issues a query, Vectara uses its neural network to convert that query from the language space, meaning the vocabulary and the grammar, into the vector space, which is numbers and math. Vectara indexes all the data that an organization wants to search in a vector database, which will find the vector that has closest proximity to a user query.

Feeding the vector database is a large data pipeline that ingests different data types. For example, the data pipeline knows how to handle standard Word documents, as well as PDF files, and is able to understand the structure. The Vectara platform also provides results with an approach known as cross-attentional ranking that takes into account both the meaning of the query and the returned results to get even better results.

From big data on Hadoop to neural search-as-a-service

Vectara isn’t the first startup that Awadallah has helped to get started; he was also a cofounder of Hadoop provider Cloudera back in 2008. There are lessons learned from his experiences that are helping to inform decision-making at the new startup.

One of the lessons he has learned over the years is that it’s never a good idea to build technology just for the sake of technology. Awadallah emphasized that Vectara’s neural data processing pipeline is powerful and could be used for different applications. They chose search to start with at Vectara because it’s a challenge that faces a large number of organizations.

“We wanted to start with a problem that everybody has that needs to be solved in a good way,” Awadallah said.

Awadallah and his cofounders all had experience at Google, where LLMs and the use of transformer techniques have been used. He explained that with a transformer, it’s possible to better understand context to get a better result for a query. With a transformer, a system doesn’t just understand the meaning of a given word, it also understands how the word relates to other words in that sentence, and in the previous sentence, and then the following sentence, to get the right context.

“We did this at Google,” he said. “We know how to properly fine-tune the parameters to get the best outcome for our customers, and that’s truly what differentiates us.”

Search is only the first service for Vectara. Awadallah said that his company will add new services over time, with likely future candidates including providing recommendations, as well as tools to help users surface related topics.

“The Industrial Revolution was about how we make stuff with our hands and now we’re helping people to build things with stuff that is coming out of their brains,” Awadallah said. “That’s the foundation of this pipeline that we’re building, which is a neural network pipeline that allows you to process and extract value out of data.”",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

Welcome to the AI Beat – my new column digging into some of the week’s artificial intelligence (AI) news and attempting to put it into context.

When I asked Gartner analyst Sid Nag yesterday why this week’s AI-related cloud news released at Google Cloud Next and Microsoft Ignite seemed like a “tsunami” of product announcements, he chuckled.

While neither of us had our cameras on for the interview, I could feel Nag, who focuses on cloud services and technologies, nodding sagely. “I think I know why that is,” he said.

I certainly needed some expert guidance. After all, I’ve been on the AI beat at VentureBeat for six months now, but I have yet to fully adjust to the seasonal PR routines of Big Tech – in fact, this week’s barrage was of the sort that always reminds me of this comic from The Oatmeal.

There were announcements at Google Cloud Next ranging from its new Vertex AI Vision service, a computer vision-as-a-service capability, to a new AI Agents service and the open-source OpenXLA project. There were also additional incremental AI improvements announced at Next, including support for the Nvidia Merlin recommender system framework, AlphaFold batch inference and TabNet support.

Next came a boatload of Azure AI news out of Microsoft Ignite bucketed around productivity, including prebuilt AI models available in Form Recognizer, expanded summarization and language support in Azure Cognitive Services, new features in speech-to-text and text-to-speech, and the debut of DALL-E 2 as part of Azure’s OpenAI Service, by invitation only.

Using AI to make cloud an intelligent platform

The Big Tech cloud providers, Nag explained – Google, Microsoft and AWS are the top three, IBM and Oracle round out the top five – have gone past the era of commoditized infrastructure capabilities, such as compute storage and networking, with a new goal of making the entire infrastructure more intelligent and predictable. The new trend, he said, is applying AI to those infrastructure needs.

“I think the pedestrian use of AI has become more pervasive, which is something I’ve been pushing for the past three or four years with the hyperscalers,” he said.

Big Tech, he explained, wants to use AI effectively up and down the cloud stack to make the cloud an intelligent platform, as well as applying a layer that democratizes AI and brings it to the business user.

Lots of ingredients, but no clear recipe

The problem with so many cloud announcements about AI-related capabilities, however, is that Big Tech isn’t properly communicating how to combine those capabilities intelligently, Nag pointed out.

“If I want to cook chicken parmesan,” he explained, “which ingredients do I need and what proportion of those ingredients? What’s the recipe I should be using? I think there’s a lot of things being announced by cloud providers, but they should really up-level the game as to how you can use those things intelligently to drive outcomes.”

Fear of falling behind in a multicloud era

The Big Tech AI announcements coming so close together – Oracle is on deck for next week at Cloud World, teasing AI news with Nvidia – is no accident, Nag said.

“Nobody wants to fall behind,” he said. “Historically, Google has been ahead of the game in the AI business; it’s almost like Microsoft and others are feeling the heat.”

In an era of multicloud – where an organization uses a combination of clouds to distribute various applications and services – the battle for customers looking to employ sophisticated AI systems has become fiercer than ever.

“[Multicloud] is the biggest use case we see today,” said Nag. Historically, workloads and applications moving to the cloud were the low-hanging fruit of things like email applications, Office 365, CRM or ERP. Now, however, organizations are moving heavy-duty, complex applications to the cloud.

“They’re moving the core crown jewels,” he explained. “For example, if I’m a hedge fund in downtown Manhattan and I have a specialized application written to do algorithmic trading, that’s what I depend on to layer up on my competition because executing trades in nanoseconds matters.”

A cloud AI war for best-in-class

As that starts to happen, CIOs and IT leaders look for best-in-class components to service that workload – so in addition to a primary cloud vendor, an organization might bring on a secondary or tertiary provider.

“It’s not that the primary vendor doesn’t have the other componentry, but they may or may not be best in class,” he said, adding that once the secondary vendor gets a foot in the company’s door, it might look to expand its services.

With companies worldwide expected to spend an estimated $494.7 billion on cloud computing this year, according to Gartner, up 20% from 2021, and spending predicted to reach $600 billion by the end of 2023, there’s a lot of potential money at stake. And Nag told the Wall Street Journal [subscription required] in April that it’s the “willingness of CIOs to purchase higher-valued features that is fueling public cloud spending growth.”

Rohit Kulkarni, an analyst at MKM, weighed in on this topic in a research note last week [subscription required]. He said he is “convinced that we are on the cusp of accelerating Big Tech AI wars,” though it is unclear who holds the early edge when it comes to commercial success.

But he said that he is certain about one thing: “Commercial rollout of AI apps requires significant storage and computing resources, thus public cloud vendors could benefit from a strong usage tailwind over the next several years.”

Register here.

Synthetic data will be a huge industry in five to 10 years. For instance, Gartner estimates that by 2024, 60% of data for AI applications will be synthetic. This type of data and the tools used to create it have significant untapped investment potential. Here’s why.

Synthetic data can feed data-hungry AI/ML

We are effectively on the cusp of a revolution in how machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can grow and have even more applications across sectors and industries.

We live in an era of skyrocketing demand for ML algorithms in every aspect of our lives, from fun face-masking applications such as filters on Instagram or Snapchat to deeply useful applications designed to improve our work and living experiences, such as assisting in diagnosing illness or recommending treatment. Among the prime opportunities are emotion and engagement recognition, better homeland security features and better anomaly detections in industrial contexts.

At the same time, while people and businesses are hungry for ML/AI-based products, algorithms are hungry for data to train on. All of that means we will inevitably see more and more different data needs, and entirely manufactured data is the key.

From Grand Theft Auto to Google

Heard about self-driving cars learning the rules of the road by playing games like Grand Theft Auto V to study virtual traffic? That was an early version of ML through synthetic data. Similarly, many in tech may have come across synthetic “scanned documents,” which have been used to train text recognition and data extraction models.

Banking and finance is one sector that already leans heavily on synthetic data for certain processes, while tech giants like Google and Facebook are also using it, drawn by the extraordinary efficiency it can bring to the work of project managers and data scientists.

In fact, we expect to see the number of synthetic images and data points increasing tenfold over the next year and by many hundred-fold in the next few years.

Constraints of real-world data

Those at the cutting edge of ML are increasingly turning to synthetic data to circumvent the numerous constraints of original or real-world data. For instance, company Synthesis AI offers a cloud-based generation platform that delivers millions of perfectly labeled and diverse images of artificial people. Synthesis AI has been able to accomplish many challenges that come with the messy reality of original data. For a start, the company makes the data cheaper. It can be too expensive for an organization to generate the quantity and diversity of data it needs.

For example, could you get photos of someone from every conceivable angle, wearing every possible combination of clothing in every possible light condition? It would be an unimaginable amount of work to do that in real life, but synthetic data can be designed to account for endless variations.

That also means much easier labeling of data. Imagine trying to pinpoint the source of light, its brightness, and its distance from an object in photos to train a shadow development algorithm. It would be pretty much impossible. With synthetic data, you have that data by default, because it was generated with such parameters.

Furthermore, companies must also contend with stringent restrictions on the use of real-world data. In the past, companies have shared data without the layers of cybersecurity expected now. GDPR and other data regulations make it complex and challenging, and sometimes illegal, for companies to share real-world data with partners and vendors.

In other cases, it may not be even possible or safe to generate the data. The real-time 3D engine producer Unigine counts as a client Daedalean, which is working on urban flying mobility. Daedalean has started to train its autonomous flying cars in Unigine virtual worlds. This makes complete sense — it doesn’t yet have a safe real-world environment in which to test its products extensively and generate the deep datasets it needs. A similar case is CarMaker software by IPG Automotive. Its 10.0 release introduced upgraded 3D visualization powered by UNIGINE 2 Sim, featuring physically-based rendering and real-world camera parameters.

Synthetic people and synthetic objects have been much more widely used by tech giants recently. Amazon used synthetic data to train Alexa, Facebook acquired synthetic data generator AI.Reverie, and Nvidia realized NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator, a powerful synthetic-data-generation engine that produces physically simulated synthetic data for training deep neural networks.

Combating bias in data

The challenges of real-world data don’t end there. In some fields, huge historical bias pollutes data sets. This is how we end up with global tech behemoths running into hot water because their algorithms don’t recognize black faces properly. Even now, with ML technology experts acutely aware of the bias issue, it can be challenging to collate a real-world dataset entirely free of bias.

Even if a real-world dataset can account for all of the above challenges, which in reality is hard to imagine, data models need to be improved and tweaked constantly to stay unbiased and avoid degradation over time. That means a constant need for fresh data.

Understanding the opportunity

Synthetic data is in the relatively early stages of growth and it’s not a panacea for every use case. It continues to face technical challenges and limitations, and the tools and standards for it have not yet been standardized.

Nonetheless, synthetic data is definitely an accelerator for ML/AI-based products as they continue to expand into every industry and sector, and we’ll certainly see a lot of new companies and deals in the area.

LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - China is using its financial and scientific muscle to manipulate technologies in a manner that risks global security, Britain's top cyber spy will say on Tuesday, warning that Beijing's actions could represent ""a huge threat to us all.""

In a speech, Jeremy Fleming, director of the GCHQ spy agency, will say that the Chinese leadership was seeking to use technologies such as digital currencies and its Beidou satellite navigation network to tighten its grip over its citizens at home, while spreading its influence abroad.

""They seek to secure their advantage through scale and through control,"" Fleming will say in the annual security lecture at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, according to extracts released by his office.

""This means they see opportunities to control the Chinese people rather than looking for ways to support and unleash their citizens' potential. They see nations as either potential adversaries or potential client states, to be threatened, bribed, or coerced.""

The remarks are Fleming's latest public warnings about Beijing's behaviour and aspirations. Last year, he said the West faced a battle to ensure China did not dominate important emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and genetics.

Fleming will say the Chinese leadership was driven by a fear of their own citizens, of freedom of speech, of free trade and open technological standards and alliances, ""the whole open, democratic order and the international rules-based system.""

That fear combined with China's strength was driving it ""into actions that could represent a huge threat to us all,"" he will say.

A spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry said the claims had ""no basis in fact"".

""China's financial and technological development is aimed at making a better life for the Chinese people, and is not aimed at anyone and does not constitute a threat. Harbouring a China threat theory and provoking confrontation is both detrimental to others and harmful to oneself,"" the spokeswoman told reporters.

Fleming will also highlight technologies where he says China is seeking to gain leverage, such as its development of a centralised, digital currency to allow it to monitor the transactions of users, as well as to possibly evade the sort of sanctions Russia has faced since its invasion of Ukraine.

He will also point to Beidou, China’s answer to the U.S.-owned GPS navigation system.

""Many believe that China is building a powerful anti-satellite capability, with a doctrine of denying other nations access to space in the event of a conflict,"" he will say. ""And there are fears the technology could be used to track individuals.""

Oct 11 (Reuters) - As online gaming platform Roblox Corp (RBLX.N) confronts a lawsuit alleging it enabled a California girl's exploitation, its chief scientist said finding dangerous content in the company's virtual world is nothing like spotting it in video.

""It's such a challenge to moderate 3D,"" said Morgan McGuire in an interview at the Reuters Momentum conference in Austin on Tuesday. He had no comment on the recent lawsuit but said Roblox was built with safety and civility at the forefront.

San Mateo, Calif.-based Roblox is deploying bots to patrol user-generated games and press buttons to detect any dangerous content that players have disguised.

""This is more like shutting down speakeasies,"" he said, referring to U.S. prohibition-era bars hiding from law enforcement.

BBC reported this year that users had created explicit private spaces, known as ""condos,"" where people's digital avatars could engage in virtual sex.

McGuire said the company is able to remove inappropriate content within minutes thanks to artificial intelligence software and moderators. What escapes scrutiny is not ""horrifically bad"" but more likely a terms violation, he said.

Still, a lawsuit filed last week alleges that adult men on Roblox connected with a girl, who was born in 2009, and nudged her to sign up for Discord, Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) Snapchat and Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Instagram to talk to them. The suit alleges they pushed her to drink, abuse prescription drugs and send explicit images, later precipitating suicide attempts.

McGuire said Roblox bars users from posting phone numbers or off-platform links. But as momentum grows to connect disparate worlds into an alternate digital reality called the metaverse, Roblox is engaging with a consortium of companies about how they could work together in the face of different standards, he said.

""A real challenge when we start looking at the open metaverse concept is that we want to be able to preserve what we've built and not just allow anything to come into our platform,"" he said.

Efforts to ease the workloads of peer reviewers by using artificial intelligence (AI) are gathering pace — with one country’s main research-evaluation exercise actively looking into ways of harnessing the technology.

A study commissioned by the United Kingdom’s main public research-funding bodies is examining how algorithms can assist in conducting peer review on journal articles submitted to the UK’s Research Excellence Framework (REF).

The researchers using AI to analyse peer review

The REF, a national quality audit that measures the impact of research carried out at UK higher-education institutions, is a huge undertaking. In the latest iteration, the results of which were published in May 2022, more than 185,000 research outputs were evaluated from more than 76,000 academics based at 157 UK institutions. The results will determine how approximately £2 billion (US$2.2 billion) of funding is distributed among UK institutions each year.

The next REF is expected to take place in 2027 or 2028, and the new study will test whether AI could make the process less burdensome for the hundreds of referees involved in judging research outputs.

The funders that carry out the REF handed over peer-review data from just under 150,000 scientific papers to Mike Thelwall, a data scientist at the University of Wolverhampton, UK. These papers had been evaluated as part of the latest REF. Such data, outlining scores given to individual journal articles, are usually destroyed. But the funders — Research England, the Scottish Funding Council, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and the Department for the Economy, Northern Ireland — gave Thelwall and his colleagues access first.

What’s the score?

Thelwall ran various AI programs on the data to see whether algorithms could yield scores similar to the ratings that REF peer reviewers gave the journal articles. The AI programs base their calculations on bibliometric data, and metadata including keywords in abstracts, titles, and article text.

“We’re looking at whether the AI [programs] could give information that the peer reviewers would find helpful in any way,” Thelwall says. For instance, he adds, AI could perhaps suggest a score that referees could consider during their assessment of papers. Another possibility, Thelwall notes, is AI being used as a tiebreaker if referees disagree strongly on an article — similarly to how REF panels already use citation data.

It seems “incredibly obvious and plausible” that AI should have a role in the REF process, says Eamon Duede, who studies the use of AI technologies in science at the University of Chicago in Illinois. “It’s just not entirely clear what that role is.” But Suede disagrees that AI should be used to assign scores to manuscripts. “I think this is a mistake.”

‘Papermill alarm’ software flags potentially fake papers

Anna Severin, a health consultant in Munich, Germany, who has used AI to analyse the peer-review process itself, goes further: “I don’t think AI should replace peer review,” or parts of it, she says. Severin, who works at management consultancy Capgemini Invent, worries that people could become overly reliant on algorithms and misuse AI tools. “All the administrative tasks and the processes surrounding and supporting the actual peer-review process — that’s really an area where AI and machine learning could help with reducing workload.”

One possible application of AI could be to find suitable peer reviewers — often a difficult task, and one fraught with biases and conflicts of interest. Recent analyses have shown that researchers are increasingly declining peer-review requests. This is especially true of a select minority who are constantly bombarded with such requests.

Thelwall says that although it is theoretically possible to use AI to find referees, this was not in the remit of his current project. “Some of the panel members, particularly the chairs, spend a lot of time allocating individual panel members to the outputs,” he notes.

AI has previously been used to streamline peer review and make it more robust. For example, some journals have implemented statcheck — an open-source tool developed by researchers in the Netherlands that trawls through papers and flags statistical errors — in their peer-review process. Some publishers are also using software to catch scientists who are doctoring data.

Backlash

Algorithms have also been used to measure the rigour of scientific papers and the thoroughness of peer-review reports. But some efforts, such as using AI models to predict the future impact of papers, have drawn a fierce backlash from researchers — partly owing to a lack of transparency about how the technology works.

Thelwall agrees that the inner workings of AI systems are often not transparent, and are open to abuse through manipulation, but he argues that conventional peer review is already opaque. “We all know that reviewer judgments for journals often diverge quite a lot.”

Thelwall’s results will be released in November. The UK funders then plan to decide early in 2023 how to proceed with future REF exercises, on the basis of the study’s findings.

Catriona Firth, associate director for research environment at Research England, says that whatever the outcome, it is important that use of AI does not simply place more burdens on the REF process. “Even if we could do it and even if it were robust, would it actually save that much time by the time you trained up the algorithm?” She adds: “We don’t want to make things any more complicated than they need to be.”",artificial intelligence,nature.com

We trust Siri to give us directions, are happy to use a self-checkout at the supermarket, and the introduction of driverless cars is eagerly awaited by many, yet it seems bank customers are not ready to accept investment advice from artificial intelligence bots.

Banks have been investing heavily in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, with virtual bots frequently replacing human service staff in customer-controlled self-service.

This has led to the growth of robo-advisers, which are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven financial advice with little or no human supervision. In the U.S. alone, it is projected robo-advisers will soon be managing over $1 trillion of Americans' wealth.

A study by Griffith University researchers, titled ""Man vs Machine,"" has assessed the faith customers had in computer-generated investment advice, and found that while things like opening an account and depositing smaller amounts (up to around $1,000) were seen as acceptable, when the amount increases customers are more likely to demand that a human is involved.

The study is published in the International Journal of Bank Marketing.

Lead author Dr. Gavin Northey said there were some notable advantages to AI.

""Artificial intelligence reduces the chance of human error, it reduces judgment bias and it gives greater forecasting accuracy and precision,"" he said. ""Even though it may offer equally good, if not better, financial advice, consumers tend to consider the performance of AI as inferior to that of a human expert provider.""

Co-author Vanessa Hunter emphasized that the doubt becomes a lot more apparent in higher risk environments.

""Even though technology is so ubiquitous, there's still that mistrust of AI and those Terminator sort of storylines,"" she said.

""Thinking back to when airlines introduced self-baggage drop, or supermarkets brought in self-checkouts, people embraced it to an extent, but there still needs to be a person nearby to guide people through the technology.

""We're incredibly social creatures. We want human interaction when risk is involved.

""The irony here, is the humans are using the same technology. They use the AI to form and provide their considered opinion.""

In what's likely to be a multi-billion if not multi-trillion-dollar industry for digital online banking, Hunter suggests banks will need to be very careful with how they project themselves as being technologically based.

""It is sort of counter-intuitive considering where we're at in terms of digital marketing and online use, but the data shows customers, in particular wealthier investors, lose trust in the bank and are less willing to invest if they are only offered AI advice.""

Register here.

Bad actors have learned: The more data they’re able to harvest about you, the more likely they’ll be able to successfully phish you. Which is probably why this attack vector has never been more popular.

Proofpoint’s 2022 State of the Phish report revealed that 83% of organizations suffered a successful email-based phishing attack in 2021, a 46% increase compared to 2020. Seventy-eight percent of companies faced a ransomware attack that was propagated from a phishing email, while 86% of businesses experienced bulk phishing attacks and 77% sustained business email compromise (BEC) attacks.

Global phishing attacks climbed 29% over the past 12 months to a record 873.9 million attacks, according to the latest Zscaler ThreatLabz Phishing Report, and there was a record number of phishing attacks (1,025,968) in the first quarter of 2022, per the Phishing Activity Trends report from the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). But things are getting even more complicated.

Scammers are now taking and ingesting every bit of breached data found on the internet and combining it with artificial intelligence (AI) to target and attack users. This practice has some of the largest companies in the world more worried than ever before as the level of sophistication in phishing attempts grows. The scary part? There’s an increase in successful phishing and ransomware payouts, and the AI being used isn’t even that smart yet.

The evolution of phishing

At its core, social engineering is about tugging at a user’s emotional heartstrings to elicit a response that, ultimately, gets them to fork over personal information like passwords, credit card information and more.

Unsophisticated phishing attacks in the form of emails, texts, QR codes, etc. are typically easy to spot if you know what to look for. Grammatical errors, typos, suspicious links, fake logos, and “from” email addreses that don’t match the credible source they’re pretending to be are dead giveaways.

These attacks were often done in mass, targeting millions of people to see who would bite. But bad actors evolved — and so did their tactics.

Hackers started using AI to target individuals in a more intelligent manner. Messages from your “IT department” that incorporated information about your job or a customized and direct spear phishing attack — which included your actual password — telling you your account had been compromised are perfect examples.

Now, once again, bad actors are taking things a step further.

The AI phishing revolution

Hackers love and hoard data. But the data they value the most is breached data — and not just the information they’ve personally breached or ransomed. Threat actors love every bit of data that’s ever been leaked on the dark web.

Data breaches can tell hackers everything from your mother’s maiden name to your date of birth to your previous passwords to even your personal interests. While this probably isn’t anything you haven’t already heard, what has changed is the way scammers are using this information.

Bad actors are now combining this data with AI to target users with incredibly sophisticated phishing attacks that are more convincing than ever. And they’re doing this with AI that isn’t even that smart — yet.

AI can’t diverge from its pre-programmed path, so we don’t have to worry about it thinking for itself. But as people grow smarter, they can make more sophisticated models and train AI to run more complex scenarios. As the level of sophistication increases, all signs point to a future where phishing looks a lot like targeted ads.

Targeted ads meet targeted phishing

It’s nearly impossible to avoid ads these days. They pop up everywhere based on your browsing, search, and social media history. It’s gotten to the point where we joke about advertisers knowing what you want before you know you want it.

How long before attackers get this advanced? How long before a market intelligence firm gets breached, and hackers use the same data used by advertisers to phish you? Near real-time targeted phishing campaigns is not some distant concept; it’s on the horizon.

Imagine searching for Super Bowl tickets, and within minutes, there are phishing emails in your inbox offering you VIP Super Bowl experiences. This is the real and immediate threat AI poses — and we’re inching closer and closer to that reality.

The future of phishing

AI and machine learning (ML) are currently being used to systemically bypass all our security controls. The attacks are occurring at a level and sophistication that no human — or group of humans — could pull off without a little (artificial) intelligence.

If you think bad actors need to build some brilliant self-realized AI hacking bot to achieve these goals, you’d be mistaken. They simply need to create an AI smart enough to interpret and manipulate specific sets of data in specific scenarios — which is exactly what criminal hackers and nation-state actors are actively doing to target and compromise people and organizations.

AI isn’t nearly as high-tech as some think, yet it can still be used to take advantage of unsuspecting individuals. By combining AI and breached data, hackers are creating more targeted and sophisticated phishing campaigns and finding greater success.

AI and ML have rewritten the rules and changed the phishing game, and there’s no turning back. If we don’t address this now, the game will quickly get out of reach.

Here’s more from our top five tech stories of the week:

Report: 81% of IT teams directed to reduce or halt cloud spending by C-suite



According to a new study from Wanclouds, 81% of IT leaders say their C-suite has directed them to reduce or take on no additional cloud spending as costs skyrocket and market headwinds worsen.



As organizations move forward with digital transformations they set out on at the beginning of the pandemic, multicloud usage is becoming increasingly unwieldy, and costs are difficult to manage across hybrid environments.



Visibility and tracking of cloud spending is also being challenged by the industry’s embrace of hybrid and multicloud infrastructure, which can be complex to manage.

Google introduces passwordless authentication to Chrome and Android with passkeys



Google announced that it is bringing passkeys to Chrome and Android, enabling users to create and use passkeys to log into Android devices. Users can store passkeys on their phones and computers, and use them to log in password-free.



The announcement comes after Apple, Google and Microsoft committed to expand support for the passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium in March of this year.

How JetBlue’s integrated use of Snowflake and Fivetran is a model for the modern data stack



Commercial airline company, JetBlue, is using the integrated Snowflake data stack to power insights into its customer services and operational activities.



The company’s a tight grip on the vast amounts of data it holds is crucial for the airline. Its data team turns information into insight by using a combination of Snowflake’s Data Cloud and Fivetran’s data integration service.



This combination represents the modern data stack. Data management is a complex challenge, and information comes from multiple directions and myriad sources. So, any attempt to turn both structured and unstructured data into useful insight requires a broad collection of techniques and technologies.

Google giving computer vision an ‘easy’ button

Vertex AI was first launched by Google in May 2021 as a fully managed cloud AI service. Over the past year and a half Google has been incrementally expanding the service’s capabilities to help organizations with specific use cases.

Computer vision is among the most common types of AI use cases, providing image recognition capabilities that can be used for different applications. With its new Vertex AI Vision services, Google is providing its users with a managed service to help more easily build and deploy computer vision.

“This [Vertex AI Vision] is a fully managed service for computer vision applications that allows you to automatically analyze video streams and pictures and detect objects,” Gerrit Kazmaier, VP and GM of database, data analytics and Looker at Google said during a press briefing. “Basically giving all of our customers the ability to build advanced machine learning applications in a very streamlined way.”

The goal of making it easier for organizations to benefit from AI is also behind Google’s AI Agents initiatives. With AI Agents, Google is building out specific ‘agents’ which are purpose-built services for a specific function that are powered by Google AI technologies. At Google Cloud Next 2022, the company is announcing one such AI Agent with the new Translation Hub service. Kazmaier explained that the Translation Hub service will provide users with the ability to take documents and translate them into up to 135 different languages.

“Translation Hub basically builds on this idea of using AI and machine learning to make knowledge more accessible and widespread,” Kazmaier said. “Think about a company [and] the ability that you gain from this to understand and serve markets in different languages alive, so we are really excited about making translation more accessible to the world with the Translation Hub.”

Open-source machine learning moves forward with OpenXLA

Google is also using the Next 2022 event as a venue to highlight how it can also work with others in the AI and ML community.

“Google is collaborating with a number of open-source AI frameworks with industry experts, including AMD, Arm, Intel, Meta, Nvidia and others as part of our shared commitment to unite the AI ecosystem, helping customers avoid platform or model locking,” Sachin Gupta, VP and GM, of infrastructure at Google Cloud said during a press briefing.

The collaboration is occurring via the new OpenXLA project, which Gupta said has the goal of helping to reduce the cost and complexity of ML deployment. The way OpenXLA will help is by addressing the issue of fragmentation that is seen across ML infrastructure today. Gupta said that with an open community of contributors, OpenXLA is developing a modular compiler and infrastructure tools to help accelerate AI development.

“Our long-term commitment to open ecosystems is grounded in the belief that no one company should own AI and ML innovation,” Gupta said.",artificial intelligence,venturebeat

The world today is inundated with a remarkable volume of data. The problem: Humans are not equipped to process it all. The solution: the blend of human expertise and technology. Now more than ever, humans and machines have the opportunity to seamlessly work together to create lasting efficiency — especially at work. Deemed the augmented workforce, the integration of humans and technology allows employees to streamline processes and implement more efficiency to drive better outcomes and consistent outputs, all while reducing human error at scale.

The augmented workforce is gathering speed, causing many organizations to reconsider how to plan for future growth, organize work and design jobs. Advancements in technology will only continue to accelerate, and it is up to organizations to embrace and understand the concept of the augmented workforce to reap the benefits and meet the demands of employees.

As more organizations seek to benefit from the augmented workforce, its success is contingent on presenting data and using artificial intelligence in a way that empowers organizations while also gaining employees’ trust. For widespread acceptance, we must strike a balance between leveraging the very best qualities of AI, natural language generation (NLG) and other deep learning technologies, without losing the human touch.

Empowering data to replace repetitive tasks

Storing the copious amounts of data that organizations are bogged down with is no longer a problem and highly skilled data science teams are able to process and analyze it, but where many organizations struggle is actually interpreting what’s valuable and putting it into action. Too often, data science teams “crunch the numbers,” hand off a deck full of “findings” to managers, and say “Here, put this into action!” without much guidance beyond that.

In an optimized augmented work environment, however, organizations seek to do more than just learn from data, but to actually empower it to make their day-to-day work more efficient. For example, advanced organizations use modern NLG to automate repetitive tasks, like reports that are slow and costly to write but have to be written often.

CEOs and other top executives typically demand reports from various departments, on a weekly or even on-demand basis, detailing performance, market changes and other key data crucial to business successes. Typically, members of the analysis team are tasked with processing the data and typing up the report, but when NLG is plugged into the big data tool, it can act as a last-mile solution to explain the analysis of the data, in an easy-to-read, written narrative.

Turning data into decisions

By automating manual and time-consuming processes through data, organizations across a myriad of industries can transform how their businesses operate as a whole, saving valuable time and allowing employees to focus on more important and strategic work. For instance, financial industry analysts at investment firms and banks spend a great amount of time analyzing incredibly large datasets before drafting detailed written reports that are then used to make business decisions.

In reality, the true value is actually in the comprehensive insights pulled from the data, and everything on the way to those insights is just a waste of time. Augmenting financial reports provides decision-makers with the information they need to drive business while freeing up employees to tackle more productive tasks, as opposed to processing data to get to those key takeaways.

Data drives products to market

An augmented work environment also gets products to market faster, which in some industries can have life-saving implications. Pharmaceutical corporations rely on generating Clinical Study Reports for new drug approval. This tedious process takes weeks or even months. So leading brands like Eli Lilly and others are supplementing the process with NLG, aiming to reduce the time it takes to bring new drugs or vaccines to the market.

NLG has developed far beyond the chatbots of early days and is now able to automate the generation of complex reports at high standards of quality, accuracy and consistency, so that employees can make much better use of their time.

Debunking myths associated with augmentation

In order for employees to effectively utilize automation, organizations must provide the transparency, resources and training needed to understand these technologies. Transparently explaining the augmented workforce will help employees understand their designated roles and provide peace of mind around robots replacing their jobs. Understanding that there may be a learning curve is essential for the overall growth and success of the employees and structure of the organization.

One of the most common myths is that workforces use augmented technologies solely to reduce overhead costs, while workforces are really seeking additional support to streamline processes and put employee productivity at the forefront. Augmentation does not mean replacements, it means reinforcements.

With that, many tend to think that transitioning to an automated workforce is difficult to learn, understand and deploy. However, the benefits can well outweigh any concerns, given proper resources, enough time to retrain, and transparent expectations. It is important to remember that AI technologies are only truly effective when combined with human intelligence.

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/10/12/ai-shows-what-the-kardashians-would-look-like-without-plastic-surgery/,"A group of live streamers used artificial intelligence (AI) to show what they believe the Kardashians would look like “without plastic surgery.”

The online streamers behind Twitch show, Vandahood Live were curious to see whether AI technology could successfully predict what Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Khloe Kardashian, and Kourtney Kardashian would look like if they had kept their original faces.

Vandahood Live’s clip which showed AI technology’s depiction of the famous family “without plastic surgery” amassed over 2.5 million views on TikTok. The streamers, who come from visual effects backgrounds in both video and 3D, say it took a week to create the video.

“We used three different AI software and two different standard graphics software and a full week to pull it off,” Keith from Vandahood Live tells PetaPixel.

“We had to take a different approach for each member of the family since each one underwent different changes over the years.”

“For Kylie we used Deep Face Lab and for two days trained an AI model of her face pre-surgery and set it to match the proportions of her current face. And then in Adobe After Effects, we manually reduced her cheek filler as they went outside the portions of her “before” face,” he says. “Then lastly we ran it through DaVinci Resolve to grade and match her original skin tone.”

“For Khloe we again used Deep Face Lab and trained an AI model of her face pre-surgery and set it to match the proportions of her current face. Then ran a few frames through Faceapp to generate her original fuller cheeks then ran those frames through another AI called Ebsynth to apply it to the whole video,” adds Keith. “And then again DaVinci Resolve for the original skin tone.”

Keith adds “For Kim and Kourtney, we trained them on Deep Face Lab and did some minor corrections and skin tone corrections in DaVinci Resolve.”

Vandahood, Keith, Ahmad, and Divy Pota, like “to push the limits of AI for entertainment” on their show Vandahood Live.

They say their AI experiment with the Kardashians “was really just out of curiosity and to see how well the tech could pull it off. In the comments section of the TikTok video, there has been all these debates on the Kardashians’ influence and people either going against or defending them. But for us it wasn’t that deep, it was all only for entertainment purposes,” he says.

“It’s still very early days for AI and it still has a long way to go but the future of entertainment is most certainly going to be AI heavy,” adds Keith. “This new world of AI has made it possible to do things that were impossible only a few years ago. It feels like every month there’s a new AI tool being released that can do incredible things.”

32,How one professional athlete is helping IBM encourage people to embrace a new era of data,https://i.insider.com/63444ecfca56b80019f332de?width=1200&format=jpeg,14/10/2022,AI can help fantasy football enthusiasts make informed decisions about their rosters.,https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/how-one-pro-athlete-is-embracing-a-new-era-of-data,"By Noah Syken, Vice President of Sports and Entertainment Partnerships at IBM

For the last six years, IBM has been working with ESPN to infuse AI-generated insights into its fantasy football platform. But we needed someone who could help us tell the story — someone who could grab the attention of fantasy football enthusiasts, introduce them to the artificial intelligence of Watson, and encourage them to embrace the era of data-driven decision making. So we asked a guy that has a lot in common with IBM: Eli Manning.

Let me explain. Back in 2016, IBM formed a partnership with ESPN. In this relationship, we use IBM's advanced analytics and AI capabilities to analyze the massive amount of data produced by fantasy football. We then serve up insights that help guide the roster decisions of ESPN's fantasy football users. Today, those insights take the form of two features:

Trade Analyzer with IBM Watson , which uses AI to analyze player statistics and media commentary to help team managers understand the value of a potential trade.

, which uses AI to analyze player statistics and media commentary to help team managers understand the value of a potential trade. Player Insights with IBM Watson, which helps fantasy managers estimate the potential upside and downside of a matchup, analyze boom or bust chances, and assess injuries.

IBM is in the fantasy football business for two reasons. First, we're solving a very real business problem for a valued partner. Fantasy football is a critical form of digital engagement for ESPN, and one that requires constant innovation to stay ahead of the competition. And Watson's insights make the platform more fun and engaging.

The second reason is that ESPN Fantasy Football offers IBM a powerful platform to demonstrate our AI capabilities to 11 million people. Both Trade Analyzer and Player Insights are produced by transforming vast quantities of data into insights that inform decision-making. We're analyzing the performance statistics of all 1,900 players in the league. But the numbers don't always tell the whole story. So we're also using the natural language processing capability of Watson Discovery to mine insights from millions of blogs, articles, and podcasts produced by media experts. Last year alone Watson served up more than 34 billion AI-powered insights to ESPN fantasy players.

When Eli Manning joined the New York Giants back in 2004 as the number one pick in the draft, many Giants fans thought he would be the second coming of Joe Namath: a big star in the big city. But Manning was more subtle than that. There were no flashy fur coats or movie-star girlfriends. Just an understated, workman-like grit that produced two championships.

So what does that have to do with IBM? It has been 17 years since IBM sold its ThinkPad business to Lenovo. That was the last time our iconic ""eight-bar"" logo appeared on a consumer-facing device. But despite this lack of visibility, our work has never been more consequential than it is today. It's not flashy, but our technology and expertise support the operation of the most mission-critical systems on the planet: electrical grids, airlines, telecommunications networks, banks, government services, and many others.

Technologies like hybrid cloud and AI are powerful, complex, and often difficult for people to comprehend. They operate behind the scenes, in data centers and back offices. But they are critically important to our clients and the world. That's why we showcase the work of IBM Consulting through partnerships like the Masters, the US Open, and ESPN's Fantasy Football. And that is why Eli Manning is helping us tell our story.

33,2 Tech Stocks to Consider Buying Over NVIDIA,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/providers/stocknews/hero-image-stocknews-436960.jpeg,10/10/2022,"Semiconductor companies, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), are struggling amid the market downturn, export restrictions, and slowing demand. However, the broader technology market is expected to endure short-term uncertainties and...",https://stocknews.com/news/nvda-csco-hckt-2-tech-stocks-to-consider-buying-over-nvidia/,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) provides graphics, computation, and networking solutions globally. On October 7, new restrictions were imposed on chipmakers, including NVDA, to prevent technology from advancing China’s military power. The companies must now obtain a license from the Commerce Department to export advanced chips and chip-making equipment.

The above restrictions have closely followed last month’s announcement in which the White House blocked NVDA from exporting high-end graphics chips to China due to similar concerns. The company said the ban impacted $400 million in potential sales to China.

For the fiscal 2022 second quarter, NVDA’s non-GAAP net income and EPS declined 50.7% and 51% year-over-year to $1.29 billion and $0.51, respectively. Also, analysts expect its EPS and revenue for the fiscal 2023 third quarter (ending October 2022) to come in at $0.71 and $5.85 billion, indicating a 39.3% and 17.6% year-over-year decline, respectively. The stock has plummeted 59.9% year-to-date.

The recently released jobs data for September seems to have paved the way for another significant interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve during its meeting next month. This indicates another headwind for tech companies.

Despite the current headwinds, demand for ubiquitous tech goods and services is expected to keep growing amid the increasing adoption of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), the internet of things (IoT), and increasing automation of business processes.

The global technology market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 25.7% over the next five years to reach $3.17 billion by 2027, with the United States expected to strengthen its leadership in this space.

Hence, we suggest investing in fundamentally strong technology stocks Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) and Hackett Group Inc. (HCKT) instead of NVDA for better risk-adjusted returns.

The company operates through three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).

On October 5, CSCO announced an expansion of its existing SD-WAN partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) to allow customers to sidestep the public internet and MPLS to send their Cisco SD-WAN traffic over the latter’s Azure cloud backbone. This is expected to add value by providing speed and cost benefits.

For the fiscal year 2022 ended July 31, CSCO’s revenue increased 3.6% year-over-year to $51.6 billion, while its operating income increased 8.9% year-over-year to $13.97 billion. The company’s non-GAAP net income increased 3.7% year-over-year to $14.10 billion, which translates to an EPS of $3.36, up 4.3% year-over-year.

Analysts expect CSCO’s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year 2023 to increase 5% and 5.1% year-over-year to $54.11 billion and $3.53, respectively. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, surpassing the consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.

Over the past month, CSCO’s stock slumped 9.6% to close the last trading session at $40.27.

CSCO’s overall B rating equates to a Buy in our POWR Ratings system. The POWR Ratings assess stocks by 118 different factors, each with its own weighting.

HCKT believes the new service will be a powerful and attractive value proposition for all C-level executives and their respective teams.

HCKT’s total revenue increased 3.7% year-over-year to $75.93 million for the second quarter of 2022. The company’s total assets stood at $217.89 million as of July 1, 2022, compared to $207.54 million as of December 31, 2021.

Analysts expect HCKT’s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year 2022 to increase 6.6% and 10.4% year-over-year to $297.20 million and $1.45, respectively. Also, the company has surpassed the consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.

HCKT’s stock has slumped 2.4% over the past month to close the last trading session at $19.05.

HCKT’s promising outlook is reflected in its overall POWR Rating of A, which translates to a Strong Buy in our proprietary rating system. It also has a grade of A for Sentiment and Quality and a B for Value and Stability.

But far too often, marketers spend their time performing repetitive, robotic tasks that could be better handled by software.",https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/artificial-intelligence-lead-generation#article,"Marketing is about reaching people. But far too often, marketers spend their time performing repetitive, robotic tasks that could be better handled by software.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to substantially change this. According to research from McKinsey, the marketing and sales sectors have the largest possible benefit from implementing AI-based solutions in the coming years, with up to $2.6 trillion in increased value.

Here are three ways modern marketers are using artificial intelligence (AI) tools to create more effective lead generation strategies and get them back to what they do best: Connecting with people.

How to Leverage AI for Lead Generation

Artificial intelligence makes marketers more efficient by shortening the time it takes to move from research to outreach. AI tools can be trained to spot patterns and draw conclusions that might otherwise need a human expert to spotlight.

1. Create Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) that match your biggest wins.

When your sales team wins a deal, the next logical move is to go after similar accounts. But replicating that ideal customer and tracking down best-fit, lookalike prospects can be a slog. AI software can dramatically speed up this process by analyzing closed-won (and closed-lost) opportunities and generating a profile that can be matched against your contact database for strong lookalikes.

For example, say your sales team just closed on a medium-sized business in the SaaS industry that has 50+ salespeople, uses Salesforce, and is located on the East Coast. AI can take these attributes (and others) to create a target list of lookalike accounts.

This process works for buying committee members, too. If most of your customer buying committees consist of marketing directors at enterprise-sized companies who use Marketo, AI can identify that trend and provide you with a dynamic list of prospects who fit the criteria of an ideal buyer.

To accomplish this, you need the right tech at your disposal. Tools like ZoomInfo’s RevOS platform, with its database of over 100 million company records, can automatically analyze your past deals, identify similarities between them, build your buyer persona, provide a list of lookalikes, and create a targeted account universe.

If you're already a ZoomInfo customer, click here to get 20% off HubSpot products.

Automated demographic, firmographic, and technographic data all play a part in drawing your absolute best-fit accounts — which means you can spend time crafting a compelling message instead of conducting research.

2. Personalize your campaigns with up-to-date data.

Professionals who run account-based marketing campaigns know that one size definitely does not fit all. How can they cover all the angles of a large buying committee without spending too much time trying to qualify their prospective leads?

The answer is buying signals. With a modern, AI-driven marketing platform, marketers can be alerted when a target account has significant changes that might inform, alter, or elevate their ABM approach:

A prospect gets a new round of investment : They're likely to be greenlighting budgets for new or upgraded tools, so tailor your ABM campaigns accordingly.

: They're likely to be greenlighting budgets for new or upgraded tools, so tailor your ABM campaigns accordingly. A new executive is hired, or an internal champion gets promoted : Now's the time to strike with an ABM campaign that targets a new leader who is likely reassessing their team's contract.

: Now's the time to strike with an ABM campaign that targets a new leader who is likely reassessing their team's contract. A target account visits your website: With real-time insight into the companies visiting your site and which pages they landed on, you can quickly send a targeted message while you're still top of mind.

There are dozens of different types of buying signals that can inspire personalization.

For example, Rocks & Gold sends real-time alerts of B2B companies in buying mode based on their history of hiring dynamics. This includes when a prospect, customer, or stale deal:

Starts growing or decreasing in company size

Makes leadership changes

Announces a new fundraising round

This type of insight gives you a competitive advantage by helping you customize your message to speak directly to the circumstances that make them a good fit right now.

3. Use intent data that illuminates the last mile of prospect interest.

You know which accounts you’d like to target. You have the campaigns that will resonate with their buying committee. But timing is everything — are they ready to hear your value proposition right now?

Intent data answers that question. By using AI-driven systems that can match corporate IP addresses and user profiles to web data, marketers can be aware when a prospect is actively in the market.

How does it work? Say a prospect account visits your website and downloads your marketing content on a pretty predictable but relatively rare basis. As the second quarter is coming to a close, that company is suddenly filling out lots of forms and engaging with your how-to videos. An AI-powered intent data system connects those dots — and elevates the significance.

On top of that, it connects the dots outside of your website. Say your company sells project management software. Intent data can track which companies are searching for terms like “project management vendors” or “project management software free trial” and consuming content on external websites — including your competitors.

If a current customer is searching these terms, it could be an indication of future churn and you can get ahead of the problem. If it’s an ideal prospect, it indicates a level of interest in making a purchase and enables you to target them with relevant content.

There are many tools that track and monitor intent-based keywords in HubSpot’s partner ecosystem. Benefits include:

Market clarity : Gain a clearer understanding of whom to target and how or when to engage with them

36,Live Brain Cells in Dish Quickly Learn to Play Pong - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/bbcaddc588de816699c3bdba9b456b26f267a3f8/hub/2012/07/27/6bf8ce27-f0e8-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/california-extreme-7469.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=630&width=1200,12/10/2022,"And those gaming cells could teach us a lot about ""synthetic biological intelligence,"" potentially helping us to unlock mysteries of the brain.",https://www.cnet.com/science/live-brain-cells-in-dish-quickly-learn-to-play-classic-game-pong/,"Scientists have created a gamer -- out of cells, in a lab.

An Australian-led team of researchers placed 800,000 live human and mouse brain cells into a dish, connected them to electrodes and a simulation of the classic game Pong. The scientists then watched as the mini-mind quickly taught itself the game and improved the more it practiced. They were able to follow along by converting the cellular responses into a visual depiction of the game that looks much like the original.

They call their system DishBrain, and say it proves neurons in a dish could learn and display basic signs of intelligence. The team details the new setup, dubbed synthetic biological intelligence, or SBI, in a study published Wednesday in the journal Neuron.

Eventually, the authors say, SBI could help unlock longstanding mysteries of brain mechanics and lead to better treatments for certain neurological conditions. ""DishBrain offers a simpler approach to test how the brain works and gain insights into debilitating conditions such as epilepsy and dementia,"" says Hon Weng Chong, chief executive officer of biotech start-up Cortical Labs.

SBI could also offer an alternative to animal testing, which is often how scientists go about studying the viability of new drugs and therapies.

""We now have, in principle, the ultimate biomimetic 'sandbox' in which to test the effects of drugs and genetic variants -- a sandbox constituted by exactly the same computing (neuronal) elements found in your brain and mine,"" adds co-author Professor Karl Friston, a theoretical neuroscientist at University College London.

Artificial vs. biological intelligence

The study team found that biological intelligence, aka living brain cells, behave pretty differently than a computer might in terms of AI.

""In the past, models of the brain have been developed according to how computer scientists think the brain might work,"" says Brett Kagan, chief scientific officer of Cortical Labs and a co-author of the study. ""That is usually based on our current understanding of information technology, such as silicon computing... But in truth we don't really understand how the brain works.""

Interestingly, DishBrain naturally learned to play Pong out of an apparent tendency toward acting on its environment in ways that make it more predictable and less random. In other words, this system behaves much more like a real live brain than AI does.

For example, when DishBrain successfully returned the ""ball"" in Pong, that resulted in the system being able to better predict where it would move next. If DishBrain failed, it would lose the point and a new point would begin with the computer releasing a ball from a random starting place, and so on. Because DishBrain uses a feedback loop, it seems to get progressively better the more it plays.

""This is remarkable because you cannot teach this kind of self-organization, simply because -- unlike a pet -- these mini brains have no sense of reward and punishment,"" Friston adds.

Now Cortical Labs, an Australian biotech startup, is working on a new generation of biological computer chips to create a generalized form of SBI that, as the team writes in its study, ""may arrive before artificial general intelligence due to the inherent efficiency and evolutionary advantage of biological systems.""

""We know our brains have the evolutionary advantage of being tuned over hundreds of millions of years for survival,"" explains co-author Adeel Razi of Monash University. ""Now, it seems we have in our grasp where we can harness this incredibly powerful and cheap biological intelligence.""

The researchers also tried the system on other simple games.

""You know when the Google Chrome browser crashes and you get that dinosaur that you can make jump over obstacles (Project Bolan),"" Kagan says. ""We've done that and we've seen some nice preliminary results, but we still have more work to do building new environments for custom purposes.""

Next up, the team has plans to show DishBrain a good time.

""We're trying to create a dose response curve with ethanol -- basically get them 'drunk' and see if they play the game more poorly, just as when people drink,"" Kagan says.

While we'll look forward to the results of the drunk DishBrain study, let's maybe keep those inebriated neurons far away from any self-driving car code.",artificial intelligence,cnet
37,1 Growth Stock Down 85% to Buy Right Now,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/703866/a-smiling-person-sitting-in-a-car-holding-up-the-keys-as-if-it-was-just-purchased.jpg,08/10/2022,Now might be the time to pounce on this artificial intelligence-driven insurance company.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/08/1-growth-stock-down-85-to-buy-right-now/,"It's no secret the technology sector of the stock market has been crushed this year. The Nasdaq 100 index, a widely followed benchmark for high-growth tech companies, has declined by 29% in 2022 so far.

But many individual stocks have been hit even harder, particularly those focused on serving consumers because it makes them more vulnerable to the broader economic slowdown. Interest rates have been rising because inflation recently topped a 40-year high, and that's placing a stranglehold on people's spending power.

Still, some consumer-centric companies have managed to maintain rapid growth rates in this difficult period. Innovative insurance company Lemonade (LMND -7.36%) is one of them. Its stock is down 85% from its all-time high, but its underlying business is arguably as strong as ever. Here's why it might be time to buy.

Lemonade is breaking new ground

Turmoil in the stock market and a challenging economic climate haven't stopped Lemonade from pursuing its grand plans to disrupt the insurance industry. It's improving on the traditional model by using artificial intelligence (AI) to price premiums and, perhaps more importantly, it's revamping the customer experience. With Lemonade, policyholders are often paid out in seconds or minutes, not days or weeks, also thanks to AI.

It's clearly resonating with consumers because the number of people holding a policy with Lemonade climbed to an all-time high of 1.57 million in the recent second quarter of 2022. The premium Lemonade earns per customer also marched higher as more people purchased multiple products. The company now operates in five insurance markets: renters, homeowners, life, pet, and car, and cross-sells and upsells accounted for 36% of all sales in Q2.

Lemonade owes much of its recent success in this economy to AI, particularly its new Lifetime Value 6 model (LTV6). It's a highly advanced, data-driven AI that can calculate a customer's potential lifetime value by accounting for their likelihood of purchasing more than one policy, of switching insurers, and of making a claim. But it goes beyond that -- it can also identify Lemonade's overperforming and underperforming insurance markets, so the company can rapidly pivot and maximize its sales.

On Oct. 3, Lemonade announced it was further expanding beyond the U.S. and entering the United Kingdom. It will only offer contents insurance there for now, but it follows the company's previous launches in Germany, France, and the Netherlands.

It's all about in-force premium

In-force premium is one of the primary ways insurers measure their performance. It's simply the dollar value of all the premiums paid by customers for active policies. Naturally, since Lemonade is rapidly acquiring customers and they're each becoming more valuable over time, the company's in-force premium is soaring.

That raises the issue of Lemonade's gross loss ratio, which is the proportion of its premiums it pays out to fund claims. In the second quarter it came in at 86%, which remains elevated, although it's down from 96% at the end of 2021. However, thanks to the predictive ability of the LTV6 model, Lemonade believes the customers it has signed up most recently could have a long-term loss ratio of 68%, well below its target of 75%.

Until it gets there, though, Lemonade will likely struggle to be profitable. It's one reason it has lost $279 million over the last four quarters -- the other is continued investments in growth and expansion, which are excusable given how quickly customers are flocking to buy policies.

The good news is Lemonade believes it has enough money on hand to see it through to profitability, so it won't require another dilutive capital raise. That's a positive for investors.

Car insurance could be Lemonade's key opportunity

The insurance industry is enormous. Lemonade's newest segment is car insurance, which it entered with the help of its acquisition of MetroMile, another data-driven insurance platform. Lemonade received licenses for 49 U.S. states and $100 million of in-force premium as part of the deal, which rapidly accelerated its entry into the market.

Car insurance could be a $316 billion opportunity in 2022 alone in the U.S., and it already makes up about 20% of Lemonade's product mix. There are approximately 198 million policy-holding drivers across America, so the company has a significant runway for growth.

With Lemonade stock down 85% from its all-time high, it could be a great bet for the long term.",artificial intelligence,motley fool
38,Don't Laugh Off the Tesla Bot. Elon Musk's Optimus Is the Real Deal - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/899c63545472436c9ce7fa6601b2958b93a89d59/hub/2022/10/04/a47f255e-4d70-4847-979b-981ddb5b9d92/tesla-optimus-robot-2.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=630&width=1200,08/10/2022,"Commentary: I saw the humanoid robot firsthand. Sure, Tesla's prototypes can't do flips, but the company has the right engineering approach for progress.",https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/dont-laugh-off-the-tesla-bot-elon-musks-optimus-is-the-real-deal/,"When watching Tesla's humanoid Optimus robot debut at AI Day 2022, it's entirely fair to be skeptical about the company's ultra-ambitious plans. The prototype robot's shuffling gait paled to the exciting parkour and flips of Boston Dynamics' Atlas, and Tesla has missed many deadlines bringing its full self-driving technology to its cars.

But I was at the AI Day event, and I'm here to advise you not to dismiss Tesla's sci-fi inspired vision.

The company revealed abundant evidence that it's thinking deeply about a bipedal robot and the artificial intelligence technology needed to make it useful. And much of Tesla's track record of genuine achievements in electric vehicle engineering and manufacturing apply to Optimus.

Non-Tesla experts in robotics and AI I spoke with at the event were impressed with Optimus, the code name for the Tesla Bot. And Tesla engineers had the kind of fire in their bellies that bodes well for progress, especially when backed by Chief Executive Elon Musk's vision and Tesla's resources.

""I haven't worked this hard since grad school. But I love it,"" said one senior chip designer working on Tesla's Dojo technology for training the artificial intelligence systems behind Optimus' ability to navigate rooms and Tesla's FSD technology to steer cars. He wasn't authorized to speak to the media.

Now playing: Watch this: Elon Musk Wants to Sell You an Optimus Robot for Less...

Seeing the Tesla Bot firsthand was impressive

I was impressed, too, compared with last year, when Tesla debuted Optimus as a few presentation slides accompanied by a robot-costumed human dancer.

I didn't applaud and cheer like many of the 1,000-plus people crammed onto a giant shop floor at Tesla's offices in Palo Alto, California, when the first Tesla Bot walked across the stage. I did appreciate the engineering achievement when seeing the computer-controlled biped pivot at the waist without toppling, powered by a computer on its chest, moved by a collection of gleaming cylindrical actuators, studded with status LEDs and cabled with a copper nervous system. I heard its cooling fans blow and, later, strained to heft the 42-pound block of copper and electronics that constitutes each 25-processor Dojo AI training tile.

It's not yet clear whether humanoid robots will someday do our shopping or take over from humans toiling on production lines, as Musk envisions. The controversial and outspoken billionaire estimates it'll be three to five years before the first Optimus goes on sale, an eternity in the technology world. But if his vision holds true, it could transform the world as profoundly as the automobile or smartphone.

""We wouldn't be surprised to see it becoming the primary driver of the stock price towards the end of the decade,"" New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu said in a report Monday. ""Imagine Optimus as a startup today: It could be valued at several billion dollars, maybe even a few tens.""

Research firm IDTechEx expects spending on service robots to nearly quintuple by 2032 to $70 billion.

To be sure, there's a long trip from prototype to product, as AI Day attendees were reminded when seeing a Tesla Semi and Cybertruck, two vehicles that have missed initial ship dates.

While Tesla's ability to deliver on its robot vision is even more up in the air, I'd recommend against writing the project off merely as Musk's utopian fantasy. Here's why.

Give Musk credit for creating nerd heaven

Musk has a talent for picking businesses that are difficult but attainable, for finding engineers up for the challenge, and providing them an environment where they expect to make a difference. They've managed to stay motivated even with Musk distractions like launching new companies and acquiring Twitter.

One who works at SpaceX, which has upended the rocket business the same way Tesla is shaking up the automotive industry, said rivals have tried recruiting her several times. They'd be cushy jobs, she said, but in practice, she wouldn't really get to do anything there. She wasn't authorized to speak to the media.

We might spend lots of money on laptops and smartphones, but Musk is looking for newer horizons. ""You definitely want to see what's happening with Optimus, whereas a bunch of other technologies are sort of plateaued,"" Musk said at the AI Day event.

That message resonated with one engineer I spoke with at AI Day who's working on actuators, a key mechanism that moves Optimus' torso, legs, arms and fingers. Previously, he worked at Boeing, but he sees robotics as a new wave of innovation.

AI Day 2022 is explicitly set up as a recruiting event for engineers. One I spoke with, who works for a direct Tesla rival, showed up because of a recruiting email. Another who works on surgical robots was clearly impressed by the breadth and funding of Tesla's work in the area. Nobody was laughing off Tesla's Optimus.

Tesla Bot represents deep research

On stage at AI Day, a pre-Optimus prototype called Bumble-C shuffled, waved, pumped its arms and flexed at the waist. It was unspectacular by some standards, but also the result of less than a year's work. A series of engineers shared the stage with Musk to detail the research that's so far gone into Optimus. Among them:

Tesla is designing its own actuators, tightly packaged sets of gears, motors, sensors and controls that act like human muscles. The company is drawing from the team that already designs Tesla cars' drive units. At AI Day, engineers showed Tesla's calculations on how it settled on a collection of six actuators for the whole robot that best optimized cost, ease of manufacturing, speed, torque, mass and efficiency.

Tesla is drawing lessons from human anatomy, for example, employing a complex four-bar hinging mechanism similar to the human knee that adapts an actuator's differing needs for strength or speed depending on how far the knee is bent.

Tesla is using the same AI technology behind FSD to guide Optimus, too. That includes the occupancy network, an AI system that converts camera input data into a 3D map of everything around a robot.

Tesla is building its own custom data center technology, Dojo, to train the multiple AI systems that go into a vehicle or robot. So far, Tesla has built three cabinets of Dojo hardware and already it can handle video training data in ways impossible with the earlier approach using 72 of Nvidia's high-end A100 processors.

For locomotion, Optimus combines a physics model that simulates a virtual robot with real-world sensor data that gauges how the robot is actually performing. The walking technology has grown more sophisticated: first steps were in February; Optimus' pelvis started rocking in July; swinging arm motion accompanying its strides starting in August; and Optimus' toes first lifted off the ground in September.

""The Tesla team is so far ahead and so confident in its pace of innovation that it doesn't worry about sharing details of what they do,"" Ferragu said.

AI is mandatory on Optimus

Optimus faces a challenge that Tesla cars do not: It requires AI for everything it does. Tesla can make a successful business selling industry-leading electric vehicles piloted entirely by humans then gradually develop autonomous vehicle technology.

Stephen Shankland/CNET

With humanoid robots, AI has to work from the start. And the AI challenge is harder with robots.

A quick primer on today's AI technology: Instead of programming computers with narrow, rigid if-this-then-that instructions, AI works by training a system to recognize patterns in vast quantities of real-world data. That lets AI systems handle much more complexity and make more nuanced decisions.

The tricky thing is that self-driving cars encounter a huge variety of situations. Even the same road intersection can be very different if it's raining, under construction or blocked by a stalled car.

Tesla is investing massively to overcome these challenges, slurping up 100 terabytes of video data reported by its cars every day, according to one engineer at Tesla AI Day. It also simulates various conditions to extend AI training situations beyond that real-world data.

But the variety of situations robots could encounter is vastly broader. Think of how different one home is from the one next door. Then compare those homes to businesses, sidewalks and farms.

Tesla's robot demonstration videos were set in a relatively narrow domain, though: its offices and research labs. And Musk said the company plans to first test them in its own ""gigafactories."" That could provide enough training data to give the robots a useful foothold.

Why build the Optimus robot?

Musk offered a somewhat murky motivation for why to build Optimus. SpaceX's job is to get humanity to Mars, and Tesla electric vehicles and batteries are to wean us from fossil fuels. Musk's explanation for Optimus seemed more opportunistic: Tesla has the expertise, so it might as well.

Musk hopes Optimus will ""help millions of people,"" freeing humans from boring, dangerous and repetitive work. In his most starry-eyed moment, he said robots could lead to ""a future of abundance, a future where there is no poverty, where people can have whatever you want in terms of products and services. It really is a fundamental transformation of civilization as we know it.""

I wouldn't expect an end to poverty anytime soon. But today's Optimus is taking big steps, literally and figuratively, from last year's debut as just an idea.",artificial intelligence,cnet

Hundreds of thousands of human neurons growing in a dish coated with electrodes have been taught to play a version of the classic computer game Pong1.

In doing so, the cells join a growing pantheon of Pong players, including pigs taught to manipulate joysticks with their snouts2 and monkeys wired to control the game with their minds. (Google’s DeepMind artificial-intelligence (AI) algorithms mastered Pong many years ago3 and have moved on to more-sophisticated computer games such as StarCraft II4.)

The gamer cells respond not to visual cues on a screen but to electrical signals from the electrodes in the dish. These electrodes both stimulate the cells and record changes in neuronal activity. Researchers then converted the stimulation signals and the cellular responses into a visual depiction of the game. The results are reported today in Neuron.

Intelligence in a dish

The work is a proof of principle that neurons in a dish can learn and exhibit basic signs of intelligence, says lead author Brett Kagan, chief scientific officer at Cortical Labs in Melbourne, Australia. “In current textbooks, neurons are thought of predominantly in terms of their implications for human or animal biology,” he says. “They’re not thought about as an information processor, but a neuron is this amazing system that can process information in real time with very low power consumption.”

Although the company calls its system DishBrain, the neurons are a far cry from an actual brain, Kagan says, and show no signs of consciousness. The definition of intelligence is also hotly debated; Kagan defines it as the ability to collate information and apply it in an adaptive behaviour in a given environment.

Cortical Labs’ work follows on work by neuroengineer Steve Potter, now at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, and his colleagues. In 2008, the team reported that neurons cultured from rats can exhibit learning and goal-directed behaviour5,6.

The work from Cortical Labs brings more-sophisticated technology and analytical tools to bear, says Potter. His original dishes had dozens of electrodes; each DishBrain has thousands. Potter’s group studied only rodent cells, but the DishBrain team also tested neurons derived from human cells.

The researchers used their system to teach the neurons to respond to an electrical signal that is a substitute for the ball in Pong. In the game, a player slides a vertical paddle up and down the screen to intercept a bouncing ball. In the experiment, the neurons controlled the paddle.

The authors represented the route of the ball by stimulating neurons along the ball’s path relative to the paddle. Responses from neurons in another region of the network were used to move the paddle up or down.

To teach the neurons to hit the ball, Kagan says, he and his team harnessed the theory that neurons tend to repeat activity that yields a predictable environment. When the neurons responded in a way that corresponded with hitting the ball, they were stimulated in a location and at a frequency that was the same each time. If they missed the ball, the network was stimulated by the electrodes in random locations and at different frequencies. Over time, the neurons learnt to hit the ball to receive the patterned response rather than the random one.

Not just a game

The work is an important step towards developing assays that could be used, for example, to test the potential effect of a new drug on neuronal function, says neuroscientist Takuya Isomura at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Saitama, Japan. But, he adds, it is not yet clear whether the neurons were behaving as they did to create a predictable environment, or in response to some other aspect of the signals they received. “I think the important next step is a detailed explanation of what kind of stimuli can actually make that difference,” he says.

Cortical Labs also aims to eventually use neurons to develop “biological processing units” for use in computing. And the techniques developed for DishBrain are quantitative enough that they could be used to compare variations in learning between different animals, or between cells from multiple regions of the brain, says Potter.

In the meantime, he says, the decision to embody DishBrain activity as the game Pong was a masterstroke. “People interested in AI are very keen on anything that can play Pong,” Potter says. “That was a brilliant decision.”",artificial intelligence,nature.com

""We just don't really understand fully who's behind this, what the motivation was, certainly at what level -- if any -- Kremlin officials were aware. We just don't know,"" Kirby told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in an interview Tuesday on ""Good Morning America.""

""We're grateful that no airport operations were affected, no safety was put at risk, but we're looking into this,"" he added. ""We're going to investigate this, we're going to try to get to the bottom of it and obviously we take cyber resilience very, very seriously, regardless of what happened at these airports.""

Some of the nation's largest airports were targeted for cyberattacks by someone within Russia on Monday, according to a senior U.S. official briefed on the situation. The systems targeted do not handle air traffic control, internal airline communications and coordination or transportation security.

""It's an inconvenience,"" the source told ABC News, adding that the attacks have resulted in targeted ""denial of public access"" to public-facing web domains that report airport wait times and congestion.

More than a dozen websites for U.S. airports were impacted by the ""denial of service"" attacks, which essentially overload sites by jamming them with artificial users, according to John Hultquist, head of intelligence analysis at American cybersecurity firm Mandiant. Hultquist told ABC News that such cyberattacks are highly visible but largely superficial and often temporary.

A pro-Kremlin hacker group called Killnet is believed to be behind Monday's attacks, according to Hultquist. Killnet has been active since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, with the hackers targeting Ukrainian allies and recently claiming credit for taking down U.S. government websites. The groups operates internationally and has been known to carry out cyberattacks across Europe, according to cybersecurity experts.

While similar groups have been found to be fronts for state-backed actors, Hultquist said there is no evidence that the Russian government was involved in directing Monday's attacks.

A recent – remarkable – puzzle from Brendan featured this run of across clues:

17a Same clue as 15 (7)

20a Same clue as 14 (8)

22a Same clue as 12 (6)

23a Same clue as 11 (10)

24a Same clue as 10 (4)

25a Same clue as 9 (5)

26a Same clue as 8 (5,3)

Same clues, each one simultaneously offering two different answers. How often does a clue have these properties? It’s hard to say because once the first entry has been written in a grid, the person testing or solving the puzzle tends to use crossing letters for the remaining clues.

The best way of finding out, it seemed to me, was to ask the finest minds in solving to look at some clues in isolation. As many of you suspected, there was something fishy about the request. As Jacob Busby surmised, the clues were not written by the setters whose names accompanied each set. Despite the nonveiled threats from some among you, I shall be brave and disclose that the clues were created by feeding a few puzzles’ worth of material from each setter into an artificial intelligence engine and asking it to produce more of the same.

I had considered removing the letter counts, but had not anticipated that Guardian solvers might be assiduous enough to discover answers that worked if, say, a “(6)” became a “(5)”. I truly appreciate the herculean capacity among you lot to create sense out of nonsense, and to a lesser extent I’m also impressed with the AI’s flair for creating plausible and intriguing surface readings. Despite the alarm expressed by one of the setters (none of whom are implicated in the exercise; any dudgeon must be directed solely at me), the phenomenon of AI clues that actually work not only seems a long way off, it’s something that holds no appeal to me beyond novelty. A setter is very much an author, and your comments have convinced me more than ever that the relationship with the solver is what keeps us coming back.

As for accidentally ambiguous clues, they are I think rare beasts. Of course there is the even rarer subset: the clue that remains ambiguous even with every crossing letter correctly filled. The last I remember was from 2018, with crossing letters giving __A__Y:

3d Blue vehicle, turning over, last in rally (4)

Online solvers were told they were correct if they turned over a CAR before the last letter in RALLY, for RACY (blue). If you solved on paper, though, and turned over a VAN, you could happily enter NAVY (blue) and consider the puzzle done. These things happen: the Guardian crossword editor Hugh Stephenson wrote of a fateful month in 2012 that featured Paul’s “Misshapen genitals, funny things? (3,5)” (ODD BALLS or TAG LINES?) as well as a remarkable it’s-not-right-but-it-could-be in the Genius puzzle. Happily, the BLUE clue inspired an entire puzzle in this July’s edition of the Magpie magazine that has to be solved to be believed. It was issue 235, you can subscribe here and we’ll be celebrating a Magpie anniversary here soon; there is also a spoiler-addled explanation from setter Twin here.

For now, mea culpas to anyone who now considers me reprehensible and for our next challenge, something different. No single answer this time: what are your clues with two answers that are as close as possible to being equally acceptable?

Cluing competition

So that leaves your clues for GADZOOKS. The audacity award goes to Dcusch for the extended “Blimey! Good translation of Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are (not in French)” but a little audacity is often called for with such a ghastly word.

The post Google Cloud Rebrands Data Studio As “Looker Studio” appeared first on Search Engine Journal.",https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-cloud-rebrands-data-studio-as-looker-studio/467599/,"Google has unified all its business intelligence tools under the Looker brand, it announced at Cloud Next 2022, its virtual user’s conference.

Looker will now be the face of all existing Google Cloud data analytics programs. These programs will be included in the Looker Suite and bear the Looker name. For example, Data Studio is now Looker Studio.

“Looker is the name you’ll hear us use when talking about all of our Google Cloud business intelligence products, as we bring together Looker, Data Studio, and core Google technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Kate Wright, Google’s Senior Director for Business Intelligence Product Management said in the announcement.

Looker Suite Includes Integrated Cloud Infrastructure Services

Looker is being launched in Cloud Preview today. The new version will include integrated core cloud infrastructure services, including key security and management services.

Google is also launching a preview of Looker integration with Google Sheets. It plans to eventually support visualization tools like Salesforce’s Tableau as well.

This continues the integration trend Google has followed since acquiring Looker in 2020 for $2.6 billion. Shortly thereafter, the search engine giant began offering full support for the Google Marketing Analytics Suite.

Google Seeking To Enhance Business Intelligence Offerings

The acquisition of Looker significantly enhanced Google’s analytics and business intelligence capabilities. A key part of this was Looker’s semantic data modeling capability, which allows developers to define data and analytics assets to ensure consistent interpretations.

By combining all its analytics offerings under one umbrella, Google seeks to provide users with more functionality than traditional dashboards.

Looker Studio will now support data models from Looker, allowing users to apply the Looker modeling layer to combine data sources. Overall, this unification seeks to allow companies to bring more data into their workflows and applications, so they can make better informed day-to-day decisions about operations.

Earlier this year, Google launched BigLake and integrated Analytics Hub and BigQueryML into its cloud platform. At the time, Looker was not mentioned.

Looker Studio Pro Adds Enterprise Management Features

Looker Studio will now be available in three tiers, including Looker Studio Pro, which is intended for more advanced users at an enterprise level. This adds additional management features, collaboration tools, and service-level agreements.

Google plans to integrate the enterprise version with Dataplex, a data management environment in the future that enables data lineage and metadata visibility.

The features included in Looker Studio Pro are specifically intended for use by large organizations with many employees.

47,Adult online age used by third of eight- to 17-year-old social media users,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5d350db606d18b3366d7d2619a008d6f278544d/0_296_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9f26403c8ccf5473b1af519ed62fb75f,10/10/2022,"Ofcom study covers Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and YouTube, all of which have age limits of 13A third of social media users aged between eight and 17 have the online age of an adult because they sign up with a false date of birth, according…",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/oct/11/adult-online-age-eight-to-17-year-old-social-media-users,"A third of social media users aged between eight and 17 have the online age of an adult because they sign up with a false date of birth, according to new research.

The fake age issue means that young users in the UK are at greater risk of being exposed to harmful or adult content, as platforms presume they are older than they in fact are.

The majority of children aged between eight and 17 who use social media have their own profile on at least one of the main platforms, according to research commissioned by Ofcom, the communications watchdog.

“When a child self-declares a false age to gain access to social media or online games, as they get older, so does their claimed user age. This means they could be placed at greater risk of encountering age-inappropriate or harmful content online,” said Ofcom.

The regulator added that once a user reaches 16 or 18, some platforms introduce features not available to younger users such as direct messaging or the ability to see adult content.

The study covered six of the leading platforms – Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter and YouTube – all of which have age limits of 13. Its findings suggested that 32% of children aged eight to 17 with a social media profile have a user age of 18 or over, while nearly half of children in the same age bracket have a user age of 16 or over.

The most popular site among all eight- to 17-year-olds was YouTube, followed by TikTok and then Instagram. The majority of respondents had set up their account profile themselves.

The online safety bill, which is due to resume its progress through parliament before Christmas, imposes a duty of care to protect children from harmful content. The inquest into the death of Molly Russell, a 14-year-old who took her own life in 2017 after viewing harmful content on platforms including Instagram and Pinterest, found she signed up for an Instagram account at the age of 12.

One expert in internet safety described the study, based on a survey of more than 1,000 young social media users by Yonder Consulting, as a signal from Ofcom to tech firms that it knows where there are flaws in their operations.

“This is a warning shot to platforms that Ofcom knows what is on going with these services,” said William Perrin, a trustee of the Carnegie UK Trust.

Under the online safety bill, platforms are required to prevent children from accessing harmful content – such as suicide and self-harm material – with systems that could include rigorous age checks. As part of a risk assessment process required under the bill, Ofcom will then decide whether each platform’s approach to age checking is thorough enough.

A spokesperson for the Molly Rose Foundation, set up by Molly Russell’s family, said: “Effective regulation through the online safety bill cannot come too soon. The Ofcom research shows that by allowing children from the age of eight on to their platforms, social media providers fail in a basic duty of care. They have proved unable to control their platforms’ capability to connect our children with distressing and harmful content, resulting in tragic outcomes.”

The spokesperson added: “Had the appropriate age checks been carried out in Molly’s case, she might have been spared a whole year of exposure to harmful content on Instagram.”

Ofcom also published research showing that children prefer a “self-declaration” method of age assurance for social media platforms while parents often preferred “parental confirmation”, where they confirm an account holder’s age.

Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, uses artificial intelligence to find underage users. YouTube, owned by Google, allows children under 13 to open accounts with parent or guardian supervision, as well as offering the separate YouTube Kids platform, while TikTok has an age gate that requires people to fill in their complete date of birth.

A Snapchat spokesperson said: “Age verification is an industry-wide challenge and we are in ongoing conversations with other companies and policymakers about consistent and effective solutions.”",artificial intelligence,the guardian

Credit: Wikipedia

An artificial intelligence approach borrowed from natural language processing—much like language translation and autofill for text on your smart phone—can predict future fault friction and the next failure time with high resolution in laboratory earthquakes. The technique, applying AI to the fault's acoustic signals, advances previous work and goes beyond by predicting aspects of the future state of the fault's physical system.

""Simply put, we predict future friction. That's never been done, and it provides a potential path to near-term forecasting of earthquake timing in Earth,"" said Chris Johnson, co-lead author of a paper on the findings in Geophysical Research Letters.

Paul Johnson, corresponding author of the paper, geophysicist and Laboratory fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory, leads a team that has made steady advances in applying various machine learning techniques to the challenge of forecasting earthquakes in the laboratory and in the field.

""The acoustic signals emitted by the laboratory fault contain foreshadowing information about the future fundamental physics of the system through the entire earthquake cycle and beyond, as we now show,"" Paul Johnson said. ""That's never been seen before.""

In a novel approach, the Los Alamos team applied a deep-learning transformer model to acoustic emissions broadcast from the laboratory fault to predict the frictional state.

""The deep-learning transformer model we used is synonymous with a language translation model, such as Google Translate, using a codebook to translate a sentence to a different language,"" said Chris Johnson. ""You can think about this as writing an email in English and having the AI translate the English to Japanese while also anticipating your words and autofilling the end of the sentence.""

Chris Johnson said the AI ""takes data of what's happening right now and says what's happening next on the fault.""

The Los Alamos team had previously forecasted fault failure timing in laboratory quakes and in historical slow-slip Earth data using a number of machine learning techniques. Applying machine learning to data from laboratory shear experiments demonstrated that the fault emissions are imprinted with information regarding its current state and where it is in the slip cycle.

Indeed, the statistical features of the continuous seismic signal emitted from the fault and identified by machine learning allowed the Los Alamos researchers to predict the evolving instantaneous—but not future—fault friction, displacement and other characteristics, along with the timing of the next lab quake.

In that previous work, the waveform (or acoustic emission) data is input to a model to predict the current state of the fault system. That prediction includes a countdown estimate, or time to failure, for the next slip event, with some degree of uncertainty, which is not a future prediction but a description of the current state of the system.

""Now we are making a future prediction from past data, which is beyond describing the instantaneous state of the system. The model is learning from the waveforms to predict the future fault friction and when the next slip event will occur using only past information, without using any data from the future time step of interest,"" Chris Johnson said.

""The model is not constrained with physics, but it predicts the physics, the actual behavior of the system,"" said Chris Johnson.

""The next challenge is whether we can do this in Earth to predict future fault displacement, for instance,"" Paul Johnson said. ""That's an open question, because we don't have long data sets for model training as we do in the laboratory.""

The method could be applied to other disciplines, such as non-destructive materials testing, where it could provide information about progressive damage and impending damage to, say, a bridge.

Microsoft has announced that a premium service for its Teams collaboration platform is on the way as part of a staged rollout that will end in 2023.

At this year's Microsoft Ignite event, the company explained that the optional premium add-on features for its video conferencing software will make meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure.

The Teams Premium preview will be available in December 2022. General availability will come in February 2023, while the most impressive features leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) will roll out in the first half of next year.

Microsoft Teams Premium features

“Intelligent recap” will allow AI to transcribe meetings, use recordings to label important moments, as well as chapters in meeting recordings for easy playback of relevant sections.

AI will also power real-time meeting transcriptions in 40 languages. Microsoft has stated that this will make meetings more inclusive. This is undoubtedly true, but it's a shame the feature is locked behind a paid subscription after being previously announced for general release .

Advanced security features, such as watermarking documents and limiting recording permissions, will protect businesses from leaks. Microsoft 365 E5 customers will also be able to apply their existing Information Protection labels from Microsoft Purview to meetings, and apply appropriate restrictions.

Setting up meetings will also be easier, with users able to choose from a range of meeting types that will be customizable by IT teams, to get into meetings with the right settings in place much faster.

Webinars, which can already be organized across Microsoft 365, are also due an upgrade in Teams Premium. Users will have access to a registration waitlist with manual approval, automated email reminders, a virtual green-room, and control over what attendees see.

But it’s not just not internal company meetings that will see overhauls thanks to the new service. Business-to-consumer (B2C) engagements stand to gain too, thanks to an “advanced” personal appointment system that will allow for sending SMS reminders for meetings, a “branded lobby experience”, and organizing scheduled as well as on-demand appointments.

Microsoft has clearly worked to make Teams Premium good value for businesses of all shapes and sizes. How much value remains to be seen, though, as Microsoft is yet to announce any pricing.",artificial intelligence,techradar

This article is part of our reviews of AI research papers, a series of posts that explore the latest findings in artificial intelligence.

Very soon, you should be wary of innocent-looking typos in online content, because they might contain a hidden attack against the artificial intelligence algorithms that process the ton of text we consume every day.

“When people see typos right now, they don’t think it’s a security issue. But in the near future, it might be something we will have to contend with,” Stephen Merity, AI researcher and expert on machine learning–based language models, told me in a call last week.

And there’s ample reason to take his warnings seriously. In recent findings, scientists at IBM Research, Amazon and the University of Texas have proven that small modifications to text content can alter the behavior of AI algorithms while remaining unnoticeable to human readers.

In their paper, titled, “Discrete Attacks and Submodular Optimization with Applications to Text Classification,” the researchers delve into paraphrasing attacks, the textual equivalent of adversarial examples, perturbations in input data that cause AI algorithms to behave in erratic ways.

Thanks to advances in deep learning, AI algorithms have become capable to automate text-related tasks that previously required the skills of human operators. Many companies completely rely on AI algorithms to process text content and make important decisions.

But deep learning algorithms are also vulnerable to their own unique type of security threats. With AI becoming more and more prominent in tasks such as filtering spam, detecting fake news, processing resumes and analyzing the sentiment of social media posts, it’s important that we understand what these threats are and find ways to deal with them.

The adversarial vulnerabilities of deep learning algorithms

Neural networks, the main component of deep learning algorithms, develop their behavior based on thousands and millions of examples they examine during their training phase. This is a break from classic artificial intelligence development, in which a large part of the effort involved programmers meticulously coding the rules that defined the behavior of their software.

The example-based approach of developing deep learning algorithms make them very convenient in tackling tasks where the rules are too vague and complicated to encode through static rules. Some of the domains that have benefitted immensely from advances in deep learning include computer vision, automated speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP).

However, with humans having little control on the behavior of neural networks, their inner-workings often remain elusive even to their own creators. Also, deep learning algorithms are statistical machines, albeit very complex ones, which means they are very different from the human mind, even if they often provide very similar results in complicated tasks. Despite all advances in the field, AI’s grasp of human language is still very limited.

The unique characteristics of deep learning algorithms make them vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples involve making small changes to the inputs of AI algorithms to force them to change their behavior. For instance, applying small changes to the color values of pixels in an image might cause an image classifier AI algorithm to change its confidence scores.

Adversarial examples accentuate the differences between AI and human intelligence. If you show the above picture to a human, they would tell you outright that it’s a turtle. But students at MIT showed that a neural network would classify the same image as a rifle. The key is to make slight changes to the colors and shapes (maybe the weird patterns on the shell) that would make it statistically close to some other object.

Sometimes, adversarial vulnerabilities can happen by accident, such as a case where AI software used by the UK Metropolitan Police to detect and flag pictures of child abuse wrongly labeled pictures of dunes as nudes.

But scientists fear that adversarial examples can someday be weaponized and turned into cyberattacks against AI systems. Any machine learning model can become subject to adversarial attacks, but deep learning models are especially vulnerable because of their complexity and poor interpretability.

The challenges of paraphrasing attacks

The idea behind paraphrasing attacks is like other adversarial attacks. The point is to manipulate the behavior of an NLP model by making changes to the input text that will go unnoticed to a human reader.

“In text attacks, people try to replace words in sentences of an article or email so that the classification will become different,” says Pin-Yu Chen, AI scientist at IBM Research and co-author of the paper.

For instance, consider an AI algorithm that automatically scans emails and blocks spam messages (many popular email providers use AI to filter out spam). A paraphrasing attack would involve rewording a spam email to slip past the AI filter while conveying the same message to the human recipient.

However, in other respects, paraphrasing attacks against NLP models are also fundamentally different from adversarial attacks against computer vision algorithms.

Discovering adversarial vulnerabilities in images is a simple process. A malicious actor can continuously feed the same picture to an image classifier, each time making small changes to the pixel values. By taking note of how changes to the pixels affect the output of the AI model, they will be able to find out how to make the right changes to completely change the classification of the image. IBM Research recently introduced a method that automates the discovery of adversarial vulnerabilities in image classifiers and helps make AI models more robust against attacks.

But creating adversarial text samples is more challenging. “Paraphrasing attacks are very special when compared to adversarial attacks on image, video and audio classifiers. Text is a high-level symbol. We know the meaning of words,” says Lingfei Wu, scientist at IBM Research and co-author of the paraphrasing paper.

In other words, you can increase or decrease color values in images, but you can’t do the same with text. “Text is traditionally harder to attack. It’s discrete. You can’t say I want 10 percent more of the word ‘dog’ in this sentence. You either have the word ‘dog’ or you take it out,” says Merity.

In many cases, a text will lose its smoothness and consistence if you take out or change a single word.

Creating paraphrasing attacks

The paraphrasing paper is not the first effort aimed at attacking text-processing AI models. But previous efforts mostly focused on swapping single words with their synonyms. This approach limited the scope of the attacks and often resulted in artificial output. In contrast, the new work by IBM, Amazon and UT expands the span of the attacks to alter entire sequences of text.

“We are paraphrasing words and sentences. This gives the attack a larger space by creating sequences that are semantically similar to the target sentence. We then see if the model classifies them like the original sentence,” Chen says.

This approach makes the attack much more versatile and ensures that the output also passes the test of being “adversarial,” which means it should go unnoticed to humans. “We believe paraphrasing is the right way to define adversarial for text-based AI models,” Wu says.

But versatility and flexibility will come at a huge cost in complexity. “We search in a very large space that looks for both word and sentence paraphrasing. Finding the best adversarial example in that space is very time consuming,” Wu says.

To overcome this challenge, the researchers have developed a gradient-guided greedy algorithm that tries to search for optimal modifications that will have the most impact on the output of the targeted AI model. “The algorithm is computationally efficient and also provides theoretical guarantees that it’s the best search you can find,” Wu says.

The paper includes some examples of paraphrasing attacks produced by the algorithm. In some cases, rewording a single sentence caused the targeted AI algorithm to change its behavior.

To create their paraphrasing attacks, the researchers had access to the structure and architecture of the model they were targeting. This is generally known as a “white box” attack.

But this doesn’t mean that “black box” attacks against NLP models is impossible. Merity points out that even closed AI models, such as those provided as online services by large tech companies, can be vulnerable to paraphrasing attacks. “Even if you keep your machine learning model secret, there have been past papers showing that if you vaguely know the training dataset or the type of AI architecture they’re using, or if you just have enough samples, you can work backwards and attack these AI systems even though you’re basically talking to a black box,” he says.

Humans are not sensitive to paraphrasing attacks

To assess the efficiency of their algorithm, the researchers had to make sure the output read smoothly and had the same meaning to humans. They tested the algorithm by running the content by human evaluators and asking them to identify the original and modified sentences.

“We gave the original and modified paragraph to human evaluators, and it was very hard for them to see difference in meanings. But for the machine, it was completely different,” Wu says.

But Merity pointed out that to be efficient, paraphrasing attacks don’t need to be perfectly coherent. In testing the algorithm, the human evaluator knows in advance that the text might be generated by an AI algorithm and will try to look for inconsistencies and flaws. But in everyday life, most of us dismiss grammatical and typographical errors as the blunders of careless or unknowledgeable humans.

“Humans aren’t the correct level to try to detect these kinds of attacks, because they deal with faulty input every day. Except that for us, faulty input is just incoherent sentences from real people,” he says.

Bad actors can actually turn this lack of sensitivity to their advantage. They can use the AI algorithm to generate paraphrasing examples, and then silently feed it into an online community platform to evaluate its coherence.

“For instance, they can post the modified content on Reddit and see how many upvotes it gets. That could be indicative of whether the sample is semantically or functionally coherent,” Merity says.

Creating more robust AI models

One of the ways to protect AI models against adversarial attacks is to retrain them with adversarial examples and their correct labels. This will make the model more robust and resilient against such attacks.

The same rule applies to NLP models. However, to their surprise, the researchers discovered that adversarial training not only makes the models more robust against paraphrasing attacks, but it also makes them more accurate and versatile.

“This was one of the surprising findings we had in this project. Initially, we started with the angle of robustness. But we found out that this method not only improves robustness, but also improves generalizability,” Wu says. “If instead of attacks, you just think about what is the best way to augment your model, paraphrasing is a very good generalization tool to increase the capability of your AI model.”

After retraining their AI models with paraphrased examples, the researchers noticed an improvement both in performance and robustness against attacks.

“It’s interesting to note that this work isn’t necessarily bad. Training the classifier against these adversarial examples that they’re actually able to produce makes the classifier not just more resilient to attacks but also can improve the accuracy of these models,” Merity notes.

The future of AI security

As artificial intelligence algorithms assume a more important role in processing and moderating online content, adversarial attacks will give rise to a new trend of security risks.

“A lot of tech companies rely on automated decisions to classify content, and there isn’t actually a human-to-human interaction involved. This makes the process vulnerable to such attacks,” Merity says. “It will run in parallel to data breaches, except that we’re going to find logic breaches.”

These kinds of attacks might be used to tamper with all kinds of AI systems. Malicious actors might use them to slip their hateful content past hate-speech classifiers, or dupe resume-processing algorithms to push their jobs application higher in the list of shortlisted candidates.

“This is the evolution of technology that you have to deal with. In the same way that in the early 2000s, spam became epidemic, we’re going to have the same thing in this era and it’s going to be more concerning. These systems potentially working against democracies and enflaming entire communities for political reasons,” Merity warns. “These types of issues are going to be a new security era, and I’m worried that companies will just spend as little on this as they do on security, because they’re focused on automation and scalability.”",artificial intelligence,bdtechtalks.com

Conservative, Bloc Québécois and NDP MPs are planning to force a committee investigation into the $54-million cost of the ArriveCan app.

With all three opposition parties on board, the MPs have the numbers to win a vote even if the study is opposed by Liberal MPs.

Canadian tech leaders have been expressing outrage after The Globe and Mail reported that total spending on the ArriveCan app is on pace to reach in excess of $54-million this year. Two tech companies announced this week that they recreated clone versions of the app over the Thanksgiving weekend as a way of illustrating that the government overpaid.

Opposition parties plan to call representatives of the company that received the most contract-related work, GCstrategies, to testify. The Globe has reported that GCstrategies has fewer than five employees, no standalone office and is currently relying on more than 75 subcontractors to deliver on contracts with over a dozen federal government departments. Neither the company nor the government will identify these subcontractors, saying it is confidential third-party information.

Conservative MP Kelly McCauley served formal notice Wednesday of a motion calling on the government operations committee to hold a minimum of six days of hearings. Mr. McCauley is proposing a witness list that includes cabinet ministers such as Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino and Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos, as well as senior public servants and various tech leaders who have spoken out about the app’s cost.

Mr. McCauley said he also wants the committee to use its powers to obtain contracts and other documents related to the ArriveCan app.

“This is an absolute waste of taxpayers’ money, with absolutely no oversight, no accountability, and no sense of caring from the government that this money could have been better used elsewhere,” Mr. McCauley told The Globe Wednesday. The motion could be put to a committee vote as soon as Monday.

Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, who is a member of the committee and also the parliamentary secretary to Public Services and Procurement Minister Helena Jaczek, said in an interview that he will review the motion before deciding how he will vote.

Mr. Housefather also said he believes there has been a lot of misunderstanding with respect to ArriveCan’s price.

“I think we’re conflating many different costs here,” he said. Specifically, he said it includes items such as call centres to support ArriveCan and primary reporting kiosks.

“And not all apps are the same. ArriveCan is not a simple information sharing app. It’s a secure transactional tool that used artificial intelligence to verify proof of vaccination,” he said.

When asked about transparency concerns, Mr. Housefather said the goal is always to be as transparent as possible.

“Normally subcontractors are third-party information that we wouldn’t be able to disclose,” he said.

ArriveCan was initially created as a way for travellers to upload mandatory health information related to COVID-19. It has since been expanded to allow users to answer customs and immigration questions. The app is no longer mandatory as of Sept. 30, but it continues as a voluntary option.

Federal departments recently provided a report to Parliament showing that as of March 31, 2022, Ottawa had awarded 27 contracts involving 23 unique companies related to ArriveCan.

GCstrategies received the most funding, at $9-million, but that total is likely to increase given that the company was later awarded a large new contract during the current fiscal year that started April 1. The Canada Border Services Agency told The Globe that GCstrategies initially received a sole-sourced contract in April, 2020, worth $2.3-million for work that included ArriveCan. It was also awarded a second contract worth $5.9-million that began on Dec. 20, 2020. Through amendments, the maximum potential value of the first contract grew to $13.9-million.

The CBSA said the first two contracts were replaced by a new $25.4-million contract that GCstrategies won through a competitive process on May 16, 2022. The total potential value of the three GCstrategies contracts is $45.2-million, which would include a mix of work that is both related and unrelated to ArriveCan.

The Globe has also analyzed the total value of federal government payments to GCstrategies as recorded in the public accounts. The public accounts for the 2021-22 fiscal year have not yet been tabled in Parliament, meaning the most current public accounts only cover spending up to March 31, 2021.

Over the five fiscal years from 2016-17 to 2020-21, GCstrategies received $28.3-million from 18 different federal departments and agencies.

GCstrategies managing partner Kristian Firth said in an e-mail Wednesday that his company follows all federal security screening requirements for contracting and subcontracting.

“While I am not going to comment on the political process, GCstrategies is a qualified vendor to provide services to the Government of Canada,” he said.

In a statement to The Globe, the CBSA said it is “satisfied that GCstrategies fully met the requirements and deliverables” outlined in its ArriveCan-related contracting.

Bloc MP and committee vice-chair Julie Vignola told The Globe Wednesday that her party is “certainly in favour” of hearings into ArriveCan.

NDP MP and committee member Gord Johns said he supports a committee study into ArriveCan and would also like MPs to call on the Auditor-General to review the Liberal government’s approach to outsourcing.

“There’s no transparency and it’s out of control. You’ve got expensive consultants that are hiring expensive consultants to deliver services,” he said. “This is just absurd.”",artificial intelligence,the globe and mail

Besides the PC vendors themselves, one of the companies most affected by this decline is Intel, which is now reportedly cutting thousands of jobs to reduce losses in its revenue.

Intel to lay off employees this month

As reported by Bloomberg on Tuesday, Intel is internally planning a “major reduction in headcount.” The report heard from sources familiar with the matter that the number of employees laid off could reach into the thousands. Although the news hasn’t been confirmed by Intel, Bloomberg says the layoffs will be announced any day now.

Intel currently has about 113,700 employees. The report also mentions that the divisions most affected by the cuts will be sales and marketing, which will be reduced by 20%. On October 27, the company will release its fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings report, so Intel wants to cut headcount before then.

The last time Intel made a significant employee cut was in 2016, when about 12,000 people were laid off.

Analysts expect Intel’s revenue to be down 15% in the third quarter, as will the company’s profit margins. Earlier this year, the chipmaker warned that 2022 sales would be about $11 billion lower than expected. A report from IDC revealed that the PC market dropped 15.3% year-on-year to 71.3 million units in Q2 2022.

9to5Mac’s Take

Although the reduction in the PC market is the main reason why Intel is losing money, the chipmaker also lost market share to AMD, its main competitor. In 2020, the chipmaker lost Apple as one of its major clients, as the Cupertino-based company decided to put its own Apple Silicon chips inside Macs.

While Intel has been trying to regain market share with its chips, the company is also investing in areas such as artificial intelligence products and data centers. Intel is even reportedly working with TSMC to build chips using the same 5-nanometer process used for Apple’s M1 chips.

In 2019, the chipmaker sold its modem division to Apple for $1 billion. It’s unclear, however, whether all this will be enough to get the company back on track.

Other companies like Oracle and Arm have also been cutting jobs. Although these are difficult times for everyone in the computer industry, it seems that Intel will face even more challenges than its competitors.

61,The Fiver | Terminator riffs at the ready – it’s Liverpool v Manchester City,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9eec119b763db570865efc354c2ca1192787af2/0_89_2626_1576/master/2626.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a5bf367e0b3a4e9931a8b34afc0726fb,14/10/2022,"Like this?

The football festival of peace, love, understanding and tolerance that is the Human Rights World Cup starts in 37 days, which might seem a fair old while but is just two fewer than Kwasi Kwarteng spent arrogantly tanking the UK economy in his blink-of-an-eye blur as UK chancellor before being chucked under a big red Brexit bus.

Yes, The Fiver’s long been renowned for its ability to see off all comers, and with cutting edge topical humour like that crowbarred into what is supposed to be a wry, sideways look at Liverpool v Manchester City this weekend, it’s small wonder we’ve seen off Dara Ó Briain and his wiseacre cynics on Mock The Week despite their commendable 17-season run.

Before the good and the great of global football converge on Qatar – and Erling Haaland checks himself into Cyberdyne Systems HQ for a month-long recharge and tune-up from the Skynet conscious group mind and artificial general super-intelligence system – there is plenty of business to attend to on the domestic front. And following his uncharacteristically poor showing against Liverpool in July’s Community Shield, The Fiver can’t help but feel Haaland might have some of the unfinished kind on his mind. Nicely rested and goal hungry after a midweek break that entailed nothing more strenuous than a few sideline stretches in Copenhagen, the Norwegian should be in prime condition to strike terror into the hearts of Liverpool’s defenders on Sunday.

“He can’t be bargained with,” said Jürgen Klopp when asked about the threat of Haaland in his pre-match presser, although The Fiver may be paraphrasing in order to continue our laboured Terminator riff. “He can’t be reasoned with. He doesn’t feel pity or remorse or fear and he absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.” However, for all his qualities as a striker, Haaland is going into Sunday’s game on a poor run of form by his own lofty standards, what with having hit the post, missed a tap-in and scored just one goal against Southampton last weekend.

Liverpool, by contrast, enjoyed a much-needed midweek confidence-booster, spanking seven past Rangers in Big Cup, even if they did, as has become customary, allow their hosts to score first. “I know the quality they have,” said Guardiola, talking Liverpool up in that slightly condescending manner he normally reserves for Bournemouth and other City whipping boys. “It has always been a tough game and I don’t expect anything else. I know the quality they have, the character.” And while results thus far suggest it might not be the tough game Guardiola claims and Liverpool are in for a shoeing, Klopp can at least console himself with the fact that until Sunday’s final whistle, the future has not been written and there is no fate but what they make for themselves.

“Can I say, as an AFCB supporter living in Bournemouth with my Rangers-supporting Glaswegian wife, I take Liverpool’s entire season as a personal insult. To be entirely rubbish for whole time, apart from inflicting two record defeats against our clubs, can only be seen as deliberate from where I am standing. While I try to understand what I have done to upset Mr Klopp, the only crumb of comfort I can take is that unless they gain an unlikely win against Manchester City at the weekend, they will still be below us in the table” – Simon Dunsby.

“I’m gutted that I didn’t keep hold of the assistant referee’s flag that I incorrectly raised for offside during my son’s U13 match a few years ago. My son’s team was trailing 2-1 when an opposition player raced through on goal. I lifted my flag, completely missing the fact that our right back (in fairness, a full pitch width away from me and my poor eyesight) was keeping everyone onside. I apologised to the opposition manager, who politely shrugged his shoulders. However, he was far from happy when the match finished 2-2. If I’d kept hold of that flag after the match, like Ali Bin Nasser did with the 1986 Hand of God ball, I’d be hoping to net a cool £2.5 million out of my incompetence” – Steven Pye.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rotem Yossef, a 44-year-old senior director of finance and operations at ClimateAI from the Seattle area. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I worked at Amazon for seven years, most recently as the head of Amazon Web Services' cloud-intelligence partnerships, with internal and external partners on AWS's business-development side. While I was comfortable working for Amazon, I realized last year that corporate America's politics were starting to take their toll on me.

As the COVID-19 pandemic altered the way people prioritized work and life, I knew I needed a change — but had no idea what a midpandemic, midcareer move looked like. I asked myself a question I hadn't had to consider for a long time: ""What do I want to be when I grow up?""

The answer, I realized, wasn't just about my future — it was about my four young children's futures as well, and I was looking for something that was more fulfilling for me and would make the world a better place for them. A new job at a climate-tech startup made perfect sense.

For the majority of my career, I'd worked for large companies in roles that had nothing to do with climate tech. To switch jobs, I first had to do some research and familiarize myself with the landscape.

Climate tech is a broad field, encompassing everything from fusion energy to plant-based proteins, freight optimization, carbon removal, and plastic alternatives. I started with LinkedIn, then wandered into other resources, including Climatebase and Climate Jobs List. The key for me was to explore companies solving problems that were material and interesting to solve, while making a positive impact on people's lives.

I soon realized I'd have to be more specific about the kind of role I wanted. My analytical, financial, project-management, and leadership skills, developed throughout my years in Big Tech and the military service, were applicable to many positions in operations and finance.

As I began to network with more people in the startup world — again using LinkedIn to reach out to connections and connections of connections — I realized that a chief-of-staff role would fit with my skills and personality. In startups, this job frequently entails owning everything that has no dedicated owner, so I knew it would offer me the opportunity to strategize and execute on building important operational systems and processes that would set up the company to scale in size and influence.

I sent my résumé out for about 10 openings and immediately heard back from my current company, ClimateAI, a San Francisco startup that's built an artificial-intelligence-based forecasting platform to optimize supply chains and crop production. I interviewed with ClimateAI's CEO, Himanshu Gupta, and, following a couple more stages, received an offer within 14 days.

That was far quicker than I'd planned

The game plan was to spend more time interviewing, receive a few offers, evaluate them, negotiate, and make a call. After all, the common approach is that job seekers aren't supposed to take the first offer without checking out a few more opportunities.

The ""problem"" was that the offer was spot-on for me, so I decided I'd rather avoid the ""fear of missing out"" and follow a protocol that Amazon uses when interviewing candidates: Start with a strong list of candidates and go with the first one that raised the bar, without looking back. ClimateAI raised the bar. I was thoroughly impressed by the entire C-suite during the interviewing process.

During the process, I completed an assignment where I drafted a strategy brief, which showed me that the way my brain works was aligned with the way the leadership team thought. At the end of the day, I look at a company like an investor: First, how's the team? Then, how's the market? Finally, how's the product? The team won out, the market is driving, and the product is powerful.

I wake up every morning with a smile on my face, fulfilled by the work I'm doing and the impact our company is making

I'm just over a year into the job, and I can confirm that many of the rumors you hear about startups are true: Everything happens at a breakneck speed. It's all hands on deck, all day, every day. There are no political limitations on how you do things. On the climate-tech side, you feel far more fulfilled working for a purpose-driven company. And it comes with a ""nice"" pay cut, counterbalanced by a dream of an ""exit.""

Luckily, I thrive in fast-paced environments with new challenges every day, and that's exactly what a chief of staff at a startup handles. I went through a thorough process when figuring it all out, so I was mentally and financially prepared to enjoy the startup life's benefits. I was assured that I had health insurance, could work remotely, had generous sick leave, and had unlimited vacation with a required minimum of paid-time-off days (versus limited time off at Amazon).

Working for a startup offers more vertical career-growth potential: It's a pure meritocracy, free of politics and rigid hierarchical structures. In no time, my responsibilities expanded to owning finance, human resources, IT, legal, and even a chunk of investor relations — leading to a promotion to senior director of finance and operations this summer.

It's also an exciting time to be in climate tech

Venture-capital investment in climate tech increased 80% between 2020 and 2021 in the US alone. ClimateAI has wrapped up its seed-investment and Series A funding rounds, having raised $16 million to date.

It's invigorating to see how we've grown as a team: The team has expanded to more than 50 employees, up from about 25 when I started. I'm allocated 50% of another employee's time for support and get to be hands-on with our investors, as I manage communications and meetings with our leading Series A VCs and with prospective investors for our Series B.

Beyond this, I feel fulfilled pursuing a career that connects me more with my values. I've always been an advocate for a sustainable lifestyle: When I was a college student in Israel 20 years ago, I recycled everything possible, even when that meant jumping over fences to sneak into restricted-access buildings that had the only cardboard-recycling facility on campus.

Today, my family uses a specialized recycling service to recycle items like plastic film, bread clips, and twist ties (yup, those can be recycled). My house has no gasoline-consuming devices, including only LED lights, energy-efficient appliances, and an electric lawn mower. Working in climate tech means that when I go to work, I continue to pursue the same values.

For others looking to make this move, I recommend starting with what — and whom — you know

You should never just apply for a job — thousands of candidates do that. Instead, use your LinkedIn network to reach out to the company's CEO via a mutual friend or a friend of a friend. Go as high as you can with as close a friend as you can. Your network should be built up every day, not just when you're looking for a job.

You also must follow the space. Read, read, read — and understand the dynamics and implications of working for a startup and for a startup in the space you're aiming at. You should also research roles: What are startups looking for? Is there a role that fits you in this space? I suggest reaching out to employers with an open role they have in mind, and if there's none, you might get lucky suggesting one — but you'll have to present a very strong case for creating a role just for you.

Overall, this transition has been 100% worth it for me. Moving out of corporate America to a small startup was a challenge, but the opportunity to build a company and a cutting-edge product that aligns with my values was the chance of a lifetime.",artificial intelligence,business insider

Scientists have begun turning to new tools offered by machine learning to help save time and money. In the past several years, nuclear physics has seen a flurry of machine learning projects come online, with many papers published on the subject. Now, 18 authors from 11 institutions summarize this explosion of artificial intelligence-aided work in ""Machine Learning in Nuclear Physics,"" a paper recently published in Reviews of Modern Physics.

""It was important to document the work that has been done. We really do want to raise the profile of the use of machine learning in nuclear physics to help people see the breadth of the activities,"" said Amber Boehnlein, lead author of the paper and the associate director for computational science and technology at the U.S. Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.

Because the paper gathers and summarizes major work in the field thus far, Boehnlein hopes it can act as an educational resource for interested readers, as well as a roadmap for future endeavors.

""It provides a benchmark that people can use as they go forward into the next phase,"" she said.

A machine learning revolution

After attending a workshop exploring artificial intelligence at Jefferson Lab in March 2020 and publishing a follow-up report, Boehnlein and two of her co-authors, Witold Nazarewicz and Michelle Kuchera, were inspired to go a step further. Together with 15 colleagues representing all subfields of nuclear physics, they decided to conduct a survey of the state of machine learning projects in nuclear physics.

They started at the beginning. As the authors describe, the first significant work employing machine learning in nuclear physics used computer experiments to study nuclear properties, such as atomic masses, in 1992. Although this work hinted at machine learning's potential, its use in the field remained minimal for more than two decades. In the last several years, that changed.

Machine learning, which involves building models that can perform tasks without explicit instruction, requires computers to do specific things, including complicated calculations. With recent advances, computers can better meet these demands, which has allowed physicists to more readily incorporate machine learning into their work.

""This would have been a less interesting paper in 2019, because there wouldn't have been enough work to catalog. But now, there is significant work to cite due to the increased use of the techniques,"" Boehnlein said

Today, machine learning spans all scales and energy ranges of research, from investigations of matter's building blocks to inquiries into the life cycles of stars. It is also found across the four subfields of nuclear physics: theory, experiment, accelerator science and operations, and data science.

""We made an effort to compile a comprehensive, collective resource that bridges the efforts in our subfields, which will hopefully spark rich discussions and innovation across nuclear physics,"" said co-author Kuchera, who is an associate professor of physics and computer science at Davidson College.

Machine learning models can be used to help both the design and execution of experiments in nuclear physics. They can also be used to aid in the analysis of those experiments' data, of which there is often in excess of petabytes.

""I expect machine learning to become embedded into our data collection and analysis,"" Kuchera said.

Machine learning will speed up these processes, which could mean less time and money is needed for beamtime, computer usage, and other experimental costs.

Connecting theory and experiment

So far, however, machine learning has developed the strongest foothold in nuclear theory. Nazarewicz, who is a nuclear theorist and chief scientist at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University, is especially interested in this subject. He says that machine learning can help theorists do advanced calculations faster, improve and simplify models, make predictions, and help theorists understand the uncertainties of their predictions. It can also be used to study phenomena that researchers cannot conduct experiments on, such as supernova explosions or neutron stars.

""Neutron stars are not very user friendly,"" said Nazarewicz.

He uses machine learning to study hyperheavy nuclei and elements, which have so many protons and neutrons in their nuclei that they can't be observed experimentally.

""I find the results to be the most impressive in the theory community, particularly the low-energy theory community that Witold is associated with,"" Boehnlein said. ""They seem to be really embracing these techniques.""

Boehnlein said theorists have also started to embrace these techniques at Jefferson Lab in their study of proton and neutron structures. Specifically, machine learning can help extract information from complicated theories, such as quantum chromodynamics, the theory that describes the interactions between the quarks and gluons that make up protons and neutrons.

The authors predict that machine learning's involvement in both theory and experiment will speed up these subfields independently, and it will also better interconnect them to speed up the entire loop of the scientific process.

""Nuclear physics helps us make discoveries to better understand the nature of our universe, and it's also used for societal applications,"" said Nazarewicz. ""The faster we can do the cycle between experiment and theory, the faster we will arrive at discoveries and applications.""

As machine learning continues to grow in this field, the authors expect to see more developments and broader applications incorporating this tool.

""I think we're only in the infancy of the application of machine learning to nuclear physics,"" Boehnlein said.

And, along the way, this paper will act as a reference, even for its own authors.

""I hope the paper is used as a resource to understand the current state of machine learning research, allowing us to build from these efforts,"" Kuchera said. ""My research is centered on machine learning methods, so I absolutely will utilize this paper as a window into the state of machine learning across nuclear physics right now.""",artificial intelligence,phys.org

65,The rural areas missing out on AI opportunities,https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-022-03212-7/d41586-022-03212-7_23587028.jpg,12/10/2022,Behavioural data scientist Ganna Pogrebna believes the AI revolution is overlooking remote communities.,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03212-7,"Ganna Pogrebna.Credit: Alexander Kharlamov

The study of artificial intelligence (AI) is a relatively new field but one that is rapidly expanding. In 2015, researchers in the United States published 850 articles on artificial intelligence and robotics in journals tracked by the Nature Index; that figure had risen to 3,651 by 2021. Such rapid growth has been mirrored elsewhere, and although it might be cause for excitement, it is also good reason to be wary of biases and inconsistencies in how this research is conducted and applied.

One of these potential discrepancies is the way in which AI relates to urban and rural communities. According to Ganna Pogrebna, executive director of the Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Futures Institute at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst, New South Wales, those living in remote areas are potentially more exposed to the technology’s dangers than their urban counterparts, but are being neglected by research.

How are rural communities treated differently by AI?

It starts with data collection, which is often harvested from our smart phones. Urban populations are more likely to use iPhones whereas rural populations lean towards Android. A 2021 study (D. J. Leith In Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (ed. J. Garcia-Alfaro et al.) 231–251; Springer, 2021) found that Android phones give Google 20 times more data than iPhones send to Apple. Android phones dominate in more rural countries such as those in Africa where 87.22% of the population use Android phones.

Nature Index 2022 AI and robotics

More data are therefore harvested from rural populations than urban ones. That’s the first half of this issue.

What are the consequences of this inequality in data gathering? Doesn’t it benefit rural areas?

When technology is created off the back of those data, it ends up benefiting urban populations and so you have a situation where rural data are being used to enrich urban lives — that’s the second half of this issue. For example, a 2019 study (J. Guerra et al. PLoS ONE 14, e0215278; 2019) found that public-health AI projects primarily use community-based surveillance data collected from rural areas, but the studies that use these data are informing public-health policies in urban areas.

Facial recognition is another noteworthy example. A lot of the data used to make facial recognition possible are generated from rural environments, but the technology is primarily used in metropolitan areas. Cities in some countries are trialling ‘pay with your face’ schemes in their public transport networks, which recognize a traveller’s face and track their journey from start to finish before charging their credit card. Cities in China are meanwhile using facial recognition to help with COVID-19 contact tracing. So rural data are being used in urban settings and that’s not necessarily reciprocated.

How would AI improve rural communities if they were able to better access the technology?

Rural communities are largely missing out on the benefits of data-driven research and that’s a big shame because AI has the potential to improve country life. I’m based in rural Australia where we often face flooding and forest fires; there are projects going on at the moment that seek to use AI to advance disaster management in remote communities. Algorithms are mining social-media posts to learn from the language being used and the pictures being shared to deduce whether flooding is happening and to what extent. This can then be used to predict which areas might be flooded next and how badly. It can give us several hours’ head-start in rural areas where resources are stretched.

Are you optimistic that this AI regional-urban gap will ever be closed? What can be done to solve or improve the situation?

I’m optimistic that things will improve. Farmers and local businesses see that AI has the potential to ensure their products reach where they’re most needed. We need to look at the reasons why AI projects tend to be rolled out in cities, and not in the country.

First, it’s about digital infrastructure. As soon as you leave Sydney and go just a few miles into the mountains, you lose mobile-phone reception. People are talking about 5G and 6G connections in some parts of the world, but frankly, you’re lucky if you have 3G in the countryside here and Australia isn’t alone with this disparity. A 2018 survey carried out by the Pew Research Center found that almost 25% of adults who live in rural parts of the United States said access to high-speed Internet was a major problem for them, compared with just 13% of adults in urban areas and 9% in suburban districts. Rural communities are missing out on AI for infrastructural reasons that aren’t within their control. That needs to change.

Second, it can be a challenge to recruit talent to come to these areas and work on AI. I work from the Bathurst campus of Charles Sturt University, which is a three-hour drive inland from Sydney, and it’s difficult to find people who are willing to move to the country. I don’t want this to turn into an advertisement for our institution, but I do think it would be good if more AI researchers worked in rural areas like Bathurst because it helps you as a researcher to better understand the challenges of living in a rural area. Having more institutes in rural areas also helps with education; if more AI experts are here it means we can help to increase the local community’s understanding of the benefits of AI.

I’m optimistic, but closing the gap will require work from local communities, researchers and government.",artificial intelligence,nature.com

A community can be formed in many ways. For example, it can be done through social media, offline events or by creating an online forum. In order to create a community on social media, you should post that will attract people who have similar interests as you. You should also make sure that the content is interesting enough to keep them coming back for more. But basically, you have to execute four main things in order to get going in the right direction:

Define the core values of yourself and your community. Go live on a regular basis (minimum once a week). Use the common language of your target audience (through qualitative studies and conversations, you identify pain points and needs of your audience). Co-creation of content (integrating and tagging people you interviewed in your podcast and from Q&A sessions, for example).

This is how I executed these four steps in order to build my community, and it will also work for your brand if you're willing to execute and answer a couple of questions:

Related: 3 Examples of How to Build a Strong Brand Community

Define the core values of yourself and your community

This first step already was tough for me, because I was not really sure about my core values. ""What is a value at all?"" I asked myself. I am from Germany, and being on time is also, for many people, a value. I thought about my existing clients and how they think about artificial intelligence. They are all fascinated by AI and use it almost on a daily basis. A common thought that I heard in my live shows was that AI is a strong tool and is here to help human beings. So, I wrote that down: ""AI is a tool and not a human replacement.""

The other thing that I thought a lot about is that I am very focused on these tools, and I could do this all day long — testing new tools and giving feedback on a regular basis — but most people don't like to test new tools. So, this is a big pain point for a lot of companies, and CEOs struggle to convince their teams because they are afraid of being replaced. So, I wrote down ""People and training first. AI second."" It made sense for me to define this approach and make sure that our responsibility is to train people so that they can use AI in the right and ethical way.

It is important to find your people and build a community with core values. It can be a blog, podcast or YouTube channel. The idea is that you are building an audience of people who are interested in the same things as you are. However, a community is not just a group of people who share the same interests. It's more than that — it's a group of people who share the same values and beliefs, which creates an emotional connection between them.

Values can be a powerful tool for driving change in your business, but they have to be authentic. Values can be used to influence behavior, create meaning for employees and customers, attract talent, build trust with customers, set standards for quality of service or product and achieve business goals. A company's values should align with its mission statement and create an emotional connection between the company and its customers. Core values should be a clear expression of who you are as a company or organization, as well as what you stand for.

The more clear you are about your core values, the easier it is for you to build trust with customers. So, make sure to ask yourself these questions:

What do you want to stand for as a company?

What do you want to represent?

What are the beliefs that drive your decisions?

Once you have the answers to these questions, make sure they are communicated internally and externally so that they guide every decision and action taken by everyone in the company.

Go live on a regular basis (once a week at minimum)

Going live on a regular basis is one of the core components of community-building. You just have to make sure that it is not only about your products and services. It should go deeper than that and have real value for the people you want in your community — which creates trust. This is a very iterative process! When I first started, I spoke with my interview guests about broader topics like and sales. Then I was introduced to the world of AI-generated content and thought, ""That is really cool! I want to get more knowledge about all these tools and the founders,"" so I launched a new concept and started interviewing CEOs of software companies.

Going live and interviewing those people helped me to build strong relationships with them, and I also started to work with them more closely. Some became clients, some became cooperation partners, and we support each other. The main point here is that going live and creating content together is a very strong approach to building trust online.

Use the common language of your target audience

This sounds like a big step, but this is really easy to do with a survey that you organize. I did a simple Google Survey and sent it to all my interview guests within the AI niche. They responded with quotes, concerns and struggles they have in their head. One common thing was that they didn't have time to create content for themselves. Even when they are CEO of an AI-generating software, they couldn't sit down for 60 minutes to go live or write a blog article. This was fascinating for me because I didn't have that on the radar, but through this survey, I was stepping into the conversation in their heads and using their own words for my own content campaigns.

Co-creation of content

This is really where the magic happens. Co-creation of content is still under the radar for many entrepreneurs. The idea is simple: People support what they create. This means if you have questions from the chat or live interaction, for example, you can create additional content from their questions. You're repurposing the content they produce. Always mention these people and tag those who appeared in your show. You can upload your live show and create micro-content pieces out of the larger video. People who are tagged are very likely to share it and like it because their name appears in this content. When you do this all the time, people feel appreciated for asking questions and showing up — that's how you build a strong community.

The important thing to remember is that this is an iterative process. A good starting point is getting in touch with potential clients or cooperation partners and speaking with them. As marketers, we should stop being too much in our own heads and start being empathic and getting into the heads of our clients and partners. In order to start your own community, take these steps. and execute them. The journey may not be easy, but it will be worth it.",artificial intelligence,entrepreneur

However, the tech industry is expected to grow significantly in...",https://stocknews.com/news/csco-nok-audc-interested-in-tech-3-stocks-to-start-with-this-fall/,"Tech stocks have been hammered since the beginning of the year due to the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes to tackle the high inflation. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is in the bear market, having fallen 32.6% year-to-date.

Many experts believe that tech stocks will likely tumble further as the Fed continues its aggressive rate hikes. Fed officials have now raised the key rate prediction for this year to 4.25% to 4.5% from the previously projected 3.25% to 3.5%.

Despite the current headwinds, the tech industry is expected to grow significantly in the long run due to the growing reliance of businesses on tech solutions, consistent innovations, and rising corporate and government investments.

Demand for tech goods and services is expected to keep rising amid the fast-growing adoption of cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), the internet of things (IoT), data analytics, blockchain, and increasing automation of business processes. The global information technology market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.3% to reach $13.81 trillion by 2026.

Amid this backdrop, we think it could be wise to invest in fundamentally strong tech stocks Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), Nokia Oyj (NOK), and AudioCodes Ltd. (AUDC) to capitalize on the industry’s long-term growth prospects.

The Bank of England acted again to stabilise bond markets and increased its maximum daily purchases of long-dated gilts. The central bank is buying the bonds through a temporary programme it created after markets took fright at the government’s plans for unfunded tax cuts. The programme is supposed to end on October 14th. British pension funds want it to be extended. They are taking a hit from collateral calls on derivatives linked to bond prices, leaving them with a short-term financing problem.

Dire straits

The turmoil pushed up the costs of financing Britain’s government debt, with the interest rate on ten-year bonds climbing back to levels that prompted the Bank of England’s first emergency intervention in September. In an attempt to regain credibility in the markets, Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor of the exchequer, brought forward the date of his “fiscal plan”, which will explain how his tax cuts are to be paid for, to October 31st.

With markets expecting the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates, the yield on American government bonds has also increased. That has pushed up mortgage rates in America, which are linked to the yield. The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has climbed above 6.8%, the highest level since 2006, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Global inflation is expected to peak later this year but remain elevated in 2023, said the IMF in its latest outlook. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to “destabilise the global economy”, said the fund, which shaved its forecast for global GDP growth next year to 2.7%. With the world economy “headed for stormy waters” the IMF thinks that investors will turn to safe assets, such as US Treasuries, pushing the dollar even higher. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF ’s managing director, predicted that the near future will be “more volatile, more fragile”.

General Motors launched a new business to help customers charge their electric cars and keep their power bills down. GM Energy’s energy-management system is similar to the one sold by Tesla.

A consortium backed by private equity agreed to pay $7.9bn for Westinghouse Electric, which provides nuclear services including nuclear fuel and maintenance to around half the reactors worldwide. The deal is seen as a big investment in the future of nuclear power. In order for the world to hit net-zero carbon goals, nuclear generation needs to double by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency.

Billions of dollars were wiped off the stockmarket value of Chinese chipmakers, after the Biden administration issued new export controls that severely curtail their access to American technology. The sell-off in shares soon extended to chipmakers in other countries. The new rules will make it much harder for Chinese companies to develop supercomputers and will slow their advance in artificial intelligence, a technology in which China claims to be a world leader.

Global shipments of personal computers fell by 19.5% in the third quarter, year on year, according to Gartner. It is the biggest decline in the consulting firm’s survey since it began tracking the market in the mid-1990s. Sales boomed during the pandemic, before inflation ate into spending budgets. Chipmakers are feeling the effects. Intel is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs as demand for its PC processors slows. Personal computers could become a thing of the past if Meta’s new virtual-reality headset takes off. Facebook’s parent company launched the Quest Pro this week, which is marketing itself to companies as a means of improving employees’ interaction. It is Meta’s first headset with inward-facing sensors, which can replicate a person’s smile, or even eye contact with someone. Meta also announced partnerships with Microsoft and Zoom, as it seeks to expand the metaverse to home working. The share prices of DoorDash, Lyft, Uber and other gig-economy companies fell sharply after America’s Labour Department proposed new guidelines to determine if workers at such firms are contractors or employees. As contractors, the workers do not receive many benefits. However, the terms of the government’s proposal are limited to issues over pay.

TP-Link has announced a quad-band Wi-Fi 6E router and a tri-band AI-powered mesh networking system that can cover up to 6,500 square feet.

Announced on Tuesday, TP-Link's latest networking devices are the Wi-Fi 6E Archer AXE16000 quad-band router and Deco AXE11000 tri-band Wi-Fi system. Both systems offer fast speeds, wide network coverage, and a lot of bandwidth.

Archer quad-band router

The Archer router offers up to 15.6Gbps speeds using quad-band Wi-Fi 6E for multiple users to browse the web, stream video, and download files. The newly supported 6GHz wireless band avoids interference for congestion-free network traffic, and the company promises it offers near-zero latency.

The 2.0GHz quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM deliver fast transmission speeds and smooth operation of devices and apps. Eight high-performance dual-band antennas and beamforming provide enough bandwidth for 16 simultaneous data streams.

The router has a 10Gbps WAN/LAN port, a 10Gbps Ethernet/Fiber combination WAN/LAN port, a 2.5 Gbps WAN/LAN port, four Gigabit LAN ports, and one USB 3.0 port.

Deco tri-band mesh system

The Deco delivers tri-band Wi-Fi with a 6GHz band, giving a total speed of 10.8Gbps. It adds seven 160MHz channels to reduce network congestion and drops in speed.

The 6GHz band also reinforces the backhaul performance between Deco units, offering a robust network for homes up to 6,500 square feet for the two-pack product.

Using internal high-gain antennas, the Deco provides 16 simultaneous data streams, eight of which are on the 5 GHz band. TP-Link says it has a 10Gbps port that gives ten times the wired speed of a standard Gigabit Ethernet port.

The mesh technology uses artificial intelligence to learn and adjust the system to fit each home environment and network load best. Devices can switch to another network source when necessary using self-learning algorithms.

The Deco offers WPA3 network encryption and TP-Link HomeShield, which blocks unauthorized access, encrypts data, and protects against cyber attacks.

75,Deep language algorithms predict semantic comprehension from brain activity,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-022-20460-9/MediaObjects/41598_2022_20460_Fig1_HTML.png,13/10/2022,Scientific Reports - Deep language algorithms predict semantic comprehension from brain activity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20460-9,"GPT-2’s activations linearly map onto fMRI responses to spoken narratives

To assess whether GPT-2 generates similar representations to those of the brain, we analyze the Narratives dataset: 101 subjects listening to seven short stories while their brain activity is recorded with fMRI. Note that subjects do not necessarily listen to the same stories (Fig. 3). First, we evaluate, for each voxel, subject and narrative independently, whether the fMRI responses can be predicted from a linear combination of GPT-2’s activations (Fig. 1A). We summarize the precision of this mapping with a brain score \(\mathcal {M}\): i.e. the correlation between the true fMRI responses and the fMRI responses linearly predicted, with cross-validation, from GPT-2’s responses to the same narratives (cf. Methods).

To mitigate the spatial resolution of fMRI and the necessity to correct voxel analyses for multiple comparisons, we here report either 1) the average brain scores across voxels or 2) the average score within each region of interest (\(n=314\), following an automatic subdivision of the Destrieux atlas27, cf. Supplementary Information A), and correct statistical tests for multiple comparisons across the brain regions. Consistent with previous findings5,7,29,30, these brain scores are significant over a distributed and bilateral cortical network, and peak in middle- and superior-temporal gyri and sulci, as well as in the supra-marginal and the infero-frontal cortex5,7,29 (Fig. 1B).

By separately analyzing the activations of each layer of GPT-2, we confirm that middle layers best map onto the brain (Fig. 1C), as previously reported5,7,29. For clarity, the following analyses focus on the activations extracted from the eighth layer, i.e. the layer with the highest brain score on average across voxels (Fig. 1C). However, the results generalize to other contextual layers of GPT-2 (Supplementary Information E, Supplementary Fig. S4).

The brain predictions of GPT-2 correlate with semantic comprehension

Does the linear mapping between GPT-2 and the brain reflect a fortunate correspondence7? Or, on the contrary, does it reflect similar representations of high-level semantics8? To address this issue, we correlate these brain scores to the level of comprehension of the subjects, assessed for each subject-story pair with a questionnaire at the end of each story. On average across all voxels, the correlation between brain scores and comprehension reaches \(\mathcal {R}=0.50\) (\(p<10^{-15}\), Fig. 1D, as assessed across subject-story pairs with the Pearson’s test provided by SciPy28). This correlation is significant across a wide variety of the bilateral temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices typically linked to language processing (Fig. 1E). Together, these results suggest that the shared representations between GPT-2 and the brain reliably vary with semantic comprehension.

Low-level processing only partially accounts for the correlation between comprehension and GPT-2’s mapping

Low-level speech representations typically vary with attention31,32, and could thus, in turn, influence down-stream comprehension processes. Consequently, one can legitimately wonder whether the correlation between comprehension and GPT-2’s brain mapping is simply driven by variations in low-level auditory processing. To address this issue, we evaluate the predictability of fMRI given low-level phonological features: the word rate, phoneme rate, phonemes, stress and tone of the narrative (cf. Methods). The corresponding brain scores correlate with the subjects’ understanding (\(\mathcal {R}=0.17, p<10^{-2}\)) but considerably less than the brain scores of GPT-2 (\(\Delta \mathcal {R}=0.32\)). These low-level correlations with comprehension peak in the left superior temporal cortex (Fig. 1F). Overall, this result suggests that the link between comprehension and GPT-2’s brain mapping may be partially explained by – but not reduced to – the variations of low-level auditory processing.

High-level representations best predict comprehension

Is the correlation between comprehension and GPT-2’s mapping driven by a lexical process and/or by an ability to meaningfully combine words? To tackle this issue, we compare the correlations obtained from GPT-2’s word embedding (i.e. layer 0) to those obtained from GPT-2’s eighth layer, i.e. a contextual embedding. On average across voxels, the correlation with comprehension is 0.12 lower with GPT-2’s word embedding than with its contextual embedding. An analogous analysis, comparing word embedding to phonological features is displayed in Fig. 1F. Strictly lexical effects (word-embedding versus phonological) peak in the superior-temporal lobe and in pars triangularis. By contrast, higher-level effects (GPT-2 eighth layer versus word-embedding) peak in the superior-frontal, posterior superior-temporal gyrus, in the precuneus and in both the triangular and opercular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus – a network typically associated with high-level language comprehension7,33,34,35,36,37. Together, these model comparisons suggest that GPT-2 best predicts how brain responses to speech vary with comprehension.

Comprehension effects are mainly driven by individuals’ variability

The variability in comprehension scores could result from exogeneous factors (e.g. some stories may be harder to comprehend than others for GPT-2) and/or from endogeneous factors (e.g. some subjects may better understand specific texts because of prior knowledge). To address this issue, we fit a linear mixed model to predict comprehension scores given brain scores, specifying the narrative as a random effect (cf. Supplementary Information B). The fixed effect of brain score (shared across narratives) is highly significant: \(\beta =\,0.04, p<10^{-29}\), cf. Supplementary Information B). However, the random effect (slope specific to each single narrative) is not (\(\beta <10^{-2}\), \(p>\,0.11\)). We also replicate the main analysis (Fig. 1D) within each single narrative: the correlation with comprehension reaches 0.76 for the ‘Sherlock’ story and is above 0.40 for every story (cf. Supplementary Information C). Overall, these analyses confirm that the link between GPT-2 and semantic comprehension is best accounted for by an endogeneous factor: i.e. individual differences in comprehension scores.

Decomposing the brain regions, levels of representation and attention distances underlying comprehension

Can GPT-2 be further decomposed to identify the mechanisms responsible for generating representations that both (i) map with the human brain and (ii) predict subjects’ comprehension? To address this issue, we investigate the links between (1) short- and long-range attentional gating, (2) the depth of the representation and (3) brain and comprehension scores. Specifically, we compute both of these scores for different GPT-2 layer k, when restricting their attention span to different distances d (i.e. layers \(k'\le k\) only access the d previous words). By systematically and independently varying k and d, we can compute \(\beta _{\mathrm {distance}}\) and \(\beta _{\mathrm {layer}}\): the two coefficients that indicate how brain scores and comprehension scores vary across layers and attentional spans, respectively. Precisely, a positive \(\beta _{\mathrm {distance}}\) indicates that scores are sensitive to long-range dependencies. On the contrary, a null \(\beta _{\mathrm {distance}}\) indicates that scores are not sensitive to long-range-dependencies. Similarly, a positive \(\beta _{\mathrm {layer}}\) indicates that deep layers have better scores than shallow layers, while a negative \(\beta _{\mathrm {layer}}\) indicates that shallow layers have better scores than deep layers.

Our results are three-fold. First, both the brain score (\(\mathcal {M}\)) and the comprehension scores (\(\mathcal {R}\)) increase with the attention span (\(\beta _{\mathrm {distance}}>0\), \(p^{M}<10^{-14}\) for brain scores, \(p^{R}=\,0.01\) for comprehension scores) as well as with the depth of the representation (\(\beta _{\mathrm {layer}}>0\), \(p^{M}< 10^{-4}\), \(p^{R}=\,0.001\)). The gain in scores obtained with attention to distant context is observed even up to the most distant items (e.g. between distance \(\approx 1000\) and 300 words: \(\Delta R>\,0\), \(p^{M}<10^{-4}\), \(p^{R}=\,0.02\), Fig. 2A).

Second, the attention span primarily impacts the brain scores and the comprehension scores of the middle layers (difference between layer 8 and layer 12: \(\Delta \beta _{\mathrm {distance}}=\,0.001\), \(p^{M}<10^{-8}\) for brain scores, \(\Delta \beta _{\mathrm {distance}}=\,0.03\), \(p^{R}=\,0.005\) for comprehension scores, Fig. 2AD). Interestingly, and to our surprise, restricting the attention span of the first layers improved their ability to predict comprehension (e.g. for the first layer, difference between scores with an attention of 10 words and full attention \(\Delta R=\,0.06\), \(p=\,0.004\), Fig. 2D). This unexpected result suggests that language transformers could be made more similar to the brain by increasing the attention span as a function of depth.

Finally, brain regions commonly associated with high-level comprehension are better predicted by the deep and contextual representations of the network, and their corresponding brain scores and comprehension scores are relatively strongly modulated by long-distance attention (e.g. in angular gyrus: \(\beta _{\mathrm {layer}}= 0.14>0\), \(p=\,0.002\), \(\beta _{\mathrm {distance}}=\,0.03>0\), \(p=\,0.016\) for comprehension scores). On the contrary, low-level acoustic regions are best predicted by the shallow layers of the network, and are, in comparison, little altered by long-distance dependencies (e.g. for the comprehension scores in Heschl gyrus, \(\beta _{\mathrm {layer}}=\,-0.076<0\), \(p=\,0.004\), \(\beta _{\mathrm {distance}}=\,-0.014<0\), \(p=\,0.012\)).

Overall, our analysis suggests that comprehension depends on a hierarchy of neural representations, whereby the first areas of the language network deploys shallow and short-span attention processes, while the fronto–parietal network relies on compositional and long-span attention processes. Interestingly, our analysis also highlights that shortening the attention span of lower layers makes them more brain-like, and could perhaps thus provide a useful inductive bias to these algorithms.",artificial intelligence,nature.com

New research suggests that changes in police agency educational requirements could save lives.

The study is unique because it’s one of the first studies to explore the nexus of officer education and victim race, says Thad Johnson, assistant professor of criminology at Georgia State University.

Repeated incidents of deadly officer-involved shootings have sparked both outrage and protests across the US over the past several years. What many of these incidents share in common is the race of the victim and the fact that they were unarmed.

According to the Washington Post, more than 1,000 people have been shot and killed by police in the past year, and the rate at which Black Americans are killed by police is more than twice as high as the rate for their white counterparts.

“Until now, investigations of racial differences regarding the education level of officers on police-caused fatalities have been virtually nonexistent,” Johnson explains.

In the new study published in the Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology, Johnson and his colleagues looked at data from multiple law enforcement databases from 235 large US cities between 2000 and 2016. They found that college degree requirements are linked to significant reductions in police-related fatalities involving Black and unarmed citizens. The work suggests that mandating at least an associate degree for entry-level officers could lower the number of Black people killed by police by as much as three times.

Here, Johnson shares insight into his work, including the changes he believes are necessary to bring about a more equitable justice system:",artificial intelligence,futurity: research news

She also loved “just how kickass Cathy and Heathcliff were – that feeling of being misunderstood and not belonging. As a teenager, their rebelliousness really spoke to me.” Forty years later, she has brought those sense memories to a story about the novel’s author Emily Brontë, in a directorial debut that she expects to enrage some purists while hoping it will inspire a new generation of young women as the novel once inspired her.

The woman who breezes up for a photoshoot and interview from her north London home, where she lives with her actor husband Gerald Lepkowski and their 17-year-old son, is simply and practically dressed for the turn of the English seasons. Though she has a makeup artist in tow, there’s nothing look-at-me about an actor whose own starring roles in period dramas have included the title role in Madame Bovary, Fanny Price in Mansfield Park and Rose, glamorous wife of the retail genius in the ITV hit series Mr Selfridge.

She speaks in a slight Australian accent, ending every sentence on an upward note, which has the effect of making statements into questions. “That’s a bit ageist?” she snaps, when I clumsily ask why she has left it so late to graduate from acting to directing. It’s a bracingly – and refreshingly – direct rebuke, which is of a piece with her explanation of a film that’s something of a feminist passion project. “I would have done it 10 years ago, but I just think women second guess ourselves a lot. And sometimes it takes us a while to get the courage to step into something that we really feel passionate about,” she says. “But if you’re going to tell a story now, I think it’s good for it to speak to women in a way that’s alive, rather than as something they’re looking at from behind a very respectful glass case.”

Emily is not a conventional biopic, a fact it signals early on with a creepy mask-play in which Emily (played by Sex Education’s Emma Mackey) freaks out her siblings by appearing to invoke the spirit of their dead mother. “Anyone who gets past the mask scene and thinks they’re still watching a biopic is probably in the wrong movie,” says O’Connor. The question that drives it is how the prickly recluse of historical record, holed up with her siblings in a parsonage (apart from a brief, disastrous stint as a schoolteacher), could have been able to summon such passion not only in her single novel but in her poetry.

O’Connor’s answer is to pair her up with one of the six curates who joined the Brontë household over the years: a man so beloved by the parishioners that he was memorialised by them, after his untimely death from cholera, in a plaque on the wall of Haworth church. William Weightman, it reads, was a man of “orthodox principles, active zeal, moral habits, learning, mildness and affability” – not the qualities that are brought most quickly to mind by Oliver Jackson-Cohen’s lusty portrayal.

Yes, but wasn’t it Anne Brontë with whom Weightman was thought to have had a romantic entanglement? “It is, but if you read up on it it’s disputed. There was one comment from Charlotte and that’s it,” says O’Connor, who cites a range of Brontë studies, not least one by Lucasta Miller, which argued that each age recreates the family in its own image. This may be fiction, but it has been conscientiously thought through.

O’Connor traces the seeds of the film back to the late 1990s, when she was in London as the lead in a star-studded film of Mansfield Park. Finding herself at a loose end when the writer-director went off sick for a fortnight, she jumped on a train to Haworth. “I was so in love with acting that I didn’t even think of directing. But I did think this is such an evocative place, and they’re such interesting characters. I felt a little bit close to them in a way, and there was something that was very cool about that. It just really piqued my imagination.”

As the middle child of five – with one brother and three sisters – who was born in the UK but emigrated to Australia when she was two years old, she felt a particular kinship with the Brontë siblings running wild on the Yorkshire moors. “We lived in the middle of nowhere and our mum, in classic 70s/80s style, would say: ‘I don’t want to see you till lunchtime.’ So we would just disappear for hours and use our imaginations to create worlds. We, too, loved roaming out on the land, and were our own best friends.”

While her siblings followed their physicist father into science, or took up musical instruments like their pianist mother, O’Connor asserted herself by becoming “a bit of a black sheep, a bit of a traveller”. Like Emily Brontë she is an introvert, she says, but she also had a middle child’s look-at-me survival instinct. At university in Western Australia she was introduced to critical thinking. “We did gendered reading and things that completely flipped your brain in terms of thinking about literature in a different way. It taught you that each person can have a completely different experience of a text, which is kind of helpful for this.”

Her international acting career took off when, as fugitive lover Nikki in Kiss Or Kill, one of three Australian films she made in two years, she caught the eye of the Canadian writer-director Patricia Rozema, who was looking for an actor who could free Jane Austen’s Fanny Price from her canonical straitjacket. O’Connor duly reinvented her, in a cast that included Harold Pinter, Jonny Lee Miller and Lindsay Duncan, as an ambitious but socially disadvantaged writer whose wit and integrity were two sides of the same coin.

Within a year she was up with the A-list, appearing alongside Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Fraser in a remake of Bedazzled, Jude Law and William Hurt in Steven Spielberg’s AI: Artificial Intelligence, and Judi Dench and Rupert Everett in The Importance of Being Earnest. Though not all of her films were successes, she herself rarely put a foot wrong on screen or stage. And so it has continued, with more recent TV roles including the mother of an abducted boy in the heart-rending BBC drama The Missing, Hecuba in Troy: Fall of a City, and as Harriet Walter’s daughter in the euthanasia series The End.

“I’ve been lucky,” she says, but acting success doesn’t make a case for the financing of a directorial debut. “I was working at it between acting projects, but at a certain point five years ago I thought: I’ve got to get serious about this. Then the pandemic happened in the middle of financing. So it was very difficult. A lot of the funding bodies weren’t sure about me, but here was a group of people who really believed in me and the project, and my passion for it.”

Emily was filmed on a shoestring, leaning heavily on the photogenically weather-racked landscapes of Yorkshire and Cumbria. A Cumbrian manor house stood in for Haworth parsonage. “There was this one windy road in and out of the house, but what’s interesting about it is that it was actually one of the things that inspired Emily to write Wuthering Heights because it was owned by a rum-trading colonist, and there was rumour that there was a slave who died there. I’m pretty sure it was haunted,” she says.

One theme that underpins the film is how hard it is for women to claim centre stage and how they edit their own lives to make themselves presentable. After the outcry that greeted publication of their novels, Charlotte Brontë devoted herself to curating the sisters’ reputation, with the result that nobody really knows the truth of them, says O’Connor. “I feel like Emily has been edited for a lot of her life. This is me taking her and putting her in the centre of her own story.”

She particularly hopes it will connect with young viewers, as a portrait of an original who followed her desires and her creativity. “In some ways this is a good time to be a woman: I see a younger generation coming up who are very forthright in terms of asking for what they want, in a way that maybe my generation didn’t,” she says. “But there’s always a gap between who women really are and who they’re supposed to be.”

Deepmind AI masters matrix mathematics

An artificial intelligence (AI) developed by machine-learning company DeepMind in London has tackled a type of calculation called matrix multiplication.

The system — called AlphaTensor — leverages the skills that DeepMind’s game-playing AIs use to beat human players at games such as Go and chess. Matrix multiplication is a widely used mathematical technique that involves multiplying numbers arranged in grids, or matrices, that might represent sets of pixels in images, air conditions in a weather model or the internal workings of an artificial neural network.

AlphaTensor broke ground by finding shortcuts to solve these problems with fewer steps (A. Fawzi et al. Nature 610, 47–53; 2022). The same general approach could have applications in other kinds of mathematical operation, its developers say, such as decomposing complex waves or other mathematical objects into simpler ones.

“It is very impressive,” says Martina Seidl, a computer scientist at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria. “This work demonstrates the potential of using machine learning for solving hard mathematical problems.”

Africa’s pandemic revealed in 100,000 viral genomes

Analysis of more than 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected in Africa reveals that most variants were imported into Africa more often than they were exported from the continent (H. Tegally et al. Science 378, eabq5358; 2022).

The collection of genomes enabled the study’s authors to map when and where variants were introduced into Africa. The researchers found, for example, that although the Omicron subvariant BA.1 was exported from Africa at least 54 times, it was imported at least 69 times from Europe and 102 times from North America (see ‘Virus on the go’). These import events brought the variant to African countries outside of southern Africa, says study co-author Eduan Wilkinson, a bioinformatician at Stellenbosch University in South Africa.

Overall, the team’s analyses indicated that most SARS-CoV-2 variants were introduced into Africa from other parts of the world more often than they were transported out. “The ironic part was that Africa was punished a few times from discovery of variants,” says study co-author Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician also at Stellenbosch University. “But a great majority of the variants, including most of the introductions of Omicron, did not come from Africa.”

Fungi inside cancers might affect growth

For years, evidence has been mounting that bacteria are linked to cancer. Now, researchers have found a similar connection with another type of microorganism: fungi.

Tumours of various cancers contain different species of microscopic fungus, and investigating the species that are present might one day be useful for diagnosing cancer or predicting its course.

Researchers catalogued fungal populations in more than 17,000 tissue and blood samples representing 35 types of cancer. They found that some fungal species were linked to different outcomes, depending on the cancer. For example, the presence of Malassezia globosa was linked to significantly reduced survival rates in breast cancer (L. Narunsky-Haziza et al. Cell 185, 3789–3806; 2022).

Another study looked at gastrointestinal, lung and breast tumours, and found that they tended to contain Candida, Blastomyces and Malassezia fungi, respectively (A. B. Dohlman et al. Cell 185, 3807–3822; 2022).

Although the studies suggest an association between fungal species and certain cancers, they do not show whether or not the fungi are directly responsible for cancer progression.",artificial intelligence,nature.com

See why I think now is not a good time to buy LMND stock.,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4546331-lemonade-stock-deep-dive-shallow-moat,"akinbostanci

Lemonade (NYSE:LMND) is a small, but quickly growing insurance company attempting to disrupt the insurance industry by leveraging digital technology and artificial intelligence. At the end of 2020, LMND stock began to catch the attention of investors who eventually drove the share price above $163 in early 2021. Since then the share price has collapsed 86% to $21.97. The company continues to lose money, expects losses to grow in Q3, trades at a P/B ratio ~1.60, and still must prove their AI gives them an edge. Despite myself being a shareholder, I do not think it is time to buy.

The Best Lemonade

Lemonade is a small, but rapidly growing, insurance company that is doing several things well. First, they have rapidly expanded their customer count and their in-force premiums. Over the two year period shown in the chart below, their customers have nearly doubled and in-force premiums have increased 195%. They’ve also maintained a high level of communication to customers and investors that I have enjoyed. They have a Founder’s Letter, maintain a blog, and write shareholders letters, all providing plenty of information for investor’s to better understand management's vision.

Lemonade 2022 Q2 Shareholder Letter

Through these channels, they have done a good job of communicating aspects of their strategy. One key to their strategy is building the company around their tech stack and attempting to leverage AI in multiple areas. Their strategy is also focused on building long-term customers. They want to attract young customers just entering the insurance market for the first time, such as those needing renters insurance, and then grow their offering with these customers. Since they want to keep these customers for life, they are designing their platform to delight customers. In fact, in their 2021 Annual Report they reported a Net Promoter score of 70.

As they seek to grow with their customers, they now offer multiple types of insurance including Renters, Homeowners, Life, and Pet Insurance. They are also expanding their car insurance, which will be helped by their recent acquisition of Metromile. Lemonade is also spreading geographically, both in the US and globally. In the US, with insurance premiums representing 11% of US GDP, LMND offers at least one type of insurance in every state and D.C. exposing LMND to this huge market.

Within the US, there is still plenty of room to grow as Lemonade does not offer all their products in every state. The map below illustrates that Lemonade only offers home insurance in 22 states and D.C. Additionally, Lemonade Car is only available in three states and ~12 states do not have renters insurance. As more policies become available in each state, cross selling will become a huge opportunity, which Daniel Schreiber, Co-Founder & CEO, mentioned on the 2022 Q2 Earnings Call:

While accounting for a quarter or even one-third of new sales only about 4% of our approximately 1.7 million customers have more than one Lemonade product today.

Lemonade is Tiny

The Insurance market is massive with ~$5 trillion in annual premiums globally. If we look at some of the giants in the industry, State Farm had $70B in direct premiums written in 2021, followed Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK.B, NYSE:BRK.A) $51B and Progressive’s (PGR) $47B. Lemonade is tiny in comparison to these industry leaders, guiding to in-force premiums of $595M-$600M for the quarter ending Sept. 30th. Investors need to keep this size in mind both in terms of future opportunities, but also potential risks.

One of these risks is concentration risk, and Louisiana and Florida are perfect examples. Since 2020, Louisiana has experienced direct hits from multiple hurricanes, including Hurricane Laura, Delta, and Ida, resulting in over $18.4B of insurance claims. These claims have contributed to eight insurance companies going bankrupt and others leaving the state. A similar story could play out in Florida as Hurricane Ian has devastated the state and insurers are expecting claims ranging from $28 B to $47 B.

Geographical Breakdown of Gross Written Premium (2022 Q2 10-Q)

Lemonade, despite offering policies in all 50 states, still has a concentration risk. As seen in the table above from their Q2 2022 10-Q, we can see 54.2% of their premiums are from California, Texas, and New York. If we jump back to their first 10-Q from 2020, these three states represented 57.8% of premiums in June of 2020 and 65.8% of policies in June of 2019. Lemonade is aware of this concentration risks. As they expand products to more states and grow their brand, investors should hope this concentration reduces, but know that highly populated states could always remain a higher percentage of their premiums.

Digging a Moat

Insurance companies offer standardized policies which can be copied by anyone. Their only products are promises. It is not difficult to be licensed, and rates are an open book. There are no important advantages from trademarks, patents, location, corporate longevity, raw material sources, etc., and very little consumer differentiation to produce insulation from competition. - Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's Shareholder Letters, March 14,1978

I wrote that quote down in a notebook 7 years ago and apparently completely forgot about it. Recently rediscovering it, I instantly regretted a few of my recent investments and wanted to do a deep dive into Lemonade Insurance. I don’t know if Warren Buffett has changed his thoughts on insurance moats since 1978, but I have been spending a lot of time thinking about this quote. Let’s work through Lemonade’s business and see if they are digging insurance a new moat.

Public Benefit Corporation

Many consumers want companies to be more socially responsible and are willing to pay for it. On the investment side, ideas such as conscious capitalism and socially responsible investing have been gaining traction, leading some to push away from the idea of shareholder primacy. Lemonade is joining in on these trends by registering as a certified B corporation, which means LMND’s management is letting investors know they will consider other stakeholders in their decisions.

Things like their Giveback program and not investing in coal are part of their B Corp status. While this effort can help attract customers and investors, it is certainly not a moat, as other companies can also enter the market as a B corp. As we’ll see in a minute, many of the large industry giants also do good things for their communities.

Giveback and Fraud Prevention

Lemonade is approaching their structure with a unique model that will attempt to smooth out profit and give back to charity. The want to take 25% of premiums as a fixed fee, which they will use to run the business and any remaining money will be profit. The other 75% will go to cover claims and pay for reinsurance. Any money remaining in this 75% will then be donated to charities selected by their customers.

Behind the scenes, customers who select the same charitable cause are classified as members of the same ""cohort."" Once a year we look at the loss ratio of each cohort, and provided that we pass the financial ratio tests required by our regulators, we aim to donate the funds remaining, if any, to the charitable cause selected by that cohort. Cohorts with a loss ratio above 40% usually will not receive a Giveback. – 2021 Annual Report

Lemonade’s structure and giveback are a significant part of their claims of why they are better than incumbents. They claim it removes temptations for them to deny claims to make more money and creates alignment of goals with customers. I can absolutely see certain customers loving this part of the company.

But they also claim the giveback will help to decrease fraud because if a person defrauds LMND out of money, then their selected charity will receive less money. It is a unique idea to combat fraud, which is a major issue for insurance companies, but this idea is not yet a proven. In fact, charities themselves are challenged with fraud with estimates showing they lose 5% of their revenue from fraud.

There are also mutual insurance companies, which are insurance companies owned by the policy holders. State Farm and Liberty mutual are two examples. State Farm periodically gives dividends to policyholders and reduced premiums after fewer claims occurred during the early COVID lockdowns. If people defraud both mutual insurance companies and charities, then I question if giveback will meaningfully reduce fraud.

Additionally, Lemonade is not the only insurance company using profit to better this world. State Farm has the State Farm Companies Foundation and routinely donates to causes after disasters. Aflac has committed $154 million for sickle cell and childhood cancer. Progressives has given over 800 vehicles to veterans in need and allows each of their 5,000 employees to select a charity to receive a $100 donation.

Lastly, giveback may hurt their ability to build a strong balance sheet to prepare for catastrophic events, as excess money is donated. Typically, a property and casualty insurance will want to build their balance sheet when possible so they can survive catastrophic events.

For investors, I do not yet see the giveback program as a moat. They need to prove it will meaningfully reduce fraud, increase customer retention, and prove it will not hamper their ability to survive catastrophic events.

Digital Tech Stack

Powered by artificial intelligence and behavioral economics, Lemonade’s full stack insurance carriers in the US and the EU replace brokers and bureaucracy with bots and machine learning, aiming for zero paperwork and instant everything. - Q2 2022 Shareholder Letter

There are potentially two parts of Lemonade that I believe could become a long-term moat and their digital tech stack is the first. It is not the tech stack itself, but the fact that they are building the company around digital technology. Unlike a large incumbent that must pivot to more digital workflow, LMND will have all their internal processes designed to leverage technology. It is possible this could give them an efficiency advantage by continuing to support more customers with fewer employees.

Competitors are not ignoring technology, though. Many of the incumbents have money to invest and are using more digital technology. Most have mobile apps and online portals for paying bills, submitting claims, sending messages, and uploading documents. Allstate has a chatbot Abie for helping with business insurance, they are leveraging AI for fraud detection, and offering Drivewise, which is an auto insurance telematics program. State Farm has Drive Safe and Save for their telematics program and they even sponsored a competition on Kaggle for a Distracted Driving algorithm. Geico is also working with Tractable for visual AI to inspect auto damage.

For investors, I do not think this is a moat at this time, but it is certainly something to monitor and watch. Combined with the next topic, it could be a major advantage, depending how well incumbents are able to digitize.

Artificial Intelligence

Lemonade wants AI to touch every part of their business. It is used in their two chat bots, AI Jim and AI Maya, but also in back-office work. Their Project Watchtower monitors satellite photos for potential events and can suspend writing new policies in areas having an immediate risk and help employees assist customers in these areas.

Lemonade S-1 Statement

AI Jim, Lemonade’s artificial intelligence “claims experience bot”, can accept claims, request documentation, approve claims, and send them for manual review, all on its own. It’s easy to see how this type of bot can provide a faster experience for customers and streamline claims processes even if it has to go to manual review.

AI Jim Takes and Approves a Claim (Lemonade Statements)

Lemonade is also sharing other successes with their AI. Their latest version, called LTV6 and discussed in their Q2 2022 Shareholder letter, now provides predictions for customers including “likelihood to churn, claim, and cross-sell” resulting in a calculation of their lifetime value. They are also using the new model to analyze risks and profitability:

For example, LTV6 flagged that many homeowner policies in California, that LTV5 scored favorably and appeared to enjoy compelling marketing efficiency, would actually prove loss making over time. Conversely, LTV6 showed that much of our Pet business promises to be more profitable than LTV5 assessed. Accordingly, in Q2 we dramatically slowed our California homeowners business in several locals, while accelerating our Pet book across most states. - Q2 2022 Shareholder Letter

While these are great successes, investors will need to see how they play out over the long term. We must also mention that competitors are not ignoring AI, but may discuss it under other terms such a predictive analytics.

AI is also hard and sometimes doesn’t work as expected. We’ve had Google say dogs are horses, Google’s AI also did something else extremely horrible that I’m not sure what to write here, Amazon’s AI showed a bias against women, and there was the massive failure of IBM’s Watson. Unfortunately, this is just to name a few of AI's failures. With some of these potential issues, there could also be concern from regulators, either not allowing certain activities to go through AI if they are suspect of unknown biases or even having Lemonade’s secrets exposed.

Once again, for investors, LMND’s AI is not yet a moat. I can certainly see how this can become a major advantage. Additionally, even if regulators began to heavily regulate AI and remove its advantages for policy approval and pricing, LMND still has an advantage with AI. Using AI just for policy pricing means the maximum benefit is the differences between what actuaries calculate and the real cost of the policy. Since Lemonade is using AI for more than just risk analysis, they would maintain an edge even in a highly regulated situation through their AI chat bots and streamlined back-office work.

The Moat is Still Price

We can see some potential for Lemonade to build a moat, but most of these will eventually come down to price, just like Warren Buffet said 44 years ago. Ultimately, there just isn't that much unique about an insurance policy. They make a promise to pay when a loss occurs for a certain price. If a company can offer some level of customer support and trust they can and will pay a claim, then many people will select based primarily on price. It is part of the reason many insurance ads focus on this only advantage, switch companies and save.

Valuation

There is a lot of focus on Lemonade's tech but unfortunately they should not be valued like a tech company, where each new user typically carries a lower marginal cost. They are still an insurance company and must find a way to be profitable selling insurance.

With this in mind, we can look at their current P/B value of ~1.60. This ratio is not necessarily expensive, but for a company facing the challenges of LMND, investors might want to consider it high. They continue to dilute shareholders and are burning a non-trivial amount of cash. While they expect losses to peak in Q3, they are guiding to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $245-$240 MM. Additionally, their Q2 2022 10-Q statement of cash flows shows a net decrease in cash of $71 MM for the 6 months ending June 20th, 2022.

At this point, for investors, the choice to invest is not about valuation. It is about what you see in the future of LMND and their ability to disrupt the insurance industry. If their AI and tech never give them an advantage, they could potentially stay a small insurance company for a long time.

Is Lemonade a Buy or a Sell?

Our analyses led us to conclude that a new kind of insurance company, built from scratch on an unconflicted business model and cutting-edge technology, will enjoy structural advantages that will manifest ever more powerfully over time.

In the above quote, I think the founder’s succinctly describe Lemonade and their goal. They are building the company around their digital tech stack and trying to leverage as much technology as possible.

While in the long-term these could give LMND a sufficient moat to disrupt the industry, they are not at that point yet. They could be extremely close, but traditional insurance companies won’t go down without a fight. Many of the incumbents are not ignoring technology and are looking at ways to also embrace it.

At this point, LMND is a buy only if you believe in the long-term vision and that there is not a better entry point in the future. For myself, several times now I’ve looked at my position in LMND and thought about putting in a sell order. If I had done my research, I likely would not have bought LMND originally. Now that I've done my research, I would not buy LMND today, but would wait until their tech is more proven. For now, these shares shall remain in my portfolio as a reminder to not get caught in FOMO and to do my own research.

We all strive to maintain healthier lifestyles, yet the kitchen is often the most challenging environment by far due to it containing a wide range of foods and beverages. The Smart-Badge project, created by a team of researchers from the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), aims to track just how many times we reach for the refrigerator door or drink water using machine learning and a suite of environmental sensors.

The wearable device itself is comprised of a single PCB that houses a pair of microcontrollers, an NXP iMXRT1062 for quickly gathering complex data, and an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense for collecting more basic samples. Whether it’s the digital gas sensor, the accelerometer, an IR thermal array, or an air pressure sensor, each reading is compiled into a single stream which updates at 6Hz and can either be stored locally on an SD card or sent via Bluetooth® to a phone.

After having 10 volunteers perform various tasks around a mock kitchen while wearing the Smart-Badge and then labeling each activity, the researchers were able to collect a sizable dataset. The 791 total data channels were fed through several layers of a neural network that could ultimately classify activities with 92.4% accuracy.

Duncan Jones' 2009 sci-fi film ""Moon"" is about a lonesome miner named Sam (Sam Rockwell) who works a high-tech drilling facility on the titular heavenly body. In the future, Earth's oil resources have run out, and energy is produced by a new miracle fuel called Helium-3, which can only be found on the moon. The mining equipment is so advanced that the entire building can be run by one person. Sam is aided by an artificial intelligence named GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey. Sam misses his family and is growing weary. He even seems to be hallucinating, as he will occasionally see a strange hobo-like man stalking through the hallways.

After Sam experiences an accident while in a lunar rover and is knocked unconscious, he awakens back at base with no memory of his return. But GERTY is acting suspicious, holding secret conversations with home base back on Earth. Sam investigates the accident site and finds his own doppelgänger out in a rover. This person also insists that they are Sam. The lunar facility now has two Sams and a mystery to solve. Alien? Long lost brother? Is reality falling apart? And why is one of the Sams so sick? Rockwell played both versions of the character.

While ""Moon"" has a calming, down-to-earth (down-to-moon?) quality, Jones' production was, in fact, quite complicated.

Within the space of just two or three decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has left the pages of science fiction novels and become one of the cornerstone technologies of modern-day society. Success in machine learning (ML) has led to a torrent of new AI applications that are almost too numerous to count, from autonomous machines and biometrics to predictive analytics and chatbots.

One emerging application of AI in recent years has been conversational intelligence (CI). While automated chatbots and virtual assistants are concerned with human-to-computer interaction, CI aims to explore human-to-human interaction in greater detail. The potential to monitor and extract data from human conversations, including tone, sentiment and context, has seemingly limitless potential.

For instance, data from call center interactions could be generated and logged, with everything from speaker ratio and customer satisfaction to call summaries and points of action being automatically filed. This would dramatically cut down the bureaucracy involved in call center handling and give agents more time to speak with customers. What’s more, the data generated could even be used to shape staff training programs, and even recognize and reward outstanding work.

But there’s something missing – trust. Deploying AI in this way is incredibly useful, but at the moment it still requires a leap of faith on behalf of the businesses using it.

In Artificial Intelligence we Trust?

As businesses, and as a society at large, we place a great deal of trust in AI-based systems. Social media companies like Twitter now employ AI-based algorithms to clamp down on hate speech and keep users safe online. Healthcare providers around the world are increasingly leveraging AI, from chatbots that can triage patients to algorithms that can help pathologists with more accurate diagnoses. The UK government has recently adopted an AI tool known as “Connect” to help parse tax records and detect fraudulent activity. There are even examples of AI being used to improve law enforcement outcomes, using tools such as facial recognition, crowd surveillance and gait analysis to identify suspects.

We make this leap of faith in exchange for a more efficient, connected and seamless world. That world is built on “big data”, and we need AI to help us manage the flow of that data and put it to good use. That’s as true in a macro sense as it is for individual businesses. But despite our increasing dependence on AI as a technology, we know precious little about what goes on under the hood. As data volume increases, and the paths taken by AI to make a determination become more elaborate, we as humans have lost the ability to comprehend and retrace those paths. What we’re left with is a “black box” that’s next to impossible to interpret.

It begs the question; how can we trust AI-based decisions if we can’t understand how those decisions are made? It’s an increasing source of frustration for businesses that want to ensure their systems are working correctly, meeting the correct regulatory standards, or that they’re operating at maximum efficiency. Consider the recruitment team at Amazon, who had to scrap their secret AI recruiting tool after they realized it was showing bias against women. They thought they had the “holy grail” of recruiting – a tool that could scan hundreds of resumes and pick out the top several for review, saving them countless hours of work. Through repetition and reinforcement, the AI managed to convince itself that male candidates were somehow preferable to female ones. Had the team trusted blindly in the AI – which they did for a very short period – the consequences for the company would have been devastating.

When it comes to business frustration and the fear of putting too much trust in AI, the emerging field of CI is an ideal case in point.

How can Conversational Intelligence be Trusted?

The world of human interaction has been a hive of AI innovation for years. It’s one thing to use natural language processing (NLP) to create chatbots or transcribe speech-to-text, but it’s another entirely to derive meaning and understanding out of conversations. That’s what conversation intelligence (CI) does. It goes beyond deterministic “A to B” outcomes and aims to analyze less tangible aspects of conversations such as tone, sentiment and meaning.

If CI is employed in a call center, for instance, it might be used to determine the effectiveness of the call handler, the emotional state of the customer, or provide an automatic call summary with action points. These are sophisticated and subjective interactions that don’t necessarily have right or wrong interpretations. If a call center is going to use CI to streamline interactions, train agents and update customer records, it needs to have confidence that the underlying AI is doing its job effectively. That’s where explainable AI or “XAI” comes into play.

Every business is different, and has a different definition of what the system is supposed to learn and predict using their conversation intelligence stack. And it’s essential that the solution provides a complete view of the predictions respective to the human actors using the system, so that they can continuously approve or disapprove the predictions made by the system. Instead of adopting a black boxed deep learning based system to perform tasks, a modularized system where there's full transparency and control on each aspect of the predictions of the system is critical. For example, a deterministic programmable system can be used to use separate systems for tracking sentiment of a call, finding topics, generating summary, detecting specific aspects such as type of issue in a support call, or requests in customer feedback calls, etc. instead of a singular deep learning system doing all these things. By creating such a modular architecture, the overall conversation intelligence solution is built to be traceable and deterministic.

Pulling Back the Curtain

When AI processes were simple and deterministic, trust in those processes was never an issue. Now that those processes have become more complex and less transparent, as in the example of CI above, trust has become essential for businesses that want to invest in AI. In his still-relevant decade-old paper, Mariarosaria Taddeo, referred to this as “e-trust” – how humans trust in computer-based processes, and the extent to which we allow artificial agents to be involved in that relationship.

Explainable AI (XAI) is an emerging field in machine learning which aims to make those artificial agents fully transparent and easier to interpret. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the US is one of the leading organizations pursuing XAI solutions. DARPA argues that the potential of AI systems is being severely hampered by its inability to explain its actions to human users. In other words, a lack of trust from organizations is preventing them from exploring the full gamut of what AI and ML could offer.

The goal is to create a suite of machine learning techniques that can produce explainable models that allow human users to understand and manage the next generation of artificially intelligent solutions. These ML systems will be able to explain their rationale, recognize their own strengths and shortcomings, and convey how they will “learn” from the data they are being fed. For DARPA, it’s part of a push toward what it refers to as the third generation of AI systems, where machines will understand the context and environment in which they are operating.

For the potential of AI to be fully realized, we need to move on from ones and zeroes and introduce more subjective analysis. The technology is there, we just need more reason to trust it.

It may not be unusual for burgeoning areas of science, especially those related to rapid technological changes in society, to take off quickly, but even by these standards the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been impressive. Together with robotics, AI is representing an increasingly significant portion of research volume at various levels, as these charts show.

Across the field

The number of AI and robotics papers published in the 82 high-quality science journals in the Nature Index (Count) has been rising year-on-year — so rapidly that it resembles an exponential growth curve. A similar increase is also happening more generally in journals and proceedings not included in the Nature Index, as is shown by data from the Dimensions database of research publications.

Leading countries

Five countries — the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Germany and France — had the highest AI and robotics Share in the Nature Index from 2015 to 2021, with the United States leading the pack. China has seen the largest percentage change (1,174%) in annual Share over the period among the five nations.

AI and robotics infiltration

As the field of AI and robotics research grows in its own right, leading institutions such as Harvard University in the United States have increased their Share in this area since 2015. But such leading institutions have also seen an expansion in the proportion of their overall index Share represented by research in AI and robotics. One possible explanation for this is that AI and robotics is expanding into other fields, creating interdisciplinary AI and robotics research.",artificial intelligence,nature.com

It is well known that research in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics is on a steep upward trajectory, but the latest numbers from the Nature Index put the growth rate beyond doubt. In just two years, the number of articles in the 82 high-quality natural-science journals tracked by the Nature Index linked to these topics has gone from fewer than 4,000 in 2019 to approaching 7,000 in 2021. Using the Nature Index metric of Share, which uses fractional counting of author affiliations, the data are even more dramatic. Both China and South Korea have increased their Share by more than 1,100% from 2015 to 2021, although the United States is still the clear leader overall.

Nature Index 2022 AI and robotics

Such growth, and the way it is representing an ever-increasing proportion of institutions’ Nature Index output, shows how this pervasive technology is crossing disciplinary boundaries as researchers seek ways to use its advantages. In this supplement, we take a closer look how AI and robotics are making advancement possible, from environmental science to the humanities, as well as having immediate real-world impact in areas such as clinical medicine. We also look at how interdisciplinary approaches are prompting researchers to rethink AI and robotics itself, particularly by drawing inspiration from the natural world.

But controversy lurks when dealing with emerging technologies, in part owing to concerns about the role being played by commercial organizations. Despite the huge influence wielded by tech firms, and their ability to attract top talent from academia, their footprint in the Index is still modest. It is bound to raise concerns about whether there is enough openness about the AI tools and techniques that are transforming society.

There are also continuing concerns about whether cutting-edge developments in AI and robotics are benefiting people from all walks of life; we speak to one researcher drawing attention to how rural communities risk being left out of AI advancements.",artificial intelligence,nature.com

Mandia spoke with reporters for the first time about his threat-intel-slash-incident-response company's new owner during a press briefing ahead of Google Cloud Next, which kicked off today in San Francisco and virtually. A key component of the $5.4 billion deal, he said, is that Google will allow Mandiant to remain ""controls agnostic.""

Endpoint security products feed ""telemetry to the brain,"" Mandia said. ""Network security monitoring tools give telemetry, and firewalls give telemetry to the brain. One of the things we can do best at Mandiant, combined with Google, is be that brain, be the hub for all the spokes.""

Mandiant likes to position itself as one of the preeminent intelligence and incident response firms that's called in by governments and major private organizations alike to clean up the mess after really bad breaches.

""We are the emergency room doctors when you need them most,"" Mandia boasted. ""Mandiant doesn't get calls for the breaches that are simple. We get called when breaches that we all read about around a scale and scope and complexity where folks need help.""

Google Cloud, meanwhile, brings expertise in big data, analytics, and artificial intelligence, he added. It can, apparently, pull telemetry from multiple sources and analyze that data at Google speed.

'Proactive offense'

With its latest multi-billion-dollar purchase, Google Cloud security will soon be able to combine offense with defense, according to Phil Venables, chief information security officer at Google Cloud.

""Chronicle, for example, and some of our other monitoring tools, they're more reactive defense,"" he told reporters during a briefing with Mandia and Google Cloud Security VP and GM Sunil Potti.

The company's security analytics platform ""looks through data, you look at events, you figure out what went wrong, and you respond to it,"" Venables said.

""Whereas with Mandiant, we get to this place of proactive offense, so using validation to see how well your security tools are working, looking at the attack surface, figuring out what incidents and how you're responding to them,"" he added. ""And joining those together, you get to do what we think is really important to get security right, which is to join the offense and the defense together.""

To hear Mandia describe it, Mandiant's in-the-trenches experience combined with Google's big data and automation technologies will produce the holy grail of security operations.

""If we can take that Mandiant expertise of finding the needle in the haystack, every day, and automate it, that's what everybody wants,"" he said. ""And that's what we can do with Google Cloud.""

Of course, much of the hard work of integrating the two companies remains to be done, and that doesn't always go well. The acquisition closed only a month ago, and while the companies joining forces makes for interesting discussions in the leadup to the cloud giant's annual conference, much of it is — at this point — still just talk.

First up: Chronicle

Google did unveil a piece of this broader vision today, however, with its Chronicle Security Operations software suite, available in preview. This takes the company's existing Chronicle security information and event management (SIEM) tech and adds in security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) from Siemplify, another 2022 Google Cloud purchase.

Additionally, Chronicle pulls threat data from two in-house sources, VirusTotal and Google Cloud Threat Intelligence, integrates alert management between the SIEM and SOAR components, and provides pre-packaged response playbooks to alerts.

In the future, according to Google Cloud execs, Chronicle will also include Mandiant's incident and exposure management plus threat intelligence capabilities.

""We will be integrating, as core foundational capabilities, starting with the threat intelligence that's world-class from Mandiant — ongoing frontline intel, and creating an automated pipeline from that into the workflows,"" Potti told reporters.

Then, further down the road, Chronicle will integrate Mandiant's products such as its attack surface management, red team-as-a-service, and security validation service.

This echoes Potti's earlier comments, when he told The Register that Google plans to use its internally developed tech combined with acquisitions to move customers to ""self-driving"" operations in the security operations center (SOC).

Combined with Mandiant's capabilities, ""a SOC can transform into not just being a modern SOC, but becoming a proactive cyber defense,"" Potti claimed.

Confidential computing and supply-chain security

Also at Next, Google announced a new confidential computing service called Confidential Space. The idea behind confidential computing is to process encrypted data in memory without exposing it to the rest of the system. All of the major cloud providers have their own flavor of this, and Google introduced its Confidential Virtual Machines in 2020.

Its new Confidential Space service runs workloads in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and uses a hardened version of Container-Optimized OS (COS) so organizations can collaborate without exposing sensitive data to their partners or the cloud provider.

For example, banks can work together to identify fraud or money laundering activity without exposing private customer information — and breaking data privacy laws in the process. Similarly, healthcare organizations can share MRI images or collaborate on diagnosis without revealing patient information, Potti said.

And finally, Google announced a fully managed software supply chain security product called Software Delivery Shield (SDS). It aims to secure code across its entire lifecycle, from development to production, and spans a ton of Google Cloud services from developer tooling to runtimes like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and its Cloud Run serverless platform.

SDS also includes Google's new Assured Open Source Software service it announced in May, which is currently in preview. It currently verifies the security of about 250 curated packages across Java and Python, and auto-generates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). Also under the SDS umbrella: Cloud Build, Google's fully managed CI platform, now supports SLSA Level 3 builds to implement SLSA level 3 best practices by default.

SLSA, or Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts, is Google's framework for ensuring the integrity of software artifacts throughout the software supply chain.

Moving to the production side of things, the supply-chain managed security service includes new security posture management capabilities for GKE, available in preview, which identifies and fixes security flaws in GKE clusters and workloads. ®",artificial intelligence,theregister.com

In a research note on Friday, Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu said he expects iPhone models released in 2024 to use Qualcomm's as-yet-unannounced Snapdragon X75 modem. Like the Snapdragon X70, the X75 is expected to be manufactured based on TSMC's 4nm process, contributing to power efficiency improvements.

In June, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicated that Qualcomm would remain the exclusive supplier of 5G modems for new iPhone models in 2023 given that Apple failed to complete development of its own replacement chip. At the time, Kuo said he believed that Apple would continue to develop its own 5G chip, but he did not provide a timeframe for when the chip would be ready for use in iPhones.

All four iPhone 15 models are expected to be equipped with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X70 modem, announced in February. Like the Snapdragon X65 modem in iPhone 14 models, the X70 theoretically supports up to 10 Gbps download speeds, with newly added artificial intelligence capabilities for faster average speeds, improved coverage, better signal quality, lower latency, and up to 60% improved power efficiency.

All in all, while initial reports claimed that Apple's own 5G modem could debut in iPhones as early as 2023, the switchover might take at least a few years longer.",artificial intelligence,macrumors

Alibaba Group is helping to close the digital divide with artificial intelligence (AI) that aides the elderly and visually impaired gain access to daily services, from transport to online shopping.

The Hangzhou-based company is making its platforms more inclusive with options featuring larger fonts, simplified navigation and voice assistance. Its research and innovation institute the DAMO Academy also launched tools powered by AI to close the gap for people in need.

More than 85 million disabled and 260 million people over the age of 60 live in China, according to a report published this year by the science and tech research institute China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. By 2050, close to one third of China's population will be seniors aged over 60, according to the research agency China Development Research Foundation.

Alibaba marked its sixth annual Philanthropy Week with a series of offline and online philanthropy initiatives this week.

In the fiscal year ending March 31, around 780 million charitable deeds were conducted by people on its philanthropy platform, which lists over 4,000 charities and nonprofit organizations for users to donate their time to.

95,Claims AI can boost workplace diversity are ‘spurious and dangerous’,https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/news/research/news/drage-ai-pic.jpg,14/10/2022,Research highlights growing market in AI-powered recruitment tools that claim to bypass human bias to remove discrimination from hiring.,https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/claims-ai-can-boost-workplace-diversity-are-spurious-and-dangerous-researchers-argue,"Recent years have seen the emergence of AI tools marketed as an answer to lack of diversity in the workforce, from use of chatbots and CV scrapers to line up prospective candidates, through to analysis software for video interviews.

Those behind the technology claim it cancels out human biases against gender and ethnicity during recruitment, instead using algorithms that read vocabulary, speech patterns and even facial micro-expressions to assess huge pools of job applicants for the right personality type and 'culture fit'.

However, in a new report published in Philosophy and Technology, researchers from Cambridge’s Centre for Gender Studies argue these claims make some uses of AI in hiring little better than an 'automated pseudoscience' reminiscent of physiognomy or phrenology: the discredited beliefs that personality can be deduced from facial features or skull shape.

They say it is a dangerous example of 'technosolutionism': turning to technology to provide quick fixes for deep-rooted discrimination issues that require investment and changes to company culture.

In fact, the researchers have worked with a team of Cambridge computer science undergraduates to debunk these new hiring techniques by building an AI tool modelled on the technology, available online.

The ‘Personality Machine’ demonstrates how arbitrary changes in facial expression, clothing, lighting and background can give radically different personality readings – and so could make the difference between rejection and progression for a generation of job seekers vying for graduate positions.

The Cambridge team say that use of AI to narrow candidate pools may ultimately increase uniformity rather than diversity in the workforce, as the technology is calibrated to search for the employer’s fantasy 'ideal candidate'.

This could see those with the right training and background ""win over the algorithms"" by replicating behaviours the AI is programmed to identify, and taking those attitudes into the workplace, say the researchers.

Additionally, as algorithms are honed using past data, they argue that candidates considered the best fit are likely to end up those that most closely resembling the current workforce.

“We are concerned that some vendors are wrapping ‘snake oil’ products in a shiny package and selling them to unsuspecting customers,” said co-author Dr Eleanor Drage.

“By claiming that racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination can be stripped away from the hiring process using artificial intelligence, these companies reduce race and gender down to insignificant data points, rather than systems of power that shape how we move through the world.”

The researchers point out that these AI recruitment tools are often proprietary – or 'black box' – so how they work is a mystery.

“While companies may not be acting in bad faith, there is little accountability for how these products are built or tested,” said Drage. “As such, this technology, and the way it is marketed, could end up as dangerous sources of misinformation about how recruitment can be ‘de-biased’ and made fairer.”

Despite some pushback – the EU’s proposed AI Act classifies AI-powered hiring software as 'high risk', for example – researchers say that tools made by companies such as Retorio and myInterview are deployed with little regulation, and point to surveys suggesting use of AI in hiring is snowballing.

A 2020 study of 500 organisations across various industries in five countries found 24% of businesses have implemented AI for recruitment purposes and 56% of hiring managers planned to adopt it in the next year.

Another poll of 334 leaders in human resources, conducted in April 2020, as the pandemic took hold, found that 86% of organisations were incorporating new virtual technology into hiring practices.

“This trend was in already in place as the pandemic began, and the accelerated shift to online working caused by COVID-19 is likely to see greater deployment of AI tools by HR departments in future,” said co-author Dr Kerry Mackereth, who presents the Good Robot podcast with Drage, in which the duo explore the ethics of technology.

COVID-19 is not the only factor, according to HR operatives the researchers have interviewed. “Volume recruitment is increasingly untenable for human resources teams that are desperate for software to cut costs as well as numbers of applicants needing personal attention,” said Mackereth.

Drage and Mackereth say many companies now use AI to analyse videos of candidates, interpreting personality by assessing regions of a face – similar to lie-detection AI – and scoring for the 'big five' personality tropes: extroversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.

The undergraduates behind the ‘Personality Machine’, which uses a similar technique to expose its flaws, say that while their tool may not help users beat the algorithm, it will give job seekers a flavour of the kinds of AI scrutiny they might be under – perhaps even without their knowledge.

“All too often, the hiring process is oblique and confusing,” said Euan Ong, one of the student developers. “We want to give people a visceral demonstration of the sorts of judgements that are now being made about them automatically"".

“These tools are trained to predict personality based on common patterns in images of people they’ve previously seen, and often end up finding spurious correlations between personality and apparently unrelated properties of the image, like brightness. We made a toy version of the sorts of models we believe are used in practice, in order to experiment with it ourselves,” Ong said.",artificial intelligence,cam.ac.uk

Will Douglas Heaven | MIT Technology Review

“The headline result is that AlphaTensor discovered a way to multiply together two four-by-four matrices that is faster than a method devised in 1969 by the German mathematician Volker Strassen, which nobody had been able to improve on since. The basic high school method takes 64 steps; Strassen’s takes 49 steps. AlphaTensor found a way to do it in 47 steps.”

A Bold Effort to Cure HIV—Using CRISPR

Emily Mullin | Wired

“While antiretroviral drugs can halt viral replication and clear the virus from the blood, they can’t reach these reservoirs [of dormant HIV-infected cells], so people have to take medication every day for the rest of their lives. But Excision BioTherapeutics is hoping that CRISPR will remove HIV for good.”

This Is Life in the Metaverse

Kashmir Hill | The New York Times

“My goal was to visit at every hour of the day and night, all 24 of them at least once, to learn the ebbs and flows of Horizon and to meet the metaverse’s earliest adopters. I gave up television, books and a lot of sleep over the past few months to spend dozens of hours as an animated, floating, legless version of myself. I wanted to understand who was currently there and why, and whether the rest of us would ever want to join them.”

For Better or Worse, Tesla Bot Is Exactly What We Expected

Evan Ackerman | IEEE Spectrum

“While there’s absolutely nothing wrong with the humanoid robot that Musk very briefly demonstrated on stage, there’s nothing uniquely right, either. We were hoping for (if not necessarily expecting) more from Tesla. And while the robot isn’t exactly a disappointment, there’s very little to suggest that it disrupts robotics the way that SpaceX did for rockets or Tesla did for electric cars.”

Google’s Newest AI Generator Creates HD Video From Text Prompts

“Currently, it’s in a research phase, but its appearance five months after Google Imagen points to the rapid development of video synthesis models. Only six months after the launch of OpenAI’s DALLE-2 text-to-image generator, progress in the field of AI diffusion models has been heating up rapidly. Google’s Imagen Video announcement comes less than a week after Meta unveiled its text-to-video AI tool, Make-A-Video.”

Satellite Billboards Are a Dystopian Future We Don’t Need

George Dvorsky | Gizmodo

“Just because you can do a thing doesn’t mean you have to do that thing. Space-based ads may be feasible, but they’d represent an eyesore of cosmological proportions, tarnishing our natural, unobstructed views of space. That our cities are already flooded with light pollution and ads on the ground is hardly an excuse to embark on such an endeavor. Here’s hoping that sensibility will prevail and that ads for soft drinks and fast food stay on the ground.”

Boeing-Backed Wisk Aero Reveals a Four-Seater Autonomous Air Taxi

Andrew J. Hawkins | The Verge

“Wisk aims to one day provide an intercity flying taxi service that can be summoned with an app, like Uber or Lyft. The plan is for the vehicle to not have a pilot on board; instead, it will be flown mainly by an autopilot system, with supervision from a human pilot situated remotely. The aircraft would theoretically take off and land from so-called vertiports located on the rooftops of buildings.”

Robot Makers Including Boston Dynamics Pledge Not to Weaponize Their Creations

A relief agency is using artificial intelligence to identify low-income victims of Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Fiona in order to provide them with emergency cash payments.

Nonprofit GiveDirectly teamed up with Google to identify those most at need of financial support, using AI to cross reference aerial images of storm damage with poverty data in Florida and Puerto Rico.

The idea is to go beyond the traditional disaster response from aid charities and government organisations, which typically focus on in-kind donations of clothing and food.

“Together with our partners at Google, we’re using aerial storm damage imagery and poverty data to identify the highest-need communities,” a GiveDirectly fundraising page states.

“We currently have enough funding from our partners to deliver cash to several thousand families in the hardest-hit regions of Puerto Rico and Florida.”

A one-time payment of $700 is sent to families, which is aimed at covering the cost of common post-disaster recovery items, such as food, toiletries and first aid supplies.

The full scale of the impact of Hurricane Ian, which made landfall as a Category 4 storm on 28 September, is yet to be fully realised, though there have already been more than 100 reported deaths across Cuba, Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, as well as over 2.5 million people evacuated.

Estimates suggest there may be up to $67 billion of damage, with modeling firm RMS claiming that the “best-case scenario” is economic damage of $55 billion.

Hurricane Fiona, which made landfall in Puerto Rico on 18 September displaced 12,500 people and left 100,000 residents without power. The economic fallout is expected to reach between $2-4 billion.

“After most major natural disasters on record, inequality sky rockets,” said Alex Diaz, head of crisis reponses and humanitarian aid at Google.org.

“Those that are most affected by disasters tend to be the most marginalised communities... Imagine a system that integrates census data [and] poverty data, and overlays that with disaster data after a disaster has hit.”

GiveDirectly, which was founded by MIT graduates in 2009, has already delivered over $500 million in cash to more than 1 million impoverished people around the world.",artificial intelligence,independent

Wade has reinvigorated fears about data security, but the weakest link for abortion seekers is often other people.",https://www.theverge.com/23385553/abortion-seekers-security-threats-human-factor,"In the years before Roe v. Wade, an anonymous group of Chicago-area women known only as The Janes came together to provide safe, clandestine abortions to pregnant people in need. Over the course of several years, the group provided over 11,000 abortions. When they were finally busted by the police in 1972, it wasn’t because of police surveillance or the group’s anti-war activism or even their willingness to provide abortions to the pregnant family members of police officers. It was a family member of a Jane patient who tipped off the police.

“Some nosey bitch tried to snitch on someone who needed an abortion,” says Renee Bracey Sherman, founder and executive director of the abortion storytelling organization We Testify.

Fifty years later, the threat that took down The Janes still looms large for people seeking abortion under criminalization. While activists rightly warn about text messages, browser histories, and other digital evidence trails, it’s low-tech — and human — security breaches that often pose the greatest risk.

It’s low-tech — and human — security breaches that often pose the greatest risk

“The biggest threat to the privacy of abortion seekers is other people,” says Laura Huss, a senior researcher at If/When/How, a legal organization dedicated to protecting the rights of abortion patients. “People’s private information — like what they search for on the internet or text messages that they’ve sent to others — have come into evidence in cases where people have been charged with a crime for self-managing an abortion. But again, the precipitating factor has most often been someone else reporting them to law enforcement, who then have the power to seize people’s devices.”

In their research on adults who’ve been criminally investigated or arrested for allegedly self-managing or assisting an abortion, If/When/How discovered that a full 45 percent of cases were brought to the attention of the police via a healthcare professional like a doctor, nurse, or social worker. Another 26 percent of people were reported by friends or family members. (Eighteen percent came to the attention of police in other ways, like police recovery of fetal remains, anonymous tips to police, or a 911 call. In the remaining 11 percent of cases, If/When/How could not identify how police were initially alerted.) These findings are consistent with cybersecurity generally: more often than not, it’s other people who are the weakest link in the chain.

The most effective security solution is also an incredibly isolating one

But if human informants are the biggest threat to abortion seekers, that means the most effective security solution is also an incredibly isolating one. Perfect security would mean keeping the procedure and even your pregnancy a complete secret, shutting out friends and even primary care providers. But for most people, that kind of complete lockdown isn’t practical — and might be too painful to bear. Terminating a pregnancy can be a fraught, emotional experience, even when the abortion is a wanted one. Going it alone can be really tough, particularly for people who are self-managing at home with abortion pills and without the assistance of a medical professional.

“I’m not a total ‘don’t tell anybody’ sort of a person,” says Bracey Sherman, noting that her stance is closer to “be careful of who to trust.” In her experience, “it’s not a surprise for people — usually — where their family members stand on abortion.” That basic information can be a pretty reliable guide for who is, or isn’t, safe to open up to.

But, she notes, this isn’t always foolproof. In her own life, Bracey Sherman has seen multiple instances of an avowed abortion supporter changing their tune once the reproductive rights battle pops up in their own backyard. “Somebody’s super, super pro-choice until they realize someone in their family needs an abortion,” she says. “Then all of the assumptions they have about who has abortions and why come to the surface” — and things can get ugly fast.

As long as abortion is viewed as shameful and dangerous, the people who need abortions will be unsafe

If you don’t want to chance it with friends and family, a number of abortion rights organizations are committed to helping people navigate the abortion process — including providing emotional support — without compromising their safety or privacy. Some, like Reprocare and the Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline, have been explicitly set up to help people through the process of self-managed abortion. Others, like local abortion funds and doulas, might not explicitly advertise their support services but can be useful (and confidential) all the same. “I’m somebody that you would call,” Bracey Sherman adds. “A lot of us [in the abortion space] are just there for you. It feels weird to trust a complete stranger and not your best friend. But that’s the life that we live right now.”

Friends and family aren’t the only people you have to worry about reporting you; healthcare providers are also a risk. Although abortion is incredibly safe, even when it’s done at home alone with pills, some people still experience complications that require medical attention. And others simply want to get checked out by a doctor for their own peace of mind. Whatever your reason for seeking medical assistance, it’s crucial that you don’t mention your abortion to the doctor, receptionist, nurse, or anyone else you might encounter during your appointment. Instead, most abortion organizations recommend telling doctors and other care professionals that you had a miscarriage since there’s no medical way to distinguish between miscarriage and abortion with pills.

But this is hardly foolproof: if a doctor doesn’t think you’re sad enough about your miscarriage, they may flag you as someone who had an abortion anyway, particularly if you’re a member of a group that’s routinely policed and criminalized, like people of color and low-income folks. So another option is to simply act surprised and confused, as though you had no idea you were pregnant in the first place. Unlike a miscarriage after a known pregnancy, there’s no “correct” way to respond to the spontaneous end of a pregnancy you weren’t even aware of. (Under no circumstances should you ever mention illicitly acquired abortion pills to doctors. They do not need to know!)

Yet fundamentally, the only way to truly protect the privacy of abortion patients is through widespread education focused on destigmatizing abortion. In the long run, that work will lead to better abortion laws. But even in the short term, teaching people that abortion is safe reduces the incentive to report abortion seekers to the police. As Huss and Bracey Sherman both note, many people who report a self-managed abortion to the police aren’t acting out of malice but, rather, a misguided desire to help. As long as abortion is viewed as shameful and dangerous, the people who need abortions will be unsafe. Building a world where abortion is recognized as a fundamental part of reproductive healthcare — and, most importantly, a private medical decision — is the best way to protect the security and safety of abortion seekers.",cybersecurity,the verge

And while there are some indications that it's becoming more diverse, bringing women into the room continues to move at a glacial pace.

Globally, women make up about 25 percent of the cybersecurity workforce [PDF], according to International Information System Security Certification Consortium, or (ISC)2, an organization that trains and certifies IT security professionals.

Granted, these 2021 numbers are an increase from 2017's findings that showed only 11 percent were women. But in an industry facing a worker shortage of about three million amid growing threats from nation states and criminal gangs alike, a mere 25 percent of the workforce is still pretty dismal.

""In some parts of the world, the percentages are much lower,"" (ISC)² CEO Clar Rosso told The Register. ""And women leave the cyber profession at higher rates than men, so organizations must take steps to increase the retention of female infosec professionals.""

Women leave the cyber profession at higher rates than men

Rosso suggests organizations do this by paying women the same as their male counterparts, and also providing them with equal career advancement opportunities — both of which should be no-brainers, but, sadly, aren't.

Other processes, such as developing an inclusive culture, implementing zero-tolerance policies on harassment and discrimination, and providing access to mentors and advocates play a role in retention, as well. But by first focusing on eliminating pay and advancement inequalities, ""you can take a giant leap forward on the retention front,"" Rosso said.

Before organizations can work on retaining female infosec professionals, the industry needs to bring more women into cybersecurity jobs in the first place, she opined.

Where are the women?

Microsoft Security earlier this year commissioned a survey that looked at the gender gap in cybersecurity and how to increase the number of women in these positions. It found more than half (54 percent) of women believe the industry has a gender-bias problem that results in unequal pay and support.

Additionally, while 83 percent of respondents said they believe there is an opportunity for women in cybersecurity, only 44 percent of female respondents believe they're sufficiently represented.

""A lack of representation can perpetuate and reinforce the gender gap by dissuading women from entering the industry,"" Vasu Jakkal, a Microsoft Security corporate vice-president, told The Register.

Women, even more than men, according to the survey, reinforce these biases: 71 percent of women (compared to 61 percent of men) think cybersecurity is ""too complex"" a career, and more women than men (27 percent and 21 percent, respectively) believe men are seen as a better fit for technology fields.

""These statistics break my heart,"" Jakkal said. ""To bring more women into the field, we need to dispel these harmful myths about cybersecurity careers, provide the skill-building and mentoring to empower women and increase their confidence, and share real examples and stories of what female leaders are doing in the cybersecurity space.""

This is something that Enterprise Strategy Group senior analyst Melinda Marks has been doing with her Women in Cybersecurity video series that features women in the field and asks them about challenges they've faced and overcome as well as resources and ways to increase diversity in the industry.

Case in point: Security conferences

""If you go to cybersecurity conferences, it's still male dominated, and unfortunately too many of us have stories about being the only woman on the team, underestimated, underpaid, or otherwise mistreated,"" Marks told The Register.

""I think sharing our stories and how we've overcome challenges helps so other women coming into the field have fewer challenges if we can address and fix some of these problems.""

The problem, however, begins well before women enter the workforce. Katelyn Bailey, director of strategic intelligence and government at Google's Mandiant, says we need to look as far back as kindergarten and continue emphasizing science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education for girls through high school.

""It's obviously more complicated than funding education, but it all starts there,"" Bailey told The Register.

""We cannot be dependent on home education to provide introduction to the STEM fields, as parents are more likely to expose boys to the foundational elements that lead to STEM fields.""

Men, in turn, are more likely to enter STEM professions. In the US alone, despite making up nearly half of the workforce in 2019, only about 27 percent of STEM workers were women with men dominating that field.

Job listings, because of biases in algorithms and wording, may attract — or repel — female candidates as well. But even something as simple as changing hiring language, may help, Gartner senior principal analyst Patrick Long said.

Women currently achieve higher level degrees and certifications than their male counterparts, and place higher value in those certifications, he told The Register.

""Hiring organizations can also change their barriers of entry by using frameworks such as NIST's Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity, also known as the NICE Framework, to identify specific needs as opposed to position titles,"" he added. ""Doing this can lead to non-cybersecurity experts transitioning toward cybersecurity roles.""

The ladder's broken

Once they're in an infosec job, however, women often find a ""broken rung"" when trying to climb the corporate ladder in that men are more likely to be promoted. This continues all the way up to the highest levels of leadership, and in cybersecurity it's especially pronounced because there are fewer women to begin with.

""It is human nature to support and champion those like you,"" Bailey said.

""If you see no one like you anywhere up your leadership chain, you may feel isolated and hopeless in terms of career progression, you may struggle more than your male counterparts to find a champion, and may struggle to feel a sense of belonging or support.""

Plus, she added, ""women also take on more unpromotable tasks than their male counterparts. If these things combine at once, it is the perfect storm for attrition.""

Some industry-wide organizations such as the Executive Women's Forum and Women In Cybersecurity (WiCys) are taking on these issues, and industry trade groups have developed initiatives to increase diversity hiring and retention across the sector.

(ISC)², under Rosso's leadership, established a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) program. And the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA), which was founded by two women 40 years ago, has its Women in Security Special Interest Group (WIS SIG) to develop leaders and build a stronger community for women in the industry.

""The vision is to enable women in cybersecurity to improve their brand, showcase their capabilities, and create new opportunities,"" ISSA International Board Member Betty Burke said.

Additionally, some private corporations have their own internal initiatives and training programs. That's not to say women are preferred over men in these processes; it's that women are given an equal crack when it comes to hiring, retention, compensation, and promotion.

For example, Secureworks CEO Wendy Thomas set a goal to have women make up 50 percent of the company's global workforce by 2030. Over the past year, the security firm's female employees increased from 26 percent to 34 percent.

Microsoft partners with Girl Security that works to develop cybersecurity career paths for girls, women, and gender minorities. Similarly, Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 created an associate program that trains the next generation of incident responders that just graduated from college.

""For this hands-on program, we ensure that at least 50 percent of the class is female,"" said Wendi Whitmore, SVP and head of Unit 42. ""Our current group of associates is actually 55 percent female. Of course, it's not only about getting them into the pipeline of employees, it's really about keeping them there.""

Equal pay … and flexible work

For this, Whitmore points to flexible work hours and locations. ""Providing these options helps women stay in their careers and move up the ladder,"" she told The Register.

Because, as the global COVID-19 pandemic made painfully clear, working women still shoulder the bulk of the household and childcare responsibilities.

""Women do so much outside of their careers,"" Whitmore said. ""They're often running their families and households. What we've seen is that the normal course of life tends to drive women out of the security industry.""

What we've seen is that the normal course of life tends to drive women out of the security industry

And keeping women in the industry is good, not only for the sector itself, but for society in general that relies on infosec workers to keep IT systems running, personal and corporate data secure, and prevent cyberthreats from bleeding into physical ones.

""The cyber threat landscape is complex and spreads like wildfire,"" Rosso said.

""To successfully solve the dynamic issues facing the cybersecurity profession and to close the skills gap, we need to lift new voices. We need to bring problem solvers, analytical and critical thinkers, and a diversity of other skill sets and backgrounds to the table to solve our challenges and secure information and systems globally.""

This means targeted programs to bring more women and minorities to the profession are important because, as the adage goes, ""you cannot be what you cannot see,"" she said. ""People across the globe have told me they lack a sense of belonging when they are the only woman, Muslim, or person of color in the room.""

Plus, ""organizations with diverse teams are more successful at recruiting and retaining women,"" Rosso added. ""We won't close the cybersecurity workforce gap or adequately secure our information and systems unless we cast a wider net and embrace more diversity, especially women, within the profession."" ®",cybersecurity,theregister.com
102,These 3 Tech Stocks Haven't Been This Cheap in Years: Is It Time to Buy?,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/704631/two-cybersecurity-workers-at-their-monitors-analyzing-data.jpg,15/10/2022,"For investors hunting for bargains in this tricky market, these stocks might be a good place to start.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/15/tech-stocks-havent-been-cheap-years-time-buy/,"The Nasdaq 100 index is often used as a barometer of the technology sector's performance. Unfortunately, 2022 has shown a low-pressure system is dominating for most of the year, with the index losing 34% of its value. If the year ended now, it would be the worst decline since the Great Recession in 2008-09.

While that's daunting, we know the market recovered to new highs in the years following that event, so this might present a rare opportunity to buy high-quality growth stocks at a discount.

A panel of three Motley Fool contributors has identified Tenable (TENB -3.99%), MercadoLibre (MELI -7.40%), and CrowdStrike (CRWD -7.81%) as potential candidates. These tech stocks are currently trading at low points they haven't visited in years, and here's why investors should consider picking them up.

The leader in vulnerability management

Anthony Di Pizio (Tenable): Tenable stock currently trades at $30.18, a level not seen in more than two years. But since then, the cybersecurity industry has only grown in importance, and Tenable continues to attract a record number of customers and is generating the highest levels of revenue in its history. That sounds like a buying opportunity.

According to a survey conducted by global consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, the threat of cyberattacks is currently the No. 1 concern for top corporate executives. Cyber-risk outranked other concerns, including the possibility of a recession, climate change, and even war, among the 722 respondents.

Tenable is the industry leader in vulnerability management and threat detection, which are proactive tools designed to seek potential risks and neutralize them before they find a way into a given network. Its Nessus platform has been deployed in tens of thousands of organizations with more than 2 million individual downloads, thanks to its customizable nature, which makes it an ideal choice for businesses of all sizes.

As of the recent second quarter of 2022 (ended June 30), the number of customers spending at least $100,000 annually with Tenable jumped 27% year over year to 1,191. It indicates that larger organizations with big cybersecurity budgets are flocking to adopt more advanced, proactive tools to protect their valuable digital assets, which are often hosted with cloud computing technology. The cloud presents new challenges for organizations because it expands the attack surface -- in other words, cloud-based assets can be vulnerable to threats from almost anywhere in the world.

Thanks in part to its increasing customer base, Tenable kept its full-year revenue guidance steady at $676 million for 2022. That's in stark contrast to many other technology companies that slashed their forecasts, and if Tenable hits the mark, it would represent growth of 25% compared with 2021. That's even faster than last year's revenue growth rate of 23% -- so this is a unique opportunity to buy a piece of an accelerating business at a price not seen since mid-2020.

A can't-miss bargain from south of the border

Jamie Louko (MercadoLibre): This Latin American e-commerce and fintech leader is trading at a valuation rarely seen. At just 4.7 times sales, MercadoLibre is at nearly the cheapest valuation it has been at since coming public in 2007.

Some relatively cheap companies are rightly considered value traps -- a poor business facing secular decline or other risks that looks appealing due to its rock-bottom valuation. MercadoLibre doesn't fit the definition. MercadoLibre dominates the e-commerce and fintech spaces in Latin America, with more than 20% share of total retail e-commerce sales in the region in 2021, according to Statista. Additionally, the company could improve its dominance: A report published through Statista suggests MercadoLibre's market share could reach almost 22% by 2023.

On the fintech side, MercadoLibre is also a top dog. The unique demographics of the region it serves include a relatively young consumer group in larger countries like Brazil and Mexico. There is also an elevated desire for digital payment platforms, meaning fintech in Latin America is expected to grow exponentially over the coming years. MercadoLibre already has over 38 million unique fintech users. This puts it in a great spot to thrive on these tailwinds.

MercadoLibre is posting some impressive results. Over the trailing 12 months, it saw revenue surpass $8.8 billion. From that revenue, it managed to extract over $1 billion in free cash flow despite its heavy investments to capture the opportunity ahead.

With a powerful grip on the industries it operates in, MercadoLibre looks well positioned to benefit from the rising tides in Latin America. The company has attractive growth prospects over the next five years, so today's valuation looks like a gift for long-term investors.

The second-fastest growing software company in history

Trevor Jennewine (CrowdStrike Holdings): Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike went public with 10 software modules in its arsenal in 2019, but its portfolio has more than doubled in size since then. The CrowdStrike Falcon platform now features 22 modules, spanning from endpoint and cloud security to identity protection and managed services. Better yet, CrowdStrike has become the gold standard in endpoint security and managed detection and response, and it's considered a leader in threat intelligence and incident response services.

That success stems from its broad portfolio and unique architecture. CrowdStrike can replace numerous point solutions with a single platform, allowing businesses to consolidate security spend through one vendor. In addition, all 22 CrowdStrike modules are delivered through a single piece of software that can be installed without a device reboot. That means customers can deploy Falcon without disrupting their businesses, and management believes that friction-reducing quality is unique to CrowdStrike.

Better yet, as the market leader in endpoint security, CrowdStrike can collect security signals on a scale no competitor can match, and that makes its artificial-intelligence engine uniquely effective in identifying cyberattacks, according to CEO George Kurtz. Naturally, the promise of best-in-class security has fueled strong demand. CrowdStrike expanded its customer base by 51% in the past year, and the average customer increased spend by more than 20%.

To that end, CrowdStrike is growing like wildfire. Over the past year, revenue climbed 61% to $1.8 billion and free cash flow soared 49% to $543 million. But the company accomplished something even more impressive. CrowdStrike is the second-fastest software company in history to achieve a $2 billion revenue run rate. Only Zoom Video Communications got to that rate more quickly.

Investors have good reason to believe CrowdStrike can maintain that momentum. Cybersecurity is not a discretionary expense -- it is a necessity. Trends such as cloud computing, remote work, and the proliferation of connected devices have created new attack surfaces for hackers, and the problem will only become more pressing in the future. To that end, CrowdStrike puts its addressable market at $97 billion by 2025.

Currently, shares trade at 19.2 times sales -- the cheapest valuation since March 2020, when the share price cratered as the stock market crashed at the onset of the pandemic. That valuation may not be cheap in a traditional sense, but it does create a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors.",cybersecurity,motley fool

The seventh-generation model is all-new inside and out, according to the US automaker. And while its new sleeker looks may take some time to settle in with fans, those who like to take their Mustangs to third-party tuners won't be as enthusiastic this time around because of Ford's tougher onboard security measures.

The Ford Mustang is known to be one of the most tuner-friendly cars around. However, the upcoming S650 seventh-gen model could change that reputation, and not in a good way. Speaking to Ford Authority, Mustang's Chief Engineer Ed Krenz noted that the latest model utilized the company's new Fully Networked Vehicle (FNV) electrical architecture, making for some good and bad news.

The good news being the convenience of getting over-the-air updates and added cybersecurity against hackers, with cars being practically connected computers on wheels these days. However, Ford's FNV will also restrict the car's tuning potential, which is likely to upset Mustang fans.

Since the car's entire ""stack"" will be encrypted, including the ECU, third-party tuners are going to have a tough time getting their mods to work. For instance, the car's turbocharger and/or other components could shut down if the onboard security system detects an unauthenticated actor.

Ford can expect backlash from die-hard Mustang customers and aftermarket tuners, though for now, the automaker says that it is open to collaborating with tuners in offering ""performance enhancements or tunes"" for the all-new 2.3 liter EcoBoost and 5.0 liter Coyote V8 engines. What that means for 2024 Mustang owners in terms of modability remains to be seen.

Once a charismatic analog muscle car, the latest Ford Mustang seems to be undergoing a major transformation towards becoming a modern, computer on wheels. The S650 series features a fully digital cockpit running the Unreal engine-powered Sync 4 system, advanced driver assistance tech, Alexa integration, and the ability to rev the engine via the key fob remotely.

While all this tech (and the occasional gimmick) does have its appeal, it ultimately requires carmakers to bake in more security measures to prevent hacking, which in turn locks down their tuning potential that ends up annoying petrolheads.

Here's hoping Ford can find the right balance with the upcoming S650 Mustang that doesn't alienate the muscle car's core audience, while also maintaining its appeal with the younger, more techy crowd.",cybersecurity,techspot
104,Nasdaq Bear Market: 5 Colossal Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying On the Dip,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/704305/bear-market-stocks-plunge-crash-invest-correction-getty.jpg,15/10/2022,These game-changing stocks are begging to be bought following a 34% plunge in the Nasdaq Composite.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/15/nasdaq-bear-market-5-growth-stocks-regret-not-buy/,"When the curtain eventually closes on 2022, it'll undoubtedly go down as one of the most challenging years for investors in decades. The S&P 500, which is often looked to as the best gauge of the stock market's health, delivered its worst first-half return since 1970 and has plunged as much as 26% from its all-time high, set in January.

Things have been even worse for the technology stock-driven Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC). The index responsible for leading the broader market to new highs has plummeted as much as 34%, through Oct. 10, 2022. That places the Nasdaq firmly in the grips of a bear market.

But there's good news amid this chaos. Historically, every double-digit percentage decline in the major U.S. stock indexes, including the Nasdaq, has eventually been placed in the rearview mirror by a bull market rally. This makes every bear market a surefire buying opportunity for patient investors.

It's an especially smart time to consider buying some of the beaten-down growth stocks whose innovations will be shaping the future. What follows are five colossal growth stocks you'll regret not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip.

Visa

The first spectacular growth stock that'll have investors kicking themselves if they don't buy it on the Nasdaq bear market dip is payment processor Visa (V -2.89%). Although Visa is cyclical and all signs point to U.S. and global growth slowing, this is a company that has both numbers and competitive advantages on its side.

Though cyclical stocks like Visa are prone to weakness when consumer and enterprise spending slows, it's important to recognize that periods of contraction don't last very long. Comparatively, economic expansions are almost always measured in years. Buying and holding a payment powerhouse like Visa allows long-term investors to take advantage of disproportionately long periods of expansion.

Opportunities abound domestically and abroad for Visa. This is a company that controlled 54% of credit card network purchasing volume in the U.S. in 2020 -- the U.S. is the world's leading market for consumption. It also has the capacity to organically or acquisitively expand its payment network into underbanked regions of the world. Since most global transactions are still being conducted with cash, Visa has a growth runway that could conservatively span decades.

Another reason for Visa's success is the fiscal prudence of its management team. Visa strictly acts as a payment processor and avoids lending. In doing so, it sidesteps the loan delinquencies and inevitable charge-offs that crop up during economic contractions and recessions. Not having to set aside capital is a big advantage that helps Visa bounce back from recessions faster than most financial stocks.

Broadcom

Semiconductor solutions specialist Broadcom (AVGO -2.54%) is the second superb growth stock you'll regret not buying as the Nasdaq plunges. Though semiconductor stocks are contending with the fears of a cyclical downturn, Broadcom has catalysts in place that should lessen this short-term pain.

For instance, Broadcom's biggest catalyst, the 5G revolution, should be fairly insulated from a possible recession. It's been about a decade since telecom companies dramatically improved wireless download speeds. Given that wireless/smartphone access has practically evolved into a basic necessity, we should witness an ongoing device replacement cycle through mid-decade. That's great news for Broadcom, which generates most of its revenue from the wireless chips and accessories found in next-generation smartphones.

Additionally, Broadcom can benefit from its ancillary sales channels. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses have been moving their data online and into the cloud at an accelerated pace. Broadcom is a supplier of connectivity and access chips used in data centers. The more data that moves into the cloud, the more demand there is for connectivity and access chips.

Broadcom also ended 2021 with a historically high backlog of $14.9 billion. These orders should buffer its operating cash flow in the event the U.S. or global economy skids into a recession.

Intuitive Surgical

The third colossal growth stock begging to be bought during the Nasdaq bear market dip is robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG -4.35%). While Intuitive Surgical has seen some optional surgical procedures get postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's market share and operating model make it a no-brainer buy.

Through the midpoint of 2022, Intuitive Surgical had installed 7,135 of its da Vinci surgical systems in hospitals and surgical centers worldwide. This might not sound like a particularly large number, but it's far and away more than any of its competitors.

To build on this point, these da Vinci systems are pricey -- often $0.5 million to $2.5 million. Taking into account the cost to buy these systems and the time-consuming training given to surgeons who use them, hospitals and surgical centers are highly unlikely to switch to a competitor once the da Vinci system has been purchased.

But the best thing about Intuitive Surgical just might be its razor-and-blades operating model. The ""razor-and-blades"" model gets a customer hooked with a generally lower-margin product (the razor) that uses high-margin replacement parts (the blades). In Intuitive Surgical's case, its da Vinci surgical systems are the razor, and the instruments sold with each procedure, along with the servicing done on these systems, are the blades. As more da Vinci systems are installed, the revenue pendulum swings ever more toward the company's higher-margin channels.

Okta

A fourth supercharged growth stock that you'll regret not adding on the Nasdaq bear market dip is cybersecurity company Okta (OKTA -7.40%). Despite Okta's bottom-line results failing to impress Wall Street, the company's long-term catalysts remain unchanged.

On a macro basis, cybersecurity has become a basic necessity service for businesses of all sizes. No matter how well or poorly the stock market or U.S. economy perform, robots and hackers are always going to try to steal sensitive data. Having software in place to protect all facets of that data has become paramount.

What makes Okta so special is the company's cloud-native identity verification platform. Okta is reliant on machine-learning software to become more efficient at recognizing and responding to potential threats. With a cloud-native platform that should be superior to on-premises identity verification solutions, Okta looks to gobble up its piece of what it deems to be an $80 billion addressable market.

Perhaps the biggest game-changer for Okta is its $6.5 billion acquisition of Auth0, which closed last year. Although integration snafus and combination-related expenses have widened Okta's losses over the past couple of quarters, the purchase of Auth0 more importantly broadens the company's reach to international markets. Furthermore, it expands Okta's potential pool of customers and fosters more cross-selling opportunities.

Amazon

The fifth colossal growth stock you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip is none other than FAANG stock Amazon (AMZN -4.83%). Despite concerns that a weaker U.S. and global economy could weigh on the company's online sales, the operating segments that really matter for Amazon continue to fire on all cylinders.

Most people are familiar with Amazon because of its dominant online marketplace. According to a March 2022 report from eMarketer, Amazon should account for 39.5% of all U.S. online retail sales this year. But even though retail sales make up the bulk of Amazon's revenue, online retail is a low-margin segment. The true key to Amazon's growth is its higher-margin operating segments.

For instance, the popularity of Amazon's marketplace helped the company sign up more than 200 million Prime members globally, as of April 2021. This figure has likely moved a lot higher, especially with Amazon gaining the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football. Subscription services have grown into a $35 billion annual run-rate segment for the company.

What's more, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's top cloud infrastructure service provider. Cloud-service margins are considerably higher than online retail margins, and cloud-service growth is still in its very early innings. Despite accounting for only a sixth of Amazon's net sales, AWS regularly produces half or more of the company's operating income.

AWS, subscription services, and even advertising services are the keys to tripling Amazon's operating cash flow over the next four years.",cybersecurity,motley fool
105,Yet another critical VPN-related bug found in iOS 16,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SEXM8ah9EKKpBKB22d7Ak3-1200-80.jpg,15/10/2022,"It's the second data leak being reported in just a few months, but your iPhone VPN app isn't the one to blame for it.",https://www.techradar.com/news/yet-another-critical-vpn-related-bug-found-in-ios-16,"Audio player loading…

It was sometime in May when a security expert first revealed that iPhone VPN apps were leaking users' data, claiming that Apple wasn't doing anything to fix it.

Now, only a few months later, another major issue has been found when using VPN software on iOS. In this instance, some of people's most sensitive information is in real danger.

Another expert has recently discovered that many Apple apps, including Health and Wallet, send users' private data outside an active VPN tunnel.

However, the best VPN services are not the ones to blame here.

We confirm that iOS 16 does communicate with Apple services outside an active VPN tunnel. Worse, it leaks DNS requests. #Apple services that escape the VPN connection include Health, Maps, Wallet.We used @ProtonVPN and #Wireshark. Details in the video:#CyberSecurity #Privacy pic.twitter.com/ReUmfa67lnOctober 12, 2022 See more

Apple apps bypass VPN encryption

""We confirm that iOS 16 does communicate with Apple services outside an active VPN tunnel. Worse, it leaks DNS requests,"" developer and security researcher Tommy Mysk tweeted on October 12.

Theoretically, when you connect to a secure VPN, your data is encrypted and passed through one of its international servers before it reaches it destination. This means that neither your ISP, nor any other third party should be able to access this flow of information. Similarly, the websites you visit won't be able to define your real IP address or any other identifying details.

Mysk ran a few tests on iOS 16 with both Proton VPN and Wireshark active. To his dismay, he and his team found out that many Apple apps actually ignore the VPN tunnel and exchange data directly with Apple servers.

What's worse, the applications leaking data are actually those managing the most private and sensitive information. These are Health, Wallet, Apple Store, Clips, Files, Find My, Maps and Settings.

Talking about the reasons behind this bug, Myks seems to believe that Apple does so intentionally.

""There are services on the iPhone that require frequent contact with Apple servers, such as Find My and Push Notifications. However, I don’t see an issue of tunneling this traffic in the VPN connection. The traffic is encrypted anyways,” he told 9to5Mac (opens in new tab), adding that they didn't expect such an amount of traffic to be exposed.

Not just iOS VPN

As Mysk confirms during his testing, iPhone and iPad users are not the only ones risking their privacy.

""I know what you're asking yourself and the answer is YES. Android communicates with Google services outside an active VPN connection, even with the options Always-on and Block Connections without VPN,"" he said.

Just a few days ago we reported on Mullvad VPN's findings that Android devices are quietly undermining VPN services during its last security audit.

Here, Android VPNs expose users' data while performing connectivity checks when accessing some Wi-Fi networks.

The VPN provider pledged Google to add an option to opt out for these checks when the VPN is active, but the big tech giant believes there's no need for this. This is why Mullvad is now pushing for at least changing the ""misleading"" description of its VPN-related features.",cybersecurity,techradar

A 53-year-old cybersecurity expert, Itkis is an independent candidate running in New York’s 12th district, where he is a long shot bid to unseat Rep. Jerry Nadler. Itkis has focused his campaign on legalizing sex work, ending adultery laws and defining consent.

Itkis recently released a 13-minute porn video in an effort to prove that sex positivity is one of his keystone issues. The video, titled “Bucket List Bonanza,” stars Itkis and porn star Nicole Sage. The porno marks the first time Itkis had sex on camera, he confirmed.

“If I would just talk about it, it wouldn’t demonstrate my commitment to the issue,” he told City & State. “And the fact I actually did it was a huge learning experience, and it actually influenced items on my platform.”

Itkis continued, “I’m very much an introvert. I’m kind of a nerd who doesn’t like to be the center of attention if I can avoid it. But I thought the issues I’m trying to address are so important. I wanted to have my issues talked about in some way.”",cybersecurity,complex

Nvidia's newest flagship GPU shattered the RTX 3090's previous benchmark records and doubled performance across almost every algorithm tested. The cracked passwords adhered to security best practices and included random letter cases, symbols, and numbers.

According to Croley's tweet, the mammoth GPU was tested against Microsoft's well-known New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication protocol as well as the Bcrypt password-hacking function. All of the tests were conducted using Hashcat v6.2.6 in benchmark mode. Hashcat is a well-known and widely used password-cracking tool used by system administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and cybercriminals to test or guess user passwords.

Easily capable of setting records: 300GH/s NTLM and 200kh/s bcrypt w/ OC! Thanks to blazer for the run. Full benchmarks here: https://t.co/Bftucib7P9 pic.twitter.com/KHV5yCUkV4 — Chick3nman "" (@Chick3nman512) October 14, 2022

Based on the benchmark findings, a fully outfitted password hashing rig with eight RTX 4090 GPUs would have the computing power to cycle through all 200 billion iterations of an eight-character password in 48 minutes. The sub-one-hour result is 2.5 times faster than the RTX 3090's previous record. Both benchmark measurements were conducted using only commercially available GPU hardware and related software.

The Hashcat software provides several attack types designed to facilitate password recovery assistance or, depending on the user, unauthorized access to another's accounts. These attack types include dictionary attacks, combinator attacks, mask attacks, rule-based attacks, and brute force attacks.

Many of the attacks available in Hashcat and other password-cracking tools can benefit from predictable human behaviors that often result in poor security practices. For example, an attack may first focus on well-known words, terms, or patterns in an attempt to minimize the amount of time required to crack the user's password. Using these types of lists and data in the attack can bring the time required to crack a password down from 48 minutes to mere milliseconds.

While the benchmark results may sound ominous, it's important to note that the approach may only have a limited set of real-world use cases. MIRACL Chief Operating Officer Grant Wyatt told ITPro.com that these types of attacks are typically relegated to offline assets due to online security tools, practices, and configurations.",cybersecurity,techspot

With the US midterm elections in sight, federal agencies are warning Americans that ""foreign actors are likely to use information manipulation tactics""

In less than four weeks, the balance of power in the US House of Representatives and Senate will be up for grabs, along with a host of gubernatorial seats, and positions at the state and municipal levels.

With everyone preparing to cast their ballots, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have reminded people about the potential threat of disinformation.

Foreign actors may intensify efforts to influence outcomes of the 2022 midterm elections by circulating or amplifying reports of real or alleged malicious cyber activity on election infrastructure

It warns that forein actors may ""create and knowingly disseminate false claims and narratives regarding voter suppression, voter or ballot fraud, and other false information intended to undermine confidence in the election processes and influence public opinion of the elections' legitimacy.""

It's not news that countries outside the US have engaged in disinformation operations before. And though we may immediately think of Russia, Iran, and China, it's worth keeping the other 70-odd countries that are into disinformation campaigns in mind too.

Nation-backed threat actors use several methods to amplify fake narratives and false claims, incite anger, and mobilize angry voters. They use public online spaces, such as social media networks, they also use email, text messages, online journals and forums, spoof websites, and fake personas.

The agencies also warn that threat actors may claim they have successfully hacked or leaked election-related data, to sow distrust in the US system and undermine voter confidence. They also affirm that while threat actors might be making hay in the discourse that precedes elections, the actual election process have not been compromised.

No information suggesting any cyber activity against US election infrastructure has impacted the accuracy of voter registration information, prevented a registered voter from casting a ballot, or compromised the integrity of any ballots cast.

Americans are urged to examine both the information they receive, and its sources, with a critical eye, and to seek out reliable and verified news to share, react to, and discuss with others.

Potential election crimes, such as intentional disinformation about the manner, time, or

place of voting, should be reported to your local FBI Field Office, they say.",cybersecurity,malwarebytes.com

They were left unable to listen to their favorite podcasts for hours after an TLS certificate at the streaming giant expired. Although certificates, or ""machine identities,"" like these are intended to provide a backbone of trust across the online world, they are also increasingly challenging for organizations to manage. Digital transformation is driving an unprecedented expansion of machine identity volumes across the globe. That’s bad news for the security teams tasked with managing them. When even one expires, it can lead to chaos.

Spotify is certainly not the first big-name brand impacted in this way. And it definitely won’t be the last. The message is clear: brands need a more efficient, automated way to manage these identities if they want to optimize cybersecurity and service uptime.

An expensive challenge

Advertisement

While human identity is authenticated and secured via usernames and passwords, machine identities use keys and certificates to validate the legitimacy of information flowing between authorized machines. They can be used to secure privileged access, DevOps assets and web transactions, authenticate software code, and enable secure, remote access to enterprise networks. But what happens when those identities expire? A certificate-related outage of the sort that recently affected Spotify, creates downtime and security risks until it is resolved.

That could end up having a major financial and reputational impact. Exactly how much is open to debate, as accurate data is difficult to come by. A Gartner study from years ago puts the figure at $5,600 per minute of IT downtime. A more recent study from ITIC claimed that just one hour of server downtime totals $300,000+ for 91 percent percent of SMEs and large enterprises. Over two-fifths (44 percent) of respondents said an hour costs over $1m. That’s not to mention the impact of poor customer experience, reduced worker productivity, diminished brand value, supply chain disruption and other factors highlighted in this research.

Getting worse

The bad news is that machine identity management is becoming more challenging for security teams as their organizations embark on a proliferation of digital initiatives. Research reveals that two-thirds (65 percent) of businesses increased technology spend during the pandemic. They invested in IoT systems to streamline business processes, laptops and mobile devices for hybrid workers, and new internal and customer-facing apps and websites to improve user experiences. In the cloud, containers, APIs and more help to drive DevOps and greater business agility. But all of these new assets need machine identities to help secure them.

Research reveals that the average business used nearly 250,000 machine identities at the end of 2021. Yet it’s predicted that they’ll double this inventory to at least 500,000 by 2024. With so many certificates to issue and manage, it’s no surprise that some slip through the cracks.

The challenge is made that much harder by separate trends occurring in the marketplace. Leading browsers are demanding that organizations change their machine identities every year, which will accelerate the frequency with which they must rotate certificates. What’s more, Let’s Encrypt, now the world’s leading certificate authority (CA), and many of its peers, are now only issuing machine identities for 90 days. They’re doing this to limit any potential damage from key compromise and mis-issuance. But forcing more frequent renewals makes missed expiration dates more likely. This doesn’t just increase the risk of outages, it can create additional security risks, by exposing websites to man-in-the-middle and phishing attacks.

It's time to automate

This is a situation that can no longer be managed manually. Even organizations with modest digital transformation plans will soon find the number of keys and certificates they need to keep track of spiraling out of control. The answer is to invest in a control plane which enables automated management of machine identities throughout their lifespan.

There are several ways that intelligent automation of this kind can benefit organizations and their security administrators. First, they can be set to intuitively discover all corporate certs across cloud, virtual and physical assets, and then catalogue them in a centralized repository. That will provide continuous visibility. Next, control tools can be deployed to automatically verify security compliance: ensuring all certificates have the right owners, attributes, and configurations no matter which CA issued them. Finally, and most important for mitigating the risk of expiration, tools can help teams continuously monitor all of their certs, alert them when one is about to expire and even automatically renew.

Being able to install, configure and validate certificates proactively before they expire, and in seconds, not only reduces security risk and the threat of financial and reputational damage that stems from outages. It also frees up security staff to work on high value strategic tasks. In a world where security talent is in increasingly short supply, that’s yet another reason to automate away the challenges of machine identity management.

Bingle et al., C.A. No. 2021-0494-SG (Del. Ch.) dismissing claims asserted against members of SolarWinds Corporation’s (“SolarWinds” or the “Company”) board of directors supplies instructive guidance on the scope and limits of directorial liability for alleged failure to oversee corporate operations.

Background

SolarWinds is a leading provider of information technology management software and solutions. The Company’s client list includes virtually all of the Fortune 500 and numerous U.S. government agencies. In 2020, Russian special services executed a cyberattack on SolarWinds to implant malware known as “Sunburst” in the Company’s flagship Orion software, ultimately seeking to target the systems of SolarWinds’ Orion clients. The Sunburst attack has been called the “most sophisticated” cyberattack in history.

Following the announcement of the Sunburst attack in December 2020, the Company found itself targeted in a number of governmental investigations and shareholder lawsuits. A putative derivative action filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleged claims seeking to hold SolarWinds’ directors liable for alleged damages to the Company purportedly flowing from the board’s failure to adequately oversee cybersecurity risks—a so-called Caremark claim.

Defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint on various grounds, including that plaintiffs failed to plead, with the factual particularity required under Delaware law, that a pre-suit demand upon SolarWinds’ board to bring the claims was legally excused as “futile” because a majority of the Company’s directors could not have exercised their business judgment with regard to such a demand. Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock, III agreed that plaintiffs failed adequately to plead demand futility, and therefore dismissed the complaint.

The Court’s Ruling

The Court began by noting the high bar a shareholder asserting a Caremark claim must clear to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage. Where, as with SolarWinds, a corporation’s charter includes provisions authorized under Delaware General Corporation Law Section 102(b)(7) exculpating directors from liability for acts of gross negligence, the complaint must plead facts establishing bad faith—i.e., “an action (or omission) that a director knows is contrary to the corporate weal.” In the context of a Caremark claim, pleading such bad faith typically requires allegations establishing that the directors either (1) utterly failed to establish any system for board-level reporting of risk or (2) failed to act in the face of known “red flags.” Further, as the Court observed, Caremark claims have, historically, been found viable only “in connection with the corporation’s violation of positive law.”

Plaintiffs did not allege that SolarWinds violated any laws. Instead, plaintiffs urged the Court to find that Caremark liability might attach to the board’s alleged failure to oversee risks relating to cybercrimes that third parties might seek to commit against SolarWinds. The Court noted that the question of whether directors of Delaware corporations may face liability under Caremark for failing to monitor such business risks—as opposed to corporate compliance with applicable laws—remains undecided. Although the Chancery Court’s recent opinion in another derivative action arising from a cyberattack on Marriott International, Inc. had entertained the possibility that failure to monitor cybersecurity risks could give rise to Caremark liability, the Court dismissed the claims against Marriott’s board, noting that there was “no known illegal conduct, lawbreaking, or violation[] of a regulatory mandate alleged in the Complaint that could support a finding that the [] Board faces a substantial likelihood of liability for failed oversight.” In Construction Industry Laborers, Vice Chancellor Glasscock observed that, while it might be possible to “envision an extreme hypothetical” in which bad faith failure to monitor business risk could give rise to Caremark liability, it is unclear whether cybersecurity attacks perpetrated by malicious third parties “present a sufficient nexus between the corporate trauma suffered and the Board for liability to attach.” Ultimately, the Court concluded it need not decide that question, as the claims before it instead could be resolved via a “traditional ‘two prong’ Caremark analysis.”

The Court began its analysis with Caremark’s second prong—examining plaintiffs’ allegations that SolarWinds’ board acted in bad faith by purportedly ignoring “red flags” pertaining to cybersecurity risks. The Court found these allegations wanting. The Court rejected plaintiffs’ allegations that a cybersecurity briefing presented to the board’s Nominating and Governance Committee (“NGC”) was a red flag that was ignored. Where the presentation warned of cybersecurity threats and risks but “was not indicative of an imminent corporate trauma,” the Court held that (1) the presentation was not a “red flag” at all, but rather an instance of board-level oversight; and (2) the complaint failed to plead that the presentation “made action by the Board necessary.” The Court also quickly dispensed with allegations about other supposed “red flags”—including concerns allegedly raised by a former employee and allegations about use of a weak password—that plaintiffs failed to plead were brought to the board’s attention during the relevant period.

Next, the Court addressed what it characterized as plaintiffs’ “stronger argument”—that the above and other allegations pled in plaintiffs’ complaint alleged the absence of an effective reporting system subjecting SolarWinds’ directors to liability under prong one of Caremark. Central to plaintiffs’ argument in this regard was the allegation that SolarWinds’ board—as a whole—did not receive any briefing on cybersecurity risk during a roughly two-year period preceding the announcement of the Sunburst attack. The complaint acknowledged, however, that the charters of both the Company’s Audit Committee and NGC charged those committees with responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity matters, and expressly acknowledged that the NGC had received a cybersecurity briefing from management in February 2019. Accordingly, the Court determined that the critical “question is whether I can infer that the Committees’ failure to report to the Board regarding cybersecurity risk over a period of 26 months … was reflective of bad faith, on the part of a majority of directors.”

The Court found any such inference unwarranted where the complaint gave no indication that either of the committees to which oversight responsibility had been delegated were “sham” committees, and the complaint affirmatively pled that the NGC met and discussed cybersecurity during the relevant period. Further, in the absence of particular fact allegations concerning the committees’ alleged “awareness of a particular [cybersecurity] threat, or understanding of actions the Board should take,” the allegation that neither committee reported to the full board on cybersecurity risk during the period in question failed to implicate bad faith. The Court noted that board committees delegated oversight responsibility must “exercise business judgment in determining what issues should be brought from the subcommittee to the full Board.” More to the point, the Court reasoned that “[h]aving delegated oversight of risk to two non-sham, functioning Committees, the failure of those Committees to make a Board presentation on a particular risk in a particular year, without more, does not to my mind give rise to an inference that the Board intentionally disregarded its oversight duties in bad faith.” As the Court succinctly put it: “It is not indicative of an utter failure of reporting and control for the Board to delegate risk assessment to the Committees, and then fail to demand an accounting of a particular business risk.”

Having concluded that the complaint failed to plead facts supporting a reasonable inference of bad faith by SolarWinds’ directors, the Court held that plaintiffs’ Caremark claim was “not viable,” and therefore that plaintiffs had failed to plead that a majority of the board faced a substantial likelihood of liability excusing plaintiffs’ failure to make a pre-suit demand. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the complaint.

Key Takeaways

The Construction Industry Laborers opinion reaffirms that viable Caremark claims must be predicated on allegations of particular facts indicating bad faith. The decision confirms that directors who have ensured that a board-level reporting system is in place do not face liability under prong one of Caremark, and that it is entirely appropriate to delegate responsibility for oversight of particular risks to a board committee. The opinion also reinforces the premise that, for Caremark prong two purposes, purported “red flags” must signal concrete and, in the Court’s words, “imminent corporate trauma”—theoretical warnings about potential risks are not “red flags.” The Court’s decision left for another day the question of whether Delaware directors might, under some circumstances, face Caremark liability for alleged bad faith failure to oversee business risks arising from malicious acts by third parties, as opposed to alleged legal or regulatory violations by the companies those directors serve.

H…",https://dnyuz.com/2022/10/15/new-generation-of-combat-vets-eyeing-house-strike-from-the-right/,"In early 2019, as the Defense Department’s bureaucracy seemed to be slow-walking then-President Donald J. Trump’s order to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria, Joe Kent, a C.I.A. paramilitary officer, called his wife, Shannon, a Navy cryptologic technician who was still in Syria working against the Islamic State.

“‘Make sure you’re not the last person to die in a war that everyone’s already forgotten about,’” Mr. Kent said he told his wife. “And that’s exactly what happened,” he added bitterly.

The suicide bombing that killed Ms. Kent and three other service members days later set off a chain of events — including a somber encounter with Mr. Trump — that has propelled Mr. Kent from a storied combat career to single parenthood, from comparing notes with other antiwar veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan to making increasingly loud pronouncements that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and that the Jan. 6 rioters are political prisoners.

In five weeks, Mr. Kent, 42, a candidate for a House seat in Washington State that was long represented by a soft-spoken moderate Republican, may well be elected to Congress. And he is far from alone.

A new breed of veterans, many with remarkable biographies and undeniable stories of heroism, are running for the House on the far right of the Republican Party, challenging old assumptions that adding veterans to Congress — men and women who fought for the country and defended the Constitution — would foster bipartisanship and cooperation. At the same time, they are embracing anti-interventionist military and foreign policies that, since the end of World War II, have been associated more with the Democratic left than the mainline G.O.P.

Alek Skarlatos, 30, a Republican candidate in Oregon, helped thwart a terrorist attack on a packed train bound for Paris, was honored by President Barack Obama and played himself in a Clint Eastwood movie about the incident. Mr. Skarlatos now says the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol has been used as an excuse “to demonize Trump supporters.”

Eli Crane, 42, running in a Republican-leaning House district in Arizona, saw five wartime deployments with SEAL Team 3 over 13 years — as a sniper, manning machine-gun turrets and running kill-or-capture missions with the Delta Force against high-value targets, some in Falluja. Mr. Crane presses the false case that the 2020 election was stolen.

And Derrick Van Orden, 53, who is favored to win a House seat in Wisconsin, retired as a Navy SEAL senior chief after combat deployments in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Horn of Africa and Central and South America. Mr. Van Orden was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, hoping to disrupt the certification of President Biden’s election.

Beyond their right-wing leanings, all share in common a deep skepticism about U.S. interventionism, borne of years of fighting in the post-9/11 war on terrorism and the belief that their sacrifices only gave rise to more instability and repression wherever the United States put boots on the ground.

Where earlier generations of combat veterans in Congress became die-hard defenders of a global military footprint, the new cohort is unafraid to launch ad hominem attacks on the men who still lead U.S. forces.

“I worked for Milley. I worked for Austin. I worked for Mattis,” said Don Bolduc, 60, the retired brigadier general challenging Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, of Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the current and former defense secretaries Lloyd Austin and Jim Mattis. “Their concerns centered around the military-industrial complex and maintaining the military-industrial complex, so as three- and four-star generals, they can roll right into very lucrative jobs.”

Mr. Austin and Mr. Mattis declined to comment. A defense official close to Gen. Milley said, “there isn’t a shred of evidence indicating Gen. Milley has been concerned with maintaining the military industrial complex and has no plans to seek employment in the defense industry after retirement.”

No one has questioned these men’s valor, as some have questioned that of another pro-Trump House candidate, J.R. Majewski of Ohio, who appears to have exaggerated his combat record.

But their pivots to the far right have confounded other veterans, especially those who have long pressed former service members to run for office as problem-solving moderates less vulnerable to shifting partisan winds. Organizations like New Politics, and With Honor Action were founded in the past decade on the notion that records of service would promote cooperation in government. That ideal is under assault.

“When you think about the faith of the mission, listen, this is hard,” said Rye Barcott, founder and chief executive officer of With Honor Action. “I mean, the trends have certainly gotten worse.”

Democratic veterans, however, see the newer veteran candidates’ willingness to embrace Mr. Trump’s lies as a precursor to totalitarianism, and in contravention of their service. “We all took the same oath,” said Representative Ruben Gallego, a former Marine who saw some of the worst combat of the Iraq war. “We all understand the Constitution of United States, and some of these men are really leaning into outright fascism.”

The candidates insist their views were informed by their combat experiences and demonstrate wisdom, not radicalization.

Mr. Crane said that he witnessed overseas the lengths to which people would go to seize and hold power, and that this fed his belief that Democrats had somehow rigged the 2020 election in President Biden’s favor.

“I think that we’re foolish if we’re not willing to be skeptical of our own system,” he said.

For Mr. Kent, the journey to the Trumpian right was both long and surprisingly short.

Inspired to join the Army at 13 by the Black Hawk battle in Somalia, he enlisted at 17 and applied for the Special Forces just before Sept. 11, 2001. Two years later he was in Iraq, where he fought in Falluja, hunted down members of Saddam Hussein’s government and briefed intelligence and State Department officers on the deteriorating war.

By 2011, as U.S. forces were preparing to leave, he said, he told General Austin, then the Army commander in Iraq, that the United States’ support of “this Iranian-proxy, Shia government is going to result in Al Qaeda in Iraq.”

But it was his wife’s death in Syria that pushed Mr. Kent, by then in the C.I.A., into the arms of Trumpism. “She was there because unelected bureaucrats decided to slow-roll” Mr. Trump’s withdrawal orders, he said. “You can disobey an order from a president fairly easily, because he’s so far up from the ground level, simply by dragging your feet. And that’s a lot of what happened.”

At Dover Air Force Base, he met Mr. Trump, who was there to pay his respects to the bodies of those killed in Syria. Mr. Kent expressed his support for the president’s efforts to withdraw from the Middle East and Afghanistan. Within days, he was consulting with the White House and volunteering for Veterans for Trump.

In a video he made for the Koch-funded Concerned Veterans for America decrying the post-9/11 wars, he appears as a bearded, longhaired grieving father.

Today, clean-cut and square-jawed, he is seen by many as a right-wing radical, ready to connect what he calls the lies that dragged his nation into war and the stories he tells of stolen elections, political prisoners who attacked the Capitol, and the slippery slope to nuclear war that the Biden administration is on in Ukraine.

“People can easily dismiss that and say, ‘Oh, he’s just a tinfoil hat conspiracy guy,’ but when you break down the nitty-gritty details of all of these different things, and the results that they’ve had on our country, I think it’s worth looking into,” Mr. Kent said.

His former campaign manager, Byron Sanford, dismissed Mr. Kent’s candidacy as a “revenge tour” for the death of his wife — who, Mr. Kent said, was both more pro-Trump and more political than Mr. Kent was at the time she was killed.

Mr. Kent had no problem with that. “If people want to characterize it as a revenge tour, yeah, I mean, I’d say it’s more of a populist uprising against the establishment,” he said. “But you know, call it what you will.”

For Mr. Bolduc, the Senate nominee in New Hampshire, the ideological shift has been more dramatic. He was one of the first Americans to make contact with Hamid Karzai, who was installed as Afghanistan’s president shortly after the U.S. invasion, and was an outspoken defender of him. In 2018, just after Gen. Bolduc’s retirement, he decried the Trump White House in The Daily Beast for “exacerbating divisiveness by not demonstrating patience and restraint, not listening to experts, attacking people for their opinions, ruining reputations, threatening institutions, abusing the media, and leading people to question our position as a beacon for promoting democracy throughout the world.”

Now, he tells voters the United States needs to avoid Iran, has done enough in Ukraine, and should undertake a wholesale re-evaluation of its posture in the world.

Mr. Bolduc contends that the interventionist views of former Senator John McCain and successors like Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina — a belief in projecting power to solve problems — arose from a belief in what he called “the military easy button.”

“My generation of combat veterans think the exact opposite,” he said.

Mr. Crane shares those views, especially on Ukraine, which he says President Biden is defending more vigorously than he is the United States’ southern border. And he, too, sees capitalism driving interventionism — a view once pushed by intellectuals on the left.

“It’s foolish, even dangerous when the industrial-military complex is driving or heavily influencing policy,” he said in an interview. “They make a lot more money when we’re at war.”

Not everyone in that generation is of the same mind.

Zach Nunn, a Republican challenging Representative Cindy Axne of Iowa, has used his Air Force combat record to burnish his credentials, but after deployments in Afghanistan, North Africa and as an election monitor in Ukraine, he has not soured on the projection of force around the globe — or on bipartisan cooperation.

Mr. Nunn speaks at length of a battle in Afghanistan in which he flew reconnaissance, providing “a canopy of freedom” for special operations forces by watching enemy positions and calling in airstrikes.

“We ended up doing three midair refuelings, we were out there for over 18 hours, and by the end of it, we had multiple ridgeline strikes and had kept the Taliban at bay long enough that the Special Operations Forces team was able to evac,” Mr. Nunn said.

What his experience did not do was breed cynicism or push him to the political margins of his party. Mr. Nunn speaks proudly of his work on cybersecurity in the Obama White House and working with the Biden administration to get allies out of Afghanistan after the military’s pullout. He says his combat experience gave him an appreciation for Americans from all walks of life and political beliefs.

“It didn’t matter what our political belief was, it was all about, hey, we’re going to protect each other’s six and complete this mission,” he said, using military jargon for watching a comrade’s back.

Mr. Barcott, of With Honor Action, argued that the new crop of right-wing veterans should not be seen as representing the political attitudes of former service members writ large. With Honor Action still asks veterans running for office to pledge to bring civility to Congress, participate in cross-partisan veterans groups, meet one-on-one with a member of the opposing party at least once a month and work with a member of the other party on one “substantial piece of legislation a year” while co-sponsoring other bipartisan bills.

But finding veterans willing to make that pledge has become more difficult.

By Mr. Barcott’s count, 685 veterans ran for the House or Senate this cycle. With Honor endorsed only 26 from both parties, many of them incumbents. Three Republican incumbents it had once endorsed, Representatives Mike Garcia of California, Greg Steube of Florida and Dan Crenshaw of Texas, were dropped for actions deemed out of keeping with the group’s mission.

Several Democrats with national security backgrounds, like Representatives Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria of Virginia and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, are running explicitly on their service records to bolster their bipartisan bona fides.

But more partisan veterans groups say this year’s candidates are pointing out a central fallacy: “People say if we just elect more veterans to Congress, things will be hunky dory, but there’s no precedent for that, no data that suggests veterans act different from anyone else,” said Dan Caldwell, an adviser to the conservative group Concerned Veterans for America.

Mr. Kent was more cutting about organizations that ostensibly back veterans bound for bipartisanship but refused to back him.

“It’s a gimmick,” he said, dismissing the groups as hawkish interventionists. “It’s just another way to get the neoconservative, neoliberal ideology furthered by wrapping it in the valor of service. Our service.”

Itkis hopes to unseat Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY). His platform includes sex positivity and support for legalizing so-called “sex work,” NBC New York reported Friday.

“To prove he’s more than just talk, Itkis was willing to bare all — and no, not in an interview. The candidate filmed and released a sex tape he made with an adult film star in hopes of pumping up support and getting his name into the race,” the outlet said.

A screenshot from what appeared to be the video in question showed Itkis and the woman, who is reportedly a porn star named Nicole Sage, in a room together:

Itkis’ website described him as a liberal independent candidate who “supports abortion rights, gun control, equal economic opportunities for everyone, strong social safety nets, and appropriate government control over markets to assure fair trade practices.”

His campaign issues page highlighted a “Sex Positive Approach” and said part of his idea of “sexual rights” is to “actively oppose the conservative idea that sex should only happen between a man and a woman who are married to each other,” adding he wants to decriminalize and legalize “sex work.”

But once sex buying, brothels, and pimping are deemed legal, the demand for commercial sex grows, resulting in more sex trafficking, according to Exodus Cry, an organization whose mission is to abolish trafficking and assist victims.

“This creates a more dangerous environment for those selling sex because it drives prices down and the need for riskier sex acts up. And since there aren’t enough women prostituting to meet the increased demand, trafficking increases,” the group said.

Per the NBC report, Itkis, a cybersecurity specialist who is also a major in the United States Army Reserves, deemed the clip, which was posted on a pornographic site, a “conversation piece” that was a big learning experience for him.

According to his website, Itkis is an unmarried man with no children, who is not celibate, and is an atheist.

Starlink is a key tool in the Ukraine war

Withdrawing Starlink terminals would deny Ukraine a key means of communication in the fight against Russia’s invasion. As well as helping Ukraine’s forces on the ground, the terminals have supported infrastructure across the country.

Ukraine has 20,000 Starlink terminals, provided evenly by USAID, Poland, the European Union and private companies, according to an Oct. 5 report from state-run news agency Ukrinform that cited Ministry of Digitalization data.

Poland purchased 11,700 Starlink terminals for Ukraine, including 5,000 acquired by state-controlled refiner PKN Orlen SA, according to Janusz Cieszynski, the government official in charge of cybersecurity.

Earlier Musk stated that the amount SpaceX was requesting to give Ukraine a “major battlefield advantage” is less than the cost of one new GPS satellite.",cybersecurity,fortune

Each password should ideally be at least eight characters in length and consist of capital and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. (Yes, using ""password123"" for everything isn't going to cut it.) It may be tempting, but using one easy-to-remember code across all of your accounts can jeopardize your online security -- and you definitely don't want to make yourself an easy target for cybercriminals. In fact, recent research by cybersecurity firm Hive Systems has suggested that a weak password can be cracked instantly by a hacker.

Password managers are vital tools that can help you stay safe online and be more digitally secure by simplifying the process of using strong passwords. And they're easier to use than you may think. Even so, 4 out of 5 American adults don't use a password manager, according to a study from Security.org.

Here's why you need a password manager and how to set one up.

What is a password manager, and why do I need one?

A password manager is an online service that stores your passwords as well as other data like credit card numbers, bank account information and identification documents in a secure, encrypted environment. It takes one of the biggest potential vulnerabilities -- weak or recycled passwords -- and does the hard work for you.

Bad password habits are dangerous for your digital security. Using weak passwords makes your accounts easy to crack, and reusing passwords leaves you open to credential stuffing attacks that can compromise accounts that share the same password.

But with a password manager, you only have to remember one single master password, and the password manager takes care of the rest -- allowing you to create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts. If you're not sure how to create a strong password, or if you don't want to come up with one on your own, your password manager can create one for you. Many password managers also include a feature that analyzes your current passwords and lets you know which ones are weak or reused and need to be changed.

Stephen Shankland/CNET

You can also securely share passwords and sensitive documents with family and friends if you need to. And if you're shopping online, you can easily fill in your credit card information to make purchases without needing to have your physical credit card on hand.

Your password manager can also help you fight against phishing scams. Even if a phishing attempt tricks you into clicking on a malicious link, it won't trick the password manager. Your password manager will detect that the URL is different than the site you usually log into -- regardless of how similar it may look to the naked eye.

If you're worried about storing all sorts of sensitive information in one place, you don't need to be. The top password managers use a zero-knowledge approach to securing your passwords and other information you store with them -- meaning that even the password manager itself can't access your passwords or other data, because everything is encrypted before it leaves your device. And if your password manager can't access your data, then neither can anyone else.

How to set up a password manager

The first thing you'll need to do is choose a password manager and set up an account (CNET's list of top password managers is a great place to start). Some password managers have a free tier that usually includes all the basic features you'd need, but you can expect to pay anywhere from $35 to $60 per year for a premium plan that includes things like access across multiple devices, expanded file storage and family sharing.

As you set up your account, you'll be asked to create a master password. This is the one password that you have to remember -- make sure it's something you can recall, yet complex enough to make it difficult for others to guess. Also, make sure your master password isn't one of your existing passwords you're already using on other sites. Some password managers, like 1Password, offer a printable ""emergency kit"" that includes information like your username and digital key and where you can write down your master password. Yes, you can write down your password, just make sure to keep the piece of paper locked in a secure location.

We really can't stress this part enough: Don't forget or lose your master password or your emergency kit because, as a security precaution, password managers don't typically offer a way to recover it. If you're locked out, there's no way back in.

Once you're all set up with your account and master password, you can download the software to your devices. Typically, you'll be prompted to download the app that corresponds to the operating system you're using when you set up your account (iOS, Android, Windows or MacOS). You can also find download links on your password manager's website for any other devices you may want to use your password manager on. If your password manager offers a browser extension, go ahead and install it -- it will make autofilling your passwords on sites much easier.

After that, you'll need to add your passwords to the password manager. Most password managers offer easy ways to import your passwords from various locations, whether that's your browser, a spreadsheet or another password manager. You can also input your passwords manually.

Once you've got your passwords loaded into your password manager, you're good to go. As long as you're logged into your password manager, it will offer to fill in your login information as you visit the sites and services you use online. It will also offer to save new, secure login credentials on new accounts you create -- ultimately saving you from putting your online security in peril.

118,Africa: Ukraine's Kuleba Tries to Change Africa's Narrative On the War,https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,15/10/2022,"Analysis - Ducking the crossfire doesn't mean staying neutral - Africa should take independent, principled positions that support the UN Charter.",https://allafrica.com/stories/202210150212.html,"analysis

Ducking the crossfire doesn't mean staying neutral - Africa should take independent, principled positions that support the UN Charter.

The protracted struggle between Russia and Ukraine (and its Western allies) to win African nations' hearts and minds continued last week with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba's continental tour.

He visited Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Kenya on a planned 10-day tour. But he cut it short to go home to deal with the massive missile strikes by Russia on Ukrainian cities on 10 and 11 October. Kuleba's African trip followed earlier ones by his American and Russian counterparts, as well as France and Germany's leaders, as Africa becomes a battleground for influence.

Kuleba was under no illusions about the difficulty of his mission. Senegalese officials had told him, 'This isn't our war, the West is fighting against Russia,' 'Russia and Ukraine are one people,' and 'Russia attacked you because you were going to become a NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] member,' he said.

'Russia's narrative has been very present here,' he added. 'Now it's time for Ukrainian truths.' Over the next week, Kuleba attempted to counter Russia's three 'lies' as he put it to African journalists in a 13 October online briefing. He noted that Russia had first attacked Ukraine in 2014 when Ukraine's policy was neutrality not NATO membership. And if the intention to join NATO was a provocation to war, why had Russia not attacked Finland?

What Kyiv fears most from Africa is indifference, neutrality or 'non-alignment'

The second Russian 'lie' was that Russia and Ukraine were actually one country, and so Russian President Vladimir Putin could impose his will on Ukraine. 'In fact we are very different countries with our own languages, cultures and histories. Imagine your neighbour coming to you and saying your language, culture and history do not exist. Your statehood is a mistake.'

And the third was that 'Russia wants peace but Ukraine refuses to negotiate.' On the contrary, Kuleba insisted that Russia had rejected Ukraine's many proposals to resolve differences. He said all of Russia's peace plans were smokescreens for ultimatums for surrender and the extinction of Ukraine.

Kuleba also dismissed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's main message on his African tour in July that global shortages of grain and fertiliser - which hit Africa hard - were mainly the fault of Western sanctions against Russia. Kuleba blamed them on Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports and noted that Russia's bombardment had raised grain prices further. He promised Kyiv would send 'boats full of seeds for Africa.'

This was the first visit by a Ukrainian foreign minister to Africa. Kuleba said some officials told him most Africans had never heard of his country before the war. He promised to step up relations and announced that Ukraine would open an embassy in Ghana - the country's 11th in Africa.

30 African states backed the latest UN resolution - two more than supported the 2 March decision

Kuleba promised digital and cybersecurity assistance, agro-technology, diplomatic training and educational bursaries to African countries. He confirmed that Ukraine was planning a 'large-scale Ukraine-Africa conference' next year - presumably partly to counter the second Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg.

Kuleba thanked his hosts in the four countries for the moral support they offered Ukraine so far in the war: Côte d'Ivoire for 'standing with Ukraine' and Senegalese President Macky Sall for 'strongly supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity.'

In February, Ukraine was delighted when Kenya advised Putin at the United Nations (UN) Security Council to respect Russia's border with Ukraine and abandon attempts to turn the clock back to Russia's glorious imperialist past. Kenya generally aligns with the democratic West on such issues, so perhaps that wasn't surprising.

Kuleba seemed especially grateful to Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo for telling the UN General Assembly last month that 'every bullet, every bomb, every shell that hits a target in Ukraine, hits our pockets and economies in Africa.' That epitomised the attitude that Ukraine hoped for from Africa.

Africa should support the UN Charter which forbids using force to change another country's borders

What Kyiv fears most from Africa is indifference, neutrality or 'non-alignment'. So Kuleba told the African journalists on Thursday that countries like South Africa, which abstained from General Assembly resolutions condemning Russia's invasion, were 'abstaining not against Ukraine but against war crimes.'

Only 28 African states supported the first UN General Assembly resolution on 2 March this year, condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine. It was significant that three of Kuleba's stops were among those 28 countries. The exception was Senegal, which had abstained. Kuleba probably included Dakar because Sall is the current African Union Chairperson and was involved in grain diplomacy to lift the Russian blockade on Ukraine's Black Sea ports.

But on Thursday, Kuleba professed to be very pleased with his African safari. All four countries visited voted in favour of the UN General Assembly resolution on 12 October that condemned Russia for its 'illegal so-called referendums' in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia and its 'attempted illegal annexation' of them.

Kuleba would have been particularly pleased that Senegal shifted its vote from abstaining in March to supporting this one. Significantly, the Angolan government did the same, stepping out of line from the five other former liberation movements in Southern Africa, which all abstained. In total, 30 African states backed the resolution - two more than supported the 2 March decision.

How will that go down in Ukraine and the West? There have been some impulses in Western countries to use more than persuasion to get African countries 'onside'. The US Congress is sitting on controversial legislation that would punish African governments and companies for doing business with dodgy listed Russian oligarchs on the continent. But ISS Today hears the bill will die in the Senate.

And in July, a leaked confidential report revealed European Union (EU) frustration with many African states' neutrality, and questioned whether the EU should consider making its considerable foreign aid to the continent dependent on African support for 'EU values'.

Could African states pay a price for not backing Ukraine and the UN Charter? That's not yet clear. Some European states fear that punishing African governments could backfire - driving them from neutrality into more active support for Russia.

Ideally, African states should take a stand in support of the UN Charter, which forbids the use of force to change the borders of another country. Ducking the crossfire in this war doesn't mean staying neutral. It means taking principled positions independently of the wider geopolitical implications.

“‘Make sure you’re not the last person to die in a war that everyone’s already forgotten about,’” Kent said he told his wife. “And that’s exactly what happened,” he added bitterly.

In early 2019, as the Defense Department’s bureaucracy seemed to be slow-walking then-President Trump’s order to withdraw all US forces from Syria, Joe Kent, a CIA paramilitary officer, called his wife, Shannon, a Navy cryptologic technician who was still in Syria working against the Islamic State group.

In five weeks, Kent, 42, a candidate for a House seat in Washington state that was long represented by a soft-spoken moderate Republican, may well be elected to Congress. And he is far from alone.

A new breed of veterans, many with remarkable biographies and undeniable stories of heroism, are running for the House on the far right of the Republican Party, challenging old assumptions that adding veterans to Congress — men and women who fought for the country and defended the Constitution — would foster bipartisanship and cooperation. At the same time, they are embracing anti-interventionist military and foreign policies that, since the end of World War II, have been associated more with the Democratic left than the mainline GOP.

Alek Skarlatos, 30, a Republican candidate in Oregon, helped thwart a terrorist attack on a packed train bound for Paris, was honored by President Obama, and played himself in a Clint Eastwood movie about the incident. Skarlatos now says the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has been used as an excuse “to demonize Trump supporters.”

Eli Crane, 42, running in a Republican-leaning House district in Arizona, saw five wartime deployments with SEAL Team 3 over 13 years — as a sniper, manning machine-gun turrets and running kill-or-capture missions with the Delta Force against high-value targets, some in Fallujah, Iraq. Crane presses the false case that the 2020 election was stolen.

And Derrick Van Orden, 53, who is favored to win a House seat in Wisconsin, retired as a Navy SEAL senior chief after combat deployments in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Horn of Africa, and Central and South America. Van Orden was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, hoping to disrupt the certification of President Biden’s election.

Beyond their right-wing leanings, all share in common a deep skepticism about US interventionism, borne of years of fighting in the post-9/11 war on terrorism and the belief that their sacrifices only gave rise to more instability and repression wherever the United States put boots on the ground.

Where earlier generations of combat veterans in Congress became die-hard defenders of a global military footprint, the new cohort is unafraid to launch ad hominem attacks on the men who still lead U.S. forces.

“I worked for Milley. I worked for Austin. I worked for Mattis,” Don Bolduc, 60, a retired brigadier general challenging Senator Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, said of General Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the current and former defense secretaries, Lloyd Austin and Jim Mattis. “Their concerns centered around the military-industrial complex and maintaining the military-industrial complex, so as three- and four-star generals, they can roll right into very lucrative jobs.”

Austin and Mattis declined to comment. A defense official close to Milley said, “there isn’t a shred of evidence indicating General Milley has been concerned with maintaining the military industrial complex and has no plans to seek employment in the defense industry after retirement.”

No one has questioned these men’s valor, as some have questioned that of another pro-Trump House candidate, J.R. Majewski of Ohio, who appears to have exaggerated his combat record.

But their pivots to the far right have confounded other veterans, especially those who have long pressed former service members to run for office as problem-solving moderates less vulnerable to shifting partisan winds. Organizations such as New Politics, and With Honor Action were founded in the past decade on the notion that records of service would promote cooperation in government. That ideal is under assault.

“When you think about the faith of the mission, listen, this is hard,” said Rye Barcott, founder and CEO of With Honor Action. “I mean, the trends have certainly gotten worse.”

Democratic veterans, however, see the newer veteran candidates’ willingness to embrace Trump’s lies as a precursor to totalitarianism, and in contravention of their service. “We all took the same oath,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., a former Marine who saw some of the worst combat of the Iraq War. “We all understand the Constitution of United States, and some of these men are really leaning into outright fascism.”

For Kent, the journey to the Trumpian right was both long and surprisingly short.

Inspired to join the Army at age 13 by the Black Hawk battle in Somalia, he enlisted at 17 and applied for the Special Forces just before 9/11. Two years later, he was in Iraq, where he fought in Fallujah, hunted down members of Saddam Hussein’s government, and briefed intelligence and State Department officers on the deteriorating war.

By 2011, as US forces were preparing to leave, he said, he told Austin, then the Army commander in Iraq, that the United States’ support of “this Iranian-proxy, Shia government is going to result in al-Qaida in Iraq.”

But it was his wife’s death in Syria that pushed Kent, by then in the CIA, into the arms of Trumpism. “She was there because unelected bureaucrats decided to slow-roll” Trump’s withdrawal orders, he said. “You can disobey an order from a president fairly easily, because he’s so far up from the ground level, simply by dragging your feet. And that’s a lot of what happened.”

At Dover Air Force Base, he met Trump, who was there to pay his respects to the bodies of those killed in Syria. Kent expressed his support for the president’s efforts to withdraw from the Middle East and Afghanistan. Within days, he was consulting with the White House and volunteering for Veterans for Trump.

For Bolduc, the Senate nominee in New Hampshire, the ideological shift has been dramatic. He was one of the first Americans to make contact with Hamid Karzai, who was installed as Afghanistan’s president shortly after the US invasion, and was an outspoken defender of him. In 2018, just after Bolduc’s retirement, he decried the Trump White House in The Daily Beast for “exacerbating divisiveness by not demonstrating patience and restraint, not listening to experts, attacking people for their opinions, ruining reputations, threatening institutions, abusing the media, and leading people to question our position as a beacon for promoting democracy throughout the world.”

Now, he tells voters the United States needs to avoid Iran, has done enough in Ukraine, and should undertake a wholesale reevaluation of its posture in the world.

Bolduc contends that the interventionist views of the late Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and successors such as Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina — a belief in projecting power to solve problems — arose from a belief in what he called “the military easy button.”

“My generation of combat veterans think the exact opposite,” he said.

Crane shares those views, especially on Ukraine, which he says Biden is defending more vigorously than he is the United States’ southern border. And he, too, sees capitalism driving interventionism — a view once pushed by intellectuals on the left.

“It’s foolish, even dangerous when the industrial-military complex is driving or heavily influencing policy,” he said in an interview. “They make a lot more money when we’re at war.”

Not everyone in that generation is of the same mind.

Zach Nunn, a Republican challenging Representative Cindy Axne, Democrat of Iowa, has used his Air Force combat record to burnish his credentials, but after deployments in Afghanistan and North Africa and as an election monitor in Ukraine, he has not soured on the projection of force around the globe — or on bipartisan cooperation.

Nunn speaks at length of a battle in Afghanistan in which he flew reconnaissance, providing “a canopy of freedom” for special operations forces by watching enemy positions and calling in airstrikes.

“We ended up doing three midair refuelings, we were out there for over 18 hours, and by the end of it, we had multiple ridgeline strikes and had kept the Taliban at bay long enough that the Special Operations Forces team was able to evac,” Nunn said.

What his experience did not do was breed cynicism or push him to the political margins of his party. Nunn speaks proudly of his work on cybersecurity in the Obama White House and working with the Biden administration to get allies out of Afghanistan after the military’s pullout. He says his combat experience gave him an appreciation for Americans from all walks of life and political beliefs.

“It didn’t matter what our political belief was — it was all about, hey, we’re going to protect each other’s six and complete this mission,” he said, using military jargon for watching a comrade’s back.

Barcott, of With Honor Action, argued that the new crop of right-wing veterans should not be seen as representing the political attitudes of former service members writ large. With Honor Action still asks veterans running for office to pledge to bring civility to Congress, participate in cross-partisan veterans groups, meet one-on-one with a member of the opposing party at least once a month, and work with a member of the other party on one “substantial piece of legislation a year” while co-sponsoring other bipartisan bills.

But finding veterans willing to make that pledge has become more difficult.",cybersecurity,the boston globe

The attackers targeted a wide range of systems within an hour on Tuesday, Microsoft said, adding that it hadn't been able to link the attacks to any known group yet.

Notably, however, researchers found that the hacks closely mirrored earlier attacks by a Russian government-linked cyber team that had disrupted Ukraine government agencies.

Ukraine has been the target of numerous cyberattacks by Russia since the start of the conflict in late February, according to western security researchers and senior government officials.

The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and neither did the cybersecurity agencies of Ukraine or Poland.

Victims of the new ransomware, named ""Prestige,"" overlap with those of another data-shredding cyberattack that involved the ""FoxLoad,"" or ""HermeticWiper"" malware, Microsoft said.

That attack hit hundreds of computers in Ukraine, Lithuania, and Latvia at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""Prestige"" ransomware works by encrypting a victims' data and leaving a ransom note that says the data can only be unlocked with the purchase of a decryption tool, Microsoft said.

In several cases, the researchers noted that the hackers had gained administrator control of the victims' systems ahead of deploying the ransomware, suggesting they had stolen their credentials earlier and were waiting for the right moment.

""The enterprise-wide deployment of ransomware is not common in Ukraine, and this activity was not connected to any of the 94 currently active ransomware activity groups that Microsoft tracks,"" the researchers said.

By RFE/RL's Radio Farda October 14, 2022

As scattered anti-government and anti-hijab protests continue across Iran, members of one beleaguered ethnic and religious minority who joined in the demonstrations are still assessing the toll from ""Bloody Friday.""

Zahedan, the capital of the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan, was the scene of the violent crackdown carried out by security forces on September 30 that observers say left more than 90 people dead -- and possibly scores more.

The victims were overwhelmingly Baluchis -- a mostly Sunni ethnic group that makes up the majority in the impoverished region, and who have long faced disproportionate discrimination at the hands of the Iranian authorities.

Rape Allegation Sparks Protests

Demonstrations have taken place in cities and towns across Shi'a-majority Iran since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurd who was detained on September 13 by the morality police for allegedly violating the country's hijab law. She died three days later.

But in Sistan-Baluchistan, public anger at the authorities was raised further by reports that a 15-year-old Baluch girl had been raped by a police official in the province's southern port city of Chabahar.

After the rape accusation was aired publicly last month by Mawlana Abdul Ghaffar Naqshbandi, the interim Friday Prayers leader in Rask, protests spread from that city about 170 kilometers north of Chabahar all the way to the regional capital.

The scene for protest was set when worshipers gathered on September 30 at the Great Mosalla of Zahedan, a prayer site near the city's central mosque that right groups say was targeted in the bloody crackdown.

During his Friday Prayers sermon, influential Sunni cleric Mawlana Abdolhamid Ismaeelzahi said that the ""demands of the people should not go unanswered"" and called for ""serious measures to be taken"" to investigate the alleged rape.

Chaos ensued. According to rights groups, including Amnesty International, a crowd assembled in front of a police station across the road to protest. Images on social media appeared to show some members of the crowd chanting anti-government slogans and some throwing rocks.

Security forces responded with deadly force by firing on the crowd from the station, according to Ismaeelzahi, who alleged in a video message on October 2 that pre-positioned plainclothes police used live rounds and aimed at the heads and hearts of protesters.

Videos on social media also appear to show the scenes inside the mosque as people prayed when security forces arrived. Many of the dead were reportedly killed outside the mosque, and security forces allegedly fired tear gas into the mosque's women's section.

People returning from Friday Prayers were also fired upon by snipers positioned on rooftops, according to Amnesty International and groups such as the British-based Baluch Activists Campaign (BAC), which has posted videos purportedly showing violent police action well into the night.

Blackout In Effect

Details of what happened have been difficult to determine, in part due to an Internet blackout in Zahedan that went into effect during the September 30 clashes.

Despite the digital void, gruesome images of dead bodies have emerged on social media, supporting reports that men, women, and children as young as two years of age were killed and wounded.

Hundreds more, including minors, have been reportedly arrested as house searches continue, allegedly leading to more deaths and injuries.

""There are no exact statistics on the wounded, local sources say the number is more than 300 people,"" Baluch activist Farzin Kadkhodaee told RFE/RL's Radio Farda. ""Many of the dead have not been taken to the morgue and we do not know where they are, and this is one of the reasons why verification becomes difficult.""

According to the activist, security forces at hospitals have told those wounded in the crackdown that they must state their acceptance of the authorities' narrative before they can be treated. The government has blamed the violence on militant groups operating in the region.

Official Blame Game

Amnesty International, in an October 6 report, said that ""in an attempt to absolve themselves of responsibility for the deaths, the authorities have shared false narratives blaming the deaths on 'terrorists,' 'rioters,' and 'separatists' who they claim were acting for foreign governments.""

The rights watchdog also said that detainees alleged to have carried out attacks on security forces have been trotted out on television with bags over their heads, and forced to make self-incriminating statements about their involvement in the violence.

Iranian state media has also reportedly said that Ismaeelzahi has admitted the role of militants and foreign actors in the protests, a claim that the cleric later denied.

Tehran has specifically blamed the violence on Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni militant group that is recognized as a terrorist organization by both Iran and the United States and which has previously claimed deadly attacks in Sistan-Baluchistan targeting Iranian security forces.

Local and independent sources, including Ismaeelzahi and Naqshbandi, have rejected the authorities' claims of any Jaish al-Adl involvement.

The authorities have also reported a much smaller number of fatalities, announcing that only 19 people, including several members of the security forces, were killed.

In its latest report, the BAC placed the number of confirmed dead at 93, with 350 injured, contributing greatly to the at least 201 people killed nationwide since protests erupted after Amini's death in mid-September.

Other Baluch activist groups and political organizations have claimed that as many as 350 people were killed on September 30, which they have referred to as ""Bloody Friday.""

More than 50 anti-riot vehicles as well as officers have been transferred to Zahedan since then, according to Ismaeelzahi.

Media reports and activists have also said that the city is under strict lockdown, with groups of no more than two people allowed to be on the streets or to attend mosque services together.

Internet blackouts also continue, with the cybersecurity watchdog Netblocks saying they have observed disruptions in Iran as recently as October 12 while nationwide protests rage on.

Despite the restrictions, protests appeared to resume in Zahedan on October 14, with unverified videos on social media showing residents taking to the streets after Friday Prayers, some chanting for the demise of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the country's Basij paramilitary forces.

A Beleaguered Minority

Rights groups have long accused Iran's clerical establishment of suppressing and discriminating against the Baluch people, along with Kurds, Arabs, and other ethnic minorities.

As evidence, critics often point to the disproportionate number of Baluchis who are subjected to capital punishment in Iran.

While Baluchis make up only about 5 percent of Iran's 84-million population, according to Amnesty International, they accounted for 21 percent of the executions carried out in the country in 2021 and 26 percent in the first half of 2022.

The figures have raised serious concerns among rights watchdogs that the executions are part of a broader effort to sow fear among members of the disadvantaged Sunni community.

Sistan-Baluchistan, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, is the most impoverished of Iran's 31 provinces. It is also considered the most arid area in Iran, which has been hard-hit by drought in recent years.

Available as an add-on subscription, Cloudforce One includes threat data and briefings, security tools, and the ability to make requests for information (RFIs) to the team.

The new security team comprises analysts covering five different areas: malware analysis, threat analysis, active mitigation and countermeasures, intelligence analysis, and intelligence sharing. Enterprise customers can subscribe to receive one-on-one live briefings, submit periodic inquiries for follow-up, and obtain early access to threat research.

Patrick R. Donahue, VP product at Cloudflare, and Blake Darché, lead of threat intelligence at Cloudflare, write:

Included with a Cloudforce One subscription is the ability to make RFIs to these experts. RFIs can be on any security topic of interest, and will be analyzed and responded to in a timely manner. For example, the Cloudforce One Malware Analysis team can accept uploads of possible malware and provide a technical analysis of the submitted resource. Each plan level comes with a fixed number of RFIs, and additional requests can be added.

As part of the announcement, new capabilities are now available within the Cloudflare Security Center, including access to historical threat data via API and threat pivoting features. Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, tweets:

The Twilio hacker? Cloudforce One tracked him down and had pictures of him (and his mom) hours after the hack. Want that ability yourself: reach out!

Dane Knecht, senior vice president for emerging technology and incubation at Cloudflare, focuses on the results from the acquisition of the cybersecurity company Area1 earlier this year:

Cloudflare doesn't make many acquisitions but when we do, a common thread is a deep belief in the technology and team. Area1 has already helped improve threat intelligence in all products, build out Cloudforce One, integrate with previous RBI acquisitions and just getting started.

Source: https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudforce-one-is-now-ga/

Among the security tools included in the subscription, the Threat Investigation Portal, for querying current and historical threat data, Brand Protection, to register keywords or assets, and Sinkholes, to monitor hosts infected with malware.

Without providing concrete numbers, Donahue and Darché explain the pricing model:

Subscriptions come in two packages, and are priced based on number of employees: ""Premier"" includes our full history of threat data, bundled RFIs, and an API quota designed to support integrations with SIEMs. ""Core"" level includes reduced history and quotas. Both packages include access to all available security tools, including a threat investigation portal and sinkholes-as-a-service.

A form is available to request access to the service.",cybersecurity,infoq.com

In a blog post published on Wednesday (October 12), Dhamodharan gave examples of things that Mastercard is doing to “turn cryptocurrencies into an everyday way to pay”:

crypto debit cards : “In Argentina, we launched a prepaid card with Binance that lets users fund their card with their crypto, which is converted to fiat currency immediately when they make payments.“

We’re going to use those same tools to provide more support to crypto players and issuers.“ payments : “We’ve partnered with a handful of top-tier crypto-focused companies — including Paxos, Circle, Evolve and Uphold — to develop ways for people to quickly convert their crypto to fiat to make payments.“

: “An important way to expand choice for people is to bring certain Mastercard-approved digital assets onto our networks, a plan we announced last year that continues to move forward.“ support for NFTs: “Coinbase users can now pay for NFTs with Mastercard, and in June we announced plans to bring the same capabilities to eight new NFT marketplaces and infrastructure providers.“

On August 2, Mastercard CFO Sachin Mehra shared his thoughts on crypto. His comments were made during an interview with Bloomberg’s Lisa Abramowicz.

With regard to crypto, he said:

“In the crypto world, we play the role as an on-ramp, with people using our debit and credit products to buy crypto. And we act as the off-ramp: When people want to cash it, we help them gain access to be able to use their crypto balances everywhere Mastercard is accepted. That’s a revenue-generating capability which has been fairly successful ever since crypto environments came up…

“For anything to be a payment vehicle in our mind, it needs to have a store of value. If something fluctuates in value every day, such that your Starbucks coffee today costs you $3 and tomorrow it’s going to cost you $9 and the day after it’s going to cost you a dollar, that’s a problem from a consumer-mindset standpoint. So we view crypto more as an asset class. But as a payment instrument, we think stablecoins and CBDCs [digital currencies issued by central banks] potentially have a little bit more runway.“

The intrusion on IT infrastructure impacted ""some of its IT systems,"" the company said in a filing with the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India.

It further said it has taken steps to retrieve and restore the affected machines, adding it put in place security guardrails for customer-facing portals to prevent unauthorized access.

The Mumbai-based electric utility company, part of the Tata Group conglomerate, did not disclose any further details about the nature of the attack, or when it took place.

That said, cybersecurity firm Recorded Future in April disclosed attacks mounted by China-linked adversaries targeting Indian power grid organizations.

The network intrusions were said to have been aimed at ""at least seven Indian State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) responsible for carrying out real-time operations for grid control and electricity dispatch within these respective states.""

The attacks were attributed to an emerging threat cluster Recorded Future is tracking under the name Threat Activity Group 38 (TAG-38).

The company further assessed that the targeting is intended to facilitate information gathering related to critical infrastructure assets or is likely a precursor for future activities.

China refuted the allegations that it was involved, stating ""many of U.S. allies or countries with which it cooperates on cybersecurity are also victims of U.S. cyber attacks.""",cybersecurity,internet

I'm passionate about accelerating science and tech to help solve some of the biggest challenges in the world. To further this, I'm planning to sell about 2% of my Coinbase holdings over the next year to fund scientific research and companies like @newlimit + @researchhub — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) October 15, 2022

Armstrong went on to say:

“For the avoidance of doubt, I intend to be CEO of Coinbase for a very long time and I remain super bullish on crypto and Coinbase. I’m fully dedicated to growing our business and advancing our mission, but I am also excited to contribute in a different way.“

Earlier this month, the Coinbase CEO announced that a documentary film named “Coin” about his firm would be released on multiple streaming services, including YouTube, iTunes, and Amazon Prime, on October 7.

The film, which is one and 28 minutes long, is directed by ten-time Emmy®-winning filmmaker Greg Kohs, and it “chronicles the rise of a visionary founder in crypto who harnesses the power of this emerging technology to promote a mission of global economic freedom.”

The cast includes Brian Armstrong, Vitalik Buterin, Hayden Adams, Alex Gladstein, Brian Brooks, and David Chaum.

On October 4, Armstrong took to Twitter to say the following about the film:

“we’ve been working with director Greg Kohs on a documentary about cryptocurrency and Coinbase over the last three years, and it will be coming out this Friday… We gave Greg and his team unprecedented access inside the company, showing the crazy ups and downs of building a tech startup all the way to us becoming a public company. He shows it all – the good, bad, and ugly… I agreed to do this documentary because I wanted to demystify what it takes to build a tech startup and encourage more people to start companies. I also wanted to demystify crypto…

“The world tends to either vilify founders or put them on a pedestal. Neither is true – they’re just regular people trying to make something that people want. And everyone working in crypto believes it can create a more fair, free, and global financial system… As the saying goes, starting a company is like chewing glass and staring into the abyss. It takes incredible determination and a bit of luck.

“But if you succeed, you can change the world, and generate enormous value for millions of people… My belief is that technology is the best lever we have to solve the world’s problems and improve the human condition, and I want to encourage more people to start tech companies. So I decided to pull back the curtain and show people what it’s really like…

“I got in touch with Greg after seeing another film he created called AlphaGo, about DeepMind’s program that defeated the Go champion, Lee Sedol. It was a powerful story, and it’s what convinced me to trust him to tell our story… hope you all go and see the film – and that policy makers see it as well. I believe it will help advance the cause of cryptocurrency, showing the motivations of the many hard working people driving this industry forward.“

See the trailer here: https://t.co/JNAc2pjJPf — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) October 4, 2022

In late July, while speaking in an interview with computer scientist Lex Fridman, Armstrong explained how his company decides which altcoins to add to the platform. He said that the company begins by evaluating an altcoin’s status as a security:

“We basically have a test of legality. We check: ‘Do we believe this is a security?’ If so, it can’t be listed on Coinbase. And there’s a very rigorous process we go through for that.

“Just currently the way the laws are in the US, you can’t do that. We acquired a broker-dealer license from the SEC. We’re trying to work with them to get that operational and hopefully one day, we can trade real crypto securities but today, that’s not possible in the US.“

Next on Armstrong’s list of evaluation criteria was security:

“Then we look at the cybersecurity of the crypto asset. Do we think there’s some flaw in the smart contract, or a way that somebody could manipulate it without the customers’ permission?

“We look at some compliance pieces to it as well, like the actors behind it and any kind of criminal history and things like that. If we believe it meets our listing standards, basically this test of legality and everything for customer protection, then we want to list it because we want the market at that point to decide...

“It’s kind of like Amazon or something like that where a product might have three stars or it might have five stars, but if it starts to get one star consistently, it’s probably fraudulent or defective or something and maybe Amazon will remove it. Otherwise, you want to let the market decide what these things are.”",cybersecurity,cryptoglobe

More than 30 signatories of a letter sent to Danielle Smith on Friday say the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA) ""has taken the aggressive position that software engineers must be regulated, and subject to onerous, restrictive, and unnecessary certification requirements.""

The signatories, which include executives from Helcim, Aimso and Neo Financial, see ""software engineer"" as a standard job title for anyone building technical programs and argue APEGA shouldn't be treating it as a role in need of certification and regulation like professional engineers.

""APEGA is actively targeting companies in Alberta with legal action to restrict us from using globally competitive job titles and descriptions,"" reads the letter orchestrated by the Council of Canadian Innovators (CCI), a national tech advocacy organization.

The signatories cite APEGA lawsuits against tech companies that use variations on the engineer title. They want Smith to ""act and remove the regulatory red tape"" they say hampers their ability to compete for global tech talent, which has long been lured to the U.S. instead with promises of big job titles and even bigger salaries.

""Some companies have considered relocating because they find this red tape extremely challenging to deal with and will need to hire more engineers,"" says CCI president Benjamin Bergen.

""You'll see companies open offices in other jurisdictions where they actually use the correct terminology.""

He argues this is a case of a regulator which has ""overstepped"" on an issue that hasn't seen this level of action anywhere else in the world.

Public safety a concern, says APEGA

The premier's office referred a request for comment to the minister of labour and immigration's press secretary, Roy Dallmann.

Dallmann said his office encourages CCI and APEGA to find a ""mutually agreeable solution"" and promised to work with both groups to resolve the issue because it is ""concerned by any regulations that impede our competitiveness.""

APEGA said in a release that the term engineer comes with a licensed and ethical set of responsibilities and accountabilities.

It said this is the same for other regulated professions, such as the health and legal professions.

""You would not want someone to operate on you in the province if they are not licensed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta,"" said Jay Nagendran, APEGA registrar and chief executive officer.

""By that same token, you do not want someone designing your pacemaker or self-driving car if they are not a licensed engineer. That puts people's lives at risk — something APEGA takes very seriously.""

The Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta says it has 'the legal right and requirement' to restrict the practice and use of titles linked to engineering and geoscience to licensed individuals and companies. (APEGA)

Nagendran also noted that software engineering is a nationally and internationally recognized discipline of engineering.

APEGA's website says it has ""the legal right and requirement"" to restrict the practice and use of titles linked to engineering and geoscience to licensed individuals and companies.

On top of traditional titles like professional engineer, professional geologist and professional geophysicist, it says those who are unlicensed cannot use the word engineer combined with any name, title, description, letter, symbol or abbreviation that implies they are licensed with APEGA in job titles, on resumes or on social media.

APEGA maintains this is because ""the public may believe that you have the right to practice engineering or geoscience"" and ""this can endanger public safety.""

'We can't be competitive'

An open letter signed by the leaders of each provincial and territorial engineering regulator in Canada in July said use of ""software engineer,"" ""computer engineer"" and other information technology titles with the engineer suffix is prohibited everywhere in Canada unless the person using it is licensed by one of their regulatory groups.

Engineers Canada, the national body for the provincial and territorial associations, also points out on its website that there is legal precedent on the matter. An Alberta judge ordered an injunction against someone not registered with APEGA who was using ""software engineer"" online in 2019.

The licensing of workers is common in many professions, including the legal and medical fields, because it's seen as crucial to keeping workers ethical and competent when public safety is at risk. However, it is seldom, if ever, used to regulate those in the tech sector, including workers who build apps and other software and hardware.

""Talent is absolutely the most important input to our future success and our ability to attract and retain talent is critical.... So if we're going to have regulators creating a hostile environment for companies ... we can't be competitive,"" says Sam Pillar, chief executive of Jobber, an Edmonton-based tech company.

You do not want someone designing your pacemaker or self-driving car if they are not a licensed engineer. That puts people's lives at risk. - Jay Nagendran, CEO of APEGA

When his home services platform first heard from APEGA about its use of engineering titles, Pillar says his company put disclaimers on its website to differentiate its workers from the positions APEGA regulates. Later, Jobber was sued by APEGA in December 2021.

The matter is still winding through court, Pillar said, adding that it's time for the government to step in because it's"" dragging on"" and affecting companies as big as Google and Apple along with small firms in greater need of talent.

A 2019 report from the Information and Communications Technology Council, a not-for-profit organization offering labour policy advice, predicted demand for digitally-skilled talent in Canada would reach 193,000 by 2022 and more than 305,000 by 2023.

A 2020 addendum accounting for COVID-19 forecast that demand would be reduced by nearly 24 per cent and said under new baseline scenarios, the digital economy is expected to experience demand for 147,000 workers by 2022, with total employment reaching nearly two million.

A Dystopian Surveillance State is Rising in India",https://www.activistpost.com/2022/10/a-dystopian-surveillance-state-is-rising-in-india.html,"By Aparajita Ghosh

A few months after Narendra Modi was re-elected in 2019, India’s Parliament passed a discriminatory bill extending citizenship to refugees from six religious minority communities, except for Muslims from the neighboring countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

Following the controversy, a series of protests erupted across the country. The capital city of Delhi witnessed ghastly communal riots, as members of the minority Muslim community were targeted by far-right groups that rallied in support of the bill. To identify the alleged “rabble rousers and miscreants,” including the protesters, law enforcement officials acknowledged using what they called the Automated Facial Recognition System. This new tool allows manual screening that can identify individuals based on physical features like race, gender, and age and link the details with pre-existing official documents like passports, driver’s licenses and voter IDs, creating a database that helped police arrest thousands of alleged rioters.

The use of facial recognition had been initially sanctioned by India’s top court in 2018 to trace nearly 3,000 missing children in the capital. However, authorities have gradually and illegally widened the use of this technology to curb dissent in recent years. It was deployed to surveil at least three major demonstrations in the absence of a data protection law in India.

“Today there exists no remedy for the violation of many digital rights that emerge from the expansive collection and procession of personal data for Indians,” states the digital rights advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation, or IFF. “The existing legal vacuum on data protection portends an Orwellian state and is clearly an infringement of the fundamental right to privacy.”

Over the years IFF has filed multiple Right to Information applications at the Central Information Commission concerning mass surveillance. Anushka Jain, Associate Policy Counsel for Surveillance and Transparency at the organization, received a response on a legal demand that questioned the technology’s accuracy. It stated that Delhi police considered any result showing above an 80 percent similarity as a positive match in order to target accused rioters.

Earlier, the law enforcement officers reported the technology’s accuracy rate at 2 percent. A year later, the number fell by a percent, and it was unable to distinguish individuals by their genders. Subsequently, Jain warned about the “chilling effect” the contentious technology will have on the rights of citizens.

Although the court declared privacy to be an inalienable fundamental right, the Modi government is using several surveillance technologies like drone mapping, DNA fingerprinting, video analytics and geo location to conduct “free and fair”investigations during protests.

Of the more than 1.5 million CCTV cameras installed across 15 Indian cities, Hyderabad and Chennai are among the highest surveilled cities, with 375,000 and 280,000 cameras installed respectively. According to cybersecurity research firm Comparitech, Delhi, with nearly 1,500 cameras installed per square mile, is the most surveilled city in the world outside of China.

In August, authorities developed an additional “Face Recognition System under Disguise” for the armed forces to identify individuals through face masks. The state intends to expand its use in public places, which will raise the risk of intrusive data policing in the country. As the world’s largest facial recognition surveillance systemcontinues to be built, India plans to construct a centralized database threatening citizen’s privacy.

Targeted surveillance

In 2020, India witnessed the world’s largest protest, when authorities passed three controversial farm laws that brought farmers from various states to Delhi’s borders. The demonstration continued for nearly a year and was reportedly hijacked on Jan. 26, 2021 during a tractor rally at the historic Red Fort that took a violent turn. During the period, Delhi police claimed to use surveillance systems like facial recognition technology and drone mapping to track down the protesters on site.

Harinder Happy, a member of the IT Cell, which provided technical support and countered misinformation at the farmers’ protest, says that almost no one knew that facial recognition technology was used by authorities from the start of the protest to target individual demonstrators.

“It is a collective effort to curb the democratic rights of citizens and push dissent to the corner,” Happy said. “We cannot fight them [the authorities] on technical grounds, but we did fight by creating platforms across various social media websites and carried out awareness campaigns. We countered the narratives of the government as well as pro-government media.”

According to IFF, there are currently at least 124 ongoing facial recognition projects being developed and deployed by authorities that can cause irreversible harm.

One place that India has been constantly monitoring with drones is the densely militarized Kashmir. After the Himalayan region was stripped of its special autonomous status in August 2019, the valley was put under complete lockdown, which was extended once the pandemic hit. In December, the Modi administration announced new plans to deploy a facial recognition system and install nearly 300 CCTV cameras in the summer capital of Srinagar to “preempt and prevent attacks” on security forces by militants.

Bring the ban

With the Bharatiya Janata Party’s emergence in 2014, the far-right administration propagated Hindu supremacism that deepened religious polarization in the country. The minority Muslim community, which make up 14 percent of the population, are facing discrimination, arbitrary arrests and demolition of their homes for criticizing the authorities. Despite condemnation by international organizations — such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International — harassment continues.

SQ Masood, a prominent Muslim activist who has been fighting for citizen’s basic human rights in the city of Hyderabad, was randomly pulled over by the state police one evening in May 2021. They took mugshots of him on their handheld tablet without his consent. As he later passed by a Muslim neighborhood on a two-wheeler, he saw a dozen police officers stationed to carry out the same task with other riders.

“This is excessive policing, and it violates our right to privacy,” Masood said. The police “are largely using the technology against illiterate, marginalized and minority communities. It’s a global trend.”

In December, Masood filed a lawsuit with legal support from IFF against the commissioner of police and the state of Telangana to stop the use of facial recognition technology. After receiving no reply, he investigated what would happen to his photograph and found out about the illegal use of the technology, such as identifying voters at polling stations and supplying essential services to the poor.

“How will authorities address our fundamental rights, which are being violated in broad daylight as they take photographs and store them?” Masood asked. “We cannot stop this, but we are asking for accountability from the state.”

Months later, Amnesty International declared that Hyderabad was turning into a “surveillance city.” In partnership with IFF and the international human rights organization Article 19, Amnesty launched a campaign called “Ban the Scan” to stop the use of facial recognition technology. The nonprofits chose two neighborhoods in the city as a sample to map the presence of CCTV cameras outdoors. They found that nearly 50 percent of these areas are under surveillance. In addition, the city has been constructing a Command and Control Center, or CCC, that will reportedly process data from 600,000 CCTV cameras at a time and link to the pre-existing state police database.

“Facial recognition technology can track who you are, where you go, what you do and who you know,” said Article 19 Executive Director Quinn McKew. “It threatens human rights including the right to privacy, and puts some of the most vulnerable in society at risk. The construction of the CCC has chilling consequences for the right to freedom of expression and assembly.”

As part of her work on IFF’s Panoptic Project — a facial recognition system tracker — Jain wrote to the authorities on the rising concerns around citizens’ data security and privacy. She asked them to address ongoing issues around the use of facial recognition technology and consult privacy experts on how it affects fundamental rights.

In a letter to the Indian Parliamentary Committee, the IFF stated that the surveillance tool’s illegal use could impact the marginalized due to rising inequality in India. “Calls for a total ban have been gaining momentum due to fear that use of facial recognition by the police and security/intelligence agencies will not only lead to violation of the rights to privacy and freedom of speech and expression, but also lead to human rights violations by helping to increase systemic bias against already marginalized communities,” the letter said.

Unprotected data

The Criminal Procedure Identification Bill was passed in April, which allows law enforcement agencies to collect sensitive data like retina scans, fingerprints, footprints, palm-prints, signatures, and unspecified physical and biological samples that can be stored, shared or disseminated for up to 75 years.

“It’s not like the police want to put a lot of people in jails — they don’t have the capacity,” Srinivas Kodali, a digital rights researcher Srinivas Kodali, told in an interview with the BBC. “But what they want to do is put you under surveillance, [and keep] tabs on what you’re doing. The bill now gives this power to every constable on the street.”

As the intrusive law is implemented, critics fear the rise of a “dystopian surveillance state.” While it empowers the law enforcement agencies to abuse civil liberties that are guaranteed under the Indian Constitution, rights groups are concerned it will adversely affect dissidents, including human rights defenders.

“Any data collection in the absence of a data protection law is harmful,” Jain said. “It will only raise fear among demonstrators about whether their identities will be revealed and make them question joining the protest.”

Especially when the government is accused of hacking smartphones of dissenters and proposes to bring encrypted messaging platforms under legal framework as part of its “legal surveillance,” India is in severe need of a data protection law which it currently lacks.

On Aug. 3, as the drafted bill was withdrawn, the Joint Parliamentary Committee justified the move by stating several loopholes which allowed citizens’ data to be processed without consent. However, critics did not find it convincing. At the same time, the authorities have asserted to introduce a new legislation which will consider fundamental rights reportedly but the details of the bill have still not been disclosed.

While major companies like Amazon and Zoom have been fined $850.6 million and $85 million respectively for breaching European Union and U.S. data protection laws, India is awaiting its new law.

In response to the global proliferation of this technology, demonstrators have adapted several tactics — such as using lasers and wearing asymmetrical makeup — to avoid tracking. However, in India, protesters find it practically impossible to protect their identity when they are constantly surrounded by numerous surveillance systems.

“Even when I wore a face mask, they [the police] asked me to remove it,” Masood said. “It’s difficult to protect our identities. We cannot fight against the surveillance technologies like facial recognition, CCTV cameras and the AI based algorithms that they are using.”

The extensive and authoritarian use of facial recognition during demonstrations has led to arbitrary detentions, illegal surveillance and the breach of dissenters’ privacy. While at least 13 cities in the U.S. have outlawed the use of facial recognition, Indian authorities are going in the opposite direction — expanding what is already one of the largest surveillance systems in the world.

“We don’t have any specific safeguard in this digital era from the digitization of databases and their unlawful circulation,” Masood said. “It’s time we demand a privacy law.”

Centre planning to take over the State Highways with high traffic density from the states, develop 4 or 6 lane highways and then recover investments through toll collection within 12-13 years: Nitin Gadkari



“The financial markets need to come up with innovative models to fund India’s Infrastructure growth. We are inviting investments in the PPP model.”



Union Road Transport and Highways Minister virtually addresses at the 12th International Convention of Association Of the National Exchanges Members Of India



Green express highway between Mumbai and Bangalore to reduce journey time to 5 hours

Mumbai, 15 October 2022

The Ministry of Road Transports and Highways is planning to take over the State Highways with high traffic density from the State Governments for a period of 25 years. Therafter, those state highways will be converted into 4 or 6 lane highways and then the Centre will collect toll from those highways. This was stated by Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari in a virtual address at Association Of National Exchanges Members Of India (ANMI)'s 12th International Convention which was held in Mumbai today. After a period of 12-13 years, the investments will be fully recovered from those state highways along with intersts and land acquisition costs, further added Shri Gadkari. He urged that investments in the infrastructure sector of the country will be risk-free and yield good returns and called for cooperation in the investment for infrastructure. “The financial markets need to come up with innovative models to fund India’s Infrastructure growth. We are inviting investments in the PPP model. We can export energy to the world if we channel our investments to waste management, green hydrogen, solar, and several such projects. Innovation, Entrepreneurship, Science, and Technology is the wealth of future India.” The Centre has given the highest priority to development of infrastructure in the country, he added.

Speaking about infrastructure development, he informed, “We are planning a green express highway between Mumbai and Bangalore”. It will be a 5 hrs journey between Mumbai-Bangalore and 3.5 to 4 hrs between Pune and Bangalore, he added. The Mumbai-Pune Express Highway will take a turn from near the Ring Road of Pune and start as the Highway towards Bangalore, he further mentioned.

Likewise, 27 green express highways are coming up in the country. By end of this year, there will be highways connecting Delhi - Dehradun in 2 hrs, Delhi-Hardwar in 2 hrs, Delhi -Jaipur in 2 hrs, Delhi - Chandigarh in 2.5 hrs, Delhi - Amritsar in 4 hrs, Delhi - Srinagar in 8 hrs, Delhi - Katra in 6 hrs, Delhi - Mumbai in 10 hrs, Chennai-Bangalore in 2 hrs and Lucknow- Kanpur in half an hour, stated the Union Road Transport and Highways Minister. Highway projects connecting Gorakhpur to Siliguri and Varanasi to Kolkata are also on the cards. “Just like the National Water Grid, we want to develop a National Highway Grid”, he said. He also stated that income from tolls have come to Rs 40 thousand crore at present and it will rise to Rs 1 lakh 40 thousand crores by the end of 2024..

The Ministry is also in the process of constructing 75 tunnels at a cost of Rs 2,50,000 crores, stated the Minister. On an average, 40 kms of roads are constructed per day in the country, informed Shri Gadkari. He further stated that, presently there exists 65 lakh Km of road length in the country and out of it, 1.45 lakh Km are of National Highways. In the future, before making highways, the plan is to acquire land in cooperation and JVs with private sector investors, stated the Union Road Transport and Highways Minister.

Shri Gadkari further said that there is a huge potential for development of public transport in the country. There is good economic viability in introducing e-buses, he said. Some of the projects taken up by his ministry include starting electric vehicles, trolleybuses and bus-ports in cities. Also, AC Luxury buses may be started for tourists, he added. Under the Parvatmala scheme, ropeways, cable-cars and funicular rail are being developed in hilly areas. The restaurants and parking plazas that will come up surrounding these projects will also add to the sources of revenue, said the Minister.

The Road Transport and Highways Ministry is also looking at diversifying fuel base to include ethanol, methanol, bio-diesel, bio-LNG, BIO-CNG, electric and green hydrogen. Under the National Hydrogen Mission, the Centre wants to make India a green hydrogen hub and export this form of energy to the world, stated the Minister. He further said that there is economic viability in making ethanol from sugar-cane, bamboo and other agricultural products. “By making bio-fuels, we may increase India's GDP in agriculture”, he said. Bio-fuels are import-substitute, cost-effective, pollution-free and indigenous, he added.

Stating that the country’s automobile industry's size is Rs 7.5 lakh crores, Shri Gadkari said that there is a plan to make it a Rs 15 lakh crore industry within 5 years. Automobiles industry has maximum employment potential and brings in maximum GST to the Centre and states, he added. The Minster also said that investments in areas of solid waste management and liquid waste management are going to yield good returns.

Maharashtra Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “I am sure that lots of brilliant ideas will be generated for the development and growth of financial markets in India. I am delighted that the theme of our conference is based on Amrit Kaal which is also the vision of our honorable prime minister Shri Narendra Modi.”

The dignitaries present on the occasion included Whole Time Director of SEBI Ashwini Bhatia. During the convention, Mr. Kamlesh Shah, President of, ANMI announced a major Cybersecurity initiative. “Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) has been assigned the important task of onboarding members for the SEBI committee on cybersecurity which has been formed in alliance with stock exchanges. The committee is mandated to create an appropriate framework for cyber security for all financial intermediaries.”

About ANMI:

Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) is an association comprising around 900 Stock Brokers from across the country who are members of National Stock Exchange of India Limited, The Bombay Stock Exchange, Multi Commodity Exchange and other exchanges having national presence. The basic objective of ANMI is to work for the growth of the capital markets thus contributing to the economic development of the country and the overall interest of investors and its members at large by becoming a medium between regulator, exchanges and participants.

“So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.” – Matthew 10:26

As this will be a comprehensive article, I’ve decided to split it up into the following sections:

Conspiracy Theories that turned out to be true

Notable Unresolved Conspiracies

Conclusion

Introduction

It seems like you can’t catch a news headline or social media post these days without coming across the terms conspiracy theory and conspiracy theorist, or phrases like ‘spreading conspiracies’. One has to wonder: why are they so frequently employed?

In my most recent published work, I referenced an article from Canada’s National Post which ran with the headline ‘CBSA says it’s investigating border officer spreading COVID conspiracies online.’

The problem with these kinds of articles is that they are too often merely used as hit pieces to ridicule, degrade, and discredit any individual or group that goes against a certain narrative or disagrees with an author’s (or their publication’s partisanship or funders’) views.

Moreover, their authors very seldom make specific references or claims as to why they label their targets when using such over-used and over-abused disparaging rhetoric. When this is the case, it leads me to believe that the overall purpose of their pieces is to disparage their targets more than anything else.

Another recent example of this involves that from the article entitled ‘Network of Syria conspiracy theorists identified – study’ written by Mark Townsend from The Guardian (UK). In the article, the author claimed “journalist Aaron Maté at the Grayzone is said by the report to have overtaken Beeley as the most prolific spreader of disinformation among the 28 conspiracy theorists identified.” Maté had to refute the claim made against him which also involved contacting Townsend by phone. His counter article and the phone conversation appear on his Substack page (see ‘NATO-backed network of Syria dirty war propagandists identified)’ and is definitely an interesting case on how these ploys take place.

Countless other instances could be cited, but suffice it to say that there is no shortage of them.

But what is perhaps even more laughable with this phenomenon is the fact that these authors wantonly use these terms without even knowing their true meanings and where they actually originate from.

Before looking into these, though, we must first and foremost examine the meaning of the word ‘conspiracy’ itself. Oxford defines it as:

a secret plan by a group of people to do something harmful or illegal

Conspiracies have been an integral part of humanity ever since people have bonded together in groups for a better chance at survival.

Lord knows that history is riddled with an abundant supply of conspiracies and we will look at some notable examples later on.

How did the term come about & become a tool for defamation?

conspiracy theorist’ itself dates Though the term ‘’ itself dates as far back as the 19th century , it became much more prominent in the years following the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.

Moreover, it’s really in the 1960s where it became more abundant and has taken on a negative connotation. This is in large part because of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States of America.

The usage of ‘conspiracy theorist’ was principally brought about to discredit any person or outfit that questioned the findings of the Warren Commission regarding the official narrative of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.

As to not be labelled a conspiracy theorist myself, here is some tangible evidence to support my claim that the CIA has been complicit with regards to the usage of the term as a means to disparage and discredit individuals with opposing views to an official narrative. An official DISPATCH (document number 1035-60) dated January 1, 1967 which was declassified and released following a FOIA request got published on the Mary Ferrell Foundation (MFF) website – one which contains nearly 2 million pages of documents, government reports, as well as other materials. The first page of the dispatch appears as follows:

COUNTERING CRITICISM OF THE WARREN REPORT, NARA Record Number: 104-10009-10022 from the Mary Ferrell Foundation, Dispatch 1035-960, Source

Firstly, we can notice the term ‘PSYCH’ in the upper-left hand corner of the document which indicates that this relates to Psychological Operations. We can see from the first paragraph that their main concern is about speculation regarding the assassination of President Kennedy and how various writers are questioning the findings of the Warren Commission report. The end of section 2 on the first page states:

“The aim of this dispatch is to provide material for countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists, …”

Scrolling down to the second page under section 3 a. appears the following [emphasis added]:

“To discuss the publicity problem with liaison and friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors), pointing out that the Warren Commission made as thorough an investigation as humanly possible, that the charges of the critics are without serious foundation, and that further speculative discussion only plays into the hand of the opposition. Point out also that parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists. Urge them to use their influence to discourage unfounded and irresponsible speculation.”

And shortly after under section 3 b., it continues:

“To employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.”

So, there you have it in black and white. The CIA specifically directs the use of their elite contacts which include politicians and editors – presumably of major newspapers and most likely of major broadcasters. Tactics suggested include writing feature articles (to counter the official narrative), writing book reviews – presumably negative ones, and further labelling dissenters as ‘Communist propagandists’ – a term that had much more of an accentuated defamatory effect back then than it does today.

This raises the obvious question of why the CIA was so seriously concerned about media coverage with regards to the assassination. What’s it to them? Did they have something hide? Where they pressed to do so by the Lyndon Johnson administration? If so, why?

To dig deeper about what they actually stated in their dispatch, we can ask: who are these “elite contacts” and “propaganda assets” they are referring to?

American investigative journalist and author Carl Bernstein – famous for his work with Bob Woodward on the Watergate scandal – wrote a rather extensive (25,000-word) exposé entitled ‘THE CIA AND THE MEDIA: How Americas Most Powerful News Media Worked Hand in Glove with the Central Intelligence Agency and Why the Church Committee Covered It Up’ that was published in Rolling Stone magazine on October 20, 1977, just over a decade after the infamous CIA dispatch was issued. Early on in the mammoth article, Bernstein lists categories in which the Agency (the CIA) partnered with journalists and the press. Two such instances appear as follows:

“- Editors, publishers and broadcast network executives. The CIAs relationship with most news executives differed fundamentally from those with working reporters and stringers, who were much more subject to direction from the Agency. A few executives—Arthur Hays Sulzberger of the New York Times among them—signed secrecy agreements.”

“- Columnists and commentators. There are perhaps a dozen well known columnists and broadcast commentators whose relationships with the CIA go far beyond those normally maintained between reporters and their sources. They are referred to at the Agency as “known assets” and can be counted on to perform a variety of undercover tasks; they are considered receptive to the Agency’s point of view on various subjects. Three of the most widely read columnists who maintained such ties with the Agency are C.L. Sulzberger of the New York Times, Joseph Alsop, and the late Stewart Alsop, whose column appeared in the New York Herald‑Tribune, the Saturday Evening Post and Newsweek. CIA files contain reports of specific tasks all three undertook.”

The CIA specifically refers to these widely read columnists as “known assets” they can count upon to perform undercover tasks. They also maintain ‘signed secrecy agreements’ with executives from the New York Times. Lovely!

Bernstein then lists many well-known newspapers, magazines, and broadcasters used by the CIA and notes their most cherished ones as follows [emphasis added]:

“By far the most valuable of these associations, according to CIA officials, have been with the New York Times, CBS and Time Inc.”

Still today, these three media outlets are giants in the publishing, broadcasting, and entertainment industries. And who really knows the extent to which the CIA and other US government agencies still maintain relationships with their editorial and journalistic staff, and possibly many others in the United States and across the world. It would certainly come as no surprise if they did.

War – and how it is covered by media – is a major recurring theme in all of this and it is no secret that the CIA has left its dirty footprints over many of them since its inception in 1947. This has been highly documented and revealed by whistleblower Kevin Shipp, a former CIA officer, intelligence and counter terrorism expert who held several high-level positions in the organization.

Finally, the CIA’s reach beyond American borders goes without saying.

A German journalist spills the beans

“I was bribed by billionaires. I was bribed by the Americans not to report exactly the truth,” stated Udo Ulfkotte back in a 2014 interview with RT (original report); the late editor and journalist of Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung was quite outspoken in this particular interview.

Screenshot of the 2014 RT interview with German journalist Udo Ulfkotte

Ulfkotte explained how the CIA and other US agencies bought journalists across all major German newspapers. He starts the interview with the following revelation [emphasis added]:

“I’ve been a journalist for about 25 years. And I was educated to lie, to betray, and not to tell the truth to the public. But, seeing right now within the last months how the German and American media tries to bring war to the people in Europe, to bring war to Russia. This is a point of no return and I’m going to stand up and say it is not right what I have done in the past, to manipulate people, to make propaganda against Russia, and it is not right what my colleagues do and have done in the past because they are bribed to betray the people, not only in Germany, all over Europe.”

It’s funny how you could almost replace this assertion (from back in 2014) in the context of today’s 2022 Russia-Ukraine war, or as some would call it, a proxy war between NATO/Western Europe/United States and Russia.

He continued:

“I was supported by the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. Why? Because I should be pro- American. I’m fed up with it. I don’t want to do it anymore.”

‘Non-official cover’ is a term the German journalist used to describe how he (and other journalists) were essentially working for or helping the intelligence agency, though not in an official capacity, conveniently leaving room for plausible deniability.

Ulfkotte goes on to explain how the journalists are rewarded by the CIA.

Statements like these really makes one wonder about the extent to which media outlets all around the world have been infiltrated not only by the CIA, but also by other powerful entities.

But wait, Ulfkotte dives deeper into other supranational influences that help shape media organizations and their prevailing narratives [emphasis added]:

“We are still kind of a colony of the Americans. And being a colony, it is very easy to approach young journalists through, what is very important here is, transatlantic organizations. All journalists from really respected and recommended big German newspapers, magazines, radio stations, TV stations, they are all members or guests of those big transatlantic organizations. And in these transatlantic organizations, you are approached to be pro-American.”

Ulfkotte then emphasizes that this phenomenon is even more the case with British journalists due to their special relationship with the US, and the French, to a lesser extent.

One need not look far to see what he is talking about with regards to these transatlantic organizations than observe the writings and actions of outfits such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the Atlantic Council think tank, both focused on American imperialism and interests. While the later is essentially a mouthpiece for NATO, the former holds an unfathomable grasp on Western media.

Examining the historical and current membership into the Council on Foreign Relations is quite revealing, to say the least. Or, perhaps more fittingly: the elephant in the room. Moreover, the think tank holds tremendous influence through its network of elites and media pundits who are central in shaping U.S. foreign policy and public discourse.

Back in 2017, an infographic emerged showing the extent of this network and how it possibly ties to the Bilderberger Group and the Trilateral Commission:

Infographic showing the network of members of the CFR, full-resolution image, click here.

Comparing current members with past ones, we can easily validate the authenticity of this elitist ilk and deduce that it is highly organized, highly interconnected, and what amounts to a highly influential network of thought leaders & shapers.

Another infographic from Swiss Policy Research – an independent, nonpartisan and non-profit research group investigating geopolitical propaganda – shows the transatlantic network the German media is subject to:

Swiss Policy Research – Media in Germany: The transatlantic network, full-resolution image, click here.

The data contained in these infographics validates German journalist Udo Ulfkotte’s claims to this effect.

The infiltration of media, be it by the CIA, other intelligence agencies, or think-tanks such as the Council on Foreign Relations or the Atlantic Council, is unmistakably a conspiracy in that their stealthily coordinated efforts control narratives the masses, including government officials, are exposed to on a daily basis.

Same Playbook, Different War

With the current war in the Ukraine, we can easily notice how the stances held by these transatlantic institutions are mostly one-sided. Here’s a recent tweet from the Atlantic Council regarding the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war:

Tweet from the Atlantic Council, Sept. 15, 2022, Source:

#UkraineAlert | Don’t be fooled by Ukraine’s spectacular successes on the Kharkiv front. Ukraine still needs more Western weaponry in order to win against Russia, argues @Kristina__Hook. https://t.co/xV3MapJYVm — Atlantic Council (@AtlanticCouncil) September 15, 2022

The related article begins [emphasis added]:

“Ukraine’s stunning counteroffensive success in the Kharkiv region has provided conclusive proof that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are more than capable of defeating Russia on the battlefield. Now is the time to end the war by providing Ukraine with everything necessary to consolidate these gains and secure a decisive victory.”

“Victory requires a coordinated, multifaceted, and long-term approach with economic, diplomatic, humanitarian, and logistical support all needed in order to bolster the Ukrainian transition to NATO-standard weaponry. Above all, this means a full commitment by Ukraine’s partners to increase arms supplies to the country.”

As you can see, they don’t hide which side they are representing while blatantly calling for NATO and partners to increase arms supplies and weaponry. Accordingly, if this is not an advertisement to further bolster the Military/Security Complex’s coffers, then I don’t know what else to say. That would be for another article altogether that would require its own investigation.

Another recent tweet and article written by the CFR’s own President, Richard Haass, a Rhodes Scholar, from the Council on Foreign Relations rings the same bell:

Tweet from the Council on Foreign Relations, also from Sept. 15, 2022, Source:

With Russia cutting off gas supplies, Ukraine’s recent military success will make it easier for European governments to justify economic and personal sacrifice during what promises to be a difficult winter, writes @RichardHaass on @ProSyn. https://t.co/YnmqIY9Ziy — Council on Foreign Relations (@CFR_org) September 15, 2022

In it, the CFR President states [emphasis added]:

“The West, for its part, should continue to provide Ukraine with the quality and quantity of military and economic support it requires. There are strong strategic reasons for doing so, including to deter future aggression by Russia, China, or anyone else.”

The only difference is that this one makes a specific reference to China – the current frontrunner to be the next boogeyman-du-jour in our Orwellian perpetual state of war which assures gargantuan profits for the Military/Security Complex. But again, I digress, for this is yet for another behemoth of an article that would require an entire team of reporters.

The extent to which this war has also been propagated on social media is, in itself, a whole other can of worms. Armies of bots, pundits and propagandists (from both sides of the conflict) along with the divided masses all contribute to the digital fog of war in the halls, hyperbolic and echo chambers of platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.

The Council on Foreign Relations Conspiracy

In a book aptly titled ‘None Dare Call It Conspiracy’ by Gary Allen and Larry Abraham published in 1971, the first paragraph of the introduction – written by former U.S. congressman John G. Schmitz reads as follows:

“The story you are about to read is true. The names have not been changed to protect the guilty. This book may have the effect of changing your life. After reading this book you will never look at national and world events in the same way again.”

I feel the same way, though I would also highly recommend the book The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve by G. Edward Griffin which focuses on the secretive events that lead to the formation of the private corporation knowns as the US Federal Reserve which has also changed the way I personally view the word.

Griffin holds the distinguished honorary title of Conspiracy Theorist by the editors of Wikipedia and others. So, he must be doing something right. His claims about how the North American medical establishment essentially got usurped by billionaire interests certainly added credence to this title.

Speaking of billionaires, a few passages from the book ‘None Dare Call It Conspiracy’ really stand out:

“The American subsidiary of this conspiracy is called the Council on Foreign Relations and was started by and is still controlled by Leftist international bankers.”

“According to his grandson John, Jacob Schiff (above), long-time associate of the Rothschilds, financed the Communist Revolution in Russia to the tune of $20 million. According to a report on file with the State Department, his firm, Kuhn loeb and Co. bankrolled the first five year plan for Stalin. Schiff’s partner and relative, Paul Warburg, engineered the establishment of the Federal Reserve System while on the Kuhn Loeb payroll. Schiff’s descendants are active in the Council on Foreign Relations today.”

And under an old photograph of a building in New York city appears [emphasis added]:

“Home of the Council on Foreign Relations on 68th St. in New York The admitted goal of the CFR is to abolish the Constitution and replace our ones [sic] independent Republic with a World Government. CFR members have controlled, the last six administrations. Richard Nixon has been a member and has appointed at least 100 CFR members to high positions in his administration.”

And later on in the book:

“The C.F.R. has come to be known as “The Establishment,” “the invisible government” and “the Rockefeller foreign office.” This semi-secret organization unquestionably has become the most influential group in America.”

It’s most interesting to see how these billionaire actors also coincidentally have had a hand in the formation of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Perhaps, G. Edward Griffin was onto something after all.

A more recent (1988) book provides similar allegations with regards to the CFR by providing a deep dive into the historical roots, connections, and linkages to the war machine of the notorious organization. Its title is ‘The Shadows of Power: The Council on Foreign Relations And The American Decline’ by author James Perloff.

I will leave it up to the reader to investigate more into this alleged conspiracy, for such an endeavor demands significant time, scrutiny, and attention.

Conspiracy Theories that turned out to be true

Though many conspiracies have been proven true over the years, I will merely showcase a few which relate to two recurring themes of this article, namely that of war and media corruption.

Operation Mockingbird, 1950s+

In light of the revelations listed earlier in this article, it is perhaps most fitting that we exhibit this particular proven conspiracy, for its overarching implications run far and wide – even in 2022 and beyond.

In a nutshell, Operation Mockingbird was a large-scale clandestine program of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to manipulate news media for propaganda purposes.

According to The Black Vault – an online archive that houses over 3 million pages of government documents, Operation Mockingbird was said to be initially organized by Cord Meyer and Allen W. Dulles, later led by Frank Wisner after Dulles became the head of the CIA; and the organization recruited leading American journalists into a network to help present the CIA’s views, including worked to influence foreign media and political campaigns.

In 1974, The New York Times had published an article by investigative journalist Seymour Hirsh who claimed that the CIA had violated its charter

In the mid-1970s, the U.S. Congress had become concerned over abuses of the CIA, NSA, and FBI and called a committee (the Church Committee) to look over it.

As per Everipedia, the final report of the Church Committee covered CIA ties with both foreign and domestic news media. Specifically with regards to the foreign news media, the report concluded that:

“The CIA currently maintains a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to influence opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets.”

And for domestic media, the report emphasizes the following:

“Approximately 50 of the [Agency] assets are individual American journalists or employees of U.S. media organizations. Of these, fewer than half are “accredited” by U.S. media organizations … The remaining individuals are non-accredited freelance contributors and media representatives abroad … More than a dozen United States news organizations and commercial publishing houses formerly provided cover for CIA agents abroad. A few of these organizations were unaware that they provided this cover.”

Apart from the staggering revelations outlined in the two passages above, the term ‘cover’ is of particular interest. German journalist Udo Ulfkotte, mentioned earlier in this article, stated that him and other fellow German journalists were basically operating as ‘non-official cover’, or in a ‘non-official capacity’ for the CIA. In other words, the CIA employed this pretext to cloak itself and adduce plausible deniability.

Looking at the headlines and overt propaganda coming out of the European mainstream press over the last several years leaves us with little doubt that this operation (or a new version of it) is still alive and kicking.

Operation Northwoods (re Cuban Missile Crisis) in 1962

Operation Northwoods was a proposed ‘false flag’ (i.e., a covert/secretive plot intended to deceive) operation against Cuba originating from the U.S. Dept. of Defense calling upon the CIA and other U.S. government operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American civilians and military targets in Guantanamo (Cuba) and blame them on the Cuban government which would serve as a justification for war against the Caribbean island nation.

The gist of the proposed operation was to hoodwink President John F. Kennedy to declare war against Cuba in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

For those with a penchant for gripping movie dramas, the 2000 movie Thirteen Daysstarring Kevin Costner and Bruce Greenwood (as President Kennedy) serves as an absorbing illustration in which the Democrat president was placed in a mental crucible and tested to his limits.

The declassified document (memorandum for the Secretary of Defense) from 13 March 1962 titled ‘Justification for US Military Intervention in Cuba (TS)’ lays it bare for all to see.

Documentarians Aaron and Melissa Dykes produced a top-notch work on this planned conspiracy.

There are many reasons why I like Truthstream Media’s documentaries. Not only do they produce extremely well-researched works, but they also present them in a clear manner; and sometimes, such as with this particular work, they offer advice to their viewers on how to better educate themselves about world events. Near the start of this documentary, Melissa Dykes states [emphasis added]:

“We thought we would look at this document for Operation Northwoods, it was declassified, because the problem with people forgetting history or failing to research history or failing to look into history is they forget these things ever happened. And history continues to repeat and people act like they have no idea why.”

On that, I have to totally agree with Melissa Dykes. In today’s fast-pace society, people are more inclined to play with TikTok on their phones or watch movies than to read books – especially those related to history. It’s one of the main factors that has led to the lack of critical thought and discernment in society.

Simple explanation of a ‘false flag’ operation. Source

Gulf of Tonkin Incident (Vietnam), 1964

Everipedia – a blockchain-based online encyclopedia (a better source of information than Wikipedia, in my opinion) prefaces the incident as follows [emphasis added]:

“The Gulf of Tonkin incident (Vietnamese: Sự kiện Vịnh Bắc Bộ), also known as the Maddox, was an international confrontation that led to the United States engaging more directly in the Vietnam War. It involved one real and one falsely claimed confrontation between ships of North Vietnam and the United States in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. The original American report blamed North Vietnam for both incidents, but the Pentagon Papers, the memoirs of Robert McNamara, and NSA publications from 2005, proved material misrepresentation by the US government to justify a war against Vietnam.”

Among all wars fought by Americans, the Vietnam War ranked 4th just after the first two world wars and the U.S. Civil war. It’s economic and human costs epitomized human folly.

What is equally nefarious is the deceptive means by which this false flag event, or conspiracy, came about.

Notable Unresolved Conspiracies

While there are too many to even contemplate, let us have a look at some of the more controversial ones that still have an impact on society and our way of life.

September 11 attacks

Perhaps one of the biggest and most contentious ones is that of the events that relate to what happened on September 11, 2001.

So much has transpired in the 21 years that have lapsed since the collapse of the World-Trade Center towers in New York City.

Though a formal investigation has been conducted and published on these events, so many unanswered questions remain as to who exactly was behind it.

We often hear some talking about this tragic event insisting that it was an ‘inside job’ (i.e., done by powers within the U.S. Government). And for this, they are immediately labelled conspiracy theorists. Actually, in this rare case I agree with the employment of the defamatory designation. For, with an event as complex as this one, one can readily make such a claim; but to back it up with convincing evidence would require an extraordinary enterprise.

What is perhaps more useful here, though, would be to ask anew some of the most important and unaddressed questions relating to this event. For these questions which are listed below, links are provided for additional context/reference. A good refresher video (WTC7 and 9/11 Truth 14 Years Later: “People Still Want the Truth”) was published by documentarians of Truthstream Media.

How is it possible that WTC Tower 7, the 47-story building which was only affected by minor fires, collapse straight down in a free fall defying known laws of physics?

Why was the collapse of WTC Tower 7 reported by the BBC 20 minutes before it actually came down?

How come no large pieces of aircraft wreckage from United Airlines flight 93 were ever found at the alleged crash site in Stonycreek Township (Shanksville), Pennsylvania?

How come no large pieces of aircraft wreckage from American Airlines flight 77 were ever found on the ground near the West wall of the Pentagon?

Why was all the rubble and steel (evidence) from the site so swiftly collected (over the objections by fire marshals) and shipped overseas?

How was the Patriot Act (effective October 26, 2001) – a fairly long and complex legal document – drafted, reviewed, introduced, and enacted in merely 6 weeks?

Of course, there are countless other unanswered questions. Perhaps the grander question is: will there ever be a fuller, more transparent official investigation surrounding these attacks?

Who really killed JFK?

Despite the findings of the Warren Commission, it remains to be solved as to whom exactly assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy since it is proven that a single gunman could not have acted alone per the additional evidence confirmed after the commission’s report.

Many intelligence documents remained classified – even after 60 years since this tragic event took place in Dallas, Texas.

Over the years, many have contributed to the investigation that never seems to end. Investigator Jim Garrison was perhaps the most prominent amongst them.

Moon Landing Controversy

The picture above (and the cover picture for this article) may seem as a conspiracy theory in itself, for it is difficult to authenticate and locate the original photograph from UPI. However, it is one that has been properly credited and attributed to the UPI. Accordingly, the cover photograph for this article can be viewed with its original header:

And the Jacksonville Daily Journal published the photograph in its September 30, 1960 edition:

For those unfamiliar with Werner Von Braun, he was a brilliant aerospace engineer – the brains behind the development of the Saturn rockets used in the Apollo launches.

Over the past several decades, there has been a lot of debate regarding many aspects of the moon missions. A tremendous amount of money, blood, sweat, and tears have flowed into the Apollo program and other related projects.

Much pressure had been placed on the U.S. Government to ensure success – especially amidst the backdrop of the Space Race and larger Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Over the course of this colossal undertaking, it became apparent that some serious problems and challenges needed to be overcome. Many were overcome, but other major problems persisted.

A three and a half hour 2017 documentary entitled American Moon (available on YouTube, Brighteon, and Odysee) outlined many of these problems along with a significant amount of anomalies – particularly in the Apollo moon missions. In the lengthy film, they disprove not only the debunkers (those who disprove the deniers) but also some of the deniers themselves regarding their false or flawed claims.

American Moon is meticulously well documented with original (official) NASA photographs, films, interviews, technical documents, and so forth, and presented in a clear and understandable way for the average Jane or Joe.

Over 40 extremely well-formulated questions are presented and addressed to NASA itself as well as the greater debunker community. I have yet to locate a source which addresses all these key points; and this, despite nearly five years having elapsed since the documentary film came out.

I certainly invite the reader to spend the three and a half hours to view this film; for, after doing so, you will never see the moon landing in the same light.

I will only cite a few of the key questions that were put forward in this film.

The first one relates to one of the most critical aspects of space flight, namely that of the dangers of radiation that are present beyond our planet, namely the Van Allen radiation belts. The belts protect our planet from harmful radiation originating from the sun and outer space.

Van Allen radiation belts, source: NASA

Here’s a simplified image to get a better idea of the range of these belts from Earth:

Screenshot from American Moon (at the 01:00:20 mark)

The problem, here, as pointed out in the film, is that modern scientists, including NASA Orion engineer Kelly Smith for that matter, have explained that no human could penetrate either of the two (inner & outer) belts without being exposed to high-energy radiation and cosmic rays which would biologically cause serious damage, if not death. In the March 1959 edition of Scientific American, the following was noted:

“The discovery [of the Van Allen radiation belts] is of course troubling to astronauts; somehow the human body will have to be shielded from this radiation, even on a rapid transit through the region.”

More recently, NASA Orion engineer Kelly Smith stated the following when talking about the Van Allen radiation belts [emphasis added]:

“We must solve these challenges before we send people through this region of space.”

In American Moon (around the 01:11:20 mark), NASA astronaut and commander Terry Virts says the following [emphasis added]:

“The plan that NASA has is to built a rocket called SOS which is a heavy-lift rocket; it’s something much bigger than what we have today. And it will be able to launch the Orion capsule with humans on board … to destinations beyond earth orbit. Right now, we can only fly in earth orbit. That’s the farthest that we can go. This new system that we’re building is gonna allow us to go beyond and hopefully take humans into the solar system to explore. So, the moon, Mars, asteroids, there’s a lot of destinations that we could go to…”

Further in the film, Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean responded the following when asked about whether he had suffered any ill effects from having passed through the Van Allen belts:

“No. Now, I’m not sure we went far enough out to encounter the Van Allen radiation belts. Maybe we did.”

One would think that as a crew member from Apollo 12 – the second mission to land on the moon – he would know about the location and existence of these belts through which he passed through.

Strange.

Very strange.

What is also rather puzzling is the fact that NASA admits they lost the telemetry datarelated to the Apollo 11 moon mission.

The Chief Flight Director for the Gemini and Apollo programs Gene Krantz (who was portrayed by Ed Harris in the 1995 film Apollo 13) admitted that NASA had lost the original tapes containing the telemetry data (alternate video link here). When asked by documentary filmmaker Aron Ranen about the tapes, Krantz stated the following:

“I haven’t seen anything that indicates the telemetry data is even in existence. And, as I said, even if we had it, we don’t have the machines to play it back.”

Ranen, the creator of the 2005 film Did We Go? then went to NASA’s Goodard Space Center and spoke with archivist Dr. David Williams who further asserted:

“We’ve been unable to track it down. We don’t know where this telemetry data ended up. And we don’t know what path it may have taken. So, unfortunately I’m afraid I can’t give you much of a clue as to where this data ended up and whether it still exists or not.”

So, let’s be clear folks here for a minute. The data that recorded what was perhaps the single most important event in human history has completely disappeared. Really? No backup copies have been made? And it would be “impossible” to re-create machines to play it back on?

Absurd.

While it is certainly possible that these tapes have indeed disappeared, the whole affair is rather questionable and pitiful, to say the least.

The American Moon documentary further outlines anomalies related to the lunar module (LEM), telecommunications (between the earth and the moon), photographs & photography, cameras, videos, shadows, cosmic radiation, extreme temperatures, and more.

A large part of the documentary focuses on photographs taken and published by NASA. The producer of the documentary hired several top photographers in the world (who worked in the field during that period) to examine and analyze the official photos taken on the surface of the moon.

These photography experts all pointed out many impossibilities found in them.

For the most part, they disproved that the photographs could have been taken on the surface of the moon if the only main source of light was emanating from the Sun; they decisively contend that the photographs were produced on a set with artificial lighting. This segment is presented with meticulous detail and analysis which makes it extremely difficult to refute the assertions from the experts.

A common counter-argument that people have regarding those who claim the moon landings were faked is how could thousands of people be on board with such a hoax without there being any whistleblowers. Firstly, there have been numerous credible whistleblowers who have come out and I will reference one below.

As for the “thousands of employees” conundrum, the answer is quite simple. These thousands of employees would simply not be aware that this subset (i.e., the moon landings) of the Apollo missions were being deceptively presented. This was the case with the Manhattan Project whereby thousands of people worked on the development of the first atomic bomb without knowing about its ultimate goal. The project was carefully structured for secrecy by means of compartmentalization. Put simply, under compartmentalization, people work in their own respective groups (or, compartments) on specific tasks and are not privy to a lot of data or information about the overall project.

Accordingly, it would not have been that difficult to structure the NASA project in such a way.

In an April 12, 2020 confession, Gene Gilmore (born Eugene Reuben Akers), now deceased, appeared in a video (alternate links here, here, and here) disclosed what his father (Cyrus Eugene Akers who was stationed in Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico in 1968) had previously confessed to him on his death bed.

Mr. Akers senior was in the Military Police for over 20 years and on his death bed in 2002 he made a recording of what he had witnessed.

Gene’s father told him about project ‘Slam Dunk’ whereby there were two large hangars (at the Cannon Air Force Base) that were connected, dump trucks had delivered sand and stone, and cement powder that was applied on top of all that material to make it look like a lunar landscape.

The surprised son continued listening to his father state that in front of the airplane hangars was pull framing with large canvas tents that were concealing the inside of the staging area. Inside the staging area, on flat bed trucks was created the lunar lander that was assembled, reassembled back inside the hangars. All of the walls were painted flat black as were the ceilings.

Cyrus Eugene Akers was sworn to secrecy by the National Security Agency (NSA).

Gene then recalled that when his father saw the moon landing on television, he cried.

He said that what he witnessed on TV is exactly what they recorded in that hangar.

Mr. Akers continued his death bed confession to his son stating that there were 3 guards at the entrance of the hangar and there was a list of 15 people who could enter, no one else was allowed by order of President [Lyndon] Johnson. Gene Gilmore then stated that he had given the list to Bart Sibrel.

Gene Gilmore then enumerates the specific names of list of 15 people who had special access to the hangars which include President Johnson, Neil Armstrong, Edwin [Buzz] Alden, Werner Von Braun, Gene Krantz, James Webb, Dr. James Van Allen, among others.

Gilmore continues on with what his father had confided in him. President Johnson was there only for the first day of filming. The filming lasted for 3 days. And then, everything was dismantled to bring the hangars back to their original states.

Gilmore then states that since 2002, he verified a lot of the information his father had given him – including records from Cannon Air Force base that confirmed the presence of President Johnson and the astronauts at that time as well as the lunar lander. Apparently though, this information was subsequently removed from Cannon’s website.

Lastly, Gene affirms that his father stated had to tell somebody about the incident before he died because it was too important; but he also warned him not to ever tell anybody.

Regarding the authenticity of these testimonies, there is always the possibility that they are not entirely truthful. But people seldom lie during death bed confessions. They usually want to get truth off their chests before they meet their maker. The fact that Gene Gilmore instructed Bart Sibrel to only publish his confession after his death also adds credibility to his testimony.

As recent as Sept. 22, 2022, Lead Stories published a fact check rebuke regarding this confession video. In it, they stated that they had contacted NASA regarding the video and posted their spokesperson’s reply in the article:

“There is a significant amount of evidence to support NASA landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 to 1972. We collected 842 pounds of moon rocks that have been studied by scientists worldwide for decades. From these rocks, we’ve learned that the moon was once part of the Earth, the moon is about 4.5 billion years old, and that most of the moon’s craters are caused by impact, not volcanism.”

Anyone with half a brain could tell that this reply is totally unconvincing. Why mention moon rocks? It’s as if the spokesperson thinks this provides tangible evidence of the moon landings. One would also think that NASA would have come up with a much more thoughtful and convincing argument than the absurdity stated above.

I digress.

The conclusion of the American Moon documentary shows part of the Apollo 11 astronauts post moon mission press conference. They point out that the three astronauts were totally unenthusiastic.

They were there to talk about the single most important feat accomplished by human beings and these men could barely crack a smile or convey their joy and enthusiasm about their monumental achievement. This goes without saying that it is all, indeed and utterly, extremely bizarre.

Moreover, the very apparent levels of stress shown by the astronauts as per their body language at the beginning of the press conference is somewhat mind boggling. Keep in mind that these astronauts are test pilots who have experience handling extremely stressful situations, not to mention having [purportedly] flown an extremely dangerous mission to the moon. So, relatively speaking, simply talking to the public and press about their monumental achievement should not have been so challenging and stressful for these men. Rather, it should have been a cause for celebration and pride. What is the average person to make of this?

American Moon ends with video clips of Bart Sibrel confronting each of the three Apollo 11 astronauts (Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins) asking them to swear on the Bible that they walked on the moon. All three men displayed very uncomfortable stances and refused. Sibrel even offered $5,000 in cash to charity should Neil Armstrong agree, but he still refused. Buzz Aldrin actually punched Sibrel in the face when the interrogator persisted in his questioning. Even though Sibrel’s approach wasn’t particularly friendly, it remains odd that none of them agreed to do so.

As more and more inconsistencies surface regarding the Apollo moon missions along with mounting evidence which contradicts the official narrative, it is probably just a matter of time before NASA becomes obligated to admit what really happened in July of 1969. Undoubtedly, there is a lot at stake.

Will history books need to be re-written?

Time will tell.

Conspiracies to Watch

As practically all of the conspiracies stated below are highly controversial and subjective in nature, I will merely provide a short summary of each along with key links that provide some initial background information – selected specifically to exhibit why they are considered conspiratorial. Ultimately, it is really up to the readers to investigate them and draw their own conclusions as to the authenticity and legitimacy of their respective stated claims.

Climate Change

Though the very hot and contentious issue of ‘Climate Change’, formerly known as ‘Global Warming’, is complex and controversial, we must begin by examining its origins.

Where did this really originate from? When was it first mentioned and put forward as an existential threat?

Former Australian politician Ann Bressington shed a bit of light on the issue in a candid speech about Agenda 21 and the Club of Rome a few years ago. In the speech(alternate link) she stated the following [emphasis added]:

“Ladies and gentlemen, the origins of the environmental movement as we see it began back in 1968 when the Club of Rome was formed. The Club of Rome has been described as a crisis think tank which specialises in crisis creation. The main purpose of this think tank was to formulate a crisis that would unite the world and condition us to the idea of global solutions to local problems. In a document called The First Global Revolution, … it stated: ‘In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill.’ …, that’s the origin of global warming ladies and gentlemen.”

Her statement does indeed check out. On page 115 of the 1991 book entitled The First Global Revolution: A Report by the Council of Rome, you can clearly read the passage under the header ‘The Common Enemy of Humanity is Man’ [emphasis added in red]:

Excerpt from page 115 of the book The First Global Revolution: A Report by the Council of Rome

The Club of Rome is still actively involved in activities related to Climate Change. And at first glance it all seems quite legitimate. But the power and influence wielded by its well-connected membership leaves much to be scrutinized.

Moreover, while the above information doesn’t serve as a smoking gun with regards to an alleged conspiracy, it does demonstrate that powerful and deeply connected think tanks (like with the Council on Foreign Relations mentioned earlier in this article) can influence many key players, including heads of state (even former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, father of the current Prime Minister).

Credible scientific evidence contrary to the current climate change narrative does exist, yet very seldom appears in the mainstream press, for it goes against the ascribed (and undebatable) “the science is settled” mantra.

One of these includes the recent (August, 2022) article entitled 1,200 Scientists and Professionals Declare: “There is No Climate Emergency” by The Daily Sceptic which challenges the ‘political fiction’ that humans cause most or all of climate change.

The article also states that the scale to the opposition to the modern-day belief that the ‘science is settled’ [on Climate Change] is remarkable, even amidst the backdrop of academia which barely ever issues grants for climate research that departs from the political orthodoxy. On a side note, a blunt revelation by the co-founder of The Weather Channel John Coleman offered a rather scathing (and highly entertaining) lecture towards Brian Stelter from CNN a few years back in which he stated that there was no real science behind climate change. Now, back to the article of interest from The Daily Sceptic. It makes reference to a declaration by over 1,200 scientists from all around the world who assert that there is no climate emergency. This declaration is formally known as the ‘World Climate Declaration (WCD)’. Here are a few key excerpts:

“Climate policy relies on inadequate models

Climate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools. They do not only exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases, they also ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial.”

“CO2 is plant food, the basis of all life on Earth

CO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential to all life on Earth. More CO2 is favorable for nature, greening our planet. Additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also profitable for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide.”

“Global warming has not increased natural disasters

There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent. However, there is ample evidence that CO2mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly.”

“Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realities

There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. Go for adaptation instead of mitigation; adaptation works whatever the causes are.”

It should be obvious – even to a grade school student – that C02 is essential for life on earth and for the healthy functioning of our biological ecosystems. But our mainstream media and academia have been bamboozled and overtaken by powerful interest groups (as is the case in many other institutions such as those of finance and government) to pervert reality and propagate absurdities day in and day out. These compromised media outlets prefer to push the half-baked narratives from the likes of Bill Gates rather than invite real scientists that will challenge the ‘settled’ narratives and pundit talking heads.

To be fairer and more objective though, the onus really is on each and every one of us to properly inform ourselves about issues such as climate change. We should be open to listening to those with opposing views and seek the opinions of independents who are not subsidised or funded by special interest groups or who will somehow benefit in spewing pre-packaged, one-size fits all, narratives.

The origins of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19)

No other matter has consumed the collective thought of people from around the world over the last 2+ years than the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Early on during the pandemic, many had contended that the virus was not of natural origin but was rather one that was altered in a lab setting; and after things had gone afoul, the virus was somehow spread out of the biosafety level 4 lab known as the Wuhan Institute of Virology into the public of the Chinese metropolis, and eventually to the entire world. This was in contrast with the original claim that the virus had originated in a wet market in Wuhan whereby the virus had crossed-over to humans from bats.

Those who made the contention that the virus could have been engineered in a lab were immediately dismissed as conspiracy theorists.

But as more evidence has surfaced regarding a massive coverup by the Chinese government and apparent pre-pandemic linkages between US-funded labs an the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the theory gained traction.

Anthony Fauci who is the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the leader in the United States regarding the handling of the Covid-19 Pandemic has repeatedly lied (to US Congress) about and denied that any gain-of-function research (specifically, a bat coronavirus research project by EcoHealth Alliance) had taken place under his US government-funded National Institutes of Health (NIH) lab in Wuhan.

Surfaced letters have shone additional light on the matter demonstrating that funding from NIH to EcoHEalth Alliance did indeed occur.

In addition, a report from The Intercept following a FOIA request produced 900 pages of materials relating to coronavirus research in China.

Furthermore, an email letter from Peter Daszak from EcoHealth Alliance dated April 18, 2020, surfaced whereby Daszak thanked Anthony Fauci, the head of the Covid-19 response team, for his [false] public comments regarding the origins of Covid-19.

News aggregator ZeroHedge ran an article on August 6, 2021 whereby virologist Shi Zhengli (also known as “Bat Lady”) of the Wuhan Institute of Virology – whose lab received US funding to make coronaviruses more infectious to humans – warned that the virus will continue to mutate producing new strains.

China expert Matthew Tye who is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and goes by the YouTube handle Laowhy86 produced a very compelling piece (dated April 1, 2020, now with over 2.4 million views) on the source origins of SARS-CoV-2, even hypothesizing about who patient zero for this virus was; namely, Huang Yan Ling an employee of the infamous lab who went missing, along with her profile from the lab’s website.

The World Health Organization (WHO) who is generously funded by Bill Gates – apart from sovereign nations, he is by far its top donor – is well known to have kowtowed to the Chinese government early on in the pandemic, was eventually compelled to conduct a formal investigation about the origins of the virus.

Using relevant sources, Summit News reported that the WHO’s chief investigator, Ben Embarek (who also surmised that patient zero was likely a lab worker at the Wuhan Institute of Virology) essentially found nothing of material substance in the probe and was only permitted [by the Chinese government] to mention the possibility of a lab leak without being allowed to probe further. All of this, too, after having visited the lab for a period of only 3 hours.

In addition, one might find it particularly inappropriate that Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance was chosen as part of the WHO’s investigatory team since he had previously worked in this same lab and given his obvious conflicts of interest in the matter at hand.

In their defense, it is highly likely that the Chinese government had adequate time to remove any incriminating evidence that could have pointed to the gain of function research about coronaviruses and the inherent lab leak of the virus.

As a substantial amount of time has elapsed since the Covid-19 pandemic began coupled with the concealment (deliberate or indeliberate) of critical direct and physical evidence regarding the real nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we may never know the true story surrounding its origins.

What remains, however, is that it is certainly worthwhile to not let this one drain down the funnel of forgotten history.

The World Economic Forum (WEF)’s Great Reset

Though founded in 1971, it is really in the last couple of years that this elitist organization, commonly referred to as the WEF, started to gain attention by the general public (rather than business leaders, politicians, and state leaders) around the world. This is in large part attributable to the increase in the influence and power they have gradually exerted on nations over the years, and particularly since the Covid-19 Pandemic came about.

In 2020, the WEF embraced the opportunity that this global crisis presented and not let it “go to waste.” And thus, seized it through a series of recommendations and actions which they stated as an opportune moment to “redefine” the world – particularly the traditional economic model into one of what they call ‘stakeholder capitalism’. Hence was born their proposed ambitious action plan known as the ‘Great Reset’.

Two books accompany this endeavor, namely, the manifesto entitled COVID-19: The Great Reset (2020) written by WEF founder Klaus Schwab, as well as the The Fourth Industrial Revolution (2016). Both serve as blueprints for what the well-connected elitist and quasi-supranational organization wish to impose on global citizens.

The WEF’s founder Klaus Schwab has been characterised as kind of a Bond villain in the last few years – particularly over social media. A well-researched introduction about Klaus Schwab and the WEF was produced by YouTuber Sorelle Amore.

While registered as a non-profit organization, the WEF does appear, at prima facie, to be one with benevolent intentions fostering public-private partnerships, that is not entirely the case. Many controversies have surrounded a lot of what has come out of their famous annual meetings referred to as ‘Davos’ which usually take place in the ski-resort town of Davos in Switzerland.

For instance, many rich elites who’ve paid a hefty membership fee to join the WEF, make it to the annual event in their private jets while they call upon the masses and nation states to curve energy emissions and reduce their carbon footprints. In this year’s Davos meeting, one of their ilk, J. Michael Evans, president of the Alibaba Group, even proposed a new technology to measure one’s carbon footprint, stating [emphasis added]:

“We’re developing, through technology, an ability for consumers to measure their own carbon footprint. What does that mean? That’s, where are they traveling, how are they traveling, what are they eating, what are they consuming on the platform? … stay tuned, we don’t have it operational yet – but this is something we’re working on.”

While we all love the environment and want to do our part to protect it, this kind of scheme appears to be nothing less than a proposed taxation scheme targeted to partner governments eager and willing to implement it.

Other controversial, some would say absurd, proposals have come out of their forums. Promoting the masses to eat bugs (as a high source of protein and great substitute for meat) is actually a thing now with celebrities such as Nicole Kidman helping to spark the trend stating how delicious they are. Insect processing plants, such as the cricket facility from Aspire Food Group in Ontario, are also starting to bolster this nascent industry.

You would be stunned at witnessing the extent to which this is becoming widespread.

Some, however, have expressed concerns about how insect-based ingredients are stealthily being added to the food we purchase and how they are not fit for human consumption and possibly even cancerous.

Tweet indicating that President’s Choice (a leading food provider in Canada) is including insect components in this product, as per the label, purchased at a store in Saskatchewan.

I suppose we are all going to have to more carefully read the ingredients lists of the foods we purchase.

Another major concern with regards to the WEF is the amount of power and influence they hold over political officials, including heads of state.

This became apparent in the recent riots that have occurred in the Netherlands where Dutch farmers have protested in masse against government diktats regarding reducing nitrogen (used in fertilizer) levels and possible farm land appropriation.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte also received criticism regarding the coziness of his ties with the WEF’s boss, Klaus Schwab, and his agendas. In fact, Rutte was blasted in the Dutch legislature by Gideon van Meijeren (MP) for this relationship and complicity in the WEF’s Great Reset (link includes the related video). Rutte responded to the young MP that he didn’t know about the book (COVID-19: The Great Reset) and ridiculed the young MP to “not look too much into these conspiracy theories.”

In turns out, though, that a close relationship did exist between the Netherlands Mark Rutte and the WEF. Independent information outlet LeLibrePenseur.org (French for ‘The Free thinker’), published secret letters between the two. In a report titled Fuites de Klaus Schwab : lettres secrètes entre le WEF et des membres du gouvernement hollandais dévoilées ! (Klaus Schwab leaks: secret letters between the WEF and members of the Dutch government exposed!), they showcased (what many mainstream Dutch journalists had described as conjecture) how the Rutte government had indeed been subservient to the interests and agendas of the WEF. Following a request from deputy FVD Pepijn van Houwelingen to make public the letters addressed to Dutch cabinet members, it was confirmed that their contributions had helped in the realisation of the Great Reset, essentially bypassing the will of the people through their elected officials.

While it is not necessarily conspiratorial to create linkages with the WEF, the secretive manner in which it was done is what proves alarming.

Regarding Canada, Klaus Schwab has repeatedly boasted on how proud he was proud of his army of Young Global Leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Schwab even bragged about how his lieutenants had “penetrated” the Canadian cabinet stating [emphasis added]:

“What we are very proud of now [is] the young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, …, that we penetrate the cabinets. So, yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau and I know that half of his cabinet, or even more than half of his cabinet are actually young global leaders of the world.”

That is a stunning admission from the leader of the WEF. Canadian opposition MP even inquired about this outside interference on behalf of a constituent of his during a parliamentary session, only to see the Speaker dismiss the question from the MP regarding this claim by provided a ridiculous excuse that the audio and video were “really really bad”. This was swiftly followed by an MP of the ruling party dismissing the question stating that the opposition MP was “promoting disinformation”. Really? I presume he didn’t hear the video in question that clearly stated otherwise. Regardless of the veracity of the claim itself, when an extremely powerful individual from an extremely powerful global organization such as the WEF makes a vivid assertion about who is controlling the Canadian cabinet, it should be taken seriously and further investigated.

At the very least, according to True North News, the Trudeau Government gave nearly $3 million to the WEF which raises a cause for suspicion regarding the relationship and its inherent motivations.

Rigging of the Gold & Silver Markets

At this point/stage, this is really no longer a conspiracy theory, but more of a conspiracy fact. As a financial author, I have followed the gold and silver markets on a daily basis for the past ten years and have witnessed and documented numerous cases of blatant price fixing – almost exclusively to the down side.

The main reason for the suppression of gold and silver prices is to maintain the illusion of a strong US dollar; for, if prices of these metals get too elevated it raises alarm bells as to the weakness of an exponentially increasing money supply.

Here is what I’m talking about:

Gold smashed down more than $85 during London trading hours on November 9, 2020. Source: Kitco

It is very typical for the price fixers (see below) to smash the gold price down (they do this by shorting large amounts of paper gold futures contracts) before the open of U.S. markets – either during Asian (Hong Kong) or London trading sessions.

Former industry insider and highly credible Peter Hambro forthrightly explains how the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the LBMA (London Bullion Market Association) in London, and the COMEX (the largest American commodities and futures exchange) in New York are complicit in the price fixing (almost exclusively to the down side) of gold.

Over the past several years, precious metals analyst Roman Manly has also conducted extensive and thorough investigative work about the manipulation of gold and silver prices as has the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee (GATA).

Regarding silver, an article entitled A Silver Price Manipulation Primer by Sprott Money and precious metals writer Craig Hemke offers a good introduction about the fixing of silver prices.

Lastly, we cannot forget the unabashedly, unfiltered, and outspoken Canadian derivatives expert Rob Kirby who passed away earlier this year (a tribute to his work can be seen via YouTube’s Liberty and Finance channel) who has extensively reported on these illegal price fixing activities on various YouTube channels such as Liberty and Finance.

Mass Censorship & Search Manipulation

In 2021, Twitter completely banned and censored the sitting U.S. President, Donald J. Trump – who had over 88 million followers on the platform.

If a Big Tech outfit like Twitter can outlaw a sitting U.S. President, you can rest assured that they can basically ban and memory-hole anyone. And that, they have done so unabatedly in the past several years.

Google (the largest search engine in the world by far) who owns a slew of other extremely popular applications used by hundreds of millions of people and media platforms such as YouTube, has been known to employ very deceptive practices over the past several years.

Many of these involve either directly or indirectly censoring websites and completely banning countless channels – particularly conservative and alternative ones – from their YouTube platform, not to mention shadow-banning. In regards to the later, whistleblower Zack Vorhies, a former Senior Software Engineer at Google, stated that the tech giant was a “highly biased political machine”. The former insider took a cache of documents that provided rather revealing information about the inner workings of their search algorithms, establishing a “single point of truth” for news, and preventing another “Trump situation” in 2020, from ever happening again.

More recently – and quite convincingly, Dr. Robert Epstein, a Senior Research Psychologist from the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technologygave an in-depth interview with The Epoch Times’ Jan Jekielek (Robert Epstein: Inside Big Tech’s Manipulation Machine and How to Stop It) revealing in a meticulously documented fashion how Google is indeed politically aligned to the left and how it manipulates the thoughts and minds of their users via “ephemeral experiences”. The April 2022 broadcast and podcast for this interview are definitely worth listening to. By listening to it, you will learn a lot about what exactly happens behind the scenes when you use Google search and its various products and services. Alternatively, you can read or consult Dr. Epstein’s full research paper entitled ‘GOOGLE’S TRIPLE THREAT, To Democracy, Our Children, and Our Minds‘ (51-page PDF) published earlier this year.

Full research report by Dr. Epstein’s entitled ‘GOOGLE’S TRIPLE THREAT, To Democracy, Our Children, and Our Minds‘ (PDF)

Slightly after the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, Dr. Epstein had surmised that search engine bias shifted 2-3 million votes in Hillary Clinton’s favor and warned that the number could increase fivefold in the 2020 contest.

Also back in 2016, it was revealed how Google had censored information about Hillary Clinton’s wrongdoings in their search results compared to other major search engines.

Whether the call for censoring and shielding Big Tech from scrutiny and legal action comes under the guise of cracking down on misinformation or preserving their censorship power, it nonetheless remains clear that these media behemoths hold tremendous power on the levers of public discourse and the availability of information.

The Biden Administration has been accused of employing an “army” of officials from multiple government agencies (specifically, the HHS, DHS, CISA, the CDC, NIAID, the Office of the Surgeon General, the Census Bureau, the FDA, the FBI, the State Department, the Treasury Department, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission) to censor information using their contacts in social media. A recent lawsuit – handled by the New Civil Rights Alliance – alleges that very claim. The lawsuit’s plaintiffs’ position begins with their claim and what it seeks [emphasis added]:

“the Plaintiffs served interrogatories and document requests upon the Government Defendants seeking the identity of federal officials who have been and are communicating with social-media platforms about disinformation, misinformation, malinformation, and/or any censorship or suppression of speech on social media, including the nature and content of those communications.”

In a recent interview with Joe Rogan, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also openly revealed that he followed the censorship orders from the FBI to suppress information related to Hunter Biden’s laptop ahead of the 2020 election; all this was under the guise of “Russian Disinformation” and the net effect was that Facebook ended up ranking the information further down their newsfeed which could certainly be seen as election interference and/or political partisanship.

I have mentioned in my initial post on Substack, that I espouse the notion that, in essence, there really is no such thing as misinformation, disinformation, or malinformation (or even ‘fake news’ for that matter) – for, it is ALL INFORMATION. If the public is not able to firstly access information and then analyse and discern it for themselves (even with regards to the complex issues of our day), then perhaps we have a bigger problem. Namely, that of a dumbed-down populous unable to critically think for themselves without been spoon fed pre-determined, unquestionable, narratives by “authority” figures.

in a recent interview, author, journalist, senior editor for The New American, and Epoch Times contributor Alex Newman offers are rather insightful view of not just the current state of censorship, but also the worrying trend of the dumbing-down of population through our degrading school system. As one who has worked in the education sector for 35 years, I can certainly agree with his concern that our youth are not adequately being taught critical-thinking skills in our public school system.

In Canada, the controversial Bill C-11 (an Act to amend the Broadcasting Act) has been passed by Parliament and is awaiting a second reading in the Senate. Though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that it would help “oppressed communities” and “strengthen trusted news sources in Canada”, many others contend that if passed as law, it will favor government-approved news organizations who are already (and will continue to) receive nearly hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money, with the CBC reportedly receiving 1.4 billion in 2021 according to the National Post. Dr. Michael Geist, a law professor and Research Chair (in Internet and E-commerce Law) at the University of Ottawa categorized the government’s defence of the bill as “cartoonishly misleading”. The main concern is that this bill could silence freedom-loving content creators, reports mrcTV. Canadian journalist Dan Dicks from Pressfortruth.ca and social media personality Viva Frei (David Freiheit) have criticized the bill (and even its predecessor bill C-10). It remains to be seen if the bill will pass the Senate to become law.

2020 Election in the United States

The 2020 Election was one of the most controversial elections in American history. Coverage about the election varied greatly among major networks and news outlets in the country.

In my opinion, I have found The Epoch Times coverage of the election to be most accurate and independent.

All publications have bias in their reporting; that is inevitable due also, in large part, to opinion pieces which in today’s polarized society carry a lot of weight. That being said, I still believe that articles from The Epoch Times have been more objective than many others.

One of their seasoned contributors, Sharyl Atkinson – an investigative journalist who has reported nationally for CBS News, PBS, CNN – ran an viewpoint article on Dec. 22, 2020 titled 2020 Election Screaming Red Flags That Deserved Criminal Inquiry. Though it was an opinion piece, she provided a fair analysis whereby she pointed out the many claims of election irregularities and fraud and how they should have been taken more seriously and investigated upon by government officials and law enforcement agencies. And since they haven’t been taken seriously, the integrity of the election results comes under great scrutiny. Her piece then lists eight examples of “screaming red flags” that should have prompted thorough criminal inquiries.

Prior to the election, The Epoch Times had unveiled a very comprehensive exposé titled Spygate: The Inside Story Behind the Alleged Plot to Take Down Trump that was very well sourced and referenced. The investigatory work outlined in great detail the concerted plot whereby key members of the CIA, FBI, Department of Justice (DOJ), and officials from the U.S. State Department set up and accused President Trump of colluding with the Russians.

Various official inquiries such as the very long and costly Special Counsel investigation of 2017-2019 (headed by the very corrupt and compromised Robert Mueller, former Director of the FBI) proved that no foul play had ever occurred between Trump and the Russians.

What is stated in the previous paragraph is important, for it adds veracity to the claims made about election fraud to the detriment of the incumbent Trump. Why? Because it affirms the motivation by those in power to use the same type of unlawful activities (and collusive partners) to falsify and skew election data.

Such manipulation of the data, demonstrable by statistical anomalies, (particularly with mail-in ballots) certainly became obvious and apparent during the morning hours following election day when, miraculously, Joe Biden’s numbers soared in key states where Trump was leading. Many outlets had cried afoul to this apparent fraud. Even the head of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Trey Trainor at the time said he believed there was widespread election fraud.

In addition, the manner in which Big Tech platforms have shown favoritism – before, during, and after the election – is also to be considered in the disputed election results. It is no secret that Google has not been shy about supporting Democratic candidates such as Hilary Clinton and Joe Biden in the past several years; this has been highly documented – with some examples detailed in this work (above). Twitter has also blatantly censored and terminated accounts belonging to conservatives; a case in point here includes them suspending 2020 election audit accounts for multiple states.

Dominion Voting Systems were used in many states for the election. And much controversy arose surrounding their reliability and accuracy in counting votes, along with hacking (including foreign) vulnerabilities. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) has pointed out that these could affect voting in multiple states. The state of Pennsylvania is suing Dominion Voting Systems alleging “severe issues” with voting data discovered after the 2020 election. And, more recently, the Biden administration is urging a court not to release a sealed report on Dominion Voting Systems.

Lastly, the fact that Joe Biden supposedly received 80 million votes – the most votes won by any presidential candidate in US history (which shatters the 69.5 million votes Barack Obama had received in 2008) – remains highly questionable. Even prior to election night, Biden himself was nowhere nearly as popular as his predecessor, Barack Obama. Perhaps there was a larger portion of the population that went out to vote and wanted to vote for the Democratic party regardless of its leader.

While there still are ongoing investigations at the state level regarding these voting irregularities, it is highly doubtful that much will come out of them. The whole affair has been greatly politicized which taints the judicial review process and proper accounting of votes for the highly-disputed 2020 election.

Aerosol Spraying (Geoengineering)

Of the many alleged conspiracies worth keeping an eye on, Aerosol Spraying(sometimes referred to as ‘Aerial Discharges’ or ‘chemtrails’) – which fits under the larger umbrella of geoengineering – is one of the most troubling and worrisome ones.

For those not familiar with the subject, geoengineering generally involves modifying the weather for various purposes such as in climate engineering (e.g., cloud seeding to induce rain over drought-stricken areas) or as weather warfare for military purposes – which dates all the way back to the Eisenhower administration in the United States.

For at least the past two decades, Dane Wigington has been on a crusade to alert the world about this troubling phenomenon due to its extensive use of harmful chemicals. His website GeoengineeringWatch.org contains a substantial amount of credible evidence regarding the dangerous effects that geoengineering practices have on our climate, environment, and populations. Whistleblower testimonies, government reports, and other evidence presented on the site – including numerous photographs and videos – prove that a lot of activities surrounding geoengineering is intended for nefarious and harmful purposes.

This is not conspiracy theory, but rather indications of a conspiracy to harm populations through weather modification and jet sprayings – sometimes inadequately referred to as ‘chemtrails’.

I myself have witnessed this phenomenon of jet sprayings over my region in the province of Quebec since my return to Canada in November of 2021. I never saw these spraying prior to the year 2008 before my departure from the country. Since my return, I’ve been witnessing massive spraying occurring over the skies of my region to the tune of three to five times a week, on average. And each day of spraying emanates from around a dozen or more flight by high-altitude aircraft.

I’ve personally written to my city, the local airport authority in the city, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Transport Canada and none of them have provided concrete answers to my inquiries and to the nature of this phenomenon in general.

Both my city and Environment and Climate Change Canada have replied to me that these sprayings are merely commercial passenger aircraft exhaust trails, i.e., condensation trails. Anyone who has taken a high-school level physics course will be able to debunk this ludicrous claim that these sprayings – that stretch over kilometers far and wide and that last hours – are due to condensation vapor trails.

I had asked Environment and Climate Change Canada if these sprayings could be attributed to weather modification programs, and they replied me that none were in effect in the province of Quebec, but that there was one in effect in the province of Alberta. So, if these are not intended for weather modification purposes, then what are they for?

My subsequent (and very polite, respectful) email inquiries to these Canadian agencies have been mostly ignored. This leaves me to conclude that they are not being forthcoming about the origins of these sprayings and thus appear to be hiding the facts surrounding them.

Aerosol sprayings over the greater City of Sherbrooke (Quebec) area on January 30, 2022

In addition, for this year alone, I have seen many photographs and videos shared online of these sprayings posted by many Canadians located in different provinces.

In Canada there have been court cases filed regarding aerosol sprayings. Mass sprayings in the Calgary, Alberta region have lead to a mass-tort case that was filed in Federal Court (see related court documents) in 2016 along with a related appeal in 2018 also at the federal level. The appeal further alleges:

“the ongoing dispersal into Canadian airspace of aerosols that are harmful to the Canadian public and that is polluting to the Canadian environment, and in respect of which aspects of the scientific community have only relatively recently evaluated in the scientific peer-reviewed literature.”

The court case mentioned above appears to still be ongoing.

What is particularly worrisome about these aerosol sprayings is that we don’t know exactly what chemicals are being used and dispersed over our skies.

The team at GeoengineeringWatch.org has produced many excellent explanatory videos and documentaries, along with a cache of documents to inform the public of what these sprayings are really about and what chemicals are found in them. I highly recommend their introductory video Hacking The Planet: The Climate Engineering Reality.

Evidence collected by GeoengineeringWatch.org has shown that chemicals and metals used in aerosol sprayings have included aluminum, barium, strontium, graphene, among others.

What is also particularly troubling is that many of these metals and chemicals make their way to ground level from high altitude in the form of nanoparticles – which if breathed in, are tiny enough to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. They are especially harmful to elderly and infant populations whose brains are still in development. In this respect, I highly recommend the work of neurosurgeon Dr. Russell Blaylock who describes the harmful effects these chemicals have on the brain.

There is also a lot of evidence that suggests that geoengineering is used to modify the climate and could thus be a significant contributor to climate change, increasingly unstable weather systems, and droughts.

Lastly, what I find particularly disappointing as a Canadian is the position, albeit one from several years ago, whereby our very famous David Suzuki – one who I admired very much growing up and watching his show The Nature of Things – pretty much described the phenomenon as conspiracy theory posited by “wacky science deniers” in an article entitled David Suzuki on Chemtrails, Conspiracies fuel climate change denial and belief in chemtrails. There are many false assertions in this poorly formulated article, but here are the key ones [emphasis added]:

“I recently wrote about geoengineering as a strategy to deal with climate change and carbon dioxide emissions. That drew comments from people who confuse this scientific process with the unscientific theory of “chemtrails””.

Suzuki’s statement bolded above makes no sense. A theory is a theory. There is nothing unscientific about a theory. A theory is a hypothesis assumed for the sake of investigation which is formulated before science is conducted to verify it.

He continues with the following later in his article:

“I’m a scientist, so I look at credible science – and there is none for the existence of chemtrails.”

“They’re condensation trails, formed when hot, humid air from jet exhaust mixes with colder low-vapour-pressure air.”

Condensation trails? Condensation trails do not drag on over several kilometers and remain suspended for hours at a time; rather, they usually dissolve within several seconds, or a few minutes at the most.

As for “credible evidence”, these aerosol sprayings have been highly documented over the past several years.

So, these are the main arguments and explanations from one of Canada’s most renowned scientists?

Really?

Sorry Mr. Suzuki, I respectfully disagree with this very perplexing assertion, for it doesn’t hold water! (pun intended)

And many of the 297 comments generated from this article are in disagreement with Mr. Suzuki’s assessment.

Author note: I have contacted Mr. Suzuki by email to provide him with an opportunity to re-assert or update his assertions (especially since several years have elapsed since the article was written) but have not received a reply from him as of publishing time.

Back to the condensation trails, I have personally filmed and photographed many instances of real condensation trails from commercial airliners including those at high altitude; and for these, the trails completely disappear within no more than a minute or so.

I even have some that show these alongside other – likely non-commercial – aircraft which produce aerosol sprayings that last for kilometers and persist for much longer periods. And this, of course, under the exact same weather conditions.

Also, I would invite the skeptics to try to find any photographs or videos prior to the 1960s that have these kinds of criss-cross patterns and lengthy and abnormal cloud dispersions over several kilometers in the sky. There are none that I know of; but if any are found, let me know. The oldest ones that I’ve been able to find appeared in a few episodes of the TV series Little House on the Prairie which began in 1974.

Wouldn’t a scientist who is genuinely concerned about climate change such as David Suzuki (and all others, for that matter) want to consider all factors (including aerosol dispersions) which may contribute to the degradation of our natural environment?

Questions that remain regarding this inadequately addressed phenomenon include:

What is the purpose of these aerosol sprayings?

Who is authorizing them?

Who is paying for them?

What substances (including chemicals) are they spraying?

Mini-Guide to Investigating Conspiracies

“An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people.” – Thomas Jefferson

Actually, the header for this section is a bit of a misnomer, for it will comprise a broader range of tools and techniques that will enable individuals to do a better job at discerning and validating information.

The internet is a vast ocean of information and knowledge. There is a lot to take in and it can all be quite overwhelming – especially when social media is included in the mix.

Many labels such as ‘fake news’, misinformation, and disinformation have been thrown left and right to hastily characterize the validity of information provided by certain parties.

Of course, this is very subjective and is influenced by many factors such as different kinds of biases, political affiliations, financial interests, and the like. One must judge what one reads based on its own merits without relying on these labels. In other words, begin by removing any of these labels or preconceived assumptions and tackle the information itself.

I would recommend reading news and information from different sources – whether it be from mainstream media, alternative media, and everywhere in between. Each article or piece of information is unique, was written by an individual (or a few individuals) and should be treated and evaluated as such. Put another way, each article is like an antique. An antique collector will inspect and examine each piece on its own characteristics and merits. Depending on the qualities and flaws observed, the collector will be able to make an objective evaluation for authentication purposes (i.e., Is it real or fake?) We should use the same approach when encountering a piece of information – particularly if it is of a complex, controversial, or disputable nature.

Another thing we can do is be wary of buzzwords. By buzzwords, I mean words or phrases like ‘right-wing’, ‘left-wing’, ‘conspiracy theorist’, ‘conservative’, ‘liberal’, ‘MAGA Republican’, ‘anti-vaxxer’, ‘so-called’, ‘quasi’, and ‘pseudo’. Buzzwords are similar to labels and are often used by writers or TV personalities to indirectly (or subliminally) convey a pre-conceived notion about the subject matter of the information piece. Also be aware that buzzwords’ meanings can vary from one geographical region to another, similar to slang. The idea here is to detect their usage and become cognizant that they may be used to sway the reader’s opinion in a certain direction. So, look out for these – especially when reading headlines to articles or social media posts.

In today’s very polarized and divided society filled with identity politics, blame and labels will be readily cast upon those who don’t “toe the line” (i.e., go along with a certain narrative, or accept the authority or views of a particular group, sometimes under pressure from that group). We’ve seen a heck of a lot of this in the past couple of years with the Covid-19 Pandemic. Prime examples include the likes of “trust the science”, or “he’s an anti-vaxxer”. For the later, the danger here is that such condescending comments or labels assigned to specific people or groups can not only be harmful, but will too often lead to incorrect assumptions about the target. For instance, if someone refuses to take the Covid-19 vaccine, that doesn’t necessarily mean she’s an anti-vaxxer; perhaps, she is willing to take other vaccines, but just not the Covid-19 one. In another prime example we often hear the label “climate change denier” (as with the David Suzuki article referenced earlier) when someone doesn’t (either fully or in part) adhere to the notion of climate change. As this particular topic is very broad and complex, labelling one in such a derogatory fashion proves itself as quite foolish. Writers, TV personalities, news pundits, and social media figures may often attack a person when they cannot invalidate or counter the substance or merits of their claims. Some are very adept at it too which takes the victim by surprise and makes them appear stupid or weak. The trick here, is to not take it personal and let it get to you. Rather, either ignore them, or turn the situation around and ask them to elaborate on the merits of why they disagree with your claim or stance, pressing for facts and evidence to substantiate their assertions.

A great question to ask is ‘Cui bono?’ which is Latin for ‘who benefits?’ The phrase originates from the very famous Roman statesman Cicero. Cicero was a brilliant orator, lawyer, philosopher, and politician who lived during the boisterous early years of the Roman Empire when wars, politics, greed, and power dominated the social and political landscapes (as they still do today). One needed to be quite astute in assessing others’ motives based solely on their words and actions. Cicero would often ask this question, cui bono, to better understand the real motivation behind individuals’ or groups’ true intentions. We should do the same, as it seems everyone is out for something to gain. Put simply, we should take some time to question the possible motivations behind what we see, hear, or read.

The Death of Caesar, 1874 steel engraving by J.C. Armytage after J.L. Gérome

In similar fashion, we should also follow the money. This is particularly useful when looking at information related to the financial markets as well as political and geopolitical happenings. Similar to the previous tool, it guides us towards the underlying motivation(s) – most often of a financial nature – behind what someone is saying or doing. They may be saying one thing, but doing another through their actions, whether they are investments, supporting political candidates or causes, donating to charity, etc.

Individuals who have received a classical education often fare much better in how they process information and interact with other people. There are key reasons for this. The first is that in this type of education system, students go through a three-step learning process, or system, which stretches from elementary school to middle-school to high-school. These three learning anchors are: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. The grammar part is not of the ‘spelling & grammar’ kind; rather, it relates to how one inputs information from the outside world. The logic part refers to how one processesthe information obtained. And the rhetoric part is the culmination – being able to communicate and express oneself persuasively. This third part is quite important. Many of the ills and divisions we see in society today is due to the lack of this particular ability. People are far more likely to debate with one another than to have a civil discussion about it.

In classical education, which has its roots from the ancient Greek philosophers, students communicate using discourse (dialectic/Socratic method). In other words, they have a conversation and use logic and reason to arrive at truth. This is a much more constructive means than to debate or argue in a back-and-forth manner whereby each party wants to be right and win. If people in today’s society would be more respectful towards one another and accept differences in views and opinion, then we could find areas of common agreement and would thus have more peace and unity, as opposed to hatred and division.

So, the moral of the story here is that we should make an effort to be polite and respectful towards the views and opinions of others, even if they vary from our own or sound crazy. In doing this, we have a much better chance of making allies and gaining the trust of others. Disagreeing with a person is much different than disagreeing with the contents of what they are saying.

Lastly, here is one more tool that almost all those who receive a classical education learn about – logical fallacies. A logical fallacy, in its simplest form, is a flawed or weak argument or assertion. They are deceptive or false arguments that may seem stronger than they actually are due to psychological persuasion, but are proven wrong with reasoning and further examination. (source) There are many different types oflogical fallacies. An example includes Blind Loyalty:

“The dangerous fallacy that an argument or action is right simply and solely because a respected leader or source (an expert, parents, one’s own “side,” team or country, one’s boss or commanding officers) say it is right. This is over-reliance on authority, a corrupted argument from ethos that puts loyalty above truth or above one’s own reason and conscience. In this case, a person attempts to justify incorrect, stupid or criminal behavior by whining “That’s what I was told to do,” or “I was just following orders.”

We’ve seen the Blind Loyalty fallacy a lot during the Covid-19 Pandemic. We’ve been told to ‘trust the science’, certain experts in the medical field, health organizations, and so on. Just because something comes from a given expert or an authoritative organization doesn’t necessarily mean it is correct. I remember when I came back to Quebec, Canada last November, the health pamphlets from the provincial health authority listed zero possible side-effect or risks associated with the Covid-19 vaccines. As all vaccines have inherent risks, this information provided by this respective authoritative source was not right, or completely accurate. Critical information was omitted.

Guilt by Association is another common logical fallacy. Here, one tries to refute or condemn someone’s standpoint, arguments, or actions by evoking negative sentiments of those with whom they associate with. A classic example of this one came about during President Biden’s controversial speech he gave on Sept. 1, 2022 whereby he rendered a large portion of Americans as dangerous ‘MAGA Republicans’; in other words, he positioned many who consider themselves as Republicans to be Trump supporters and some kind of insurrectionists. In Canada, the mainstream media often associated and labelled those who supported the Freedom Convoy protest movement as far-right extremists.

Many other logical fallacies are employed by those in the media and across social media. These are flawed arguments or assertions that you need to look out for. You need to be able to first recognize them and then you will be in a better position to defend yourself by addressing them for what they are.

Conclusion

So, why does society need conspiracy theories and conspiracy theorists? Well, it‘s no secret that we’ve been lied to. We’ve been lied to about a lot. And we are still being lied to on a daily basis. This makes it much harder to get to the truth.

Knowing more about how conspiracies actually work and how past ones have played out can help us to be more vigilant and question more about our perceived reality. Everything happens in the mind. The better we train our minds, the better we can sift through the rubbish and keep what’s real and authentic while discarding what is not.

Conspiracy theorists are often labelled and demonized – usually because they have demonstrated the courage to speak out, to point out inconvenient or uncomfortable truths. They may lose the support of friends, family, and employers in the process. But they remain true to themselves and who they are at their very core. Therefore, we should encourage them and even strive to duplicate their courage and assertiveness.

Xinhua) 15:36, October 15, 2022

NAIROBI, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- State-owned Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) and Chinese firm, Huawei said Friday they have partnered in order to scale up cyber security skills in the east African nation.

Ezra Chiloba, Director-General of the CA said cyber security is critical since the future of Kenya's economy is going to be driven by the digital space. ""We are working with Huawei, who are bringing on board their expansive experience in this sector, and I want to encourage young people who are undertaking courses and are looking forward to participating in the digital economy to invest their time and resources in understanding the future of cyber security,"" Chiloba said in a statement released in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.

He noted that CA, the telecom industry regulator, and Huawei will jointly set up a special cyber security boot camp for students attending institutions of higher learning across the country.

""The boot camp has attracted more than 1,700 university students across the country. The partnership targets to build capacity amongst technology students to ensure secure networks and cyberspace,"" Chiloba added.

Official statistics indicate that Kenya has just under 2,000 certified cybersecurity professionals against an annual demand of 10,000 experts.

Chiloba also revealed that the three-day intensive training session which is set to run on Oct. 17-19 is one of the highlights of the month-long celebrations to mark national cybersecurity awareness month marked every October.

He observed that the boot camp includes a Huawei certification e-learning course on cyber security, virtual lab exercises, on-site training, and mentorship from experts within the field.

""These jointly structured sessions and courses are geared at preparing participants for a successful career in cybersecurity,"" Chiloba said.

In the decades since Seymour Cray developed what is widely considered the world’s first supercomputer, the CDC 6600 (opens in new tab), an arms race has been waged in the high performance computing (HPC) community. The objective: to enhance performance, by any means, at any cost.

Propelled by advances in the fields of compute, storage, networking and software, the performance of leading systems has increased one trillion-fold since the unveiling of the CDC 6600 in 1964, from the millions of floating point operations per second (megaFLOPS) to the quintillions (exaFLOPS).

The current holder of the crown, a colossal US-based supercomputer called Frontier , is capable of achieving 1.102 exaFLOPS by the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark. But even more powerful machines are suspected to be in operation elsewhere , behind closed doors.

The arrival of so-called exascale supercomputers is expected to benefit practically all sectors - from science to cybersecurity, healthcare to finance - and set the stage for mighty new AI models that would otherwise have taken years to train.

However, an increase in speeds of this magnitude has come at a cost: energy consumption. At full throttle, Frontier consumes up to 40MW (opens in new tab) of power, roughly the same as 40 million desktop PCs .

Supercomputing has always been about pushing the boundaries of the possible. But as the need to minimize emissions becomes ever more clear and energy prices continue to soar, the HPC industry will have to re-evaluate whether its original guiding principle is still worth following.

Performance vs. efficiency

One organization operating at the forefront of this issue is the University of Cambridge, which in partnership with Dell Technologies has developed multiple supercomputers with power efficiency at the forefront of the design.

The Wilkes3 (opens in new tab), for example, is positioned only 100th in the overall performance charts (opens in new tab), but sits in third place in the Green500 (opens in new tab), a ranking of HPC systems based on performance per watt of energy consumed.

In conversation with TechRadar Pro, Dr. Paul Calleja, Director of Research Computing Services at the University of Cambridge, explained the institution is far more concerned with building highly productive and efficient machines than extremely powerful ones.

“We’re not really interested in large systems, because they’re highly specific point solutions. But the technologies deployed inside them are much more widely applicable and will enable systems an order of magnitude slower to operate in a much more cost- and energy-efficient way,” says Dr. Calleja.

“In doing so, you democratize access to computing for many more people. We’re interested in using technologies designed for those big epoch systems to create much more sustainable supercomputers, for a wider audience.”

In the years to come, Dr. Calleja also predicts an increasingly fierce push for power efficiency in the HPC sector and wider datacenter community, wherein energy consumption accounts for upwards of 90% of costs, we're told.

Recent fluctuations in the price of energy related to the war in Ukraine will also have made running supercomputers dramatically more expensive, particularly in the context of exascale computing, further illustrating the importance of performance per watt.

In the context of Wilkes3, the university found there were a number of optimizations that helped to improve the level of efficiency. For example, by lowering the clock speed at which some components were running, depending on the workload, the team was able to achieve energy consumption reductions in the region of 20-30%.

“Within a particular architectural family, clock speed has a linear relationship with performance, but a squared relationship with power consumption. That’s the killer,” explained Dr. Calleja.

“Reducing the clock speed reduces the power draw at a much faster rate than the performance, but also extends the time it takes to complete a job. So what we should be looking at isn’t power consumption during a run, but really energy consumed per job. There is a sweet spot.”

Software is king

Beyond fine-tuning hardware configurations for specific workloads, there are also a number of optimizations to be made elsewhere, in the context of storage and networking, and in connected disciplines like cooling and rack design.

However, asked where specifically he would like to see resources allocated in the quest to improve power efficiency, Dr. Calleja explained that the focus should be on software, first and foremost.

“The hardware is not the problem, it’s about application efficiency. This is going to be the major bottleneck moving forward,” he said. “Today’s exascale systems are based on GPU architectures and the number of applications that can run efficiently at scale in GPU systems is small.”

“To really take advantage of today’s technology, we need to put a lot of focus into application development. The development lifecycle stretches over decades; software used today was developed 20-30 years ago and it’s difficult when you’ve got such long-lived code that needs to be rearchitected.”

The problem, though, is that the HPC industry has not made a habit of thinking software-first. Historically, much more attention has been paid to the hardware, because, in Dr. Calleja’s words, “it’s easy; you just buy a faster chip. You don’t have to think clever”.

“While we had Moore’s Law, with a doubling of processor performance every eighteen months, you didn’t have to do anything [on a software level] to increase performance. But those days are gone. Now if we want advancements, we have to go back and rearchitect the software.”

As Moore's Law begins to falter, advances in CPU architecture can no longer be relied upon as a source of performance improvements. (Image credit: Alexander_Safonov / Shutterstock)

Dr. Calleja reserved some praise for Intel, in this regard. As the server hardware space becomes more diverse from a vendor perspective (in most respects, a positive development), application compatibility has the potential to become a problem, but Intel is working on a solution.

“One differentiator I see for Intel is that it invests an awful lot [of both funds and time] into the oneAPI ecosystem, for developing code portability across silicon types. It’s these kind of toolchains we need, to enable tomorrow’s applications to take advantage of emerging silicon,” he notes.

Separately, Dr. Calleja called for a tighter focus on “scientific need”. Too often, things “go wrong in translation”, creating a misalignment between hardware and software architectures and the actual needs of the end user.

A more energetic approach to cross-industry collaboration, he says, would create a “virtuous circle” comprised of users, service providers and vendors, which will translate into benefits from both a performance and efficiency perspective.

A zettascale future

In typical fashion, with the fall of the symbolic exascale milestone, attention will now turn to the next one: zettascale.

“Zettascale is just the next flag in the ground,” said Dr. Calleja, “a totem that highlights the technologies needed to reach the next milestone in computing advances, which today are unobtainable.”

“The world’s fastest systems are extremely expensive for what you get out of them, in terms of the scientific output. But they are important, because they demonstrate the art of the possible and they move the industry forwards.”

Whether systems capable of achieving one zettaFLOPS of performance, one thousand times more powerful than the current crop, can be developed in a way that aligns with sustainability objectives will depend on the industry’s capacity for invention.

There is not a binary relationship between performance and power efficiency, but a healthy dose of craft will be required in each subdiscipline to deliver the necessary performance increase within an appropriate power envelope.

In theory, there exists a golden ratio of performance to energy consumption, whereby the benefits to society brought about by HPC can be said to justify the expenditure of carbon emissions.

The precise figure will remain elusive in practice, of course, but the pursuit of the idea is itself by definition a step in the right direction.",cybersecurity,techradar

The International Center for Law and Economics (ICLE) released a white paper on Thursday arguing that Section 512 of Title 17 of the Copyright Act has been a failure, and it should be reevaluated and overhauled. Congress passed Section 512 as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and authors Kristian Stout and Geoffrey Manne argue the federal courts have written out key provisions in the law.

Stout and Manne write that Section 512 has succeeded in allowing online service providers (OSPs) such as social media companies to grow and thrive by providing a safe harbor provision as long as they take down infringement promptly. However, the authors argue that the law has failed to provide proper incentives and systems to prevent digital piracy.

The white paper builds on a May 2020 report from the U.S. Copyright Office which found that OSPs found Section 512 to be a success due to the growth it allowed, while on the whole rightsholders were more likely to have a negative view of Section 512. The U.S. Copyright Office “concluded that Congress’s original intended balance has been tilted askew” in favor of OSPs and against rightsholders.

ICLE published the white paper with the goal of offering recommendations to Congress should they choose to revisit the law.

Recommendations

The white paper lays out the case for six potential adjustments to Section 512 that would “better mitigate piracy and offer incentives for OSPs and rightsholders to engage in licensing negotiations.”

The paper’s first recommendation is to “overturn the subjective element of red-flag knowledge” that was set in a 2016 court ruling in favor of the video-sharing platform Vimeo. In that case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Vimeo could not be held liable for copyright infringement despite Vimeo employees viewing videos with copyrighted audio. The ruling was hailed by social media companies, including Facebook, Twitter, and Google, with major record labels arguing for Congress to revise the 1998 Section 512.

Stout and Manne argue that “OSPs that host user-generated content should be attributed more knowledge than an ‘ordinary’ person” and should act against infringement to a higher standard than an ‘uninformed lay person.’”

Secondly, the authors say Section 512 could be reformed to require OSPs to “ensure that they know their users’ identities” to deter users from posting content that infringes content. This change would strengthen OSPs’ ability to cut down on users creating accounts to evade bans related to copyright strikes. While the authors write that “identities could remain confidential, disclosed to third parties only when needed to resolve a case of infringement,” removing anonymity from social media accounts is already a highly controversial topic due to concerns around civil liberties.

Less potentially controversial, the authors’ next proposed, adjustment is to prevent piracy using already existing filtering technology on various platforms. Google and Dropbox have previously implemented this technology to flag copyrighted material and block selected files from being re-uploaded. The authors promote the idea of developing more standard technical measures (STMs) to prevent infringement before it happens. According to the white paper, no STMs have been adopted industry-wide. Therefore, Stout and Manne call on Congress to empower the U.S. Copyright Office to work with OSPs and rightsholders to specify industry-wide STMs that apply filtering technology.

Concerns

The authors also address important privacy concerns related to some of their proposals. These concerns include cybersecurity breaches, privacy, and a chilling effect on free speech. Stout and Manne concede that STMs could cause negative externalities, so STMs should be able to be adapted in such cases to increase good-faith compliance while eliminating flaws.

Another concern for OSPs is the cost of some of these changes. The authors state that while new filtering technology will involve a cost to OSPs, using filtering technology could remove a burden from employees and help streamline the copyright infringement claim process.

The last concern is that of an overreaching filtering process that illegitimately blocks too much content. However, the authors write that “actual false positives—instances where a user has an unambiguous right to use a file (e.g., they are the actual creator or have a license)—are likely to be exceedingly rare.”

The other cases of potential illegitimate content blocks would fall under fair use. The authors cite Katherine Oyama, global director of business public policy for Google, who stated “uploaders disputed less than 1% of the Content ID claims made from January through June 2020.”

While Stout and Manne concede that the percentage of false takedowns may be more than 1%, they believe that since the majority of the claims are not contested, “the social cost of the false positive (erroneous takedown) is presumably not very significant compared to the value of enforcing IP rights.” However, they do not cite how much content constitutes 1% of content ID claims and what negative effect a false positive can have on an uploader.

Final Three Recommendations

Next, the authors move on to the topic of repeat infringers. Section 512 requires OSPs to have policies that remove repeat infringers from their platform, however, Stout and Manne argue that the courts have often ruled “rather loosely” on the policy requirement. To strengthen this provision, they suggest empowering the U.S. Copyright Office to draw up the minimum requirements to fulfill the repeat-infringer policy obligation. In the author’s opinion, this would better protect OSPs’ right to safe harbor while also deterring repeat infringers.

The paper also discusses the difficulty in stopping infringement from websites based outside of the United States even when U.S. courts rule that willful infringement has occurred. In order to resolve the issue, the authors state that Congress should amend Section 512 and grant U.S. courts the authority to issue no-fault injunctions that would require OSPs to block or delist websites that regularly infringe copyright. Currently, more than 40 countries allow no-fault injunctions that disable access to copyright-infringing websites.

The authors’ final recommendation is to strengthen rights-management information. Currently, digital copyrighted files have embedded information that includes details about the copyright holder. If this information is intact, it decreases the likelihood of infringement as it makes it easier for rightsholders to enforce their copyright. But according to the report, some OSPs remove the embedded information. While this is against Section 512, the authors argue that the bar is too high for rightsholders to enforce proper rights-management information. Therefore, the authors once again argue that Congress should amend Section 512 and “make it unlawful to negligently, recklessly, or knowingly remove rights-management information.”

Overall, the ICLE’s white paper is an impassioned plea to Congress to better protect rightsholders by updating Section 512, but it also acknowledges the need to protect OSPs’ right to safe harbors. While the authors are aware that the challenging political environment makes full reform less likely, they state “there are select measures proposed above that we believe could, even standing on their own, provide significant benefit.”

If Elon Musk's deal to buy Twitter closes, the billionaire will have taken the first step toward something he calls ""X,"" his vision for a new kind of social media platform that most in the US haven't experienced before.

An ""everything app,"" as Musk puts it.

The Tesla CEO has said the acquisition will act as ""an accelerant"" to creating X — jump-starting the process by three to five years.

Musk has been talking about building X for months. In August, when a Twitter user asked him whether he had considered creating his own social platform, he replied, ""X.com"" — a web domain he bought over five years ago. At Tesla's annual shareholder meeting that same month, Musk said he had ""a pretty grand vision"" for X as ""something that would be very useful to the world.""

While it's unclear whether Musk plans to turn Twitter into X or use it to build an entirely new platform, the billionaire has dropped several hints regarding his plans to shake up the world of social media.

Here's what he's said publicly — and privately, via recently released text messages — about the idea.

A new super-app

X wouldn't be the first app trying to do a bit of everything. In fact, Musk indicated in May might look for inspiration from Tencent's WeChat, a Chinese social media juggernaut that's one of the largest super-apps in the world.

WeChat acts as an all-encompassing service — from messaging and video chatting to video games, photo sharing, ride services, food delivery, banking, and shopping.

""If you're in China, you kind of live on WeChat,"" he said. ""It does everything — sort of like Twitter, plus PayPal, plus a whole bunch of things, and all rolled into one, with a great interface. It's really an excellent app, and we don't have anything like that outside of China.""

At his first town hall with Twitter staff, the billionaire said there's a ""real opportunity"" to create a similar app outside of China.

""I think if we could achieve that, or even close to that with Twitter, it would be an immense success,"" he said.

Matt Navarra, a top social media consultant, told Insider it wouldn't make sense to gut Twitter and turn it into a super-app, but it could become a sort of ""mini-app"" within Musk's larger platform.

Private texts about a blockchain-based platform

Musk has also discussed creating a social media platform built on a blockchain. The billionaire is known for his love of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

In April, the billionaire privately outlined his idea for a ""Doge"" social media platform in texts to his younger brother, Kimbal Musk. The messages were made public as part of Musk's court battle with Twitter.

""I have an idea for a blockchain social media system that does both payments and short text messages/links like Twitter,"" Musk texted. ""You have to pay a tiny amount to register your message on the chain, which will cut out the vest majority of spam and bots.""

Musk said the site would have a ""massive real-time database"" that would keep permanent copies of messages and followers and a ""Twitter-like app on your phone"" that can access the database in the cloud.

A subscription model

Musk's idea for a blockchain-based platform feed into some of his discussions around Twitter's revenue model.

The billionaire has repeatedly expressed his distaste for ads, but advertising makes up the vast majority of Twitter's revenue. In a since-deleted tweet from April, Musk said the company should exist without ads.

Instead, Musk has talked about making money from Twitter via alternative methods, including charging some users to be on the site. While Twitter has already begun charging some users for special features through Twitter Blue, the Tesla CEO has been critical of it. In April, he said that users of the premium subscription service should pay $3 per month and immediately get a verified account.

The billionaire has also noted the app could help foster payments directly to users, though Twitter launched a ""Tips"" feature last year that includes an option to pay users with Bitcoin.

""It's important for content creators to have a revenue share,"" Musk said at a May event for the ""All-In"" podcast.

The billionaire has also discussed changing Twitter's algorithm and making its code open source, as well as adding an edit button — a feature the site recently enabled for Twitter Blue subscribers.

An emphasis on free speech

Whatever Musk builds, expect it to have a far more free-wheeling free speech policy than Twitter today.

Musk often refers to Twitter as a ""town square"" and has said he is against censorship that ""goes far beyond the law.""

The billionaire has been critical of Twitter's ban on some users, including its permanent ban on former president Donald Trump following the insurrection at the US Capitol. Musk has said he will re-instate Trump if he goes through with the purchase.

Social media expert Navarro said companies are unlikely to want to advertise next to posts that could be labeled as unsavory, but noted it could be a good move for Twitter to diversify its revenue sources.

A battle against bots

One thing is clear throughout Musk's dealings with Twitter — the billionaire's social media platform will be tasked with eliminating scam accounts.

Musk has called bots on Twitter the ""single most annoying problem"" and made the number of scam accounts on the site the centerpiece of his attempts to wiggle out of the purchase months ago.

In an April 14 interview at TED 2022, Musk cited this issue as the first thing he would change as Twitter's new owner — it's fair to expect whatever X ends up being to also focus on eliminating bots.",blockchain,business insider

In August 2021, KrebsOnSecurity published “New Anti Anti-Money Laundering Services for Crooks,” which examined Antinalysis, a service marketed on cybercrime forums that purported to offer a glimpse of how one’s payment activity might be flagged by law enforcement agencies and private companies that track and trace cryptocurrency transactions.

“Worried about dirty funds in your BTC address? Come check out Antinalysis, the new address risk analyzer,” read the service’s opening announcement. “This service is dedicated to individuals that have the need to possess complete privacy on the blockchain, offering a perspective from the opponent’s point of view in order for the user to comprehend the possibility of his/her funds getting flagged down under autocratic illegal charges.”

Antinalysis allows free lookups, but anyone wishing to conduct bulk look-ups has to pay at least USD $3, with a minimum $30 purchase. Other plans go for as high as $6,000 for 5,000 requests. Nick Bax, a security researcher who specializes in tracing cryptocurrency transactions, told KrebsOnSecurity at the time that Antinalysis was likely a clone of AMLBot because the two services generated near-identical results.

AMLBot shut down Antinalysis’s access just hours after last year’s story went live. However, Antinalysis[.]org remains online and accepting requests, as does the service’s Tor-based domain, and it is unclear how those services are sourcing their information.

AMLBot spokesperson Polina Smoliar said the company undertook a thorough review after that discovery, and in the process found two other services similar to Antinalysis that were reselling their application programming interface (API) access to cybercrooks.

Smoliar said that following the revelations about Antinalysis, AMLBot audited its entire client base, and implemented the ability to provide APIs only after a contract is signed and the client has been fully audited. AMLBot said it also instituted 24/7 monitoring of all client transactions.

“As a result of these actions, two more services with the name AML (the same as AMLBot has) were found to be involved in fraudulent schemes,” Smoliar said. “Information about the fraudsters was also sent to key market participants, and their transaction data was added to the tracking database to better combat money laundering.”

The Antinalysis homepage and chatter on the cybercrime forums indicates the service was created by a group of coders known as the Incognito Team. Tom Robinson, co-founder of the blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic, said the creator of Antinalysis is also one of the developers of Incognito Market, a darknet marketplace specializing in the sale of narcotics.

“Incognito was launched in late 2020, and accepts payments in both Bitcoin and Monero, a cryptoasset offering heightened anonymity,” Robinson said. “The launch of Antinalysis likely reflects the difficulties faced by the market and its vendors in cashing out their Bitcoin proceeds.”",blockchain,krebs on security

148,2 Green Flags and 1 Red Flag for Coinbase,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/704586/crypto-trader-making-decision.jpg,15/10/2022,"This last year has been rough for Coinbase, but there could be reasons for optimism.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/15/2-green-flags-and-1-red-flag-for-coinbase/,"There are few other companies that have had as many ups and downs as Coinbase Global (COIN -4.08%) this year. Ranging from partnerships with companies such as investment management giant BlackRock (BLK -2.02%) to coming under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), this battleground stock has much to be hopeful -- and also concerned -- about. Let's take a look at the good and the bad to get a better idea on what to expect from Coinbase in the future.

Green Flag: Institutional investors offer promise

RJ Fulton: It probably isn't well known among its users, but Coinbase also creates products for non-retail investors. Referred to as institutional investors, these investors tend to be large businesses that typically have much more capital at their disposal than retail investors.

Coinbase is attempting to diversify its revenue streams by offering services to these institutional investors. Called Coinbase Prime, this is a solution for institutional investors to trade crypto, research trends, and even integrate with their existing software to provide a seamless trading experience.

Ensuring that institutional investors have access to crypto is a valuable endeavor that can further generate revenue. Institutional investor-trading volume dwarfs that of their retail counterparts. On average over the last year, institutional investors traded more than 40% more than retail investors and peaked at $371 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Despite Coinbase's institutional revenue shrinking by 17% from Q1 2022, the crypto exchange added another 1,500 institutional investors, which now totals more than 14,500. In addition, the number of institutional investors has doubled since Q2 2020.

Of the 1,500 institutional clients added in Q2, one stands out from the rest and could signal a growing trend. In August 2022, the world's largest asset management firm, BlackRock, signed up for Coinbase Prime to integrate with its existing investment management platform, Aladdin. BlackRock's Aladdin software manages more than $21 trillion as of 2020. Yes, trillion, with a capital T.

That $21 trillion is now exposed directly to Coinbase and its crypto products. This isn't to say that all of the $21 trillion will be allocated to crypto, but even if 1% was used for crypto, roughly $210 billion, that would double the total value of institutional assets on Coinbase today.

BlackRock's decision to partner with Coinbase is a by-product of a growing trend among institutional investors -- the desire to trade crypto. If other asset management competitors begin to follow a similar course, which they could if they want to remain competitive with BlackRock, then Coinbase is best positioned to become the primary provider of institutional crypto trading. And that is exactly what Coinbase wants. Their goal is to become the leading institutional crypto broker in the world. If Coinbase can capitalize on this opportunity, then the recent drop in its stock could be viewed as a buying opportunity in preparation for the day this crypto winter ends.

Red Flag: Rising competition

Michael Byrne: To its credit, Coinbase has announced plenty of positive developments in recent weeks. However, it's always important for investors to keep an eye out for any looming threats on the horizon, and Coinbase faces a major challenge in the form of emerging competition from some formidable players.

Many equity market investors think of Coinbase as the 800-pound gorilla in the crypto space because it is the largest and highest-profile publicly traded crypto company. However, Coinbase is not the world's largest crypto exchange; that distinction belongs to Binance, which far outpaces Coinbase in terms of daily volume. Binance has deep pockets and a highly visible CEO in Changpeng Zhao, commonly referred to as ""CZ"" in the crypto industry. Binance's native token, Binance Coin (BNB 1.17%), is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, and its market cap of $43 billion is far larger than Coinbase's market value of $17 billion. Binance is building a presence in the U.S. market with Binance.US.

FTX, led by crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, has been busy making deals and acquiring stakes in other platforms during the crypto winter and is also making a big push into the U.S. market.

FTX was recently in talks to raise $1 billion at a $32 billion valuation, and Bankman-Fried recently became Robinhood's (HOOD -4.36%) largest shareholder when he purchased a 7.6% stake in the company. His investment has led to speculation that there could be a future collaboration between the two companies.

The crypto market is certainly large enough for multiple winners, but the entry of these two power players into the U.S. market is a challenge for Coinbase. Coinbase derives the vast majority of its revenue from transaction fees, but Binance.US announced that they will be offering commission-free trading on Bitcoin (BTC -0.51%), which is the largest cryptocurrency and thus the asset that drives the most trading fees. Whether this is a good move by Binance.US remains to be seen, but it could create fee compression for the entire industry in a ""race to the bottom"" akin to what we saw when traditional brokerages began to eliminate their commissions on trades several years ago.

There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about Coinbase, but this is one looming concern that interested parties would be wise to keep an eye on.

Green flag: Growing subscription and services

Neil Patel: One of the biggest knocks on Coinbase's business model is that the company generates the bulk (81.6% in Q2 2022) of its sales from fees when individual and institutional customers trade various digital assets. Given that the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, falling in and out of favor with investors at the drop of a hat, it shouldn't be a surprise that this makes the business's financials very unpredictable quarter to quarter.

That's why Coinbase's founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong, recently said that he wants 50% of the company's revenue to come from subscriptions and services one day, compared to 18.4% in the latest quarter. This segment, which increased sales 43.7% year over year in Q2, makes money primarily from blockchain rewards, mainly consisting of staking revenue, and custodial fees. Ethereum's (ETH -2.05%) completion of The Merge, transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, should help grow the revenue Coinbase makes from blockchain rewards.

In their short history thus far, cryptocurrencies have been characterized mostly as a tool for financial speculation. And this can't be a shock to anyone. Some digital assets have produced monster returns in extremely short periods of time, encouraging a gambling mentality. And once interest fades, as it quickly does, asset prices tank.

Management, therefore, understands that in order to boost the long-term prospects of the business, they need to help usher in the next phase of cryptocurrencies, one that is dominated by the utility as opposed to pure profit-seeking behavior. A particularly interesting offering, called Coinbase Cloud, is a tool that third-party developers can use to build blockchain-based applications without the need to create their own complex and expensive infrastructure. And it could prove to be a major winner for Coinbase to diversify its revenue stream over time.",blockchain,motley fool
149,'Baby Al Capone' to pay $22m to SIM-swap crypto-heist victim,https://regmedia.co.uk/2022/10/15/shutterstock_sim_crowbar.jpg,15/10/2022,"Too young to drive, old enough to bribe AT&T staff, apparently
A man who lost $24 million in cryptocurrency in an elaborate SIM swapping scam has won a multi-million-dollar judgment against the thief, who was 15 at the time of the hustle.…",https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/15/pinsky_terpin_sim_swap/,"A man who lost $24 million in cryptocurrency in an elaborate SIM swapping scam has won a multi-million-dollar judgment against the thief, who was 15 at the time of the hustle.

According to court documents [PDF] filed Friday in a federal New York City court, Ellis Pinsky agreed to pay Michael Terpin $22 million for his starring role in the SIM swap and crypto heist. Pinsky was a New York high school student at the time of the theft in 2018, and it's said he paid back $2 million about a year later to his victim.

Pinsky, now 20, has also agreed to testify against AT&T, according to Terpin. In a LinkedIn post earlier today, the blockchain investor told his followers of his civil lawsuit win:

[Pinsky] will be held responsible for $22 million (the amount he and his fellow gang members stole, minus a $2 mm credit for paying us back a small portion in 2019). Equally importantly is his agreement to provide evidence and testimony against AT&T in our upcoming May 2023 trial in federal court in Los Angeles.

Pinsky has not, to the very best of our knowledge, been charged with any crime, and it's presumed this is because he was a minor at the time of the theft, and because he cooperated immediately with the Feds a couple of years ago when investigators homed in on him. In a Rolling Stone interview over the summer, Pinsky – dubbed Baby Al Capone by the media – admitted he swiped millions in crypto-coins from Terpin via a SIM swap.

According to that article, Pinsky said he wrote a Python script that would search social media for people who appeared to work for cellular networks, and would privately message them. Pinsky would, we're told, offer those employees a small amount of Bitcoin to perform SIM swaps, aka port outs.

This basically reassigns a victim's phone number to the SIM in the scammer's phone so that the scammer receives that number's calls and texts. Once that happens, the crook can request a password reset for the target's webmail account, with the one-time verification code texted to the thief. Now in control of the email account and phone number, the thief can start going through all of the victim's online accounts and apps, resetting passwords with the links and texts going to the webmail or hijacked phone number, logging in, and stealing any (say) cryptocurrencies found.

Which, according to Pinsky, is what he did to Terpin: after an AT&T worker did the SIM swap, he and an accomplice found a file in an Outlook account loaded with crypto wallet information, which was then used to siphon off the money. Specifically, it's claimed, Pinksy and his co-conspirator stole 3 million TRIG coins, each worth more than $7 at the time, and laundered them into Bitcoins. TRIG has since crashed to less than 20 cents a coin.

The other side

Terpin sued AT&T for $240 million in 2018 for repeatedly failing to protect his cellphone from the teenage scammer. It's been a long, drawn-out case, full of legal maneuvering on both sides, but here's the gist of what Terpin said happened to his phone — and in court rooms since then.

According to Terpin's first lawsuit [PDF], in June 2017 a fraudster posing as Terpin convinced an AT&T employee at a store in Connecticut to transfer Terpin's phone number to another SIM card — after 11 earlier attempts at the scam in other stores had failed.

The miscreant then used his access to Terpin's phone number to gain access to his cryptocurrency holdings, and transferred millions of dollars to a different account.

Terpin complained to AT&T, and the carrier agreed to put additional security policies in place where any future changes would require someone to not only provide ID but also supply a special six-digit code that only he and his wife knew.

Despite this, in January 2018, fraudsters again hijacked his phone number and, again, broke into his cryptocurrency accounts, ultimately stealing $24 million worth of digital coins. ""The purloined telephone number was accessed to hack Mr Terpin's accounts, resulting in the loss of nearly $24 million of cryptocurrency coins,"" the lawsuit stated.

In February 2020, a judge dismissed AT&T's effort to dismiss the case, noting that Terpin had provided sufficient proof that the US telco giant should defend its position in front of a jury.

Later that year, a judge threw out a $200 million damages claim Terpin had filed against AT&T, but allowed the rest of the case to move forward. It is slated for a federal court in Los Angeles in May.

Interestingly enough, Pinsky told Rolling Stone he returned all he could from the Terpin heist – 562 Bitcoins, his share of the spoils with his co-conspirator – a couple of years ago when he realized the jig was up. In 2020, that BTC would be worth $2 million, which Terpin alluded to in his statement above. At their peak in November last year, those Bitcoins would be worth about $40 million, and today: about $11 million. In any case, Pinksy's now agreed to pay Terpin, one way or another, $22 million. ®",blockchain,theregister.com

China Focused on Blockchain Use Cases and CBDC Despite Crypto Ban

While China banned all crypto trading in 2021, the second most powerful country in the world has been actively exploring the use of blockchain technology, with the Chinese government approving multiple blockchain projects.

China has been particularly interested in central bank digital currency (CBDC) and has made significant developments in that area in recent years. The Chinese government has been even issuing digital yuan loans to local companies, allowing it to expand its oversight over businesses in the country.

Earlier this week, reports showed that one-third of China’s CBDC bridge pilot project transactions originate from businesses in Shenzen. In September, the central bank of Hong Kong also said it expects to roll out a wholesale CBDC in 2-3 years.

The Holy Grail Of Energy Generation

The promise of nuclear fusion is no longer a pipe dream. A virtually limitless energy source that doesn’t produce greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive waste — a clean and safe way to power our homes and industry. This ‘holy grail’ of energy — or the physical process which powers the sun — has eluded practical application for decades, but there are signs that a bright future might be on the horizon. I couldn't think of a better person to help us deep dive into this fascinating space than Yiannis Ventikos, co-founder of First Light Fusion and Kennedy Professor of Mechanical Engineering and the Head of the Mechanical Engineering Department at University College London. In 2011, Yiannis and Nick Hawker started First Light Fusion, a spin-off from the University of Oxford, with the vision to solve the problem of fusion power with the simplest machine possible. To do that they have raised over $100m and put together a world-class team of researchers and engineers. We learn:

what is fusion power and how it’s generated

how different teams around the world try to get energy gain from fusion

the pathway to the first fusion powerplant by First Light Fusion

why humanity needs to substantially increase its clean energy expenditure to reverse environmental damage

how we can transform our planet’s energy mix in a clean and sustainable way

Let’s get to it!

Yianni, I appreciate you taking the time. It’s great to have you here. What we’re going to discuss today is so fascinating and potentially game-changing for energy generation. So let's start with the basics. What is fusion power?

YV: Alex, it is really a pleasure to be here! So, fusion is the set of processes — physical processes — that powers the sun and all the stars. It is the only primordial source of energy in the universe because every other source of energy we currently have is a cascade of that first type of energy generation. How does it work? As you know, when you have particles, atoms, molecules that are charged with charges of the same sign, positively or negatively, they tend to repel each other. This is because of Coulomb's law (like charges repel each other, while opposite charges attract each other). So if you have two nuclei, which are comprised of protons and neutrons, you cannot get them close together as they repel each other due to this same positive charge repulsion. In order for them to get close, you need to move them towards each other at very high speeds. When this happens, other types of forces that exist in our universe take over, and the nuclei merge, they fuse, as they say. The bigger the nuclei, the more difficult it is to do that, so it’s easier with the smallest one — the hydrogen nuclei. Some isotopes of hydrogen, especially deuterium, which is a proton and a neutron, or tritium, a proton and two neutrons, when they have enough velocity to get close together, they fuse. And what they release are neutrons that go very fast. Now, the important thing here is that this neutron kinetic energy that is released could be energy that we can harvest. This is what we mean by fusion energy: capturing energy from particles that are shed at very high velocity from fusing.

There are three boxes we need to tick, in order to overcome this repulsion I mentioned before and get the nuclei very close. And this is not an easy feat. We need high temperature (think a hundred million degrees), high density (have a lot of these nuclei in a very small space), and keep the nuclei in that small space long enough for them to “react”. The sun achieves that by having a lot of gravity which keeps everything in place, compressing it. We cannot replicate this on earth, so fusion experiments attempt to satisfy these rules through different means.

When most people hear about nuclear energy, they think of radioactive waste disposal, radiation-releasing nuclear accidents, and nuclear weapons. We associate nuclear with fission, not fusion. Can you explain how fusion is different?

YV: Both are physical processes that produce massive amounts of energy from atoms. But, fission is the exact opposite of fusion. Instead of fusing nuclei together, you split a big and heavy one into smaller nuclei. This process releases some of the energy that was there, keeping them together. And this is a lot of energy. It's very substantial amounts that people can harvest to produce electricity, as they do in existing nuclear reactors nowadays. I should say that, although the comparison is not entirely fair, fusion produces a lot more energy than fission per unit mass that “burns” completely.

Even though research into fusion reactors started years ago, we still haven’t created a design that’s efficient in a way that produces more energy than the reaction consumes. So we’re still not at the stage where fusion power can serve as an efficient form of energy generation for humanity. Why is that?

YV: I believe that research on fusion initially started for military applications. People thought that if we can get so much energy output from a fission bomb, maybe we can get even more output from a fusion bomb, and eliminate some of the adverse negative effects such as the amount of radiation. That was the idea. At some point, people realised that by scaling this down, we could take it to a size where the actual reaction is not a catastrophic gigantic explosion, but something that can be contained and harvested. Then, of course, the most obvious thing to do was to start small and build up. Several projects fall under this premise such as Tokamak, JET (the Joint European Torus) or NIF (National Ignition Facility). This has been going on since the 1960s and 1970s with some very big efforts being put in place in the 1990s. Finally, in the last decades, there have been many more teams working on fusion, including not only government-led but also private companies.

Now, you have to understand that fusion is a genuinely very difficult problem, which has required substantial advances in our understanding of physics and engineering. The physics is challenging, but at the same time, the engineering part for harvesting fusion is not obvious at all. Let me explain what I mean by that. One of the most promising facilities where people try to break the “gain equals one” barrier (produce more power than what is put in) is the National Ignition Facility in the US. The initial investment was around 4 billion dollars. This facility has close to 200 of the most powerful lasers on Earth and putting them together in a perfect alignment to shoot at a very particular sequence on a tiny pellet of deuterium and tritium mixture held at cryogenic conditions — this makes for a highly complex experiment! Let’s assume that everything works perfectly and we get energy gain from this — so the difficult science part is done. Well, how do you capture and convert those neutrons flying out, wanting to crash into everything on their way, into electricity? The energy is there, but how do you make something useful out of it (which could then be used for power generation)? This is the hard engineering part. If you add those up, you realise why this has taken so many years and it’s still work in progress.

Only recently, I would say in the last 10 years, people have started thinking in genuine commercial terms with private companies — including our own venture, First Light Fusion — entering the game, taking risks and acting way faster, away from bureaucratic procedures and big government operations. What happened in this industry, as it happened in other industries in the past as well, was that big government experiments around the world produced basic knowledge and understanding, and then smaller agile companies are taking this knowledge onboard and converting it into engineering that may mean something commercially interesting. An industry where this worked very well is the space industry, right? Decades ago the only actors were NASA and ESA. Now, when someone thinks of space the first thing that comes to mind is SpaceX. This is probably the best of both worlds and is the way things are going to move the fastest.

Let’s zoom into First Light Fusion now. You achieved fusion in the lab some months ago (source) and the result was validated by the UK Atomic Energy Authority. Can you share more about the progress your team has made and what makes First Light’s design different from other teams?

YV: Let me first point out that First Light is a very scientifically oriented organisation. A result might have been achieved months or years before it’s reported as we want to make sure that there’s no hidden weirdness anywhere. That an experiment can be repeatable, that we can get exactly what the simulations are producing, and that we can have external validation. So as I started saying before, First Light, is a company that follows a fresh, agile approach. We built our first major pulse power machine in under a year, whereas a government entity would need five years and 10 times the cost for a similar outcome.

Inside First Light’s lab in Oxford

In a nutshell, the way our technology works is that we have an entity, let’s call it a cavity or a bubble, that has the fusion fuel (a mixture of deuterium and tritium) in it. We use a mass (we call it the projectile), like a small flyer plate, that is shot from a machine and is given a very high velocity. This object flies and impacts on the material that is holding the fule cavity I mentioned before. This impact generates a very intense shock wave, which is a jump in pressure. Through some very advanced and smart application of hydrodynamics, this shockwave is amplified and shaped in such a way that it makes the fuel cavity collapse in a very intense way. This amplified collapse is so strong that it creates fusion conditions (check this animation here). Right now, we achieve velocities of 20km/sec — 20km/sec is fast, right? You’d go from one side of Athens to the other in a second or two if you were to fly that fast.

We have different ways to achieve very high projectile velocities. One way is a very big two-stage gas gun, which can reach velocities of 7km/h or 8 km/h. The most exciting machine we use though is a pulse power machine with hundreds of very big capacitors that store electricity. This machine can accelerate a small piece of metal from 0 to 20km/sec within a distance of 2cm. I don’t even know how big that acceleration is. It might be a billion g (a billion times the acceleration due to gravity).

A lot of interesting things happen when it comes to shaping and amplifying the original shock wave into something that can achieve very intense bubble collapse conditions, and this is also where a big part of our IP and trade secrets are involved. Remember what we said in the beginning? That to optimise the fusion result, we need high temperature, high density, and maintain these conditions long enough. We continue to finetune all those aspects, so we can generate more power than what’s required and break the “gain equals one” barrier. This is easier said than done if you think that this process takes nanoseconds, temperatures are at the level of 20, 30 or 50 million degrees, etc. You can actually see First Light's reactor concept animated in the following video.

Machine 3, First Light’s pulsed power device. It’s capable of discharging up to 200,000 volts and in excess of 14 million ampere – the equivalent of nearly 500 simultaneous lightning strikes – within two microseconds

What are the next steps for First Light Fusion?

YV: Ok, so even if we do fantastically well with the existing machines we still cannot achieve “gain equals one”. They are not powerful enough to go to gain. So at the same time, we are designing the new machine, which is going to be a hundred times bigger in terms of what it can do, compared to the ones we have and will increase the speed at which the projectile hits the target. We need to go maybe 2, 3, or 4 times faster than where we are now. To come up with these targets we have run a huge amount of simulations to confirm what we expect to see. And this is something we do religiously at First Light — we use the power of computer simulations to inform our decision-making process.

A big milestone is of course to demonstrate a “gain experiment”, where roughly speaking, the energy that you take out of the experiment is more than the energy that you put in. Then you start incorporating those design principles into a reactor, which is the next big step towards having the first fusion powerplant. In fact, the technology we are thinking of can be retrofitted into an existing powerplant. All you’d have to do is replace the combustion component, where the fossil fuel combustion takes place nowadays and might be natural gas, coal or oil that burns and produces steam, with the fusion island.

Let’s assume that we’ll soon have energy gain from fusion and we’ll soon have fusion reactors, right? What’s the best way to think about its potential to transform the world's energy mix?

YV: If we compare fusion to other forms of energy generation, in terms of energy density, it’s really at the forefront due to the core physics that produces the energy. There’s no comparison really — fusion is extremely energy dense and excellent for baseload production. The question that we have put a lot of effort to answer is whether there will be enough demand for fusion energy so that the capital investment required to create fusion power plants makes sense. Based on our analysis, this is a definitive yes and I can explain where this confidence comes from. How will the energy market behave 10, 20, 30 years from now? If you take the most optimistic scenario for renewables deployment and at the same time the most conservative scenario of the world’s energy requirements, for some countries, the gap is going to be around 30% - 40% or more. And this is a huge gap. For instance, think of a country such as India, where it might need 40% more electricity than it can have, even if full and best use of traditional renewables happens. This gap will end up being covered by existing “dirty” power generation options — coal, in most cases. Unless something like fusion comes in to provide the capacity to bridge this gap in energy requirements, all the targets we are setting for greenhouse emissions go down the drain.

I know this is a million-dollar question, but I’ll go ahead and make it anyway — have we crossed the point of no return when it comes to global emissions?

YV: Now, this is completely speculative but this is where I think the world is going. There is almost an accepted dogma that says that if we reduce our emissions and achieve our net zero targets, we can stop or possibly reverse climate change. I believe this is far from reality. We will realize more and more that in order to reverse the damage we have done, passive measures to reduce CO2 emissions are not enough by themselves. We have to do this for sure, we must absolutely strive to achieve net zero as soon as possible, but in my pessimistic maybe view that is not enough. Even if we were to stop CO2 emissions completely today, you know, civilization switches off 100%, that's not enough. I think that we will need to take active measures in order to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Some of them will be very “green”, for instance, increasing the planet’s forest coverage. But, I suspect that we are going to need to do a lot more in terms of CO2 capture by doing things that are very energy intensive. To make a long story short, in order to reverse the damage we've already done, we will need to increase the energy expenditure substantially — sounds almost like a paradox. And this cannot be done without very clean and sustainable energy, otherwise, it's pointless. One of the ways to do this is of course fusion.

So I really think that within the next 10 to 20 years, fusion will have an indispensable and irreplaceable role to play in our energy mix.

Yianni, thank you so much for taking the time, it was great to talk to you!

YV: Thanks Alex, it was a pleasure!

154,Digital LeBron vs. analog Mantle: Sports collectibles remain hot despite NFT boom,"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/221014-mickey-mantle-baseball-card-mn-1140-3e49a1.jpg",15/10/2022,"In the sports collectibles world, cardboard is still king — for now.",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/digital-lebron-vs-analog-mantle-sports-collectibles-remain-hot-nft-boo-rcna51863,"In the sports collectibles world, cardboard is still king — for now.

Despite the boom and subsequent semi-bust of digital sports collectibles in the past couple of years, the world of tangible sports collectibles — cards, jerseys, memorabilia and all things in between — has remained hot. The record for most ever paid for sports memorabilia has been broken three times this year, though prices for some popular cards have dipped from their peaks in 2020 and 2021.

That market has been boosted by a thriving online content industry surrounding sports cards and memorabilia. Dozens of YouTube channels, podcasts and TikTok accounts track the market, with some offering a way for people to purchase cards, jerseys and even autographed football helmets.

That’s fueled some optimism that NFTs, or non-fungible tokens (blockchain-based tokens tied to digital art) aren’t set to replace the thrill of opening a pack of cards anytime soon.

“I would say the future is 100% tangible,” said Mike Heffner, CEO of Lelands, a sports auction house that approaches $50 million in revenue a year. “With an NFT, I don’t understand it; I just don’t see how that can bring the same thrill to someone.”

Sports NFTs did have their moment. Sales soared during the pandemic, and Deloitte Global projected that they would generate $2 billion in U.S. transactions this year, almost double that of 2021. But amid a crypto winter, the future trajectory of the sports memorabilia market, tangible or NFT, is being disputed.

Heffner said his company has attempted a couple of NFT deals that didn’t work out and now exclusively does tangible item auctions. He doesn’t plan to head into the NFT space anytime soon.

The trading card resurgence quickly built upon itself at the start of the pandemic. With live sports stalled, many restless sports fans nostalgically searched their attics to check in on the value of a past hobby. Stirred by viral TikTok and YouTube videos of collectors opening packs of valuable cards, some dusted off well-conditioned cards that sold for thousands of dollars, and a few for millions.

One of the largest auction houses for sports memorabilia, Goldin Auctions, raked in $100 million in 2020 sales and more than triple that in 2021.

Meanwhile, the success of NBA Top Shot, arguably the most successful sports NFT market, soared and eventually crashed. The platform — run by Dapper Labs, a blockchain startup that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding — boasted around 180,000 unique buyers in March 2021, according to data from NFT tracker CryptoSlam. In August 2022, that number dipped to less than 10,000 buyers. The prices of Top Shot NFTs followed a similar trajectory.

“Much like crypto, sports NFTs were driven by so much concern over money and value,” said Darren Rovell, a sports business reporter for Action Network and devoted sports ticket collector.

There was the initial cultural and internet craze for sports NFTs, but love for the item kept the tangible market thriving, and that is where the focus is now, Rovell said.

“I’m just not convinced that there was a lot of enjoyment with [NFTs],” he said.

Some collectors saw tangible assets as a more stable financial investment than their digital analogs.

“The tangible pieces continue to hold strong, hold their value, even rise in value, while the NFT market has pulled back quite significantly,” said Chris Ivy, president and founder of the sports division of Heritage Auctions, who oversaw the record-breaking $12.6 million sale of a Mickey Mantle baseball card in August.

There’s a place for NFTs in the market, but it’s with a new type of collector, said Ivy, who has been with Heritage Auctions for 22 years. “Traditional collectors want the tangible item,” he said.

Millennials are driving the NFT market, according to a Morning Consult survey that found 42% of all NFT collectors are 26 to 40 years old.

Some are still keen to capitalize on the NFT sports market and view it as the future of sports memorabilia sales due in part to the endorsement of all-star athletes.

In September, baseball Hall of Famer Derek Jeter launched Arena Club, a sports card collecting company that attempts to bridge the physical and digital sports card spaces by allowing users to send in their cards to be represented in a personalized digital showroom.

NFL quarterback Tom Brady, who last year co-founded Autograph — a sports NFT company that gives users the chance to purchase digital assets that have been signed by athletes like LeBron James and Steph Curry, and even nonsports celebrities like Quentin Tarantino and Paris Hilton — launched a fan club experience last month that gives digital token owners access to exclusive watch parties and a chance to meet Brady himself.

“Sports and NFTs just make sense as a combination,” said Ethan McMahon, an economist at Chainalysis, a company that monitors blockchain data. “There’s just so much that can be done with digital technology … not only ownership, but membership, and that’s just something the tangible side doesn’t offer you.”

McMahon said the drop-off in transaction volume of sports NFTs was proportionally less than the entire NFT market experienced during the crypto winter. He estimated that revenue of sports NFTs is currently around $50 million per month and has been consistent since November 2021.

Much of the issue is maturity of the market, McMahon said. NFT collections will often launch with skyrocketing sales that later fizzle down to more standard price points.

“A collection may have a hot start but it’s hard to have a sustained level of activity, but that’s not to say the activity isn’t happening in other places within sports,” he said.

Some sports market experts argue that regardless of an NFT bounce back, tangibles and NFTs in the sports memorabilia market don’t compete with each other.

“I don’t think that [NFTs] are going to eat into the physical memorabilia market,” said Pete Giorgio, leader of Deloitte Consulting’s global and U.S. sports practice, who tracks and forecasts the sports memorabilia market. “The person who is buying an NFT is not necessarily the person who is buying Michael Jordan’s game-worn jersey.”

Like many attempting to forecast what is to come, Giorgio predicted that the future of sports memorabilia is likely made up of both markets.

“I do think it will still be a mix,” he said. “I do think the tangible and digital will both play a part in it.”",blockchain,nbc news
155,Magic Eden Launches $1 Million Hackathon to Innovate on NFT Creator Monetization and Royalty Tools,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MMzRMTU1sauUNMwsNs9SfQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz00MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/003bdf5ae5c1c9d33f82826bf3cc79b2,15/10/2022,"In response to the growing trend away from static creator royalties, Magic Eden, the leading cross-chain NFT platform, today announced that it would be...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magic-eden-launches-1-million-023000088.html,"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to the growing trend away from static creator royalties, Magic Eden, the leading cross-chain NFT platform, today announced that it would be introducing a Creator Monetization Hackathon with up to $1M investment to support the development of pro-NFT royalties and alternative monetization tools on Solana.

Magic Eden (PRNewsfoto/Magic Eden)

As a platform committed to equally serving both collectors and creators, Magic Eden is ready to offer resourcing that will allow creators to contend with a rapidly changing market. With the $1M Creator Monetization Hackathon, Magic Eden will be fostering the creation of new creator business models as well as collaborating with partners to develop tools that support a sustainable creator ecosystem.

Magic Eden CEO and Co-Founder Jack Lu commented on today's news: ""We've recently experienced seismic shifts in the NFT ecosystem. The movement away from creator royalties has been an unfortunate trend, but one that seems inevitable given that royalties are not enforceable at the protocol level. It is a trend that we are hoping can be reversed long-term. To accelerate new innovations on creator business models and royalty protecting tools, we are running a $1M Hackathon with the community to develop new creator royalties tools that will protect and support creators. We believe this initiative will help us continue to champion a creator-centric business. Our hope is that this is a temporary circumstance and that royalties return as a consistently viable business model in the future.""

For NFT creators, the potential to receive regular royalties from future sales has attracted thousands of talented creatives to enter the web3 space. Since royalties are not enforceable on the blockchain, and, in practice, are only payable at the discretion of the platform and collector, users are increasingly opting to purchase NFTs on platforms that allow them to bypass royalty fees. Effective today, Magic Eden will also be enabling optional royalties on their platform and allowing NFT buyers to opt into full, half, or no royalties. The Creator Monetization Hackathon will help reduce the business impact felt during this transition to an optional creator royalty model and will also incubate tools that will protect royalty revenue and explore new models of monetization.

Story continues

It is evident that creators need alternative monetization tools and the second part of the Creator Monetization Hackathon will help cover the initial costs of experimentation for creators. In lieu of royalties, creators at this time can explore holding a portion of their supply to introduce back to the market later or set up their own liquidity pools. Top projects can also be able to explore ancillary revenue streams with Boots, a protocol that allows users to customize trait/skins-based SFTs (semi-fungible tokens) for their existing NFTs. Creators who have a compelling monetization model or are exploring royalty protection tools will be able to apply to the hackathon for grant money and investment support.

156,It’s time for the feds to define digital commodities,https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjItMTAvOTRkM2Y0YjMtODdlMS00ZTYzLTk3MjYtYzJjNGY5YmU5NTYxLmpwZw==.jpg,15/10/2022,Europe will leave the United States behind unless lawmakers act to provide clear regulatory definitions for cryptocurrencies.,https://cointelegraph.com/news/it-s-time-for-the-feds-to-define-digital-commodities,"This month, the European Union (EU) agreed on the text for a unified licensing regime for cryptocurrency exchanges to operate across the EU bloc as part of its Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA). The United States — despite being a traditional global leader in legal frameworks for technological innovation — has not provided that same regulatory clarity.

National cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. are regulated at the state level through a patchwork of money transmission laws that overburden companies while under-protecting consumers. In our view, many digital tokens are properly characterized as digital commodities rather than securities. Yet, a unified federal regime for cryptocurrency exchanges listing digital commodities does not exist.

To create one, Congress must pass legislation that clearly defines “digital commodity” and creates jurisdiction for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to supervise national digital commodities exchanges. Recent bipartisan bills addressing the topic suggest that this achievement may be within reach.

Don’t let a thousand flowers bloom at the state level

The individual states, rather than the federal government, are the primary regulators of cryptocurrency exchanges and other online payment providers under the rubric of money transmitters — a category of businesses that traditionally contemplate money wire providers with brick-and-mortar locations in the state.

These laws are aimed at ensuring that money transmitters do not lose, steal or misdirect a customer’s money and impose penalties on those who do.

Related: Biden‘s anemic crypto framework offered nothing new

Because cryptocurrency exchanges have customers across the country, they must understand and abide by the unique money transmission statute of every state.

Letting a thousand flowers bloom in “state laboratories of experimentation” may spur legal innovation in some contexts, but it is a poor fit with cross-border networked goods like money transmission. As a result, state-by-state licensing of modern money transmitters is inefficient, burdensome and under-protective.

More importantly, money transmission laws are not designed to protect consumers from market manipulation in spot trading of speculative digital assets among millions of people as occurs on cryptocurrency exchanges.

In that regard, the Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated that exchanges listing digital securities should be treated as national securities exchanges, which would bring them under the investor protection regime of the securities laws.

However, the question of whether tokens currently listed on domestic exchanges are securities remains unanswered and is vigorously contested in the courts. Coinbase insists that it does not list securities — end of story.

Tokens that are not securities would appear to fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC as commodities. However, the CFTC’s supervisory authority extends only to derivative markets for commodity tokens and not to spot markets, including exchanges, where it has only investigative and policing powers.

Using a comprehensive definition of “digital commodity,” Congress can create jurisdiction for the CFTC to supervise spot markets and address market concerns — such as investor disclosures, market transparency, fraud, manipulation and insider trading — present on exchanges. At the same time, it can establish unified licensing rules relating to the role of exchanges as custodians and payment providers.

A unified federal regime to rule them all

With legislators from both parties taking up federal crypto regulation, the time is ripe for Congress to act. We believe that a federal “digital commodity” regime that, among other things, governs domestic cryptocurrency exchanges should accomplish at least three major goals.

First, it must clearly disentangle a “digital commodity” from a security by making clear that while an investment scheme involving digital assets (usually the initial sale) triggers the application of the securities laws, the object of that scheme is more often a digital commodity rather than a security. That distinction underscores the novelty of blockchain technology: that tokens are intended to outlast their issuer and to be traded among the community of users of the blockchain outside any initial investment scheme.

Distinguishing digital commodities from securities in this way is not only correct as a matter of securities law but is also critical for maintaining a sustainable blockchain ecosystem in the United States. Treating parties engaged in standard commercial transactions involving tokens as broker-dealers transacting in securities would chill user growth and lead to the de-listing of many popular tokens like Axie Infinity Shard (AXS) from Coinbase. The Gillibrand-Lummis bill is one draft proposal pending before Congress in which the text purports to disentangle “ancillary assets” from their investment schemes. This conceptual distinction is a step in the right direction.

Second, a CFTC-supervised regime of digital commodities exchanges should provide meaningful consumer protections appropriate for cryptocurrency exchanges. While treating tokens as securities and restricting them from flowing on the blockchain and trading on the secondary market in the United States would be fatal, failing to clearly and adequately address market abuses and manipulation in an industry that was valued at $3 trillion last year is similarly unacceptable. In this regard, the EU’s MiCA could be instructive.

Third and finally, any new digital commodities regime must not unduly burden industry actors and respect their constitutional rights. In August, senators introduced the bipartisan Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act of 2022, which aims to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges as CFTC-supervised commodities brokers, dealers, custodians and trading facilities. While this renewed attention from lawmakers was welcome, it raised fresh concerns about overreach and unintended consequences on constitutionally protected activity (e.g., publishing software and relaying transaction messages) and on persons who are merely buying and selling cryptocurrencies on their own accounts.

The appearance of ambitious digital asset legislation, such as MiCA, gives the United States and its domestic industry the opportunity to learn from legal approaches in other countries before they become the standard globally. (MiCA will not take effect until 2024.) It is also a reminder that the maturing blockchain industry is driving legal innovation in other markets. On the critical topic of regulating digital commodities exchanges, the United States has not been left in the dust, at least not yet, but it is undeniably playing catch-up.

However, web services are nothing new and typically take the form of an application programming interface (API). The Web is a collection of related hypertext materials that may be accessed online. For example, a user examines web pages that may contain multimedia using a web browser and uses hyperlinks to move between them.

Tim Berners-Lee, who was employed by CERN, The European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva, Switzerland, invented the Web in 1989. Since then, Berners-Lee has actively directed the development of web standards and has pushed for the creation of the Semantic Web, also called Web3.

The phrase “Web3” is used to characterize multiple evolutions of web interaction and usage along various paths, including creating a geospatial web, utilizing artificial intelligence tools and making content available through numerous non-browser apps or Web3 browsers. A Web3 browser introduces users to a new world of decentralized apps (DApps) and digital economies.

This article will discuss Web3 fundamentals, key features of a Web3 browser, how a Web3 browser works and how to use one.

What is a Web3 browser?

Web3 browsers help users interact with decentralized applications built on blockchain technology. Web3 technologies like distributed ledgers, artificial intelligence, Metaverse and others aim to create the next-generation internet, which is accessible to everyone and offers benefits.

READ ALSO The key technologies that power the Metaverse

Key features of a Web3 browser include:

Immutable ecosystem, i.e., trust that people will download the digital product just as the original creator intended.

Enhanced transparency and security,

Quicker browsing performance,

Complete user anonymity and confidentiality,

Integrating cryptocurrency wallets with multiple blockchains,

Complete control over the content due to decentralization.

Furthermore, search engines can find microcontent texts automatically tagged in Web3, calling for converting countless macro Web1 content into microcontent. Because tagging can somewhat eliminate the uncertainty that homonyms and synonyms introduce to the search process, the end result may be a more accurate search.

How does a Web3 browser work?

The world of DApps and digital economies is made available by Web3 internet browsers. By leveraging cryptography and public blockchains, the Web3 browser places control with users, wiping out centralized institutions. Additionally, consumers are rewarded financially for interacting with content or viewing carefully selected adverts on decentralized social media platforms and Web3 browsers.

But, how do Web3 browsers change the online experience? Web3 browsers enable users to use the standard functionality of browsers. They are essentially decentralized applications that allow users to retain ownership of their data and share its revenue. So, is Chrome a Web3 browser? No, Chrome is a Web2 browser like Firefox and Safari. However, users can access Web3 applications with Web2 browsers using a Web3 wallet like MetaMask.

How to use a Web3 browser?

The Web3 wallets can be incorporated into traditional web browsers, providing DApp browser functionality by allowing flexible access to decentralized applications without the assistance of other intermediaries while still maintaining full ownership of their assets. In addition, users can access the Web3 economy without going through any Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures.

Moreover, crypto assets can be stored and managed effectively using Web3 wallets. However, if one loses their seed phrase, they may lose funds, unlike centralized custodial wallets. So, which Web3 browser would be suitable for your requirements? Let’s learn about various Web3 internet browsers in the sections below.

Opera Web3 browser

Both crypto-curious and blockchain-savvy users may enjoy a seamless, private and secure Web3 experience with Opera Crypto Browser with features such as phishing protection, a secure clipboard, a malicious-address checker and the Wallet Selector, the industry’s first multi-wallet management tool. Ether (ETH), ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens are supported by the built-in crypto wallet and several blockchains, including Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains, Bitcoin and layer-2 solutions. Additionally, Opera has a strong partner network with partners like Solana or Polygon across the crypto ecosystem.

Furthermore, users can quickly access WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Twitter and more social apps in the sidebar of the desktop Crypto Browser to stay connected to their communities at all times. In addition, users may access future airdrops, industry updates and event calendars, gas costs, instructional content and others through the integrated Crypto Corner.

If you are interested in using the Opera Web3 browser, you must first download the Opera Crypto Browser for Android, Windows, or Mac (iOS coming soon). Then, if you already have a wallet, you can use it or create an Opera wallet to utilize the functionalities mentioned above.

Puma Web3 browser

Ukrainian-Canadian developer Yuriy Dybskiy founded Puma Browser in January 2019. It provides access to Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and Handshake (HNS) domains and InterPlanetaryFileSystem (IPFS), as well as seamless payments for content creators, app and game developers via Coil Content Network and Interledger Protocol. Using the Puma browser, web monetization works as follows:

A monthly charge of $5 is paid by Coil Members to access the content created by the users.

Interested users set up a digital wallet and make money from their content. Every hour a Coil Member spends viewing users’ content earns them $0.36 from Coil.

While Coil Members enjoy users’ content, Coil streams funds to their wallets.

Brave Web3 browser

Brave is open-source software that offers privacy-preserving features together with a free-to-use business model. It enhances users’ browser super app with cost-free video calls, fully autonomous search, offline playlists and even a personalized news feed. Brave, by default, bans trackers and obscene advertisements on all websites users visit. Moreover, Brave’s brand-new nonfungible token (NFT) gallery feature provides users with a streamlined interface for viewing and managing NFT collections.

Additionally, by watching ads, one can earn passive income in Basic Attention Tokens (BAT). Another notable feature of the Brave Web3 browser is the incorporation of IPFS functionality, which enables built-in decentralized file storage and reduces data concentration by distributing file storage across a worldwide network.

Beaker browser

Beaker browser allows peer-to-peer website hosting, referred to as Hyperdrives, in a private mode. Only those with the link to a Hyperdrive can access the website once it has been created. To create hostless applications, the Beaker browser offers new APIs while still being compatible with the rest of the Web.

Beaker displays the complete site’s structure in a GitHub-like format, in contrast to most browsers showing the page’s source code to the website visitors. Even better, one can host their own fork of the website.

Osiris browser

The first net-neutral browser in the world, Osiris hopes to release people from commercialism, the shackles of censorship and bias that have crept into the internet. Osiris asserts that it is a blockchain-based browser that, by default, bans all commercials and trackers and states baldly that it is self-sustaining without advertising money.

With Osiris Armor, users can configure privacy settings and view the number of advertising and scripts that have already been banned. In addition, it offers a multi-wallet called Metawallet that embeds a wallet in the browser and supports several cryptocurrencies to enhance the Web3 experience for blockchain users.

The future of Web3 browsers

Web platforms have long been without the capability of money transfer, resulting in a deluge of internet advertising and dishonest business practices. As the Semantic Web (Web3) promises to arrange the world’s information in a way that Google’s search engine architecture cannot achieve, it enables web monetization opportunities for developers, gamers, and content creators. Web monetization offers an effective, free, native and automatic means of paying creators, funding essential web infrastructure and supporting API calls.

Although Google Chrome is the most used Web2 browser and DApps can be accessed via Web3 wallets, blockchain-friendly web browsers allow users to control their data, funds and assets without intermediaries. Therefore the shift towards decentralized web calls for novel and innovative solutions to enhance the user experience, and Web3 browsers acting as a gateway to DApps are essential to access the digital economy.

Despite the fact that there are still many unexplored areas of the Semantic Web and a lot of research to be done, it is evident that Web3 technologies are becoming a significant force in the current Web landscape. And it is expected that Web3 browsers (both existing and upcoming ones) will continue to offer distinct services to serve the needs of blockchain users.",blockchain,cointelegraph

These assets are known for their highly explosive nature, especially during a bull market. You need to identify the expected growth rate of different cryptocurrency assets to get the best from your trading activities.

While this can be tough, you can learn a lot about a coin by studying its architecture, use case, and previous developments in the coin market. This piece will review the expected growth rate of top-rated coins in the crypto space. Let’s begin!

Shiba Inu – The ‘Doge Killer’

Shiba Inu is one of the largest cryptocurrencies on the coin market based on market cap, but it also enjoyed one of the most dramatic rises to fame. This meme coin was made by a development team called Ryoshi. Reports state that Ryoshi was previously connected to Dogecoin (DOGE) before they opted to create an alternative to the popular meme coin.

When Shiba Inu was created, it was designed to have some of Dogecoin’s features with subtle improvements. For instance, Shiba Inu has a dog-themed logo similar to DOGE. Also, it’s hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.

However, it also adopts a few subtle changes that make it unique. Unlike Dogecoin, which has an unlimited supply, Shiba Inu has a total supply of 1 Quadrillion SHIB tokens. While this may be considered a huge amount of tokens, it still ensures that the token’s value can be controlled through decisive actions.

Going further, you’ll be thrilled to find out that Shiba Inu’s growth and development are controlled by the activities of its community, known as the ShibaArmy. While this community started from humble beginnings, it’s considered one of the largest and most active crypto communities today. This community has token burns planned in the future to reduce the total supply and boost the token prices.

Furthermore, Shiba Inu is designed to have its ecosystem where DeFi transactions are carried out and other projects are created. The tokens found in this ecosystem include SHIB, LEASH, and BONE.

Compound is one of the few cryptocurrencies that do not serve as a means of exchange or store of value. Instead, this coin has a unique utility. Compound is a decentralized protocol that’s hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.

This project is renowned for supporting unique DeFi features such as borrowing and lending, using Ethereum’s versatile network. Through Compound’s platform, users can borrow digital assets or earn interest by lending to the platform.

When users borrow funds on Compound, they’ll pay interest and the amount borrowed. But when users lend their resources to the platform, they’ll earn interest for their actions. Compound is different from other cryptocurrency projects only interested in taking your money. Instead, Compound incentivizes all the activities on its platform.

Compound offers users rewards for all their activities on the platform, either borrowing, withdrawing, or repairing a loan. Users will earn COMP tokens for doing anything on the platform. As an ERC-20 token, COMP is compatible with other Ethereum-based projects.

Big Eyes Coin Storms Through Presale

Big Eyes Coin is a clear sign that meme coins are not what they used to be. Before now, many considered meme coins to be nothing more than mere jokes in the crypto space. But recently, they have proven they can do much more.

Big Eyes Coin is a perfect example of meme crypto with the ability to do much more. The first interesting thing to note about Big Eyes Coin is its attractive colour scheme. This design would thrill meme and cat lovers.

Like other top meme coins before it, Big Eyes Coin has incorporated some form of utility into its ecosystem. Big Eyes Coin will be used to create unique NFT tokens and has the potential to produce the next best seller in the NFT marketplace. Big Eyes Coin is also concerned about giving back to the community and producing millionaires shortly. The fifth stage of the presale is on, and Big Eyes Coin is offering bonus tokens to those who purchase with the code ‘EYES1254’!

161,Nodes are going to dethrone tech giants — from Apple to Google,https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjItMTAvNDYyMzFjZjMtMTY1Ni00NWU5LWI2MDUtNzUxMjI0YmQ5MDE2LmpwZw==.jpg,15/10/2022,Decentralized systems are slowly putting power back in the hands of developers and users — and taking it away from Big Tech companies.,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nodes-are-going-to-dethrone-tech-giants-from-apple-to-google,"While highly regarded even at the time of its writing, Marc Andreessen’s 2011 landmark essay, “Why Software Is Eating the World,” has proven even more prophetic than it seemed at the time. At the dawn of a decade when software would prove invaluable to nearly every aspect of modern life, Andreessen argued that every company was now ostensibly a software company, whether the company liked it or not.

Tailoring his argument to many of the companies that were market leaders at the time, his ideas eventually also applied to companies that either hadn’t fully defined their markets or didn’t even yet exist but would go on to generate billions in market share: Uber, Lyft, TikTok/ByteDance, Robinhood and Coinbase, among several others. If you were going to be a unicorn in the 21st century, software was probably going to be a key part of earning that horn.

Related: Facebook is going to destroy the Metaverse and Web3

The hidden motor behind this complete disruption of modern economies and life was the emergence of true cloud computing and cloud giants, an industry in which Andreessen himself had been a pioneer at a time when many inside and outside computing were scoffing at the notion.

But there was a great cost to making so much of life so easy.

By the second decade of the 21st century, they weren’t scoffing much at all. In the 2010s, worldwide spending on cloud computing more than quintupled, from $77 billion to $411 billion. It was the backbone of what made everything accessible at the touch of a button on the computer in our pocket.

Related: Facebook and Twitter will soon be obsolete thanks to blockchain technology

While the mobile-powered software revolution made life as easy as the push of a button, as with anything else, it came with its own compromises. With software eating the world, it became the province of very few, very large cloud hosting companies. Amazon, Google and Microsoft now account for 65% of the cloud hosting market.

This created its own sort of shadow monopoly via cloud hosting. For example, with cloud hosting in particular, hosts can knock services off of clouds, as Amazon did with the notorious social media service Parler. Parler was also banned from Apple’s App Store.

Related: Biden is hiring 87,000 new IRS agents — and they’re coming for you

When it comes to the larger issue at stake here, it doesn’t matter whether or not you agree with a service like Parler. What the incident demonstrated was that it only took two companies, Amazon and Apple, to completely knock a service offline, effectively putting it out of business in the post-software world.

What happens when a service or developer runs afoul of a more innocuous Amazon policy or term of service? The internet has been painted into a corner where it can no longer truly be a marketplace of free ideas and free development, especially if that development is somehow perceived as a threat by companies like Amazon and Microsoft.

Nodes can build a new world

Just as Bitcoin (BTC) “broke” money and allowed people to think about the exchange of value in new ways, newer blockchain protocols have the chance to “break” data in a world that has been consumed by software and oligopolistic companies, allowing us to think about the exchange of that data in new ways.

Web3 and the projects it will birth promise to redefine how information lives and is carried through the internet autonomously and transparently. Decentralization-first and community-first ecosystems promise to put power back into the hands of developers and, thus, the users who will use their decentralized applications (DApps) and software. This will allow for a common framework that promotes best practices and economies of scale that will be able to compete with the largest centralized entities on the internet.

Related: The feds are coming for the metaverse, from Axie Infinity to Bored Apes

That isn’t to say we’ve yet reached a decentralized utopia. Though decentralized systems are also ostensibly “trustless” systems, it is ironically trust that still must be built up in these systems for both developers and users. Whatever the disadvantages of relying on companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple, they have banked decades’ worth of that trust, credibility and familiarity that makes it difficult for both developers and users to switch to an entirely new way of doing things.

Part of building that trust is rewiring the incentivization model that has supported the last several decades of the internet. For a new decentralized internet to work, it will mean users buying into nodes and developers best utilizing those nodes to build software that is simple enough to run and access on one’s phone as Uber or Wordle.

If the decentralized Web3 community is able to do that, we can restore the world that was eaten by software, one node at a time.

Back in the day, there were web applications. But now, we are going towards DApps (Also known as Decentralized Apps). Due to their demand, a lot of companies are learning how to build a DApp.

Before going about how to make a DApp, we would like you to read about how to make decentralized apps by going to the link.

But, What Are DApps?

Let’s make one thing clear, DApps are similar to those web applications. They have similar features and offer the same capability (Sometimes improved).

However, the working model of DApps is different from that of web applications. At the same time, web applications rely on servers, and DApps work on a peer-to-peer network. One of the P2P examples is Blockchain or smart contracts.

The reason many people are trying to build DApp is that these apps are not controlled by single or multiple entities. They are decentralized. There are other varieties of reasons why you should build a DApp.

The records and data are public.

The apps are open-sourced and run on their own.

With the help of cryptography, these apps keep the network secure.

Decentralized Apps Workflow Explained

Traditional apps are divided into three different parts when you are trying to build them. The steps are front-end, back-end, and database. When you are trying to build a DApp, you will see that it also has three different steps. Here are the three main components that are required when building a DApp.

Front-End UI

Front End UI of DApps, in its simplest front, is an HTML page that uses Javascript to call smart contracts. This step is similar to when you are creating a traditional web application. Developers can use regular frame networks like Angular or React.

When you are planning to build DApp, make sure that your front end is communicating with smart tokens. For that, it is recommended to use JavaScript libraries like Web3.js.

Smart Contract

A smart contract is what makes decentralized applications powerful. These contracts are operated using Ethereum VM (Virtual Machine). Smart contracts contain a term called business logic. Business logic is the same as the code that runs on those web applications. For instance, crowdfunding companies use smart contracts to regularize how funds are collected and distributed.

Back-End Server

The last part when building DApp is the back-end server. Back-end service for DApp can be created using tools like Ruby or Node.js. The back-end server contains a local copy of Ethereum clients such as Parity. This will be used to receive elements from Block Chain and forward them to the dedicated client.

How to Build A DApp? The Modern subtleties

The internet is filled with multiple guides that tell you how to make a DApp. They have their own processes and show different ways to deploy a DApp. Whenever you want to build a DApp, it is essential to understand the key steps because these steps will define the future of your app. Here are the steps that you can use to develop a DApp.

Go through What you Want to Build

The first step towards creating a DApp is seeing what you want to solve. Once you have that, it is time to see whether there are use cases of decentralized apps related to that. If yes, you can move toward the next step.

Understand the Technology

Decentralized apps, tokens, smart contracts, blockchain, and crypto are some of the words that can make you go insane. So, understanding this technology is crucial if you are trying to build a DApp.

In DApps, there are multiple blockchain platforms. Each of them has its own tools and features. Before selecting a platform, asses the requirements of your project and see which solution works best for you.

Conduct Market research

Market research is one of those methods that enable companies to see how to target potential customers and investors. Create paperwork, presentations, and other things to convince the investors that your solution will work.

Moreover, see existing DApps, and check where those apps are lacking. Doing proper market research will place you ahead of your competitors, so make sure you are doing it the right way.

Develop the App

After getting all the related insights, it is time to design and develop your own DApp MVP (“Minimum Viable Product.”). The most common way of building DApp is using the Ethereum platform and C++ programming language. The front end of the app will be similar to the web application. After creating the MVP version, check the market response and then plan to launch version 2.0 of the decentralized app.

Decentralized apps are becoming game changers for many companies due to a number of reasons. First, these apps are decentralized, meaning no single/multiple entities are controlling this app.

Secondly, they are secure because of the blockchain network. And third, they are autonomous. These are some of the reasons why businesses are learning how to build a DApp, and you should do it too! That is because DApp is becoming the new normal.",blockchain,hackread

A P2E game where players can earn even big prizes from a single match;

Cool graphics, NFT characters, and plenty of firepowers;

Rewards paid out in BBZ and BUSD.

(October 14, 2022) – Nostalgia and retro fun arrives on the blockchain with the launch of Bomberzilla, a bet-2-earn gaming platform where players can earn rewards for their skills and acumen right from game one.

The creators of Bomberzilla, a small team of players, began in 2019 with a strong desire to resurrect classic games from the golden age of gaming and build them again using today’s technologies. These are revolutionary games that everyone remembers and would love to play again.

The gaming community of BomberZilla will be a buzzing place for conversations, meetings, and sharing of good and sweet memories. The mission was to not only recreate an old game but to allow for betting on one’s performance and winning based on gaming skills.

The most outstanding feature of the game is its reward system, not based on the outdated P2E model but in shares of a prize pool created by the ticket entrances paid by the users.

The battles on Bomberzilla take place on a mythical floating island filled with arenas and mazes where players use NFTs, avatars, and firepower to make their way to the top. Bomberzilla is inviting whitelist applications and has a pre-sale lined up shortly for its gaming token (BBZ).

A demand for retro games from the 1980s and 90s led to the creation of Bomberzilla on the blockchain. The game blends the classic appeal of the past with modern graphics and battles aplenty in an electrifying mix of bravado, style, and strategy. Included are exclusive tournaments and the mother of all battles, the BomberZilla World Cup!

The game’s objective is to move from one arena to the other exploding all the enemies to be the only survivor. Bomberzilla involves plenty of firepower and battles against worthy opponents to climb their way to higher leagues with bigger prizes and get access to exclusive rewards and tournaments.

Players can buy Bomber Boxes with characters’, skins, and items NFTs to play. Every character has a Stamina level assigned that is spent to access. You can reset a character’s stamina with potions and extra points sold on the game store.

To join matches, players can buy tickets with BUSD and BBZ tokens. A Battle Pass will provide players with access to exclusive rewards and tournaments meant only for the best BomberZ.

“Bomberzilla is here to take you on a trip to the 80s, to experience the same nostalgia and the romance of spending time in gaming alleys playing console games, but this time, powered by a blockchain! This time, feel the same action and thrill with new option and possibilities,” said a spokesperson for Bomberzilla.

The game is played off the blockchain to guarantee users a safer and more fluid gaming experience. The rewards are earned quickly, taking only a single match of a few minutes for players to win BBZ and BUSD tokens.

Any simple wallet like MetaMask can be used to connect and play. Players retain control over their playing assets and can trade, interact and socialize with the community. By the way, the community seems very important for the game environment, considering the Vision and Mission available on the project’s whitepaper.

Gaming skills alone are sufficient to earn tokens and rewards on BomberZilla. Players can enter into battles and earn tokens as they progress in their journey. New features, such as betting on other players, are also in the planning stages. The PvP mode, where players win from other players, means reward tokens are not minted but acquired from the game.

Regarding tokenomics, the BBZ token has 15% reserved for the whitelist, 25% for public sale, and 10% for prizes, rankings, and other game elements. Liquidity provision is ensured, with 20% of the tokens reserved.

For all game enthusiasts waiting for some thrill and excitement straight from the old gaming times, BomberZilla is here to bring back memories and more… just play and win.

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.

Top Stories This Week

Starting in early 2023, Coinbase’s payment service, Coinbase Commerce, will facilitate crypto payments for customers purchasing Google’s cloud services thanks to a deal between the two companies. Google will only allow certain crypto assets for payment, including Bitcoin. Initially limited to certain participants, the option to pay with crypto will eventually be expanded to other customers, an executive at Google Cloud told CNBC. Google Cloud has taken several other steps toward crypto and blockchain industry involvement in 2022.

Banking giant BNY Mellon has entered the crypto custody field, offering certain customers Bitcoin and Ether custody services via a new platform. The 238-year-old bank will provide bookkeeping for clients’ crypto in a similar fashion as it does for traditional assets, while also handling clients’ private keys. BNY Mellon’s CEO of securities services and digital, Roman Regelman, said: “With Digital Asset Custody, we continue our journey of trust and innovation into the evolving digital assets space, while embracing leading technology and collaborating with fintechs.”

Following multiple delays, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has denied WisdomTree’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal, which the firm filed in January. The SEC cited fears of market manipulation and fraud as the rationale for its decision, which is consistent with its previous rationale for denying spot Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC also denied a spot Bitcoin ETF proposal from WisdomTree in 2021.

PayPal’s Acceptable Use Policy was set to change in early November to include a $2,500 fine for any platform users that promote, post, send or publicize so-called “misinformation.” PayPal has since claimed that the policy provision was added in error. “PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy,” said PayPal. The fiasco has reignited concerns about centralized platforms among crypto users who view self-custody as an important pillar of self-sovereignty and financial inclusion.

Data from DappRadar revealed that $1.3 billion worth of venture capital flowed into metaverse projects and blockchain games in Q3 — a bright spot amid crypto bear market darkness. While venture capital funding for these sectors was down 48% compared with Q2, the Q3 figure was still more than double the amount invested in all of 2021.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $19,665, Ether (ETH) at $1,329 and XRP at $0.50. The total market cap is at $938.70 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Huobi Token (HT) at 87.06%, TerraClassicUSD (USTC) at 63.33% and Quant (QNT) at 22.07%.

The top three altcoin losers of the week are Klaytn (KLAY) at -20.36%, Internet Computer (ICP) at -15.04% and eCash (XEC) at -14.48%.

“A bear market is the best time to start working in crypto and find a job.

Raman Shalupau, founder of Crypto Jobs List

“There is protection in gold. But in my opinion, Bitcoin is far superior. It’s got math and code. It’s defended by a decentralized protocol. You don’t mess with math.

Greg Foss, executive director of strategic initiatives at Validus Power Corp

“It’s incredibly important not to ever forget that we have an immense responsibility that influencers do not. They have their own risks in terms of their followers’ trust, but we have our responsibility to keep our integrity as journalists.

Kristina Cornèr, editor-in-chief of Cointelegraph

Prediction of the Week

For most of the week, Bitcoin traded sideways, slightly favoring the downside, according to Cointelegraph’s BTC price index. The asset sustained a fair bit of price volatility on Oct. 13, however, in line with the release of September’s U.S. inflation data. Bitcoin’s price dropped down near $18,200 following the news but subsequently rebounded above $19,000.

In an Oct. 13 post, pseudonymous Twitter user il Capo of Crypto tweeted about the possibility of Bitcoin’s drop being a bear trap, noting a potential subsequent rally to $21,000, followed by a stark drop.

FUD of the Week

Crypto exchange Bittrex faces charges from two different United States regulators: the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The regulatory authorities have essentially alleged that Bittrex did not conduct proper due diligence on its customers and transactions between 2014 and 2018, which allowed users from sanctioned regions to use the platform. Bittrex confirmed it would settle with OFAC for around $24 million, which may also be applied as a credit toward its $29 million settlement owed to FinCEN. Looking to move forward from the situation, Bittrex stated that it has been up to date with expected standards since 2018.

Mango Markets, a decentralized finance platform running on the Solana blockchain, reportedly bled around $100 million from its treasury thanks to an exploit. Someone manipulated price data for the platform’s native MNGO asset, letting them borrow crypto worth far more than the value of the MNGO they put up as collateral. MNGO suffered a roughly 50% price drop following news of the event. Later reporting saw the hacker coming forward, demanding a $70 million bug reward and other terms to return exploited funds.

After about four months, media outlet CNN has decided to discontinue its nonfungible token (NFT) endeavor, seemingly another bear market casualty. The media company’s NFT project, known as Vault by CNN, essentially offered tokenized memories of historical news events spanning multiple decades through CNN’s history. The project’s roadmap projected six months of development, although the media outlet has since claimed the project was a “6-week experiment,” according to an announcement from the Vault by CNN Twitter account. NFT buyers will get a 20% reimbursement of the price they paid to mint their NFTs, according to a CNN staffer on Discord.

On October 13th, Ethan Buchman, co-founder of the Cosmos inter-blockchain communication (IBC) ecosystem, revealed a major security weak point that affects all Cosmos chains that utilize IBC, regardless of the version of IBC they employ.

The Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol allows users to seamlessly switch from one Cosmos blockchain to another.

42-IBC Connected Blockchains At Risk

Currently, there are 42 blockchains that are IBC-enabled. Among these are Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Cronos and Evmos.

OKX Chain, Luna Classic and Thorchain are some of the major blockchains which have integrated IBC before. Luckily for them, the functionality was either already deactivated or was never fully enabled to begin with.

Buchman’s disclosure during the Cosmos Hub Forum is not to be taken lightly especially that all affected networks combine for a total market capitalization of $8.18 billion.

Meanwhile, the Cosmos co-founder said the problem has been dealt with through a patch that will be deployed on all blockchains currently at risk.

Developers and validators were given private access to the patch before the announcement of the security threat was made.

A third of a blockchain’s voting power must be patched in order for it to be safe from the said vulnerability.

ATOM Price Takes A Hit

The news about the potential threat took its toll on ATOM, the cryptocurrency of Cosmos, as the asset is experiencing a price drop.

At press time, according to tracking from Coingecko, ATOM is trading at $11.58 and has been down by 4.4% over the last 24 hours. Its price correction furthered its decline over the past seven days as the crypto is -10%.

Although it is forecasted to jump all the way to $13.31 over the next five days, the general sentiment toward the asset remains bearish according to Coincodex.

In fact, the online crypto data provider said 25 of the 28 technical analysis indicators for ATOM gave bearish signals.

As for the Fear and Greed Index, the crypto tallied a score of 24 which translated to Extreme Fear. Moreover, Coincodex said now is a bad time to buy the asset.

It’s understandable that the digital currency would react negatively to the development announced by Cosmos.

It’s now a waiting game to see if the mentioned solution for the detected threat will allay fears and negativity that pushed ATOM to another bearish rally.

New York-based blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis released a study on the highly increasing use of crypto – a large part them illicit in nature – in Eastern Europe in an excerpt from its upcoming 2022 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.

The noticeable increase in activity among residents of the two countries started shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February.

As the war escalated, their economies began to suffer, pushing inflation upwards to suffocating levels.

Russian Crypto Activity Focused On Stablecoins

According to data by Chainalysis, stablecoins appeared to be the go-to digital assets for Russians who are forced to endure economic sanctions imposed by various countries as form of condemnation to the invasion.

The analysis firm said stablecoin transaction volumes in Russia increased from 42% in January to 67% in March. Since then, overall crypto activity in the country likewise grew.

As Russia has been removed from the SWIFT cross-border system as part of the broader sanctions, the country has turned to digital currencies, specifically stablecoins, to process cross-border transactions.

The Russian people also resorted to trading their national currency, the ruble, for stablecoins as they attempt to protect the value of their assets in this period of conflict.

Ukraine Receives Millions Of Bitcoin Donations

Ukraine’s crypto activity might be a bit different compared to that of Russia’s, as the country’s digital wallets have been filled with bitcoin donations.

Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic revealed the nation was able to raise $63 million worth of Bitcoin and other related currency donations in just two weeks following the invasion.

A 2022 Financial Times report earlier this year said crypto aid for Ukraine already breached the $100 million mark.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was also among the biggest donors for Ukraine, using the Tornado Cash mixing service and privacy tool to facilitate his donation.

Meanwhile, Illia Polosukhin, the co-founder of Near Protocol, shared that when he thought of how he could help Ukraine, he first thought of digital currencies, thinking of them as “lifeline.”

Polosukhin, talking about Bitcoin and their advantages in such situation, said:

“It’s resilient, it’s fast, it delivers help directly to people,” said Polosukhin, talking about crypto and their advantages in such situation.”

It’s no wonder why Ukraine’s crypto activity is on a steady increase compared to Russia’s.

Meanwhile, the initial findings show that more than 18% of all crypto transactions in Eastern Europe are linked to potentially risky or illegal endeavors.

Interaction with high-risk exchanges, which often don’t require users to submit know-your-customer (KYC) information, contributes to the risks faced by Eastern Europeans.

High-risk behavior related to exchanges is likely to increase as a result of Russians being blocked from accessing European crypto firms owing to sanctions.

One thing is for sure though, Russians and Ukrainians are looking at virtual money as a means to survive as their countries continue to duke it out with missiles, bombs and guns.

169,Russian Accounts Restricted by Crypto.com and Blockchain.com After Sanctions,https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/imageForEntry1-ZZt.jpg,15/10/2022,Top crypto platforms Blockchain.com and Crypto.com have stopped providing services to Russian nationals.,https://tokenist.com/russian-accounts-restricted-by-crypto-com-and-blockchain-com-after-sanctions/?u,"Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.

Top crypto platforms Blockchain.com and Crypto.com have stopped providing services to Russian nationals, urging these users to withdraw their funds as soon as possible. The move comes as a result of recent sanctions by the EU against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

Russian Nationals Must Withdraw Their Blockchain.com Funds Before Oct. 27

Crypto exchanges Blockchain.com and Crypto.com informed Russian users they will no longer be able to use custodial and reward services on the platforms. Blockchain.com notified Russia-based users they must withdraw their funds before Oct. 27, after which their accounts will be blocked.

“As a result of EU sanctions, Blockchain dot com is currently restricted from providing custodial and rewards services to Russian nationals. Please withdraw your custodial funds (including rewards) by October 27, 2022, after which date your account will be locked. Effective immediately, rewards accruals are now blocked, but can still be withdrawn by October 27.” – Blockchain.com said in e-mails sent to Russian users

The decision follows the latest sanction package by the European Union (EU) against Russia, introduced earlier this month. Among other things, the latest package includes a” full ban of the provision of crypto-asset wallet, account or custody services to Russian persons and residents, regardless of the total value of those crypto-assets.”

EU’s new sanctions also involve restrictions on the maritime transport of Russian oil to third countries and other trade prohibitions related to steel products, cigarettes, paper, and more. Moreover, the package targets Russia’s media and defense sectors and prohibits providing architectural, engineering, IT consultancy, and legal advisory services to Russian entities and individuals.

Crypto.com, one of the fastest-growing crypto exchanges in the world, already banned Russian users from using the app. However, as opposed to Blockchain.com, Crypto.com did not provide any details on fund withdrawals.

Dapper Labs Suspends Accounts Linked to Russia Following EU Sanctions

Blockchain.com and Crypto.com were not the first only crypto-related companies to stop providing services to Russian nationals. This month, blockchain gaming company Dapper Labs also suspended accounts linked to Russia as a result of new EU regulations.

The Western leaders have been imposing severe sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in February. The dispute between the West and Russia significantly added to inflationary pressures as gas prices skyrocketed over recent months.

Washington was among the first to impose sanctions against Russia, including bans on cryptocurrency transactions and mining. Russia has responded in a similar manner, banning exports of more than 200 goods and prohibiting foreign investors from selling their Russian investments. More recently, the top financial regulator in Russia added Facebook owner Meta to the list of “terrorists and extremists” organizations, according to a report by Interfax.

Global ID is joining an accelerator that could also provide a path to a new biometrics market, while Google and Microsoft have launched new consumer biometrics and enterprise identity management products, respectively, and ForgeRock is being taken private in a $2.3 billion deal.

Top biometrics news of the week

A new EMVCo draft specification for point-of-sale payment devices and ATMs which supports biometric payment cards has been published. The new Contactless Kernel Specification, one of more than 20 contactless kernel systems used around the world, ensures interoperability between POS systems and cards from Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB and UnionPay.

The deadline for biometric SIM card registration in Kenya is Saturday, with 14 million mobile accounts yet to be registered and at risk of being shut down. The telecommunications providers in the Philippines say they are ready to carry out a similar exercise in their country, but would be well advised to take extra care with the security of any data they collect, as shown by a massive breach of SIM registration data in Indonesia.

The first of Pakistan’s new biometric passports has been issued to government officials, while Ghana says its own updated travel document is just months away. Nigeria’s government is putting passport application processes online to sidestep problems the system has faced, while South Africa is increasing the cost of its passports, and Philippine Airlines staff have been accused of suspect handling of travelers data.

Security camera supplier Dahua and facial recognition developer CloudWalk have been added to an official U.S. government list of companies considered to be extensions of China’s military. Businesses on the list do not get sanctioned for inclusion, but is meant to dissuade some potential partners or customers from working with them.

Global ID has been selected to participate in an innovation acceleration program run by RUAG, a tech supplier to the Switzerland’s army. The vein biometrics developer will work on system access security with the help of academic, technical and business expertise provided through the program.

Google has launched biometric passkeys to replace passwords with FIDO-based credentials on mobile devices running Android and Chrome. Passkeys can also enable account log-ins on a separate device using smartphone biometrics. The launch makes the passkeys available to developers, and apps utilizing the technology are expected to reach consumers later this year.

The World Economic Forum-run Known Traveller Trusted Identity program appears to be have been mothballed after being initially grounded by the pandemic. The blockchain-based project would have tested an early implementation of user-controlled digital ID in a complex setting, but with the Dutch side now focussed on EES, it may not be revived. As the America’s CBP and TSA deploy their new technologies, meanwhile, legacy self-service kiosks are being phased out, and retired next year.

Microsoft has brought its version of Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers to enterprise systems with the release of Entra Verified. The company believes its decentralized identity product can help businesses onboard employees, partners and customers, marking a potential big step towards mainstream adoption for the new W3C VC standard.

ForgeRock has reached a blockbuster $2.3 billion deal to be acquired by equity firm Thoma Bravo, which recently also bought Ping Identity. A 53 percent premium on ForgeRock’s stock price is the cost of taking the identity and access management leader private.

Meanwhile Intercede has acquired password management software provider Authlogics for $6 million. The deal gives Intercede access to a much larger customer market, just as it partners with NextgenID on remote identity proofing solutions.

IronVest, a company led by BioCatch Founder Avi Turgeman that offers a decentralized biometric password manager, has come out of stealth with a $23 million seed investment.

The latest episode of the ID 16.9 podcast focusses on a new approach to birth registration from Digitech Development, which has already been used to provide legal identity to millions of children in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Digital Trust World 2022 is now only a few weeks away. You can meet Biometric Update at the event in London.

District police of Firozabad in India have launched a blockchain-based complaint registration portal. The news gathered considerable media attention and brought this obscure district with 2.4 million people to the international limelight.

Close to the national capital Delhi, Firozabad is otherwise known for glass bangle factories. India has 766 districts and Uttar Pradesh province, where Firozabad is located has 75 districts. Given this background, launching a blockchain-based complaint registration portal by district police may not appear a significant development.

But complaints about police at the lower level refusing to register people’s complaints or manipulating them are quite widespread. Given this, a blockchain-based portal for the victims of crime to file their complaints is considered revolutionary as it not only ensures registration of the complaints but also ensures there is no manipulation.

The credit to use this innovative solution to make a difference in the way police deal with people’s complaints goes to the chief of the district police Ashish Tiwari.

“The benefit of using Blockchain is that the complaints registered on it can’t be tampered with as data recorded is immutable and transparent,” Ashish Tiwari, who belongs to the elite Indian Police Service (IPS), said in a tweet.

There are 21 police stations in the Firozabad district, and people can make their complaints from anywhere on the blockchain-based complaint platform — policecomplaintonblockchain.in — using the QR code to be provided by the district police. The complaint would automatically reach the relevant police station for further action. The blockchain network they are using for this purpose is Polygon.

In response to news development, Polygon CEO Sandeep Nailwal said in a series of tweets, “This is very close to my heart… With an FIR (first information report) going on the blockchain, specifically, if people can get online platform to file these with their identity, no lower-level officers can deny the FIR. This could be a game-changer in ensuring right to justice.”

The complaint portal has been designed by a private company using Polygon’s modular blockchain solutions. However, the role of Ashish Tiwari, Senior Superintendent of Police, Firozabad, in getting this project on stream is stellar. Tiwari is an M. Tech in Computer Science from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur.

Going by the problems that ordinary people face in getting their complaints registered at police stations, blockchain-based online complaint registrations can prove to be a game changer. But modernization and reforms in the police department have been one of the most challenging tasks anywhere in the world, and the story in India is no different.

However, with police officers like Ashish Tiwari at the helm, the situation can change slowly but surely!",blockchain,zycrypto

BURNABY, BC / OCTOBER 11th, 2022/ Isoforce Games has announced that Mouse Haunt’s fast-paced and competitive “Dodgeball Arenal” is out, and you can start playing now. This game mode is designed to be competitive while showcasing the team-dynamics essence of Castle Heist. In this mode, a mouse receives new tools to aid the team, throw enemies out of the tower or shoot a flaming ball to kill them instantly; upon death, you come back as a dangerous and unstoppable ghost. “Dodgeball Arena” is perfect for competitions because of its rapid speed, ease of use, and replayability. This mode is available so players can taste Castle Heist’s game mechanics.

In Mouse Haunt Castle Heist mode, players form groups and engage in team-based PvP. The Mouse Heroes are attempting to retrieve the Ancient Fragrant Cheese, while the Ghost Team group is out to eliminate the former. When navigating the Castle’s ghostly corridors, the Mouse Heroes must fire, sprint, and utilize their unique skills to survive. Likewise, the Ghost Team uses its ethereal talents to possess items, set off traps, and eliminate the annoying rodents; that’s when the twist happens, when a mouse hero dies, he switches sides and becomes a ghost, swinging the odds of battle.

Mouse Haunt’s mission is to develop innovative games that provide users access to cutting-edge mechanics. They combine the worlds of conventional gaming and cutting-edge blockchain technology, forming a single universe. Gamers can play and have a great time without interacting with any blockchain systems, or they can play, have a great time, own their assets as NFTs, and make actual cash. Unreal Engine 5 creates Mouse Haunt, and the BNB Chain (BEP20) is used for added security.

Furthermore, as an investor, if you’re not interested in real-time PVP, you can earn MHT tokens by farming. Lock n load, an idle game mode that allows NFT owners to immediately begin farming with just 5 minutes of work every day and a few simple clicks. In upcoming upgrades, MouseHaunt will provide Renting options for institutional investors that want to rent out a sizable number of assets.

The game’s initial real-time PVP “Dodgeball Arena” is already available for early access to anybody who registers on the website, and if you think this is the best time to start, the answer is YES!

On October 24th, Mouse Haunt will offer limited-edition bundles with both the Mouse and Ghost NFTs, with friendly prices for all sizes of pockets and with a considerable discount compared to their last sale, a dutch auction that sold 3 unique Legendary NFTs for nearly $500 each. Each new bundle includes bonus items such as trait re-roll dices, Play-to-Earn Early access, and Rank up potions. Players can pre-buy these unique NFTs to get rapid access to previously unseen items and to farm tokens on Lock n’ load.

About Mouse Haunt

Mouse Haunt came into existence in 2018 due to the effort made by six devoted game creators. It was completed as a capstone project for a course in game design that was taken in Canada. The six students, who came from various countries, worked together to create something extraordinary and one-of-a-kind. The multiplayer experience known as Mouse Haunt is presented in a three-dimensional, isometric format. There are two teams: the Ghost Team, whose objective is to eliminate all of the Mouse Heroes, and the Mouse Heroes team, which aims to attain the Fragrant Cheese of Yore.

(“Argo” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ARBK). Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at newaction@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980.



The investigation concerns whether Argo and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.

[Click here for information about joining the class action]

On or around September 22, 2021, Argo conducted its initial public offering (“IPO”), selling 7.5 million American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) priced at $15.00 per ADS.

On October 7, 2022, Argo issued a press release “announc[ing] several strategic actions that are intended to bring in additional capital to the business and ensure that the Company has the working capital necessary to execute its current strategy and meet its obligations over the next twelve months.” Argo stated that in addition to measures being undertaken to reduce costs and preserve capital, Argo has signed a non-binding letter of intent with an affiliate of New York Digital Investment Group to amend existing equipment financing agreement; plans to sell 3,400 mining machines for cash proceeds of £6 million; and intends to raise approximately £24 million via proposed subscription with a strategic investor.

On this news, Argo’s ADS price fell $0.97 per ADS, or 23.26%, to close at $3.20 per ADS on October 7, 2022.

Then, on October 11, 2022, Argo issued a press release providing an operational update, in which it announced that “[d]uring the month of September, Argo mined 215 Bitcoin or Bitcoin Equivalents (together, BTC) compared to 235 BTC in August 2022. The decrease in BTC mined is primarily due to a 12% increase in average network difficulty during September. Additionally, the Company is continuing to curtail operations at its Helios facility in Dickens County, Texas during periods of high electricity prices.”

On this news, Argo’s stock price fell $0.27 per share, or 10.9%, to close at $2.19 per share on October 11, 2022.

Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions.

Every year, we see new technologies and trends emerge that have the potential to change the landscape of wireless forever. So, what's next for wireless? Here's what to watch:

1. eSIMs: Embedded SIM (eSIM) cards are the next generation of SIM cards. Unlike traditional SIM cards, which are physical cards that must be inserted into a device, eSIMs are embedded into devices and can be activated remotely. This means that users will no longer have to physically swap out their SIM cards when they want to change carriers. Instead, they'll be able to simply activate or deactivate their eSIM with their carrier of choice. This technology is already being used in some smartphones and smartwatches, and it's expected to become more prevalent in the coming year.

2. GIGS out of Germany, but with venture funding from around the globe, is building a platform to enable any business to offer eSIM & SIM enabled phone plans of any size on any network globally. Businesses can launch their own mobile service and monetize their audience, unlocking recurring revenue streams,

3. Helium: Helium is a new network architecture powered by the Helium Blockchain, The People’s Network represents a paradigm shift for decentralized wireless infrastructure.

Here is how Gemini’s Cryptopedia explains tokenization:

“Generally speaking, a token is a representation of a particular asset or utility. Within the context of blockchain technology, tokenization is the process of converting something of value into a digital token that’s usable on a blockchain application. Assets tokenized on the blockchain come in two forms. They can represent tangible assets like gold, real estate, and art, or intangible assets like voting rights, ownership rights, or content licensing. Practically anything can be tokenized if it is considered an asset that can be owned and has value to someone, and can be incorporated into a larger asset market.

“The concept of tokenization precedes blockchain technology. The financial services industry has implemented some form of tokenization to protect clients’ confidential information since the 1970s. This process has typically involved the conversion of sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other personally identifiable information into a string of alphanumeric characters, which are then processed through a cryptographic function to create a unique token.

“To some extent, this method bears some resemblance to the tokenization process enabled by blockchain technology. However, while past tokenization mechanisms were primarily designed to protect sensitive data, blockchain-enabled tokenization allows for a more secure yet flexible tokenization of assets that has significantly broadened the potential applications of digital tokens across a wide array of industries.“

Anyway, on October 11, according to a report by The Daily Hodl, Mounts told Melker during an episode of the popular “The Wolf Of All Streets” podcast:

“We think the tokenization of everything is going to happen. Who can predict the exact twists and turns of the pathway to that? But in the meantime, we want to make sure our organization is positioned to provide the services and products that are needed to shed light on the risks in the industry and allow shareholders to make informed decisions…

“In the long term, we think the tokenization of everything will happen, but in the range from purely centralized to purely decentralized, my personal opinion is that we’re still going to end up in some blended space.“

On October 4, S&P Global published a report titled “Smart Contracts Could Improve Efficiency And Transparency In Financial Transactions”. Below are a few highlights:

“Smart contracts are a core building block of decentralized applications, facilitating the execution of specified tasks (such as payments) based on predetermined business rules.

“Using smart contracts in financial transactions can improve efficiency and reduce reliance on third parties like asset servicers and custodians, as well as make transaction resolutions faster–enhancing creditworthiness and the integrity of business dealings.

“Smart contracts have had slow and limited adoption in the financial markets owing to key risks including technology issues (such as incorrect coding) and legal and regulatory ambiguities that make accountability difficult.“

In an interview with Altcoin Daily, Cowen laid out his bullish case for the decentralized oracle platform, noting that while he often refers to BTC’s dominance – or its share of the cryptocurrency market – going much higher in the future, some tokens may still outperform it.

Cowen said that “f history is any indication, at the end of a bear market and in the accumulation phase before the next bull market, Chainlink is a reasonable place to look.”

Cowen added that the decentralized oracle platform has been integrated into several projects to enable smart contracts to receive data. The project’s strength, he said, isn’t being translated into a higher price over the ongoing bear market, which has seen investors move away from risk assets over interest rate rises meant to tame inflation.

Per the analyst, the “fundamentals of Chainlink shine through a bit better in the bear market than they sometimes do in the bull market.” He said:

Chainlink sort of acts as a backbone for a lot of cryptocurrencies.… We’ve seen over the years, just how many cryptocurrency projects it’s integrated itself into and I would argue that it provides a very valuable service in providing real-time feeds via the blockchain.

Cowen added he is looking to see how $LINK performs in the future if cryptocurrency prices keep on dropping in the near future.

Notably, Chainlink has recently partnered with SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication to try to bridge the gap between traditional banks and blockchain. The partnership will see both working on an “initial proof of concept” using Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability protocol, which provides a cross-blockchain communication standard.

The partnership will mean that the 11,000 financial institutions connected to SWIFT will be able to engage in token transactions across chains. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov has said the move will accelerate the adoption of distributed ledger technology across capital markets and traditional finance.

SWIFT’s interbank messaging system is the most widely used platform for traditional cross-border fiat transactions. In August, it recorded an average of 44.8 million messages per day. Transactions made using SWIFT’s network can take days to complete, however.

Chainlink has said the collaboration with SWIFT allows financial institutions to gain blockchain capability without replacing, developing, and integrating new connectivity into legacy systems.

Powered by the Ethereum blockchain, the Girles Metaverse project is making headlines already. The recently launched NFT-based P2E platform has raised over $1.2 Million in the equally new public presale of its token (the Girles Token).

While plans are underway to provide 15 investment options, the Girles Token remains the main product. The NFT GameFi token is not only a mix of Staking Contracts, NFT Metaverse, and P2E Alliance, but it’s also offering an investment opportunity like no other—early birds will enjoy an ROI of up to 200%, partially explaining the massive uptake.

Not Your Ordinary NFT

Like the Girles Token, the NFT metaverse is vital to the Girles Metaverse. However, it’s not the standard pictures the NFT community is accustomed to. The Girles NFT can be an author’s work, land plots, or game items.

Interestingly, users can stake NFTs and receive Girles tokens. They can also swap tokens for NFTs if need be. Beyond staking, the platform supports NFT burning to earn bonuses. Further, the Girles community is free to mint, hold or trade NFTs across the platform.

Girlie Metaverse Growth Potential

Meanwhile, project scalability is assured. Developers are creating the P2E server in Minecraft, one of the most popular games in the world. Further, the platform features quests empowering players to earn real money. Coupled with the ongoing refining of NFT Tokenomics, the Girles Metaverse is set on a path of excellence.

About the Girles Metaverse

The Girles Metaverse, or Girles in short, is a decentralized P2E platform developed on the Ethereum chain. Leveraging the power of NFTs, the project also serves as an NFT market where users can buy and sell their artwork.

Besides, investors can hold, burn, or swap their NFTs with Girles Token, the firm’s heartbeat. On top of that, the Girles’ legality is unquestionable since the fully doxxed team passed KYC and shared respective links on their LinkedIn profiles.

Buchman made this announcement on the Cosmos Hub Forum where he assured that steps have already been taken to ensure that all significant public IBC-enabled chains have been fixed.

This update is coming in a week that saw many hacks that cost more than $100 million.

Triggered by the BNB exploit

The Cosmos team had reportedly been in touch with the developers of major IBC projects to ensure a patch is applied to the network before the vulnerability can be exploited.

The patch would be made available via the Cosmos SDK so that developers of smaller projects can also upgrade their networks by 14:00 UTC on 14 September.

It was also stated that the patch may be applied without requiring a network halt, and once the upgrade has been approved by a third of voters on the chain.

On the heels of the $100 million cross-chain bridge exploit on BNB Chain on 6 October, the core developers of Cosmos and Osmosis reportedly stepped up security audits. The audits led to the discovery of a vulnerability that had not yet been exploited.

Over $1B and 40 chains at stake

The Cosmos team’s handling of the vulnerability is still up for debate. If the serious vulnerability is not addressed, the DeFi ecosystem’s Total Value Locked (TVL) might lose more than $1 billion.

This is because the Cosmos ecosystem is currently home to over 40 chains, with Cronos, Cava, Thorchain, and Terra Classic being some of the noteworthy protocols with millions of TVL locked in.

Over the past few months, the TVL in DeFi protocols as a whole had dropped significantly. As of this writing, it had fallen from about $140 billion in May to under $54 billion.

The price of ATOM was on an uptrend using trendlines on a daily timeframe. The chart indicated that ATOM had risen by over 200% since the beginning of its rally.

At the time of writing, ATOM was trading between $11 and $12, a rise of almost 6% from the start of the trading period.

Following the successful implementation of the Vasil hardfork, the new daedalus mainnet update has been released.

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Cardano for 2022-2023

The daedalus mainnet’s new upgrade will be supporting the Ledger technology. This upgrade also introduces an optional anonymous usage data analytics collection that will help the IOHK team to prioritize new features and help with bug fixing.

Although the InputOutput team was making progress to help improve the Cardano ecosystem, their development activity was observed to be declining over the last week.

However, for the past couple of days, there was a slight uptick observed in this metric.

The uptick in development activity may garner interest from some investors. However, Cardano’s stakers were not too impressed with Cardano over the past month.

The number of stakers went down by 6.81% over the past week.

One of the reasons for their disinterest could be the declining revenue that was being generated by Cardano’s stakers. According to Staking Rewards, there was a 22.57% decline in Staker revenue over the past 30 days.

Along with the decline in stakers’ interest, there were other bearish factors observed on the Cardano network.

The number of active addresses on the Cardano network declined over the past 30 days. The public sentiment towards Cardano wasn’t too positive as well.

As can be seen from the image below, the weighted sentiment metric dropped significantly over the past month. Thus, indicating that the crypto community had more negative things to say about Cardano than positive.

Cardano’s MVRV ratio was also declining since the past month which indicates a bearish outlook for ADA.

Despite all the bearish indicators, Cardano’s volume observed a massive spike post 13 October.

Well, along with Cardano’s growth in volume, its market cap too saw an uptick. At the time of press, Cardano captured 1.5% of the total crypto market.

Cardano’s price followed suit and was trading at $0.381, at the time of writing with an appreciation of 5.01% over the last 24 hours.",blockchain,ambcrypto.com

A…",https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2022/10/cardano-ada-founder-on-the-importance-of-crypto-friendly-regulatory-frameworks/,"On Thursday (October 13), Charles Hoskinson, Co-Founder and CEO of Input Output Global (aka “IOG”), the blockchain technology firm behind Cardano’s R&D, explained the importance of having regulation that appreciates the benefits offered by cryptocurrencies.

According to a report by The Daily Hodl, the IOG CEO said:

“It’s necessary for us to get [to] the next level. As many of you know, we want Cardano and cryptocurrencies in general to become the financial operating systems of the world. And my big passion in life has always been banking the unbanked and giving the unbanked economic identity that they control, that’s self-sovereign and ultimately global in nature, and ensuring human rights, the freedom of association, commerce and expression.

“To accomplish that there needs to be a regulatory regime that acknowledges the existence of cryptocurrencies, views them as positive things and appreciates the liberty that they provide people.“

On October 11, Hoskinson explained in an interview why he is very bullish on crypto in the long term.

His comments were made during an interview with Maria Bartiromo, the anchor of “Mornings with Maria”, on American cable TV channel Fox Business Network (FBN).

When Bartiromo asked Hoskinson for his current assessment of the crypto market and how he expected crypto regulation in the U.S. to change, the IOG CEO replied:

“It’s a tough market. The stock markets are down nine trillion dollars, and the crypto markets don’t seem to be immune to that, but, you know, I’ve been through seven boom and bus cycles in the last eight years. So, we’ve gotten pretty used to it. We’ve gotten used to volatility, but the fundamentals are still very strong.

“All the infrastructure continues to be built. There’s a lot of great exchanges doing wonderful things. A lot of good protocols doing things. So, like all things, it’s businesses as usual, and most the major actors are still building and still doing interesting things. So, I’m overall very optimistic in a long term, but it’s going to be a rough short term.“

Then, when asked about Coinbase receiving regulatory approval to operate in Singapore, Hoskinson said:

“Well, the United States has been very difficult, and as a result, a lot of crypto companies are going global and that ultimately it means they’re moving jobs and opportunities outside of the United States, and so unless and until that environment gets better, we’re going to continue to see this trend where American companies diversify, whether it be Ripple or Coinbase, and it’s just something that we’ve had to deal with. But overall, it shows you that the people at Coinbase and others in the industry are quite bullish and optimistic about global growth.“

Mitch Roschelle, who is the founding partner of Macro Trends Advisors LLC and who appears regularly as a guest on Fox Business, asked Hoskinson how cryptoassets would be affected by the slowdown in the global economy.

The IOG CEO replied:

“I used to believe that crypto would be counter cyclic and the place that people would put assets when they were fearful of the global economy, but so far they seem to be moving in parallel with tech stocks and some of the more standard equity markets. So that’s kind of a problem. But all things considered, I think that long term the crypto markets are going to decouple from the traditional marketplaces and have their own economy… and, you know, it’s probably going to occur in the next 24-36 months.“

Bartiromo then wanted to know how major blockchain upgrades — like the ones that Ethereum and Cardano have had recently — improve the ecosystem.

Hoskinson told her:

“Well, it’s just like many of the things that we do. We are a slow and methodical project…. Everything we do… is all about making things better, faster, and cheaper, and ultimately improving use and utility in the platform. So, Vasil was about 12 months of work, and we just got it out last month, and it’s really exciting to see that it’s caused a lot of great positive upgrades in our community.

“But more broadly, when we look at the cryptocurrency space, this is the the case. Most people are building, and while the macro environment is not so positive, the individual environment of each cryptocurrency, whether it be Ethereum with the Merge or Cardano with Vasil, is looking better and better every day, and we keep getting more capabilities… There’s great growth and everything from GameFi to metaverse to NFTs to DeFi. So, I’m very bullish in the long term.“",blockchain,cryptoglobe

In a blog post published on Wednesday (October 12), Dhamodharan gave examples of things that Mastercard is doing to “turn cryptocurrencies into an everyday way to pay”:

crypto debit cards : “In Argentina, we launched a prepaid card with Binance that lets users fund their card with their crypto, which is converted to fiat currency immediately when they make payments.“

: “An important way to expand choice for people is to bring certain Mastercard-approved digital assets onto our networks, a plan we announced last year that continues to move forward.“ support for NFTs: “Coinbase users can now pay for NFTs with Mastercard, and in June we announced plans to bring the same capabilities to eight new NFT marketplaces and infrastructure providers.“

On August 2, Mastercard CFO Sachin Mehra shared his thoughts on crypto. His comments were made during an interview with Bloomberg’s Lisa Abramowicz.

With regard to crypto, he said:

“In the crypto world, we play the role as an on-ramp, with people using our debit and credit products to buy crypto. And we act as the off-ramp: When people want to cash it, we help them gain access to be able to use their crypto balances everywhere Mastercard is accepted. That’s a revenue-generating capability which has been fairly successful ever since crypto environments came up…

“For anything to be a payment vehicle in our mind, it needs to have a store of value. If something fluctuates in value every day, such that your Starbucks coffee today costs you $3 and tomorrow it’s going to cost you $9 and the day after it’s going to cost you a dollar, that’s a problem from a consumer-mindset standpoint. So we view crypto more as an asset class. But as a payment instrument, we think stablecoins and CBDCs [digital currencies issued by central banks] potentially have a little bit more runway.“

Justice is not absolute. Despite how one person, or several hundred people, have been wronged, there are loopholes, contracts and lawyers among many other roadblocks in the way of what could be considered “justice”. The recent dismissal of the Chronicles of Elyria plaintiff’s case to have their Kickstarter backing refunded after the unprecedented misuse of the funds resulting in the game falling far short of achieving a single intentional goal is, understandably, not justice. The money has been spent, the game is veritably nonexistent, and yet, the developer still has the audacity to talk about the future, after fleecing so many over a promise that will never materialize. Chronicles of Elyria, Kingdoms of Elyria, and projects like it must end now!

It's easy to disparage crowdfunding campaigns. Realistically, turning to a group of individuals, promising them a product with zero guarantee they will ever receive it already sounds like a losing investment. This doesn’t even broach the fact that Kickstarter MMORPGs have a terrible track record of making their way to completion. The problem goes far deeper than that. See, in this particular situation, backers were misled from the beginning. Whether it was misrepresenting the state of the game from the initial Kickstarter, or it was restarting development on a poor substitute for the initial game with Kingdoms of Elyria, the depths that Soulbound Studios went through to pull the wool over the eyes of their backers is mind blowing. Rehashing the entire saga of Chronicles of Elyria and the ineptitude of the team is not the purpose of this column. However, it’s not to be ignored either.

More appropriately than blaming crowdfunding, it makes far more sense to point the finger at Jeromy “Caspian” Walsh for the shortcomings of what Soulbound Studios has failed to accomplish. In many ways, the fault does lie at his feet. According to the Kickstarter campaign, the team weighed the risks and determined that the funding provided by backers and Walsh’s personal funds would be enough to pull the game through to launch. Yet Walsh didn’t just fall short of completing the initial game. Before there was a game worth the 1.3 million in funds from backers and 7.7 million more that Walsh bilked from his fanbase on their website, the development shut down. There was a gross miscalculation, not just that the funds raised would fund further development, but that the game was nowhere near a reasonably playable state by March of 2020 when Soulbound stopped development and released their employees.

Despite shutting down, Soulbound Studios LLC still picked up a PPP loan of more than 200K dollars to fund development just a month later for the 15 employees he claimed would continue working despite lack of funding. Later Wash attempted to clarify that he wasn’t completely shutting down, but by this time development had already ceased. Nothing tangible came of the game development wise, until a completely new title was revealed, Kingdoms of Elyria, which was a completely different standalone title. Not only was Walsh unable to deliver on the original product, but the attempt to do so after more than 4 years “in development” wasn’t even attempted. Of course, by October of 2020, when the class action lawsuit rolled in, the defense for Soulbound Studios deemed that it was not illegal to change direction following a business reevaluation.

Here’s the thing. Sure, it’s not illegal to “change direction” but when you expect people to pay for a product and never deliver the product, that’s not reevaluating, that’s flat out deceiving them. As “development” rolled on, Walsh moved out of creating Chronicles of Elyria as a valid product and instead moved into the utilization of Blockchain and NFTs as a way to leverage the crypto boom at the time. Now, anyone who has frequented this site knows that, as someone who covers blockchain games regularly, I have a measured approach that doesn’t entirely dismiss these titles with prejudice. In this particular case, the premise Walsh produces for the inclusion of NFTs – a starkly monetization heavy aspect of gaming – when Soulbound Studios failed to produce anything noteworthy after more than 5 years is ludicrous.

If I were to play devils advocate here, I would probably say that when CEO of Souldbound Studios, Jeromy Walsh, started this project, his ambitions were far ahead of his capabilities. We could look at other projects where people were delusional to think that the minuscule funding from Kickstarter would be able to pull an entire MMORPG together. We’ve seen this delusion is rampant with Kickstarted games from Dreamworld, to City of Titans. Though arguably, both of those games are further in delivering on their vision than where Chronicles of Elyria is after 6 years. Say what you will about some of the other crowdfunded games like Camelot Unchained and Star Citizen but by comparison to COE these look like professional studios. Even with delays, and the supreme lack of communication, Walsh is no Mark Jacobs when it comes to handling game development.

The problem is, there’s this underlying ruse that has been permeating the development of Chronicles of Elyria. After the dismissal of the class action lawsuit last week, Walsh posted a lengthy state of the game where he celebrated his vilification, and mansplained the purpose of crowdfunding. The part that irked me the most wasn’t that he was happy the suit was dismissed; it was in the following lines:

“With respect to our backers, now that the legal matters are behind us, and the costs finally capped, we can at last, after two years, put 100% of our attention back on the business of making games. And that's exactly what we're going to do!” - Jeromy Walsh, CEO Soulbound Studios, State of Elyria Post

Soulbound Studios is not in the “making games” business. Delays to a game are one thing, but there comes a time when you have to cut your losses. The only game that's being played is the one Walsh is playing with his backers, and any future investors he attempts to convince. Walsh went into detail about the lengths of debt they have gone into, and with truth to those claims, I can sympathize with him. However, there is no future to the Elyria franchise. Whether or not the lawsuits ruled in favor of the backers who have rightly felt abandoned after nothing materialized for the game that they funded back in 2016, Elyria and Soulbound studios is marred with the kind of controversy that you don’t simply bounce back from.

The snowman has snowed, and he has done so with the exceptional luck of walking away without the court mandating he pay back the costs to backers. This entire saga should be put to rest. The whole idea that somehow Elyria will rise from the ashes as anything more than an attempt to placate the few backers that may have still hung onto hope isn’t worth the detriments that it will cause to backers who will never be pacified, and to Walsh himself, who seems to still live in a universe where there’s still a chance for success. Even if there is a successful launch of Kingdoms of Elyria, it is still a massive and total failure to deliver on the initial promise he made. The entire project needs to be scrapped. But that, after all, is just one man’s opinion.",blockchain,mmorpg.com

Hogan, a Ripple proponent, tells his 232,400 Twitter followers that on September 29th, U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres overruled the SEC’s objections to turning over emails sent by William Hinman – the former SEC Corporation Finance Division Director.

However, the XRP-friendly lawyer highlights that Judge Torres did not specifically say when the SEC should turn over the evidence. In this case, Hogan says that the SEC has two months or more to comply.

“The deadline becomes when an appeal of the judge’s ruling is due. The court is lenient like this because once the documents are handed over, it can’t be ‘undone.’

So, that deadline is, basically, 60 days – maybe longer if they move for reconsideration which I doubt they’d do.”

The evidence in question include internal emails written by Hinman and largely related to a speech he made in 2018 where he stated Ethereum (ETH) was not a security.

Hogan says if the SEC appeals the ruling over the Hinman documents, it could lead to a lengthy legal process and he does not think the regulator has a good chance to win on appeal.

“IF the SEC appeals the ruling, it will take a long time to figure out – months. I personally don’t think the SEC will appeal because it risks adverse BINDING case authority by doing so. Bad facts = bad law. And these are bad facts. But others have different opinions on that.”

Hogan says even if the SEC appeals, he expects the case to advance over whether Ripple violated security laws (Section 5). Ripple argues XRP is not a security and also that they were not given fair notice by the SEC that it was violating any security laws.

Hogan says the Hinman documents only have a bearing on the Fair Notice Defense (FND) issue.

“I believe that Ripple will object to a ruling on the Fair Notice Defense issue because discovery is not complete. It wins that objection. So, even if the SEC appeals the email order, the Section 5 violation issue will continue forward and be fully briefed by Nov. 15th.

NO MATTER WHAT happens on the Hinman email issue, no matter the delay, the main issue will move forward to judgment. If Ripple wins on the Sec 5 violation, the FND becomes moot. IF Ripple loses on Section 5, it can still move for summary judgment on the Fair Notice Defense.”

The SEC sued Ripple in late 2020 under allegations that it issued XRP as an unregistered security.

September closed in style as the highly anticipated Shimmer network went live. This is after weeks of fire testing the Shimmer Beta version, a process which was initiated back in Mid-July as part of IOTA’s road map.

Earlier this week, Dominik Schiener, Co-founder and Chairman of the IOTA Foundation reaffirmed the launch of the Shimmer network and its native token (SMR).

“This is the week where, for the first time since the start of #IOTA in 2015, we launch a new token to the world. Couldn’t be more excited for what will follow.“

The Shimmer network will serve as a staging network for the Shimmer and IOTA ecosystem together with its native token SMR. The SMR tokens are specifically created to bring forth full participation from users on the Shimmer network.

Notably, the Shimmer network launch will bring on the capability of IOTA’s smart contracts running on Shimmer’s network. Additionally, other activities like trading, staking and lending will also be possible on the network.

What Does Shimmer Network Bring to IOTA?

Shimmer outperforms other blockchain networks with the utilization of a DAG-based parallelized settlement layer with a high anchoring capacity similar to IOTA’s. One of the key roles is to verify all developments driven towards the IOTA blockchain. Despite Shimmer offering a feeless and bridgeless layer for tokenizing anything, it will also serve as a hatch for developments of IOTA 2.0.

An essential section on the Shimmer network will be the Stardust module which will enable developers to come up with smart contracts congruous with NFTs and other forms of tokenization. It’s also Shimmer’s hope to offer Decentralized Finance (Defi) applications.

Interestingly, Users will be able to savor the staking services of Shimmer’s native token SMR and receive staking rewards. Firefly Stardust, the official Shimmer network wallet will see it possible users receive their staking rewards according to the official statement.

“A total of ~1,450,896,407 SMR was generated from users staking IOTA. Moreover, the community decided to mint additional tokens to award 10% of the total supply (~181,362,051 $SMR) each to the Swiss Tangle Ecosystem Association (TEA) and the Shimmer Community Treasury (DAO), allowing them to independently fund community projects. The total Shimmer supply is ~1,813,620,509 $SMR.“

Primary Benefits of Shimmer Network

Highly scalable ledger- The DAG ledger of Shimmer is UTXO-based and able to scale to higher transaction throughput with fast finality. For better Scalability, the shimmer network has parallelized the state anchoring of smart contract blockchain.

Native assets– Shimmer users will be able to create, mint and transfer assets natively on the network without any fees. This means that these assets will be in the user’s control without relying on someone else’s smart contract chain.

Application layer with EVM and WASM support- Basing Shimmer as a feature-rich smart contract platform, the network will offer builders the choice to build dApps on EVM or WASM-enabled smart contract blockchains. Additionally, the Network is capable of supporting “multiple, different VMs in parallel, allowing entirely new dApps and Web3 ecosystems to be created”.

MEV protection and native randomness. Shimmer Smart Contract Chains eradicate current network limitations e.g front-running or sandwich attacks.

Fair Token Distribution. One of Shimmer’s most distinctive features, according to Dominic Schiener, co-founder of IOTA, is the way tokens are distributed. There are no VCs, token lock-ups, or secret allocations of tokens to the team.",blockchain,zycrypto

The reason for this growth could be multiple sources of capital flowing into Algorand’s DeFi protocols.

However, there was more to celebrate. Coupled with the growth in the DeFi space, Algorand’s engagement on the social front also observed a significant uptick.

____________________________________________________________________________________

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Algorand for 2022-2023.

____________________________________________________________________________________

Hivemind Capital, a crypto-focused investment firm, invested around $80 million into various Algorand DeFi projects. This could be considered a positive for Algorand’s growth.

As can be seen from the image below, Algorand’s total value locked (TVL) showed massive growth over the past couple of weeks and it grew by 51.75% in the last seven days. ALGO’s overall TVL stood at 266.08 million at the time of press.

Furthermore, ALGO’s growth in the DeFi space went hand-in-hand with Algorand’s growth on the social front.

You go where ALGO

According to LunarCrush, a social media analytics firm, Algorand’s social mentions and engagements both grew respectively. At the time of writing, Algorand’s social mentions increased by 14.28% and its social engagements appreciated by 16.8% in the past seven days.

Algorand’s growth on the social front could have a positive impact on its prices going in the future. Additionally, another indicator of a possible bullish outlook for Algorand would be its increasing weighted sentiment.

ALGO’s weighted sentiment grew massively over the past two weeks, indicating that the overall crypto community had a positive outlook towards Algorand at press time.

Algorand had multiple reasons to rejoice as the blockchain witnessed an uptick in the active addresses count especially in September. The number of active addresses grew by a tremendous 59% over the last 30 days according to data from Messari.

However, a decline was observed in the medium transfer value of Algorand. This indicated that despite the growth in activity on the network, the USD value transferred per transaction had reduced.

Despite good news for the Algorand blockchain, its native token ALGO failed to share the enthusiasm. At press time, Algorand, was trading at $0.315 after depreciating by 3.52% over the last 24 hours.

It’s volume declined by an alarming 65% during the same time period and its market cap fell by 3.20%. Readers who want to hold a long position on Algorand could consider this as an opportunity to get the token at a discount.",blockchain,ambcrypto.com

With the bleeding charts, cryptocurrency investors shifted their attention to more promising cryptocurrencies like Flasko.

Polygon (MATIC) Is Trying To Recover, But Investors Believe That It’s Too Late

Polygon (MATIC) is the first project based on Ethereum to offer a solution to the scaling issue of Ethereum. Polygon (MATIC) offers a series of different blockchain technologies. It will create less efficient blockchain networks, which will maintain stability while operating at peak levels.

The recent bear market created a negative impact on Polygon (MATIC). Polygon (MATIC) experienced a massive price drop. Even though it is trying to recover, Polygon (MATIC) investors are already losing hope.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is No Longer Gaining Attention

When Shiba Inu (SHIB) was initially launched, it received a lot of attention among cryptocurrency investors. Investors such as Elon Musk showed support for Shiba Inu (SHIB), causing the price to skyrocket. However, the hype is now over, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is no longer gaining traction. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is no longer a promising investment for investors.

Flasko (FLSK) Is A Hidden Gem

By taking a look at the list of up-and-coming cryptocurrencies, any cryptocurrency investor with good market knowledge will figure out that Flasko is a hidden gem. Flasko is expected to grow by the end of 2022 and will continue its momentum throughout 2023.

Flasko will create the first alternative-investment platform tailored for cryptocurrency investors. Users will be able to invest in fractionalized NFTs backed with vintage champagnes, premium whiskeys, and fine wines to be invested in.

The team behind Flasko locked its liquidity for 33 years, and it could also receive amazing results from a recently conducted audit from Solid Proof.

The Flasko presale has started, and the current price is around $0.065. Flasko is a promising investment, and we recommend checking it out now.

Binance Pool has launched a $500 million lending project aimed at helping crypto miners keep their heads above water amidst the devastating crypto winter.

The project, which is the first of its kind for Binance Pool, was designed “to provide debt financing services” to public and private blue-chip bitcoin miners and global digital asset infrastructure companies.

“In light of current market conditions, Binance Pool is launching a $500million lending project to support crypto miners and digital infrastructure providers.” Binance wrote in a Friday blog .”As one of the world’s leading crypto mining pools, Binance Pool has a responsibility to help maintain a healthy digital asset ecosystem.”

As per the announcement, applicants will have to pledge security in the form of physical or digital assets for 18-24 months. Further, the loan will attract interest rates ranging from 5% to 10%. As per the exchange, Binance pool would soon launch cloud mining products requesting cloud mining vendors to work with it to boost the cloud mining hash.

The announcement comes as the rout in crypto prices continues to weigh heavily on the mining industry. Following the sharp drop in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices, miners have struggled to keep their mining activities running. Some have been forced to liquidate their BTC holdings to pay operating costs and loan instalments. To make things worse, Bitcoin’s hash rate worsens after soaring to an all-time high on Monday.

So far, public mining companies Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital’s shares have also plummeted by about 70% and 65% year-to-date. Last week, London-based Bitcoin mining firm Argo Blockchain was forced to sell some of its shares to a sole investor for $27 million to ease liquidity pressures and keep its operations up. In September, Computer North, one of the leading crypto mining firms, filed for bankruptcy after it failed to meet its obligations on a $500 million loan owed to more than 200 creditors.

Meanwhile, apart from Binance, various crypto companies have also been offering to bailout miners. Last month, the Decentralized Finance platform Maple Finance launched a lending pool for cash-beleaguered miners with up to 20% interest. Earlier this month, crypto investments firm Grayscale debuted a co-investment vehicle aimed at helping investors acquire bitcoin mining infrastructure amidst the ongoing crypto winter.",blockchain,zycrypto

According to data from crypto market price,https://zycrypto.com/bears-spell-doom-for-cardano-as-price-drops-to-21-month-low-wen-ada-bull-run/,"Advertisement

Cardano (ADA) is firmly in the grasp of bears as the price of the coin has continued to plunge. According to data from crypto market price aggregator CoinMarketCap, ADA has fallen 2.83% to about $0.36 in the last 24 hours — a price level last reached some 21 months ago.

Per CoinMarketCap, the current price of ADA is an 82% and 71% drawdown from one year ago and year to date (YTD), respectively. ADA has reached a long-term low after recently completing the anticipated Vasil Upgrade.

The price decline confirms the prediction of market analyst and chartist Peter Brandt who said in a tweet that the ADA/USD trading pair was in a classic descending triangle pattern. In this technical pattern, Brandt said ADA could fall to a price of less than $0.25, although he adds that charts may not always work.

While the market outlook for ADA is gloomy, Cardano adherents have accepted the bear market and the consequent price dips and negative sentiment accompanying it. Dan Gambardello, a Cardano community member and stakepool operator, admitted that the last year has been challenging for ADA holders. He added that the market may still get tougher but in the end, it would reverse to bullishness.

“ADA holders, I think the last year leading to this current moment was the toughest part. Now we prepare for the last leg of the bear market. It will be volatile & crazy, but the clouds will eventually clear and Cardano will thrive in the next bull cycle. Stay strong & plan,” he wrote.

Bullish Cardano ecosystem fundamentals still in play for ADA

One reason for the confidence exhibited by ardent ADA investors is the progress being made in the Cardano ecosystem. Unphased by the bear market, the Cardano blockchain commercial and venture capital arm EMURGO has recently set up a $200 million fund to incentivize projects building on the network. About $100 million of this fund has been earmarked for EMURGO’s Africa initiative.

Cardano is also now looking ahead to its next major roadmap milestone, the Voltaire era. Input Output Global (IOG) founder Charles Hoskinson said the upgrade would propel the blockchain to be a pioneer in decentralized governance.

“The Age of Voltaire will soon be upon us as an ecosystem. It’s going to unlock the power of the millions of Cardano users and builders. It will again show the rest of the industry how to do decentralized governance just like we did with staking,” he wrote.",blockchain,zycrypto

Critics say it represents a clear failure of governance.,https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/crypto-group-lets-hacker-keep-stolen-80m-20221016-p5bq3n,"The community of decentralised-finance application Mango DAO got back a portion of about $US100 million ($160 million) stolen this week after letting the hacker keep about $US50 million ($80 million) of the funds.

The settlement wraps up several days of tense negotiations between the hacker and Mango, which is governed by its community of token holders who vote on any changes.

Soon after the theft, the hacker posted a proposal in the app’s governance forum asking for bad debts on the platform to be erased – a deal that was not approved by the majority of Mango token holders even after the hacker voted for it with some of the stolen tokens.

The Mango team then posted a counter-proposal, offering to let the hacker keep about $US50 million for the return of the rest of the funds while promising no criminal prosecution and to erase the bad debt.

“We just got notice of the funds being returned,” Maximilian Schneider of Mango said in a Discord message to Bloomberg on Saturday. Community members are expected to meet to discuss how to refund the returned $US67 million to users, with votes on the plans taking place next week, according to Mango’s Twitter.

In a series of tweets on Saturday, an individual took responsibility for the hack, saying he was “involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week” on Mango.",blockchain,australian financial review

However, the attacks on vulnerabilities, including the recent $570 million bridge hack on the BNB Chain stressed the need for industry leaders to address the ongoing problem of safety and security within the space. P3 Network is a company aiding government officials and institutions in the analysis and betterment of this industry, serving as a vital step for the growth, adoption, and overall future of web3 technologies.

The Problem at Hand

Investors entering a new territory are often vulnerable due to their limited experience and knowledge, which makes crypto a scammer's paradise. Scams include disappearing founders, marketing campaigns that lead investors to trust illegitimate projects, pump-and dump schemes where individuals see prices increasing quickly before suddenly dropping, simple hacks where private keys are stolen, and so on. Long story short, there have been over one billion dollars swindled in scams since 2021.

The solution to stop crypto scams in the near term is to work on building a proper regulatory framework and providing the right educational information.

The Road to Effective Mass Adoption

While there are many opportunities for growth and profit in this new digital economy, there are also risks. One major way to mitigate these risks is through education. By learning about the different aspects of web3, investors, governments, and institutions can make more informed decisions, better understand the associated risks, and implement emerging technologies more efficiently.

Along with this, support from governments goes hand-in-hand. The industry currently faces a lack of structure and regulation from governments, and the problem it presents is twofold. For one, it allows for large companies to take advantage of the situation and establish monopolies within the industry. Secondly, it also leaves room for fraud and scams to proliferate. The Wild West atmosphere of the Internet age is what led to the Dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s, and a similar situation could easily happen again with Web3.

The Solution - Building a legitimate Ecosystem

The desire for countries and institutions to quickly adopt the technology and gain a first-mover advantage, yet be surrounded by an unregulated state of affairs, is simply not sustainable in the long run. P3 is stepping in to provide guidance and oversight to not only individuals but also government bodies and large establishments.

The platform is focused on global roundtable dialogue, and addresses financial risk, invests in core manufacturing sectors, accelerates the growth of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies, and creates ecosystems that benefit nations across the globe. Their ability to create legitimate connections with stakeholders, government officials, and business leaders worldwide to build projects with strong fundamentals and value, makes the network a recognized leader in the field of blockchain technology.

Today, one of the best platforms for facilitating quicker and simpler international financial transactions is Stellar. A decentralized on-chain protocol serves as its foundation. Its own cryptocurrency, Lumens (XLM), is used as the transaction fee.

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Stellar [XLM] for 2023-24

Individuals instead of organizations are more interested in Stellar as a platform for small-amount payments. It is becoming increasingly well-known as a result of its simple user interface.

Stellar enables real-time transactions to occur anywhere in the world in as little as five seconds. A new smart contracts platform called Soroban has released its second preview. The upgrade intends to increase platform developer friendliness, scalability, and sensibility.

Only recently, Ethereum transitioned from the proof-of-work (PoS) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism following the Merge. The step underlines the need for cryptocurrencies to move towards eco-friendly methods. In this regard, Stellar is very promising as it has a smaller carbon footprint. Its authentication cycle is also fast, keeping energy use to a minimum.

Acting as decentralized currency exchange, Stellar helps you track all of your assets with an order book. You can sell, buy and manage all of your assets here, with XLM acting as an intermediate currency for paying transaction fees. The currency is very useful for the users because it helps you reduce transaction costs.

The Stellar network makes transactions seamless and reduces fees for micro-payments and remittances in order to make financial services affordable and accessible to the world.

Transactions on the Stellar platform are performed swiftly due to the ease of Lumens. The currency not only makes transactions seamless for the sender and the recipient but also ensures that transactions are secure.

Jed McCaleb, Co-founder, and CTO of Stellar said in an interview with CoinMarketCap that XLM is used in a fundamental way for the network.

“Maybe that affects the price, maybe price is a secondary indicator of how useful the underlying protocol is in some way… But I think that the trend is there: that where price and utility can come into play.”

XLM is listed on a number of crypto exchanges including Binance, eToro, Huobi Global, CoinTiger, FTX, and OKEx. This shows that the currency is an increasingly accepted choice of investors now.

A total of 100 billion XLMs were issued when the Stellar network was launched in 2015. In 2019, the group announced that it was burning over half of the cryptocurrency’s supply. Stellar mentions on its website that currently, there are around 50 billion XLMs in existence; 20 billion XLMs are in circulation and 30 billion XLMs are retained by the Stellar Development Foundation for project development. Nothing more will be created.

In an interview in March 2022, Stellar CEO Denelle Dixon said that despite its ongoing military conflict with Russia, Ukraine is still working with Stellar on its central bank digital currency (CBDC). The progress, however, has not been at the expected speed due to the crisis. She added that Stellar is “talking to the administration about things that we can do to help with … humanitarian aid needs.” She also commended Ukraine’s decision to accept cryptocurrency donations for aid.

Also, it was only recently that XLM got listed on the leading cryptocurrency exchange Robinhood, significantly spiking its price.

Due to its increasing adoption, XLM is among the top 30 cryptocurrencies in the world right now, with a market capitalization of under $3 billion.

Why these projections matter

Where Stellar trumps other financial platforms is its low transaction fees which have drawn a huge number of cryptocurrency users to it. It is one of the few blockchain networks that has been successful in collaborating with large tech corporations such as Deloitte and IBM. Stellar, in partnership with IBM, launched a project that enables fintech to engage in financial transactions using assets such as stablecoins.

It must be noted that Stellar is one of the large corporations that are operating in the cryptocurrency market. It is one of the most centralized cryptocurrency networks active on the internet. While the Stellar network uses decentralized nodes, it doesn’t have that many validators. Such an infrastructure gives the group a lot of control over the operations and price movement of XLM.

In 2016, Deloitte announced a partnership with Stellar, along with four other blockchain networks, to provide new technological capabilities to its global financial institution client base.

In June 2018, the Fortune reported that New York financial regulators approved Stellar Lumens to trade on the itBit exchange, the first time the state’s authorities have given it the green light.

In October 2021, IBM partnered with Stellar to facilitate cross-border payments by banks. The system uses XLM as a bridge currency for transactions and it has been successful in the South Pacific region.

The same year, Moneygram announced a partnership with Stellar. Its integration with Stellar facilitates the conversion of the USDC stablecoin into cash and vice versa. The facility aims to encourage the liquidity of cryptocurrencies and the integration of traditional and cryptocurrencies.

In October 2021, Flutterwave, a global payments technology company, also announced two new remittance corridors between Europe and Africa on the Stellar network. The step is a major step in Stellar’s expansion in the global market.

It also succeeded in receiving certification from the Islamic scholars of Bahrain in 2018, aiming to integrate the technology into the field of sharia-compliant financial products, reported Reuters.

“We have been looking to work with companies that facilitate remittances, including in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. It’s a huge market,” said Lisa Nestor, the then-director of partnerships at Stellar. Since the Middle East and South Asian regions are key areas of growth for the group where a lot of countries are run on a sharia-compliant system, this is a major success for Stellar.

Developing economies are the main focus of the Stellar network in the areas of remittances and loans. It primarily aims to target those who are still not part of the traditional banking system.

In June 2022, the global platform for modern money movement, Nium, and Stellar announced a partnership to enable payouts to 190 countries. “This integration truly drives home the value that blockchain-powered cross-border payment solutions bring to the current financial system,” said Denelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director of the Stellar Development Foundation. “At SDF, we are always working to fill up the map and connect the network to more of the globe. Together with Nium, we are thrilled to expand the reach of the Stellar network so significantly.”

In an interview with Pymnts last year, Nestor said that digital assets are a tool for everyone and that this asset space will grow. Bitcoin, stablecoins, Dogecoin, and other assets can all coexist in a single interoperable network and create an inclusive financial system. “We hear from our partners around the world that the ability to save, access, and transact seamlessly across borders, with dollars, is something that draws a lot of interest and demand,” she added. Stellar aims to leverage its system in such a way that makes it both accessible and easy to use for people and businesses all over the world.

Another prominent feature of Stellar is that it gives power to the community to decide what project(s) the blockchain should focus on.

We will now briefly give an overview of the key performance indicators of XLM such as price and market capitalization. We will then summarize what the world’s leading crypto-analysts have to say about the future of this currency, along with its Fear & Greed Index.

XLM’s Price, Market Cap, and everything in between

XLM’s price has hiked significantly over the last few years. Back in 2018-2019, it kept falling below its previous ATH of around $0.93 (recorded in early January 2018). It was only in 2021 that its price again began to rise, hitting a price level of over $0.7 around mid-May. However, as the cryptocurrency market collapsed in the second quarter of 2022, XLM went into a bearish dive.

At the time of writing, it was trading at $0.112, with a market capitalization of a little below $3 billion.

The market capitalization of the cryptocurrency follows its price trends throughout. In early January 2018, it was nearly $9 billion and it skyrocketed to as high as $16.5 billion (May 2021) during the crypto-boom of 2021. In fact, it was performing fairly well in 2022 too until the market crashed during the year’s second quarter.

Stellar has seen many growth spurts over the past few years, such as when Mercado Bitcoin announced its use of the platform. In less than a year, Stellar housed almost 3 million user accounts. Since that time, however, Stellar has built a network of partners that includes Flutterwave and MoneyGram.

XLM’s 2025 Predictions

Readers should first be aware of certain things about market predictions. Different crypto-analysts may choose different sets of parameters to predict the prices of currencies. Therefore, it is self-evident that their analyses and predictions will widely vary. Besides, none can foresee certain political or economic changes such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis or China’s decision to ban crypto-mining. Investors should therefore conduct their own research before deciding to invest in any cryptocurrency.

Nicole Willing is a financial journalist with over a decade of experience. She writes for the Capital and she recently claimed that the price of XLM has now stabilized after stumbling in May due to the collapse of Terra.

In fact, according to Willing, the altcoin could trade at around $0.325 by the end of 2025. Another AI-based forecaster AI Pickup predicted the average price of XLM in 2025 to be $0.14.

A Changelly blog post added that many experts have observed the prices and fluctuations of XLM over the years, concluding that the crypto could go as high as $0.51 and as low as $0.42 in 2025. Its average price will remain around $0.43 in the said year, it added, with potential ROI of the altcoin projected to be 292%.

On the contrary, Finder’s panel of experts are a little more optimistic about where they see XLM going in the next few years. While the average prediction for 2025 centered around XLM being valued at $12.5, there were outlier predictions which places the crypto’s value at $150 by the aforementioned year.

XLM’s 2030 Predictions

The aforementioned Changelly blog post also predicted that the maximum and minimum prices of XLM in 2030 will be $2.97 and $2.56, respectively.

According to Willing’s predictions, experts are both bullish and bearish in their assessment of the performance of XLM in 2030. Some predict that it could go as high as $1.28 while some predict that it won’t be able to hike over $0.352.

On the contrary, Telegaon writes that 2030 could be a year of change for the cryptocurrency market as many coins’ values might reach their peaks during this period. It is extremely bullish in its forecast that the cryptocurrency might hit a maximum level of $31.02.

Finder’s panel, as expected, was even more optimistic on this front. It projected a maximum value of $200 for XLM by the year 2030, with an average price of $17.66 for the cryptocurrency.

Now, while the aforementioned projections might sound crazy, there may be some logic to it too. Consider this – Many nation-states across the world are actively considering Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Stellar securing a partnership with Ukraine to provide a CBDC infrastructure could be the catalyst it sorely needs. In fact, according to Finder,

“If successful, it may mean the project becomes the go-to infrastructure provider for governments globally.”

Furthermore, according to Dr. Iwa Salami,

“As an increasing number of countries around the world explore CBDCs, concrete examples of successful implementation of these projects by blockchain technology firms is likely to increase the value of their native cryptocurrencies. As such, this may result in an increase in the price of XLM.”

Not everyone’s convinced though, with some like Professor John Hawkins claiming that such updates are unlikely to “save the coin.”

Even so, it’s worth pointing out that most do see some positive impact on XLM’s prices.

It was in March this year that Stellar stated in its blog that it will launch Project Jump Cannon, an E&D venture to introduce native smart contracts for its blockchain. The same month, it also introduced the Starbridge project that would create bridges between Stellar and other blockchains, enabling interoperability. If Stellar continues to adopt more of such innovations and succeeds in building a larger community, it would significantly increase its price by 2030.

Conclusion

The Stellar team plans to focus on three strategic building blocks in 2022, viz. (i) increasing network scalability and innovation, (ii) activating more network participation, and (iii) promoting diversity and inclusion.

In June 2022, the system upgraded Protocol 19, building payment channels and key recovery channels. Stellar is also working on Project Jump Cannon to facilitate a robust execution environment for smart contracts.

This year, many crypto exchanges such as WhiteBIT, CoinMe, and Mercado Bitcoin enabled USD-backed stablecoin transactions, increasing access to USDC on Stellar.

Stellar has, time and again, stressed its role in increasing financial inclusion across the globe. In particular, it focuses on working towards better micro-finance management. It has partnered with financial institutions like FinClusive to make financial transactions over banking networks easier and seamless. Today, it operates in association with a number of financial institutions across the globe, shaping the future of a financial system that is welcoming to cryptocurrency.

Any financial institution can integrate with Stellar and avoid the hassle of building its own payment gateway. This facility makes the process innovative and specialized. Besides, the associated costs for both the platforms and its customers are incredibly low, making Stellar the preferred choice of many global financial institutions. This integration connects these global players in such a way that interoperability and communication among different systems are seamless.

These developments are certain to boost Stellar’s credibility among users. Besides, XLM is one of the most eco-friendly cryptocurrencies. Its consensus model is faster than both PoS and PoW, making it the preferred choice of many investors.

The Stellar network is considered to be a rival to the Ripple network. While Ripple helps banks make fund transfers, Stellar helps individuals outside the banking system make fund transfers. Its simple, swift, and economical process has made it very popular among users across several developed countries.

The unique features of Stellar such as strategic partnerships and convenience make XLM one of the most reliable crypto investments. Its growth as a payments network will be the most important factor influencing the future of XLM.

A significant accomplishment of Stellar is the integration of the global financial system while cutting fees. Stellar has a sizable user base, which is not surprising given that it has become a crucial tool for enabling economic empowerment. Despite being embroiled in a legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Stellar’s Lumens coin is a major cryptocurrency to wager on.

We must note that XLM will be scarce in the future as Stellar doesn’t plan to mint more currency. As it becomes increasingly rare, its value is bound to increase. Such a possible scenario could make XLM a potentially lucrative investment asset.

210,SCAM ALERT: Old 1inch Address Used by Malefactors' Contract,https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/2022-10/24817.jpg,15/10/2022,"Attackers deployed malicious contract to old address of one of most popular DeFi protocols, 1inch",https://u.today/scam-alert-old-1inch-address-used-by-malefactors-contract,"Attackers deployed malicious contract to old address of one of most popular DeFi protocols, 1inch

Seasoned developer Justin Bebis, CEO of Byte Masons Web3 development studio, reported that one of the old wallets of 1inch Network (1INCH) addresses is abused by malefactors.

Old Fantom (FTM) wallet of 1inch Network under attack

Bebis has taken to Twitter to inform users that an old address on the Fantom (FTM) network that was previously used by 1inch Network (1INCH) multi-blockchain DeFi protocol, is controlled by malefactors.

‼️It seems that someone deployed a malicious contract to an old @1inch address. Likely computed the address using the Profanity hack. One of our users was affected - please make sure you all revoke approvals if you've ever used their platform on Fantom.https://t.co/Vfb5HaaWkv — bebis ~ Byte Masons | BlockBytes (@0xBebis_) October 14, 2022

The attackers deployed a malicious contract to the address 0x11111112542d85b3ef69ae05771c2dccff4faa26. As such, all DeFi users who interacted with the contract put their money at risk.

Bebis asked all Fantom (FTM) users who had approved transactions with the aforementioned compromised address involved to immediately revoke them.

As of printing time, the address is labeled as an ""Exploit"" and ""Phish/Hack"" address by a major Fantom (FTM) network explorer service FTMScan. It is highly likely that the attackers use the same vector as the recent exploit of ""Profanity"" addresses that made headlines in mid-September 2022.

1inch co-founder Sergej Kunz announces refund program

Back then, attackers exploited the generators of ""vanity"" (partially human-readable) addresses; they accessed key generation instruments and drained over $3.3 million.

Following Bebis' alert, Sergej Kunz, one of the 1inch Network founders, explained that some users of API endpoints authorized transactions to a Fantom address that, in fact, only existed on the Ethereum (ETH) network (Ethereum and Fantom contracts use the same 0x-like addresses).

Hi! Yes some API users did a mistake and created approvals on Fantom for contract which was only existing on Ethereum. Foundation has a refund program which can be used by request. — Sergej Kunz (@deacix) October 15, 2022

Also, Kunz stated that a refund program had been launched and he had already informed affected users. He also stated that law officers of 1inch are ready to report the attack to the police.",blockchain,u.today

Joining the multi-awarding winning artist and producer on the track are Julian, Ky-Mani and Jo Mersa Marley — relatives of the legendary reggae icon Bob Marley.

The single comes from MAFFIO's latest full-length album Eso Es Mental. The 25-track record was released in May 2022 by Sony Music Latin.

MAFFIO heads to the metaverse for new single ""Blessings""

Dominican urban recording artist and producer MAFFIO has partnered with CEEK for his latest single's release. The music video for ""Blessings"" is available via the virtual reality metaverse platform, which is accessible via its official website and the CEEK VR application.

MAFFIO is the latest of an increasingly star-studded roster at CEEK. Previously, the platform has hosted concerts and music videos from Lady Gaga, Demi Lovato, Ringo Starr, Ziggy Marley and others.

CEEK is a blockchain-based entertainment platform that looks to bring artists closer to their fans via virtual and augmented reality experiences. Deployed on Binance Smart Chain, it offers an NFT marketplace where fans can buy and sell collectibles from world-renowned artists, and many of its features are powered via its native crypto asset, which trades under the ticker symbol CEEK.

MAFFIO collaborates with three Marleys on first metaverse foray

Joining MAFFIO on ""Blessings"" are Julian, Ky-Mani and Jo Mersa Marley. Julian and Ky-Mani are both sons of the late, great Bob Marley and Jo Mersa is the legendary reggae artist's grandson.

As cited in a press release detailing the CEEK partnership, MAFFIO commented on the track's guest artists:

""Having the collaboration of Ky-Many, Julian and Jo Mersa is a privilege and a proof of brotherhood because although I am Dominican and not Jamaican, it means a lot to me that we can together send a message of blessing to the world.""

The single appears on the album Eso Es Mental, which was released in May 2022. Yet, the song is not new for the award-winning artist.

MAFFIO commented on the decision to release the track as a single now:

""The song has been around for almost four years, but I firmly believe that God's timing is perfect, and this is the right time to promote it, due to everything that is happening nowadays around the world.""

In addition to the collaboration with CEEK and the legendary Marley family, the ""Blessings"" video is made even more special by the inclusion of MAFFIO's two daughters. The album Eso Es Mental is available now on all major digital streaming platforms.

In a new strategy session, Pizzino tells his 276,000 YouTube subscribers that regardless of the smart contract platform’s fundamental growth over the past months, the charts tell him that ADA could ignite another sell-off event if it fails to hold a key support level.

“The final capitulation zone: we’ve looked at this between $0.17 and $0.33 for ADA and currently the lows are $0.35. If it can’t hold that $0.38, we’re currently at $0.378, yes, it’s going to probably trend around between this zone of $0.26 and $0.38…

It has to get back above approximately that $0.38 to $0.40 level quite quickly. Otherwise, we’re in for some more grindy time. And probably lower prices over the coming months.”

Cardano is trading at $0.367 at time of writing. A move to Pizzino’s target suggests a downside potential of more than 53% for ADA.

Turning to fellow smart contract protocol Solana (SOL), the crypto analyst warns of “more trouble” ahead if the Ethereum (ETH) rival falls below the $29 price level.

“If it [Solana] closes below this level of about $29.80, $29.90, so $29, that’s going to be a little bit more trouble and probably head towards that previous low of between $25 and $26 dollars.

So that’s what you want to look out for, for the end-of-day close here and then also for the end-of-the-week [close] for Solana.

Otherwise, this is probably leaning to more towards the rest of those cryptos capitulating.”

Solana is valued at $30.05 at time of writing.

Pizzino is also watching smart contract-enabled blockchain Fantom (FTM), which he says could fall further just like “most altcoins.”

“This thing [Fantom] has just tested new lows ($0.2062)… It is looking rather weak. However, top to the current low, 94.6% down from the high…

I think there’s still a fair bit more time to go for most altcoins. And so if this was to drop a little bit further, it could go anywhere underneath that $0.10. Currently at $0.20, which means it will be another 50% down from the current price.”

Fantom is swapping hands at $0.2085 at time of writing.

Russians have hopped on stablecoins to circumvent Western sanctions to send trading volumes to new highs.

The decision by SWIFT to kick out Russian banks from the network plays a role in the spike in stablecoin use.

A recent study shows that Eastern Europe has recorded the highest number of illegal and risky crypto transactions since the start of the year.

In the wake of tightening sanctions, Russians are drawn by the allure of virtual currencies as a way to settle cross-border transactions, but the Kremlin’s position remains unclear.

Russian citizens are recording higher stablecoin volumes following sanctions mounting up after the invasion of Ukraine. A report released on Oct 12 by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis shows that Russia’s stablecoin transaction volume has spiked to 67% from 42% at the start of the year.

The increase in stablecoin volumes is linked to sanctions meted out by the European Union (EU) and citizens who wish to bypass internal virtual asset regulation by the government. The removal of Russia from the cross-border system SWIFT has seen citizens switch to cryptocurrencies to make transactions, with the preferred option being stablecoins due to their price stability.

Citizens, on their part, have opted for stablecoins against the Ruble to protect their assets amid inflation concerns.

“While some of that may be due to businesses encouraging cryptocurrency for international transactions, it’s also likely that some of the increase is due to ordinary Russian citizens trading for stablecoins to protect their asset value”, the report noted.

Last month, Russia’s Deputy Finance Minister, Alexey Moiseev, revealed that Russia is exploring stablecoins against the backdrop of Western sanctions to make payments with “friendly countries.”

“We are currently working with several countries to create bilateral platforms in order not to use dollars and euros. Stablecoins can be pegged to some generally recognized instrument, for example, gold, the value of which is clear and observable for all participants.”

Russia’s indecisive crypto policy

With the mass adoption of digital currencies, Russia initially turned its back on Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, citing regulatory concerns and possible illicit use. In 2019, the government reportedly began exploring distributed ledger technology (DLT) and decided to launch its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to mitigate the problems associated with cryptocurrencies.

At the start of the year, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin hinted that the country could do well mining Bitcoin as the miners flocked to the country following China’s crackdown in the summer of 2021. In July, Putin signed a law banning citizens from trading virtual assets, but the planned use of stablecoins for cross-border payments has left analysts wondering how Russian regulators plan to juggle both legislation regimes.",blockchain,zycrypto

Earning.farm drained for almost $1 million, here's how

As per a statement shared by California-based Web3 security vendor Supremacy Inc., earning.farm DeFi suffered two attacks yesterday, Oct. 15, 2022.

1/ Hi, @EarningFarm, your EFLeverVault contract was hit by a Flashloan attack that resulted in a cumulative profit of 480 Ether from the MEV Bot and 268 Ether from the hackers. here is a brief vulnerability analysis of the attack.https://t.co/Faw9FyWae1 pic.twitter.com/jhXuqbq1dJ — Supremacy Inc. (@Supremacy_CA) October 14, 2022

EFLeverVault, a key element of earning.farm DeFi's design, was targeted by flash loan attacks. Due to an architecture flaw of its contract, attackers managed to withdraw all Ethers (ETH) stored in the contract that was designed to act as collateral.

As explained by a seasoned blockchain security researcher Daniel Von Fange, a contract of EFLeverVault filed to verify the initiator of the large withdrawal:

Ads

The 750 ETH hack from EFLeverVault a few hours ago happened because the contract did not verify that flashloan callbacks were actually initiated by the protocol, allowing the attacker to tell the protocol to withdraw large amounts of funds

As a result, a total of 750 Ethers was siphoned from the protocol: 480 Ethers ended up in an MEV bot, while 268 Ethers were withdrawn by hackers.

Hack season instead of ""Uptober""

As Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, was changing hands at $1,300 yesterday on major spot trading platforms, net losses might exceed $950,000.

October 2022 will be remembered as a month of unmatched attacks against the mainstream DeFi infrastructure. On Oct. 7, 2022, a bridge between two elements of BNB Chain was exploited for $566 million.

On Oct. 12, Solana-based liquidity protocol Mango was drained of $100 million as a malefactor managed to manipulate the price oracles.

Later, the Mango community agreed to pay the largest bug bounty to the hacker: they receive $47 million and return the rest of the funds affected.",blockchain,u.today

The Bitwise CEO’s comments were made on October 10 during a conversation with Emily Chang on Bloomberg Television’s daily show “Bloomberg Technology”.

According to a report by The Daily Hodl, Horsley said:

“Crypto is down about 60%, or thereabouts – it’s changing every day. So the story of this year is definitely a bear market. Nevertheless, we’ve seen increased interest from our client base. And I think the backdrop for many crypto investors is that there have historically been four-year cycles, and while there are opportunities to make money in many crypto market moments, bear markets are the moments when fortunes can be made. So there are some that are positioning themselves in the current bear market and are coming into the space now...

“The historical pattern of crypto with the data we have – 12 years of a journey – is that we get four-year cycles. We get three years of bull markets with growing momentum and then we get a bear market year. So in 2014, the market down almost 60%. 2018 – market down north of 70%. And this year, obviously, 2022, the market down around 60%. The expectation, if the market continues its historical trend, would be that we begin a new cycle next year.“

On October 4, Bitwise, which claims to be “the world’s leading crypto index fund manager with more than $1.3 billion in assets under management”, announced the launch of the Bitwise Web3 ETF (ticker: BWEB, which uses a strategy that “gives investors access to companies well positioned to benefit from the emergence of Web3, a term used to describe the next wave of the internet’s development characterized by greater decentralization and individual ownership of data.”

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan stated:

“Today, many experts believe we’re on the cusp of a major evolution in the core architecture of the internet. Any shift of that magnitude will depend on companies that can provide the services and infrastructure to support it. With the Bitwise Web3 ETF, we’re excited to give investors the opportunity to capture one of the fastest-emerging themes in technology through a diverse mix of companies that we believe will lead the charge.“

The press release went on to say that the Bitwise Web3 Equities Index on which the fund is based “includes broad exposure to companies spread across five key themes: Web3 Infrastructure Providers, Web3 Finance, Web3-Enabled Metaverse and Digital Worlds, Web3-Enabled Creator Economy, and Web3 Development and Governance” and that “more than 85% of the portfolio will be invested in companies directly linked to Web3 themes and business activities.”

And the Bitwise CEO had this to say:

“Today’s Web3 companies are not only helping reshape the internet as we know it, but they’re among some of the most disruptive and fastest-growing firms in the world. The Bitwise Web3 ETF seeks to capitalize on this great opportunity by offering investors of innovation a straightforward way to access the space. It also leverages our expertise in crypto—the cornerstone of Web3—as many of these companies are centering their businesses on blockchain technology. We’re looking forward to seeing their anticipated continued growth as the space unfolds.“",blockchain,cryptoglobe

According to the Poloniex CEO, he might be the biggest HT holder as Huobi Global finalizes a new ownership transfer. The controversial figure said this statement in a recent interview with Bloomberg.

Sun had initially declared that he was not taking over at the exchange but only acting in an advisory role. However, recent activities from the Huobi exchange might indicate that the Tron [TRX] founder had secured a stake in the company.

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Huobi Token for 2022-2024

This was because Wu Blockhain revealed that about 74 million HT were transferred into a wallet belonging to Sun. Hence, creating rumors of a private handover.

74 million HT of Huobi’s two official wallets have been transferred to two new addresses on October 13, and the first transactions were from Justin Sun’s poloniex. The HT officially held by Huobi may be part of the acquisition of Huobi Exchange and has been handed over to Sun. https://t.co/O3SexjA8io — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 14, 2022

The Etherscan receipt showed that Huobi sent the tokens worth $583.86 million into the “Poloniex 4” wallet. However, it did not seem like HT was concerned about slowing down its surge.

At press time, CoinMarketCap showed that HT was 13.85% up from the previous day’s price. While it decreased earlier to $7.39, it regained its bullish drive, trading at $7.87, at the time of this writing.

Of highs and lows

Although there had been a continuous uptick in some aspects, a few others experienced lows. According to Santiment, the HT one-day circulation which rallied to 74.23 million on 13 October had dwindled.

The on-chain analytic platform revealed that the circulation, at press time, was a mere 93,800.

Conversely, the HT 24-hour active addresses had not stopped increasing. At press time, it was up to 339. This translates to the fact that despite some ease in trading, HT was still a token of interest in the crypto market.

In addition, the reflection of the active addresses may suggest that some parts of the crypto community trust Sun’s judgment. On the exchange part, active deposits seemed to have decreased. Santiment noted that HT deposits on exchanges as of this writing were six.

However, it was likely that HT investors could be considering selling their holdings in non-custodial wallets. The exchange supply revealed this.

According to Santiment data, HT supply on exchanges had risen to 16.82 million.

Meanwhile, it did not seem like HT investors would lose that much if the token price slightly decreased.

According to the thirty-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, investors who held the token since the start of October would still be in profit. Despite a decline to 19.02%, the MVRV showed that more gains could be on the way.",blockchain,ambcrypto.com

In addition, the platform is developed for the noble cause of African Freedom. It focuses on the development of Africa in terms of technology and digital space. CYF wants to enhance the opportunities in the continent for the people of Africa. To achieve these targets, CYF facilitates its users through additional services such as:

Blockchain Technology secures the algorithm; therefore, nobody, even the developer, can interfere with, cancel, or alter your transactions.

The smart contract code is open source, and anyone anytime can observe the entire transaction history. It ensures fair and reliable accountability conditions.

Everyone venturing into the Crypto-Currency has one thing in mind `What's in it for me? `. That's precisely what CYF answers to while ensuring long-term sustainability.

Reliable 3rd parties auditing firms have fully audited CYF token contract and the Smart-Mint contract.

About the Company – CYF: Community Yield Farming

CYF, abbreviated as Community Yield Farming, is the world's first platform to reward holders directly from ICO while sustaining its liquidity while at the same time preventing any possible rug-pull. It is developed by the co-founders Bright Hoza and Kalvin Hoka. The token mainly represents the African community. It never had any financial system that could make them achieve its goal of reaching 5 billion dollars to help all 54 countries of Africa financially to become a free continent.

Due to CYF’s token’s stunning performance and rapid expansion, major global investors have started investing in the project, such as wolf of Congo took notice of the early beta version of the CYF Token and invested immediately. In addition, CYF also is planning to add more bitcoin atm (CYF ATMs) all over Africa.

As a platform committed to equally serving both collectors and creators, Magic Eden is ready to offer resourcing that will allow creators to contend with a rapidly changing market. With the $1M Creator Monetization Hackathon, Magic Eden will be fostering the creation of new creator business models as well as collaborating with partners to develop tools that support a sustainable creator ecosystem.

Magic Eden CEO and Co-Founder Jack Lu commented on today's news: ""We've recently experienced seismic shifts in the NFT ecosystem. The movement away from creator royalties has been an unfortunate trend, but one that seems inevitable given that royalties are not enforceable at the protocol level. It is a trend that we are hoping can be reversed long-term. To accelerate new innovations on creator business models and royalty protecting tools, we are running a $1M Hackathon with the community to develop new creator royalties tools that will protect and support creators. We believe this initiative will help us continue to champion a creator-centric business. Our hope is that this is a temporary circumstance and that royalties return as a consistently viable business model in the future.""

For NFT creators, the potential to receive regular royalties from future sales has attracted thousands of talented creatives to enter the web3 space. Since royalties are not enforceable on the blockchain, and, in practice, are only payable at the discretion of the platform and collector, users are increasingly opting to purchase NFTs on platforms that allow them to bypass royalty fees. Effective today, Magic Eden will also be enabling optional royalties on their platform and allowing NFT buyers to opt into full, half, or no royalties. The Creator Monetization Hackathon will help reduce the business impact felt during this transition to an optional creator royalty model and will also incubate tools that will protect royalty revenue and explore new models of monetization.

It is evident that creators need alternative monetization tools and the second part of the Creator Monetization Hackathon will help cover the initial costs of experimentation for creators. In lieu of royalties, creators at this time can explore holding a portion of their supply to introduce back to the market later or set up their own liquidity pools. Top projects can also be able to explore ancillary revenue streams with Boots, a protocol that allows users to customize trait/skins-based SFTs (semi-fungible tokens) for their existing NFTs. Creators who have a compelling monetization model or are exploring royalty protection tools will be able to apply to the hackathon for grant money and investment support.

t2’s mission is to encourage deep reading, create a social experience around reading, and bring a promising solution to the global reduced attention span. This investment brings t2 closer to its goal of empowering readers and writers to grow their communities in the Web3 space by utilizing new economic and voting tools leveraged by blockchain technology.

Believing that those tools can be employed for promoting human-centric ethics and community, the team led by Mengyao Han, CEO & Founder of t2.world, is building a more transparent, decentralized, and collaborative narrative for the future and an alternative for the extractive attention economy.

Aligning incentives between readers, writers and curators

t2 enables users to monetize their time and attention investment as they interact with content by ushering in a new read to contribute, read and earn model. By utilizing this model, the platform provides infrastructure for decentralized communities (DAOs) to develop and monetize their subcultures by curating high-quality content.

t2 is designed as a decentralized online publisher that promotes collaboration, with the incentives between different users (writers, readers, and curators) thoughtfully aligned so that everyone collects fair rewards for contributing.

t2’s protocol uses time as a matrix of value capture and distribution by passively minting and dispersing tokens with real world value to content creators, readers, and communities for participating in the ecosystem and playing an integral part in curating the content.

This seemingly utopian world is about to become a reality powered by Proof-of-Attention tokens, TXT (Time X Time), which embodies how users contribute to the network from their interactions with content and subsequently return them with tangible value.

The protocol is designed to capture the curation value generated from users’ time spent deep reading and the platform’s native token represents the value created from one hour of curated human attention in attention markets.

“We couldn’t be more excited about working with the phenomenal t2 team. t2 is a user-owned platform taking a leap to a new model of humane content curation through a read-and-earn incentive mechanism. At the core of this mechanism lies the human time spent on deep content interaction (Proof-of-Attention). We believe that t2’s approach holds the potential to turn the internet on its head by replacing clickbait with quality content for people to read and learn,” commented Alexander Lange, Founding Partner at Inflection VC.

The exciting roadmap ahead

t2, based primarily in London, will be deploying the $3.4M investment toward creating the platform’s revolutionary Proof-of-Attention (PoA) model to incentivize deep reading, developing a vibrant, sustainable reader and writer community and hiring key talents.

t2 is in the midst of development, and plans for working on the Beta product and onboarding the first group of writers and high-quality content are in motion. Aiming to launch the first version in late 2022, preparations for building the community and setting up the ambassador program as an extended team are underway.

Focused on helping decentralized communities to form and grow their subculture, t2 is also laying the groundwork for developing content partnerships, connecting with writers, content houses, and DAOs, and defining the future of t2 together with strong subculture allies. In the meantime, t2 is inviting new users to test the product, report bugs, and suggest new features. Anyone interested in being an Alpha tester, is encouraged to sign up via the allowlist application.

“We are ecstatic to support t2. Mengyao and the team bring a unique, experienced UX/UI lens to web3 content alongside a disruptive Read-and-Earn mechanism. We at Archetype believe t2 can unlock an untapped market by designing a new era in content consumption and curation whereby users become stakeholders rewarded for their contributions,” noted Ash Egan, Founder and General Partner at Archetype.

Register here.

The decentralized nature of Web3 projects has made it a challenge for traditional regulatory organizations to govern them. For a long time, the community saw this as a positive because it meant that these projects were outside of government control.

However, as these projects have grown in popularity, there has been an increased push by regulators to find ways to govern them. One area where this is most apparent is Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance.

KYC has had very negative connotations in the Web3 community. People see it as an infringement on their privacy and a way for the government to control them. They also see it as the antithesis of blockchain technology, which is supposed to be decentralized and anonymous.

In this article, we will attempt to answer the question: Does KYC really encroach on decentralization? We will look at the arguments for and against KYC compliance and try to come to a conclusion about whether Web3 projects should consider it.

The Wild West of Web3

For the longest time, the decentralized nature of Web3 projects meant that there were no rules or regulations governing them. This was seen as a good thing by many because it meant that these projects were outside government control.

This dates back to the early days of Bitcoin, when the anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto said that the cryptocurrency was designed to be “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system” that didn’t need “any trusted third party.” This meant that there was no central authority controlling Bitcoin, and it was up to the users to decide how to use it.

Naturally, this lack of regulation also meant that there were no rules against things like money laundering or terrorist financing. This led to Bitcoin being used for a variety of illegal activities on the dark web, which furthered negative associations that it was used for criminal activity.

The way onboarding used to work for crypto projects: Users would go to their website, download the software, then send them some money. There was no KYC or AML compliance because there was no way to know to whom money was being sent.

This all changed when crypto ecosystems started to grow and attract more mainstream users. As more people started buying crypto, the exchanges that they were using began to implement KYC and AML compliance measures.

Early pushback against big players

This was a necessary evil in order to continue growing ecosystems and attract more users. But it also led to a lot of friction within the community because many people thought it as a way for governments to control them.

The tension came to a head in 2017 when the Chinese government cracked down on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). This led to a mass exodus of crypto projects from China to more friendly jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Singapore.

However, even in these more crypto-friendly jurisdictions, KYC and AML compliance was still necessary to comply with the law. This led to a lot of projects doing KYC-AML compliance in a way that the community considered too intrusive.

For example, Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, was accused of doing too much KYC on its users — but then the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pushed Binance to actually increase its KYC standards. This suggested that having users upload their IDs and selfies was simply not enough. Most users are understandably not comfortable with that.

This led to a lot of criticism from the community because it was seen as an invasion of privacy; but Binance has not relented and still maintains a thorough KYC policy.

Dissatisfaction with strict policies indicates that there is a delicate balance that needs to be struck when it comes to KYC and AML compliance. On the one hand, you need to do enough to comply with the law and prevent your platform from being used for illicit activities. On the other hand, you don’t want to do too much and risk alienating your user base.

The current state of KYC in the crypto world

In the current crypto world, most exchanges and wallets have some form of KYC, but there is still a lot of variation in how much information is required from users.

Some exchanges, like Coinbase, only require users to submit their name and email address. Other exchanges, like Binance, allow multiple verification tiers with varying degrees of required information.

There are also a few exchanges that have implemented KYC-less protocols. This means that users don’t need to submit any personal information to use the platform.

The main downside of this approach is that it makes it more difficult to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. This is why most exchanges still require some form of KYC from their users.

Lessons in sovereign policy

The push and pull between regulation and decentralization is not unique to the crypto world. All sovereign nations have to deal with it when it comes to their own policymaking.

Historically, United States laws have sought to regulate the internet — and have been met with a lot of resistance. The most famous example is the Communications Decency Act, which the Supreme Court struck down in 1997.

The act was passed in an attempt to regulate online pornography, but it was quickly met with criticism from the tech industry. The main problem with the act was that it was too broad and would have ended up censoring a lot of non-pornographic content.

The court ultimately struck down the act, but the case highlights the tension between regulation and decentralization. The U.S. has since taken a more hands-off approach to regulating the internet, which has allowed the tech industry to flourish — but has also enabled the prevalence of harmful content.

Lack of regulation is why big banks still have a leg up over DeFi

When interviewed about the potential success of the crypto industry in replacing legacy banking players, hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin mentioned that the perpetual flaw of crypto is that, unlike with banks, very little can be done when users need their financial provider to do right by them.

Charlie Munger, legendary investor from Berkshire Hathaway, also mentioned that crypto was “rat poison” and cited the prevalence of illicit activity for why he would personally never consider it a viable asset class.

These statements, while inflammatory, get to the heart of one of crypto’s big problems: The lack of regulation. Unlike with banks and other financial institutions, there is no government body that oversees the crypto industry.

This means that there are no guaranteed protections for users if something goes wrong. If a user gets hacked and loses all of their crypto, there is no government insurance that will cover the loss.

The same lack of regulation also makes it difficult for exchanges and other crypto businesses to get traditional banking services. This is one of the reasons why the DeFi industry has been such a big deal in the crypto world, since it can fulfill many of the services of traditional banks such as lending and borrowing with interest accrual, and asset investments, without the same regulatory requirements.

By using decentralized protocols, users can bypass the need for traditional financial institutions. However, the lack of regulation also makes DeFi protocols more vulnerable to hacks and other security problems.

KYC, decentralization and digital identity

So with all that said — does KYC violate Web3’s tenets of decentralization and privacy? It does not. To better understand why you have to look at it from a two-sided approach.

First, let’s look at it from the perspective of exchanges and other businesses that require KYC. For these businesses, KYC is a way to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. By requiring users to submit personal information, businesses can help prevent criminals from using their platforms to launder money.

This is a good thing for both businesses and users. It is also worth noting that KYC does not have to be a violation of privacy. When done properly, businesses can collect the necessary information without sacrificing the privacy of their users.

Second, it is worth noting that decentralization works hand in hand with another important element of Web3 — digital identity. For decentralization to work, users need to be able to prove their identity. Otherwise, there would be no way to prevent bad actors from taking advantage of the system.

Decentralization without digital identity is not the kind of decentralization that we are striving for. Furthermore, a self-sovereign identity system would give users complete control over their personal information, further easing the worry about centralization.

This means that users could choose to share their information with only the businesses and organizations that they trust. They would no longer have to worry about their information being mishandled or stolen by central authorities.

KYC is one way to establish a digital identity. By requiring users to submit personal information, businesses can help ensure that everyone using their platform is who they say they are.

Why KYC is a necessary first step for crypto exchanges

With all of the above points in mind, it is clear that KYC is the necessary first step for Web3 projects. Without some form of KYC, it would be very difficult for exchanges to operate in a compliance-friendly manner.

Users should not think of it as their data being centralized — but rather their legitimacy being verified. Once a user’s KYC information has been verified, they can go about their business on the platform without having to worry about being flagged for suspicious activity.

In conclusion, it is evident that KYC is a necessary first step for exchanges and other Web3 projects. Without some form of compliance, it would be very difficult for these projects to operate in a legal and safe manner.

In our next segment, we will talk about the role DeFi plays in the inclusive economics behind Web3: How it allows participation by those who have been left out of the traditional financial system, and what advantages it has compared to the current system.

We’re only halfway through October but this is already the worst month ever for crypto hacks, according to a recent report by blockchain data firm Chainalysis – putting 2022 on track to be the worst year ever. Already, crypto worth $3 billion has been pilfered this year.It may surprise you that North Korean hackers were responsible for a third of this theft – $1 billion – according to Chainalysis, far surpassing the $400 million they stole across seven cyberattacks on crypto exchanges in 2021.But why is North Korea, of all places, diving into digital assets?It all boils down to choice – of a lack of it.Wild swings in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies make them a poor store of value and a terrible medium of exchange.But what if you have few choices, like El Salvador? The country had long abandoned its own fiat currency – the colón – and legally adopted the US dollar before it decided to give bitcoin the same status last year. Here’s how that experiment is going, by the way. (TL;DR: not great.)And what of North Korea, a brutal dictatorship run by a crime family that threatens the world with nuclear armageddon while starving its own people for decades?Years of crippling economic sanctions and pressure from governments in the neighbourhood (mainly China) have forced North Korea to come up with creative ways to bypass these economic punishments.Of the most successful of these has been – you guessed it – crypto hacks.North Korean hackers have sent crypto worth around $52.46 million to exchanges in South Korea since 2019 in an effort to evade sanctions or launder money, according to the Chainalysis report, which also caught the attention of South Korean lawmaker Yoon Han-hong this week.Chainalysis, which has worked with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Europol to track the criminal use of crypto, said it arrived at the figure by tracing several intermediary deposit addresses that have been exposed to crypto wallets owned by North Korean hackers.So what is the impoverished, pariah nation with a GDP of just $18 billion in 2019 doing with its new-found crypto riches?Building a nuclear arsenal, of course. Reuters reported in February, citing an excerpt of a confidential United Nations report, that ""cyberattacks, particularly on cryptocurrency assets, remain an important revenue source"" for North Korea, and that independent sanctions monitors said they had received information that North Korean hackers continued to target financial institutions, crypto firms and exchanges.Crypto may be in the throes of a crippling bear market but – as the latest numbers show – that hasn’t dented North Korea’s crypto ambitions, since it directly funds the one thing keeping the Kim family in power.Written by Zaheer Merchant in MumbaiAll major IT services firms except Tech Mahindra announced their second-quarter results for FY23 this week.

FrontRow said it fired 130 employees (almost 75% of its workforce), across marketing, sales, engineering, and product, in what was its second round of layoffs this year.Meanwhile Vendantu, another troubled edtech startup, acquired Deeksha – a test preparation platform for board and competitive exams – for $40 million.The successive layoffs in the edtech sector reflect the overall doldrums within the Indian startup ecosystem.

Dogecoin and other meme coins are inspired by memes and jokes. The Shiba Inu image that went viral online inspired the Doge meme, which led to the creation of Dogecoin.

Memecoins aren’t meant to be taken seriously, but when other members of the community buy them to join in the joke, their popularity grows. Even among the uninformed, Dogecoin is now as well known as Bitcoin.

Individual investors will occasionally join after a coin’s value has increased and skyrocketed, helping the cryptocurrency gain even more popularity. Famous people and well-known online personalities help to increase the appeal of various meme currencies.

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Dogecoin [DOGE] for 2023-24

Since its launch in around 2010, the cryptocurrency industry has come a long way. The vision of the cryptocurrency industry was an on-chain financial order that would not invite governmental intervention. Needless to say, such a grand plan elicited suspicion, and even invited smirks.

Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, a pair of software engineers, had been observing this trend who thought that this whole crypto affair was being taken far too seriously. In response, they created a memecoin named Dogecoin in December 2013 to mock crypto maximalists. The memecoin soon became popular across the globe, thanks to it going viral on social media sites such as Reddit.

The token featured an image of an adorable Shiba Inu dog, a rare breed of hunting dog from Japan. Dogecoin went viral on social media platforms such as Reddit, gaining instant popularity worldwide.

Dogecoin soon earned a devoted following. Those who were interested in cryptocurrency but were not too serious about its alleged revolutionary potential, were the first to flock to this memecoin. People who liked this breed of Japanese dogs also bought this memecoin. Anyone willing to casually engage with cryptocurrency also participated in the Dogecoin culture.

However, as it gained more traction in the market and its value increased, people began to buy this joke of a cryptocurrency in earnest. Today, it is the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and post the Ethereum Merge, has emerged as the 2nd largest Proof-of-Work (PoS) cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. In fact, the value and popularity of this memecoin grew so popular that it was the sleeve sponsor for the English football club, Watford F.C. for the 2021-22 season, as reported by The Atlantic.

Thanks to the popularity of Dogecoin, a herd of meme-inspired cryptocurrencies have mushroomed across the globe- Shiba Inu being the most popular among them. Over the years, more than 200 meme coins have been created since the launch of Dogecoin.

Within a few days of its launch, it rose from $0.00026 to $0.00095 in value, recording a significant hike of around 300%. In doing so, it quickly established itself as one of the market’s top-10 cryptocurrencies. Between January and May 2021, DOGE surged by more than 8,600%.

One of the reasons behind such a surge was it being mentioned on social media by tech and entertainment giants such as Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Mark Cuban. On 8 May 2021, it hit an ATH of $0.7376. At the time of writing, Dogecoin was trading at $0.1029 on the charts.

A long-term Dogecoin developer Sporklin, now no more, once remarked,

“Dogecoin can be a joke and still be functional … While the branding is frontal jokes and memes, everything under that has been solid from the start.”

What is peculiar to Dogecoin is it being a fascination of the business magnate Elon Musk. Musk even supported Dogecoin on Twitter and once called it a hustle on an SNL episode, significantly pushing its price both the times.

Much wow!

However, when the crypto-market crashed in May 2022 and a lot of Dogecoin investors also lost money, an investor named Keith Johnson filed a $258 billion lawsuit against Elon Musk and his companies, SpaceX and Tesla, for allegedly running what he called a “Dogecoin Crypto Pyramid Scheme.” In early September, Reuters reported that the lawsuit now has seven new investor plaintiffs and six new defendants.

So far, DOGE has been used to reward creative users on Reddit, Twitter and other such networks for good content. People can also get tipped with DOGE in the eponymous online communities where the currency is popular. Another new concept for our readers might be the existence of Dogecoin faucets. A Dogecoin faucet is a website that gives you a Dogecoin for free so that you get introduced to the world of Dogecoins and become an active member of this meme coin community.

Dogecoin has also been used to raise funds for a number of causes. In 2014, the community came together to raise $50,000 worth of Dogecoins to build water wells in Kenya. The same year, a group of enthusiasts raised over $25,000 worth of dogecoins to let the Jamaican bobsleigh team attend the Winter Olympics in Sochi. In 2014 again, the community raised $55,000 worth of Dogecoins to sponsor the Nascar driver Josh Wise. “I can’t thank the dogecoin and Reddit community enough for the support… To the moon!” said Wise.

The growth of Dogecoin over these years has less to do with its infrastructure development and more to do with its strong mining community.

Only recently, Billy Markus, the co-founder of Dogecoin, rejected a $14 million offer to promote Dogechain, the unofficial layer-2 solution for the meme coin. Many believed that the decision reflected Billy’s loyalty to the Doge community. Decentralization is a central marker of this revolutionary financial system and forging an alliance with another group is a possible violation if the latter comes to dominate the system. Keeping the memecoin community fun and independent has been the cornerstone of the belief system underlying the growth of the community.

Today, Dogecoin is as mainstream as Bitcoin and is traded on all the major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Gemini and Binance.

Many prominent members of the blockchain and fintech communities are currently involved with Dogecoin. A foundation was formed in 2014 to support and govern the project but it dissolved over time. It was reinvigorated in 2021 by members of the original core team along with fresh faces and new seasoned advisors ready to grow Dogecoin for the decade ahead.

Its group of directors include Dogecoin founder Billy Markus, core developer Max Keller, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, and Jared Birchall representing Tesla founder Elon Musk. Markus takes care of the community and memes, Keller handles technical aspects of the project, Buterin acts as the crypto-advisor for the foundation, and Birchall provides legal and financial advice.

We can see how a currency that began as a joke has come such a long way that the most prominent members of the crypto community are today leading, advising, and monitoring its development.

Let us explore how this fun cryptocurrency, one that claims to “Do Only Good Everyday,” will perform in the next few years.

Why these projections matter

Dogecoin is the pioneer among all the memecoins active in the market. It is only after the initial success of Dogecoin that other memecoins like Shiba Inu and Monacoin entered the market. In fact, at press time, it was among the market’s top 10 cryptocurrencies.

Dogecoin remains immensely popular among its core fanbase and other crypto-enthusiasts. Currently, its Twitter and Reddit communities have 3.4 million and 2.3 million members. A major reason behind its increasing value has been the support of these online communities.

In January 2021, its price saw a hike of 800% in just 24 hours when a subReddit named r/SatoshiStreetBets began pushing its price to make it the cryptocurrency equivalent of Gamestop. In early April 2021, it rose by 400% after popular crypto-exchange Coinbase went public and Elon Musk tweeted about Dogecoin.

Before investing in Dogecoin, it is wise that you should be aware of its previous performance, studies and market predictions. It is precisely for this reason that we are providing a summary of most reliable predictions regarding Dogecoin, in addition to the Fear & Greed Index.

Dogecoin’s price, market cap and everything else

The way Dogecoin began as a mockery of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, its performance also broadly mimicked the performance of those currencies. Adverse market conditions towards the end of Q2 in 2022 completely ravished the crypto-market and Dogecoin couldn’t escape its brunt either.

In 2021, it remained one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, peaking in May with an ATH of $0.7376 and a market cap of over $0.7 billion. Then, it quickly began descending. 2022 began with a fairly decent start for the cryptocurrency with a price of around $0.17 in early January. But since then, it has lost over 60% of its value.

It was in May 2017 that its market capitalization crossed $100 million and by the end of 2017, it crossed $1 billion. During 2018-20, the market cap of Dogecoin couldn’t cross the $1 billion mark. However, come 2021 and like its price, its market cap also kept soaring. In April, it hit $52.65 billion, before reaching the $88.68 billion-mark in early May. It ended the year 2021 with a market cap of over $22 billion.

Early 2022 was also fairly blissful for Dogecoin, though not as good as the previous year. In early April 2022, its market cap was $19.84 billion. Alas, since May, the same has been falling from around $17 billion to a little over $8.7 billion at the time of writing.

What is peculiar to Dogecoin is it being a subject of fascination for business magnate Elon Musk. Musk even supported Dogecoin on Twitter and once called it a hustle on an SNL episode, significantly pushing its price both times.

I will keep supporting Dogecoin — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 19, 2022

It has also won the support of other celebrities such as Mark Cuban and Snoop Dogg too. While the former’s NBA team Dallas Mavericks has been accepting Dogecoin as a payment currency, the latter supported Musk in his support for the meme coin on Twitter.

Another distinction between Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies is that there is absolutely no cap on the number of Dogecoins that can be issued. Its website claims that it “has a diminished inflation rate because it has a fixed yearly issuance of 5 billion coins.”

Dogecoin’s 2025 Predictions

Investors should understand that different analysts look at different sets of parameters to forecast market metrics. Different analyses can therefore widely vary. We should also remember that unexpected macroeconomic forces such as government regulations and wars cannot be foreseen. Market changes its course wildly during such changes. No prediction is therefore set in stone.

Now, let us see how different analysts have predicted the future of Dogecoin in 2025.

Coin Journal is rather bullish about the future of Dogecoin. Especially since predicts its wider utility as more and more merchants begin accepting it as a mode of payment, pushing its price to $2.59.

On the contrary, a Changelly blogpost mentioned that the maximum and minimum prices of DOGE in 2025 will be $0.28 and $0.23. It predicts a potential ROI of 452% for DOGE in the said year. Furthermore, an Analytics Insight report claimed that with adoption and cryptocurrency regulations set to get better, DOGE’s price could go as high as $0.77 by 2025.

As far as Finder’s panel is concerned, it predicted that DOGE will be priced at $0.19 by the end of 2025. These projections, dated July 2022, were curiously lower than its own January projections. Back them, the panel predicted DOGE will hit $0.32.

Dogecoin’s 2030 Predictions

Even though predicting market metrics 8 years down the line is very speculative, it is nonetheless helpful to study the predictions of reliable crypto analysts regarding Dogecoin in 2030.

Capex writes that the further we look into the future, the harder it becomes to predict the prices of a cryptocurrency. It becomes especially challenging in a market that is as volatile as any cryptocurrency. According to the same, experts predict that DOGE’s price could surpass $0.80 in 2030. In a bullish market, its minimum price won’t go below $0.30.

Finder’s panel shared some DOGE price predictions for the year 2030 too. According to the same, the popular memecoin will hit a price level of $0.64 on the charts by 2030.

Experts opine that influencer marketing and promotions will also heat up DOGE’s price. It will also grow at a substantial rate. Features such as zero staking rewards and lack of new use cases will also impact the market.

Here, it’s worth pointing out that perhaps, Dogecoin doesn’t follow the traditional rules of a regular asset since it is a memecoin. Just consider what Panxora Hedge Fund’s Gavin Smith has to say –

“Detractors of the token forget that community is at least as important as uniqueness in the crypto-space.”

There’s the matter of updates too. Ordinarily, people would associate new upgrades and updates with a hike in the crypto’s price. However, has that been the case for DOGE? Well, not quite. In fact, Musk has been more useful as a catalyst. In fact, Finder’s panel seemed to agree with the said proposition.

Conclusion

Just recently, Elon Musk introduced a Boring Company fragrance on Twitter and said that customers can buy it with Dogecoin. The announcement had an instant impact as DOGE’s price rose quickly. We will have to see if the decision is followed through and if other companies follow suit.

Last week, Google Cloud announced its partnership with Coinbase for Web 3.0 development projects. Select customers will be able to pay for these services via cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin too. We will have to see if the decision is followed through and if other companies follow the suit.

“Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver once famously said that the memecoin is superior and better than the pioneering cryptocurrency – Bitcoin. Now, whether the aforementioned predictions will come true or not depends on a lot of factors, some of which cannot be foreseen. Even so, for an altcoin that began as a joke, Dogecoin has certainly come a long way.

Dogecoin was the first memecoin that successfully wedded the financial potential of cryptocurrency with the fandom of meme culture, making it accessible for new crypto users. In addition, celebrity endorsement also added immensely to its popularity. Today, it is counted among the most valued cryptocurrencies.

Recent reports suggest that a sharp rise has been witnessed in the memecoin as trends of whale activities are emerging. An analysis by the market research firm IntoTheBlock suggested that most of the whales intend on holding the tokens instead of selling them.

Early this month, Google Cloud and Coinbase announced a collaboration for Web 3.0 development projects. Certain customers will be able to pay for these services using cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin. We’ll have to wait and see if the decision is implemented and if other companies follow suit.

What is certain, however, is uncertainty. Especially since the Fear and Greed Index was flashing extreme greed at press time.",blockchain,ambcrypto.com

243,Why we need an edge data architecture to digitize the world — sustainably,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1305428682.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,15/10/2022,"Edge databases can empower edge data to bring computing and data storage close to data sources, toward sustainability and reduced waste.",https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/why-we-need-edge-data-architecture-digitize-world-sustainably/,"Join us on November 9 to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit. Register here.

Our world is inherently decentralized. Over the last two decades, the trend in IT has been to ignore the decentralized world and work around it by combining impressive technologies and organizational structures in approaches such as cloud data warehouses. This is a huge obstacle for digitization projects.

To really, finally digitize across industries, we need a broader spectrum of data architecture options reflecting the diverse world. Only if we discard the domination of a centralized cloud-based approach and acknowledge the need for a distributed paradigm can we harness the potential of digitization and enable new use cases. In short: We need a true edge to open up the full spectrum of edge-cloud data architectures.

There are, of course, also many cases where centralization makes sense, but the centralized paradigm is of no or only limited use for all those cases that are inherently decentralized.

Forcing centralized cloud-use on decentralized/distributed use cases is economically, environmentally and socially wasteful. It is unsustainable and a major reason why digitization is stalling. On a broader level, this mismatch of topology and use case is detrimental to creating bottom-line value and harmful to the ecosystem’s welfare. On top of that, “edge washing” (a large cloud with a small edge under the “edge computing label”) is just worsening the situation and hindering the uptake of a paradigm that can create huge value.

For a thriving and innovative ecosystem, developers must have simple and efficient tools for decentralized and distributed computing in addition to the cloud, so they can choose the most useful and sustainable data architecture for a given project.

That’s in essence why we need a “new” data architecture reflecting the world as it is. Or, more specifically: we need infrastructure software — tools — that enable developers to digitize and capture the decentralized world so that they can build powerful new apps quickly and efficiently.

Why is data architecture central to successful digitization?

Data follows business needs

The goals of data architecture are to match business requirements with data and system requirements and to manage data flow through the enterprise in accordance with organizational strategy. Good data architectures make data available when and where it is required; data follows the business needs.

A closely related term is data modeling. Both data architecture and data modeling aim to bridge the gap between business objectives and technology. Data architecture, however, spans the organization and takes a high-level, holistic view, whereas data modeling focuses on specific systems or business cases.

In any case, the architecture or modeling should follow business needs. Often, however, the data architecture is on the highest level already given — it is centralized/cloud-based. As McKinsey puts it: “Using data effectively requires the right data architecture, built on a foundation of business requirements. However, most companies take a technology-first approach, building major platforms while focusing too little on killer use cases.“

With this dominance of centralized cloud computing comes an ”inaccessibility of edge data” and with it lost business opportunities and a blocker of innovation and value creation. In other words: We need an edge over the cloud.

The cloud needs an edge. (image by author)

Compute follows data

Today, data is produced and needed everywhere. “Edge data” is data generated on a myriad of decentralized devices like smartphones, cars, machines and consoles. Valuable data is therefore increasingly generated and used outside traditional data centers and cloud environments.

Many businesses struggle to access and use this decentralized edge data, which comes from sources like machines on factory floors, cars on the street, and batteries in airplanes. Yet there are already more connected devices than people on this planet. Every day their number grows. They produce huge amount of data. And the opportunities to create value from this data are manifold.

Transferring all this data to the cloud to make it accessible is currently not feasible, due purely to bandwidth. There are, however, several more good reasons why the cloud is not a viable option for making this data usable:

No or intermittent connectivity

Networking and cloud costs

Data security concerns

Data privacy concerns

Latency

Edge computing refers to an inherently distributed computing paradigm that moves computation and data storage closer to the edge and to data sources. And edges are often distributed systems in themselves (edge of edges). However, edge computing still lacks core infrastructure software that would facilitate its use. Unlike the centralized paradigm with its long-established cloud infrastructure, the decentralized/distributed paradigm has little infrastructure software yet available to help establish new projects quickly and easily.

Legacy systems combined with a cloud-centric infrastructure make it difficult to access and capture the value of edge data — and there is no easy option available. Because “distributed systems are hard,” it is nothing that is easily or quickly solved in-house.

And while there are always options to get (at least some of) that data, DIY solutions for these kinds of challenges typically cost a lot of time to implement, don’t scale well, are slow, and are later hard to maintain. In short, such costs do kill edge projects.

Lack of core edge tech (image by author)

There are many use cases that only work based on the decentralized edge computing topology and many that only make sense based on that topology. Some examples:

Smart vehicles

“Smart vehicles,” anything from connected cars to autonomous driving, need to satisfy high availability and reliability requirements and depend on lightning-fast data processing and transmission onboard. A car of course is a distributed system itself and cannot afford the latency and uncertainty a cloud-based approach brings. Intermittent connections can be used to transport some parts of the data to the cloud.

Remote locations

Anything in a remote location without (reasonable) internet access, e.g. oil and gas fields, tunnels and Points of Sales (PoS), really need applications that work without an internet connection on the edge. In the oil and gas industry, for example, failures can be disastrous. The many assets on-site therefore need to be carefully monitored but are typically in a remote location with little to no internet connectivity. Once a connection is available, some data can be transferred to the cloud. However, high MNO costs and limited bandwidth as well as flaky networks often require frugal choices with regard to data transferal.

Smart manufacturing

Smart manufacturing applications, at least in Europe, typically need to satisfy high data protection and security requirements, and for this very reason there may often be no direct connection to the internet — and many manufacturers are reluctant to have their data in the cloud. On site, you can find everything from low-frequency brownfield devices to high-frequency greenfield devices on a factory floor. As a rule, the machine controllers in use are not designed to store or transmit data. They usually lack not only the functionality but also the resources to support this. The clear separation of machine control and the edge data processing unit ensures that there is no risk of unintentional interference with the machine controller.

In all these examples, the typical use case entails a number of different devices, from controlling units to machines to phones to tablets to PCs. The edge consists of many edges that need to exchange data; however, the use cases really need at least guaranteed response times, and often speed is also of the essence, and so on. If you look closer at the cases, they all have the same base requirements:

Decentralized devices

Quality of Service (QoS) control

Fast response times

High availability

Secure data handling

Scalability and resilience

Fault-resilient capabilities

And all those requirements aim at one thing: Having the right data available when needed and where needed.

Having the right data where it’s needed (image by author)

Anything that can go wrong will go wrong

What sounds trivial conceals a number of more complicated challenges arising from the challenge of data access in distributed systems (plus industry-specific challenges). The complexity becomes clear in the context of the system environment:

The network is unreliable.

Latency is not zero.

Bandwidth is finite.

The network is not secure.

Topology can change.

It’s unknown if there is an administrator at all, or how many.

Transport is costly.

The network is heterogeneous.

Fun fact: these have arisen from the “8 fallacies of distributed systems” that were defined back in the ’90s (e.g. the false assumption that the network is reliable). Bottom line: Anyone working on a distributed system needs to assume that “anything that can go wrong, will go wrong” — and it can be hard to take care of all the individual parts failing at any given moment, let alone any possible combinations thereof.

The complexity therefore already begins before the solution is implemented, as it necessitates a thoughtful approach to data architecture and the governance of a distributed system. What makes it even more difficult is the fact that distributed systems have multiple components spread across multiple locations, domains and technologies. This is likely to be one of the first stumbling blocks for many projects that need the edge: It already takes time and money — an investment — to come up with a solid conception.

Moreover, without core infrastructure software for the edge, every project will take a lot of time, money and nerves to implement just the basic mechanisms of such a complex system. And this will only be a foundation for what the project eventually wants to achieve based on the usable edge data. On top of that, due to the distributed nature, such a project will be error-prone and take diligent testing and iterations to get to a good level.

Visible and hidden requirements (image by author)

Last not least, such projects face another reality: It’s far easier to get budgets for visible and shiny features than for hidden features that “no one ever sees.” A “quick PoC” might be set up using the cloud to demonstrate the value of the application and using that data. However, it cannot be used in production later on due to all the reasons given above. So, digitization is stalling. The reality today is that, across verticals, a ton of data is unused and companies struggle to access edge data.

Why should I care about edge data architecture?

The power of the edge

Pushing data management capabilities toward edge environments adds value in a variety of ways. Once you can manage edge data on the edge, you can:

Act with extreme speed and empower real-time use cases. By uniting data and computation on the edge, you get to a completely new level of efficiency and speed.

Enable smarter devices and make more use of the already available and distributed hardware, including remote management or autonomous behavior via onboard (edge) data.

Overcome data inconsistencies, protection, privacy and other data governance issues that arise from siloed or unused edge data or cloud-centric data architectures.

Reap the benefits of digitization independent of an internet connection. Bandwidth costs and scenarios with limited or intermittent connectivity are no longer obstacles.

Provide greater fault tolerance and resiliency.

Just imagine what else you can do … and all of this while using fewer resources and making the digitization as sustainable as possible.

There is also a silver lining in terms of development: New solutions in the edge computing space aim to deliver core infrastructure software to developers, allowing them to easily manage edge data on the edge. So-called edge database management systems (or edge databases) provide the fundamental capabilities for making decentralized edge data usable outside of traditional data centers and public cloud environments. They take care of collecting, retrieving, storing, distributing and governing data within the decentralized/distributed edge computing topology.

Last but not least: Inefficient data architectures hurt the planet!

Already feeling the drastic effect of our actions on the planet, we cannot wait any longer before starting to embed the sustainable mindset into everything we do. Making the investment into carefully chosen data architectures including the edge computing topology will prove to accomplish a lot more than just lowering your carbon emissions. Choosing a fitting and efficient data architecture will also pay off economically and have a positive social impact.

Economical

Cloud waste is generally defined as unused or underutilized cloud services (e.g. idle VMs, over-provisioning). And while estimates vary, between 30% and 50% of cloud spending is literally wasteful — wasting not only CO2 but money. For example, Andreessen Horowitz recently estimated that across the top 50 public companies, $100 billion is lost in market value due to cloud waste. However, that is only looking at it from one side of the coin. The cloud also encourages wasteful development behavior and data architecture: A lot of data is needlessly transferred to the cloud and back, while it is really primarily used and useful on the edge. From an unnecessary cloud setup for decentralized cases to ignoring CPU and memory consumption of the code to inefficient data management (e.g. unnecessary data streaming, repeat transferals, full dumps) — it all increases ongoing costs and CO2 emissions.

Environmental

Did you know that cloud data centers already use 2%-3% of the world’s electricity? They, therefore, contribute to 2%-3% of the world’s CO2 emissions. Additionally, with ongoing digitization, a rapidly soaring number of devices, and exponentially growing data volumes, the CO2 impact of digitization is growing. Therefore, the potential global impact of more sustainable digitization projects is enormous. And the greatest leverage lies in choosing efficient data architectures that avoid unnecessary and wasteful networking and cloud use.

Social

From a societal standpoint, edge data management solutions make it easy for developers to keep data at or close to the source, e.g. on the user’s device. Keeping data on the device increases data ownership, data privacy and data security. Individual devices can be hacked, but the potential loss is much smaller than when a massive central cloud server is corrupted, making the data of millions of users subject to compromise. A wider spectrum of data architectures and solution providers will also strengthen the ecosystem, empowering more innovations and greater independence from hyperscalers.

All in all: Sustainable digitization needs an edge.

TL;DR

The world is decentralized; data is generated all over the place. The dominant computing model, the cloud, is inherently centralized. It is infeasible, inefficient and unsustainable to force the decentralized world to conform to this centralized topology. This is one of the reasons why digitization is stalling. To capitalize on the value of edge data, we require a new data architecture that reflects this decentralized reality.

Edge computing is a distributed topology that brings computing and data storage closer to the edge and to data sources. But edge computing still lacks core infrastructure software to make it easy to implement edge projects. Edge databases present a silver lining empowering developers to easily manage edge data on the fly.

244,2 Top Growth Stocks Near a 52-Week Low to Buy Now and Hold Forever,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/704696/investor-15.jpg,15/10/2022,These growth stocks are begging to be bought at their current valuations.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/15/2-top-growth-stocks-near-a-52-week-low-to-buy-now/,"Recession fears fueled by runaway inflation and rising interest rates caused the stock market to plunge this year. The Nasdaq Composite is about 35% off its peak, which means the tech-heavy index has traveled deep into bear market territory. Many individual stocks have fallen much further. For instance, Shopify (SHOP -3.68%) and DigitalOcean Holdings (DOCN -9.15%) have lost roughly 85% and 74% of their value, respectively, putting both stocks near a 52-week low.

Losses of that magnitude can be terrifying, but the investment theses behind Shopify and DigitalOcean remain firmly intact. That makes the ongoing sell-off a buying opportunity for patient investors. Here's why.

1. Shopify: Gaining market share in U.S. retail

Shopify is the market leader in e-commerce software, outranking all rivals in both market presence and user satisfaction, according to G2 Grid. That success stems from the simplicity and scope of its platform. It allows merchants to manage sales across physical and digital storefronts, including online marketplaces, social media, and direct-to-consumer websites.

Shopify also provides adjacent services like payment processing, financing, and money management accounts. Few (if any) other vendors have such a comprehensive offering.

Of course, high inflation has been a headwind for the retail industry, and Shopify delivered somewhat disappointing financial results over the past year. Revenue was up just 30% to $5 billion, a significant deceleration from 85% growth in the prior year, and free cash flow fell 88% to $59 million. But investors need to look beyond the temporary headwinds -- the future still looks bright for Shopify.

Last year, Shopify accounted for 10.3% of retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. Only Amazon held more market share. That leaves Shopify well positioned for future growth, as retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. are expected to increase at 12% per year to reach $1.7 trillion by 2026.

But the company is also gaining traction in physical retail settings. In fact, Shopify continued to gain market share in U.S. retail (both online and offline) in the first and second quarters of 2022, in spite of disappointing financial results. And the fulfillment network the company is currently building could reinforce that trend in the coming years.

Additionally, Shopify recently added new business-to-business (B2B) tools to Shopify Plus, its commerce platform for larger businesses. That could be a big growth driver for two reasons.

First, management estimates more than half of existing Plus merchants could utilize B2B tools. Second, global B2B e-commerce sales will approach $8 trillion in 2022, and that figure will grow at 20% annually to reach $33 trillion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.

In short, Shopify sits in front of a big market opportunity, and it is executing on a sound growth strategy. With shares trading at 6.3 times sales -- a bargain compared to the three-year average of 36.6 times sales -- this growth stock is worth buying today.

2. DigitalOcean: Bringing cloud computing services to small businesses

Cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services dominate the industry and offer an extensive range of infrastructure and platform services. However, those products are tailored to the needs of large enterprises -- the kinds of companies with plenty of IT support. But what about small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that lack those resources?

DigitalOcean simplifies cloud computing for SMBs and individual developers. Its portfolio may not be as extensive, but its platform features an intuitive deployment interface with click-and-go options that allow customers to provision cloud services in minutes, without specialized training.

DigitalOcean also provides round-the-clock customer service and technical support to all clients, regardless of size. Additionally, the company built a sizable learning ecosystem for its customers, which features thousands of developer tutorials and tens of thousands of community-generated questions and answers.

Those qualities distinguish DigitalOcean from other cloud vendors, and that edge fueled strong growth. DigitalOcean now has 105,400 customers that spend more than $50 per month, up 16% from the prior year, and its net dollar retention rate currently sits at 112%, meaning the average customer spent 12% more over the past year.

In turn, revenue climbed 34% to $492 million, and the company generated positive free cash flow of $32 million over the past year, up from a loss of $5 million in the prior year.

Turning to the future, DigitalOcean puts its addressable market at $145 billion by 2025, and the company is working to capitalize on that through consistent product innovation. For instance, it recently introduced serverless computing solution DigitalOcean Functions. ""Serverless"" is a somewhat misleading term, as servers are still involved, but they are managed by the cloud vendor instead of the customer. That means SMBs can build and scale applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Currently, shares trade at 7.1 times sales, a discount compared to the historical average of 13.1 times sales. That creates an attractive buying opportunity, and investors may regret passing on this growth stock.",cloud computing,motley fool
245,These 3 Tech Stocks Haven't Been This Cheap in Years: Is It Time to Buy?,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/704631/two-cybersecurity-workers-at-their-monitors-analyzing-data.jpg,15/10/2022,"For investors hunting for bargains in this tricky market, these stocks might be a good place to start.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/15/tech-stocks-havent-been-cheap-years-time-buy/,"The Nasdaq 100 index is often used as a barometer of the technology sector's performance. Unfortunately, 2022 has shown a low-pressure system is dominating for most of the year, with the index losing 34% of its value. If the year ended now, it would be the worst decline since the Great Recession in 2008-09.

While that's daunting, we know the market recovered to new highs in the years following that event, so this might present a rare opportunity to buy high-quality growth stocks at a discount.

A panel of three Motley Fool contributors has identified Tenable (TENB -3.99%), MercadoLibre (MELI -7.40%), and CrowdStrike (CRWD -7.81%) as potential candidates. These tech stocks are currently trading at low points they haven't visited in years, and here's why investors should consider picking them up.

The leader in vulnerability management

Anthony Di Pizio (Tenable): Tenable stock currently trades at $30.18, a level not seen in more than two years. But since then, the cybersecurity industry has only grown in importance, and Tenable continues to attract a record number of customers and is generating the highest levels of revenue in its history. That sounds like a buying opportunity.

According to a survey conducted by global consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, the threat of cyberattacks is currently the No. 1 concern for top corporate executives. Cyber-risk outranked other concerns, including the possibility of a recession, climate change, and even war, among the 722 respondents.

Tenable is the industry leader in vulnerability management and threat detection, which are proactive tools designed to seek potential risks and neutralize them before they find a way into a given network. Its Nessus platform has been deployed in tens of thousands of organizations with more than 2 million individual downloads, thanks to its customizable nature, which makes it an ideal choice for businesses of all sizes.

As of the recent second quarter of 2022 (ended June 30), the number of customers spending at least $100,000 annually with Tenable jumped 27% year over year to 1,191. It indicates that larger organizations with big cybersecurity budgets are flocking to adopt more advanced, proactive tools to protect their valuable digital assets, which are often hosted with cloud computing technology. The cloud presents new challenges for organizations because it expands the attack surface -- in other words, cloud-based assets can be vulnerable to threats from almost anywhere in the world.

Thanks in part to its increasing customer base, Tenable kept its full-year revenue guidance steady at $676 million for 2022. That's in stark contrast to many other technology companies that slashed their forecasts, and if Tenable hits the mark, it would represent growth of 25% compared with 2021. That's even faster than last year's revenue growth rate of 23% -- so this is a unique opportunity to buy a piece of an accelerating business at a price not seen since mid-2020.

A can't-miss bargain from south of the border

Jamie Louko (MercadoLibre): This Latin American e-commerce and fintech leader is trading at a valuation rarely seen. At just 4.7 times sales, MercadoLibre is at nearly the cheapest valuation it has been at since coming public in 2007.

Some relatively cheap companies are rightly considered value traps -- a poor business facing secular decline or other risks that looks appealing due to its rock-bottom valuation. MercadoLibre doesn't fit the definition. MercadoLibre dominates the e-commerce and fintech spaces in Latin America, with more than 20% share of total retail e-commerce sales in the region in 2021, according to Statista. Additionally, the company could improve its dominance: A report published through Statista suggests MercadoLibre's market share could reach almost 22% by 2023.

On the fintech side, MercadoLibre is also a top dog. The unique demographics of the region it serves include a relatively young consumer group in larger countries like Brazil and Mexico. There is also an elevated desire for digital payment platforms, meaning fintech in Latin America is expected to grow exponentially over the coming years. MercadoLibre already has over 38 million unique fintech users. This puts it in a great spot to thrive on these tailwinds.

MercadoLibre is posting some impressive results. Over the trailing 12 months, it saw revenue surpass $8.8 billion. From that revenue, it managed to extract over $1 billion in free cash flow despite its heavy investments to capture the opportunity ahead.

With a powerful grip on the industries it operates in, MercadoLibre looks well positioned to benefit from the rising tides in Latin America. The company has attractive growth prospects over the next five years, so today's valuation looks like a gift for long-term investors.

The second-fastest growing software company in history

Trevor Jennewine (CrowdStrike Holdings): Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike went public with 10 software modules in its arsenal in 2019, but its portfolio has more than doubled in size since then. The CrowdStrike Falcon platform now features 22 modules, spanning from endpoint and cloud security to identity protection and managed services. Better yet, CrowdStrike has become the gold standard in endpoint security and managed detection and response, and it's considered a leader in threat intelligence and incident response services.

That success stems from its broad portfolio and unique architecture. CrowdStrike can replace numerous point solutions with a single platform, allowing businesses to consolidate security spend through one vendor. In addition, all 22 CrowdStrike modules are delivered through a single piece of software that can be installed without a device reboot. That means customers can deploy Falcon without disrupting their businesses, and management believes that friction-reducing quality is unique to CrowdStrike.

Better yet, as the market leader in endpoint security, CrowdStrike can collect security signals on a scale no competitor can match, and that makes its artificial-intelligence engine uniquely effective in identifying cyberattacks, according to CEO George Kurtz. Naturally, the promise of best-in-class security has fueled strong demand. CrowdStrike expanded its customer base by 51% in the past year, and the average customer increased spend by more than 20%.

To that end, CrowdStrike is growing like wildfire. Over the past year, revenue climbed 61% to $1.8 billion and free cash flow soared 49% to $543 million. But the company accomplished something even more impressive. CrowdStrike is the second-fastest software company in history to achieve a $2 billion revenue run rate. Only Zoom Video Communications got to that rate more quickly.

Investors have good reason to believe CrowdStrike can maintain that momentum. Cybersecurity is not a discretionary expense -- it is a necessity. Trends such as cloud computing, remote work, and the proliferation of connected devices have created new attack surfaces for hackers, and the problem will only become more pressing in the future. To that end, CrowdStrike puts its addressable market at $97 billion by 2025.

Currently, shares trade at 19.2 times sales -- the cheapest valuation since March 2020, when the share price cratered as the stock market crashed at the onset of the pandemic. That valuation may not be cheap in a traditional sense, but it does create a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors.",cloud computing,motley fool
246,1 Semiconductor Stock Down 65% You'll Wish You'd Bought on the Dip,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/704627/a-digital-rendering-of-a-computer-chip-being-plugged-into-a-circuit-board.jpg,15/10/2022,"This hasn't been a great year for chip stocks, but Advanced Micro Devices' positive, long-term trajectory is undeniable.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/15/1-semiconductor-stock-down-65-wish-you-bought-amd/,"The 2022 stock market sell-off has been broad, but it has been particularly brutal for the technology sector. While the benchmark S&P 500 index is down by 25% year to date as of this writing, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has lost 34%.

But when you zoom out and compare their performances over the past five years, the picture looks very different. The Nasdaq-100 is up by 77%, which is nearly double the S&P 500's gain of 40%. This supports the widely held view that investing for the long term typically delivers the greatest benefits.

Investors could apply that strategy to semiconductor stock Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -1.73%), which has declined by 65% from its all-time high. Semiconductors continue to grow rapidly in importance, and the sector could be worth as much as $1.5 trillion annually by 2030. AMD is a best-in-class producer, and one that investors should consider buying now.

Semiconductors are down, but certainly not out

Semiconductors are the computer chips that power our everyday digital experiences, from smartphones to cars. The pandemic led to disruptions in their manufacture as fabrication facilities were temporarily closed and supply chains became snarled, resulting in chip shortages throughout 2020 and 2021. At the same time, demand soared as people working and attending school from home realized they needed to upgrade their computers and devices, and the inability to take part in many group leisure activities gave the popularity of video games a boost.

Those trends have largely reversed in 2022, and AMD is far from the only company in its niche that has experienced a steep decline in value. The iShares Semiconductor ETF, which is a barometer for the broader sector, is down 43% year to date. But it's up 112% over the last five years, crushing even the Nasdaq-100 index.

AMD has one of the most diversified product lines in the industry in terms of its end users. It produces chips for gaming consoles, computers, virtual reality headsets, and Tesla's electric vehicles. But the data center segment is the most important one for the company. It has deals with some of the largest providers of cloud computing services in the world, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

Data centers have become more than just places to store information. They're now hives of computing activity where artificial intelligence and machine learning models are trained to make sense of mountains of data that humans could never process manually. Valuable insights can be drawn from those analyses, helping businesses serve customers more efficiently -- and, ultimately, make more money.

AMD might be set for a bumpy end to 2022

On Oct. 6, AMD released preliminary results for the third quarter, saying it booked an estimated $5.6 billion in revenue for the period. That was a big miss from the $6.7 billion the company had previously forecast.

The main drag on its results was the client segment, where sales shrank by 40% year over year due to falling demand for personal computers. But the big winner was the data center segment, where revenue grew by a whopping 45% to $1.6 billion. In the gaming and embedded segments, AMD delivered modest gains, and while the company's overall revenue missed expectations, it was still up 29% compared to the same period last year.

The key for investors here, though, is to focus on the big picture, because AMD is still on track for a 49% jump in annual revenue despite its third-quarter struggles. Plus, there's no denying its long-term trajectory based on the chart below.

AMD's acquisition of Xilinx could be key

AMD recently closed its $49 billion acquisition of Xilinx, which could set up the next five to 10 years of gains for shareholders. Xilinx is a global leader in adaptive computing, creating innovative chips that can repeatedly be optimized in real time -- after they have been installed -- to adapt their capacities to whatever specific application that is needed.

AMD believes this is the next big opportunity in high-performance computing, especially in areas like artificial intelligence, where solid-state chip hardware isn't evolving fast enough to meet demand. The capacity of adaptive chips to be reconfigured many times after they've been manufactured stands in stark contrast to typical chips that need to be fully replaced in order to upgrade.

To put it simply, AMD stock's 65% decline has most likely created a buying opportunity for the long term. This year has been more challenging in some ways for the company than 2020 or 2021, and 2023 may bring its own set of hurdles, but AMD continues to drive its business forward.

248,3 Stocks to Hold for the Next 20 Years,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/704827/saving-money-growth-investing.png,15/10/2022,These companies are gaining more relevance with consumers in travel and retail as they continue to expand.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/15/3-stocks-to-hold-for-the-next-20-years/,"The growth-centric Nasdaq Composite index delivered a 500% return between 2011 and 2021. The sell-off this year has given back a third of those gains. But while a bear market is never fun to live through, it often provides incredible buying opportunities.

The safest way to invest in a bear market is to stick with large, established companies that provide essential services to consumers and businesses. Investors who buy an equal amount of the following stocks should earn great returns over the next 20 years.

Airbnb is enjoying strong momentum

Spending on hotels and cruises has not fully recovered back to pre-pandemic levels, but that makes Airbnb's (ABNB -13.43%) recent results even more impressive. The rental platform reported $17 billion in gross booking value in the second quarter -- 73% higher than the same quarter in 2019. Airbnb was gaining share in global travel before the pandemic, and its outperformance in 2022 bodes well for long-term growth.

There are a few advantages working in Airbnb's favor. For one, it offers unique places to stay that travelers can't access through hotels. The company claims to have nearly every type of space you can imagine in almost every location around the world. If you've ever dreamed of living in a fairy-tale house shaped like a giant boot, you'll find it on Airbnb.

Another dynamic that solidifies Airbnb's competitive moat is a two-sided marketplace of renters and hosts. There are 4 million hosts on the platform that are drawn to the large customer pool and ability to turn their property into extra income. This is a powerful incentive that helps Airbnb attract hosts to handle spikes in demand in certain geographies. Its adaptable supply of listings is a key advantage over the big hotel companies.

Airbnb has grown from the founder's apartment in 2007 to a business that generated $47 billion in gross bookings in 2021. With a long-term addressable market of $3.4 trillion, and a stock trading at a more reasonable price-to-sales multiple than it did a few years ago, Airbnb offers market-beating return potential over the next 20 years.

Expectations are too low for this top e-commerce stock

With nearly half a trillion dollars in annual revenue, Amazon (AMZN -4.83%) might seem too large to deliver more returns. The 7% increase in net sales last quarter lends credence to that notion. But Amazon will likely reaccelerate sales back to double-digit growth rates soon enough. The tech titan's annual revenue is still peanuts compared to the $6.98 trillion value of the U.S. retail market, not to mention the massive opportunity in cloud computing at Amazon Web Services.

Market traders have sent the stock down 32% this year over slowing growth. Meanwhile, Amazon is clearly a more valuable business today than it was three years ago. This is evident in its second-quarter sales, which were nearly double the level of sales in the same quarter of 2019. Clearly, more customers and organizations are depending on Amazon more than ever.

Amazon continues to introduce new ways of generating revenue, including expanding into advertising, grocery, gaming, streaming, and even Amazon Care (virtual pharmacy). The company is widening its competitive moat and giving more than 200 million Prime members every reason to never leave their home to buy anything.

Amazon has historically turned its growing capital expenditures in new fulfillment centers into more revenue and free cash flow, which grows the value of the business and pushes the stock higher. With the stock trading at its cheapest price relative to sales in over five years, you don't want to miss the opportunity to buy shares during the market sell-off.

Costco is more relevant today than ever before

Costco Wholesale (COST -3.29%) is one of those stocks that gives you a warm and cozy feeling to own. It's a bonus that it just happens to be a financially rewarding stock to build your nest egg. The stock has delivered a 13-fold return over the last 20 years.

Costco's strategy is not rocket science. It buys in bulk to deliver big savings to the consumer, while keeping costs extremely low. Most of its razor-thin profit margin comes from membership fees.

Costco's warehouse stores are more relevant in today's economy. Comparable sales growth accelerated during the pandemic, and the recent sky-high inflation is pushing more shoppers to seek value. Coming off a strong fiscal fourth quarter, in which comp sales grew at a robust 13.7% year-over-year, September comp sales still look strong at 8.5%.

Shareholders should be happy to own the stock 20 years from now. While Costco shares still trade at a premium to the market average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, it's also never been cheap. While I wouldn't pay an extremely high valuation to buy shares, the current P/E of about 32 is a good enough to start a small position. Costco deserves a premium for its consistency, culture, and future opportunities to expand in e-commerce and international markets.",cloud computing,motley fool
249,Nodes are going to dethrone tech giants — from Apple to Google,https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjItMTAvNDYyMzFjZjMtMTY1Ni00NWU5LWI2MDUtNzUxMjI0YmQ5MDE2LmpwZw==.jpg,15/10/2022,Decentralized systems are slowly putting power back in the hands of developers and users — and taking it away from Big Tech companies.,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nodes-are-going-to-dethrone-tech-giants-from-apple-to-google,"While highly regarded even at the time of its writing, Marc Andreessen’s 2011 landmark essay, “Why Software Is Eating the World,” has proven even more prophetic than it seemed at the time. At the dawn of a decade when software would prove invaluable to nearly every aspect of modern life, Andreessen argued that every company was now ostensibly a software company, whether the company liked it or not.

Tailoring his argument to many of the companies that were market leaders at the time, his ideas eventually also applied to companies that either hadn’t fully defined their markets or didn’t even yet exist but would go on to generate billions in market share: Uber, Lyft, TikTok/ByteDance, Robinhood and Coinbase, among several others. If you were going to be a unicorn in the 21st century, software was probably going to be a key part of earning that horn.

Related: Facebook is going to destroy the Metaverse and Web3

The hidden motor behind this complete disruption of modern economies and life was the emergence of true cloud computing and cloud giants, an industry in which Andreessen himself had been a pioneer at a time when many inside and outside computing were scoffing at the notion.

But there was a great cost to making so much of life so easy.

By the second decade of the 21st century, they weren’t scoffing much at all. In the 2010s, worldwide spending on cloud computing more than quintupled, from $77 billion to $411 billion. It was the backbone of what made everything accessible at the touch of a button on the computer in our pocket.

Related: Facebook and Twitter will soon be obsolete thanks to blockchain technology

While the mobile-powered software revolution made life as easy as the push of a button, as with anything else, it came with its own compromises. With software eating the world, it became the province of very few, very large cloud hosting companies. Amazon, Google and Microsoft now account for 65% of the cloud hosting market.

This created its own sort of shadow monopoly via cloud hosting. For example, with cloud hosting in particular, hosts can knock services off of clouds, as Amazon did with the notorious social media service Parler. Parler was also banned from Apple’s App Store.

Related: Biden is hiring 87,000 new IRS agents — and they’re coming for you

When it comes to the larger issue at stake here, it doesn’t matter whether or not you agree with a service like Parler. What the incident demonstrated was that it only took two companies, Amazon and Apple, to completely knock a service offline, effectively putting it out of business in the post-software world.

What happens when a service or developer runs afoul of a more innocuous Amazon policy or term of service? The internet has been painted into a corner where it can no longer truly be a marketplace of free ideas and free development, especially if that development is somehow perceived as a threat by companies like Amazon and Microsoft.

Nodes can build a new world

Just as Bitcoin (BTC) “broke” money and allowed people to think about the exchange of value in new ways, newer blockchain protocols have the chance to “break” data in a world that has been consumed by software and oligopolistic companies, allowing us to think about the exchange of that data in new ways.

Web3 and the projects it will birth promise to redefine how information lives and is carried through the internet autonomously and transparently. Decentralization-first and community-first ecosystems promise to put power back into the hands of developers and, thus, the users who will use their decentralized applications (DApps) and software. This will allow for a common framework that promotes best practices and economies of scale that will be able to compete with the largest centralized entities on the internet.

That isn’t to say we’ve yet reached a decentralized utopia. Though decentralized systems are also ostensibly “trustless” systems, it is ironically trust that still must be built up in these systems for both developers and users. Whatever the disadvantages of relying on companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple, they have banked decades’ worth of that trust, credibility and familiarity that makes it difficult for both developers and users to switch to an entirely new way of doing things.

Part of building that trust is rewiring the incentivization model that has supported the last several decades of the internet. For a new decentralized internet to work, it will mean users buying into nodes and developers best utilizing those nodes to build software that is simple enough to run and access on one’s phone as Uber or Wordle.

If the decentralized Web3 community is able to do that, we can restore the world that was eaten by software, one node at a time.

This video was recorded on Oct. 8, 2022.

John Rotonti: Ten to 15 years ago, the industry was largely driven by PC cycles and iPhone cycles, to be honest with you. But now, like we said, they go into everything. I mean, is demand for the cloud going to go away? I don't think so.

Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill and that's Motley Fool senior analyst John Rotonti. He joined fellow analyst Jason Moser for an introduction to semiconductors. Computers, cars, and whatever you're using right now to listen to this podcast need them to function. They're an important building block for our economy. Today, John and Jason discuss companies in the semiconductor value chain, the industry's risks, and one important chipmaker that's cheaper than the S&P 500.

Jason Moser: Let's go and start from the very beginning. What are semiconductors and why are they so important to the economy now?

John Rotonti: Thanks, Jason, one of my favorite things to talk about. Semiconductors are the brains of all electronic devices. They partially or semi-conduct currents. They are largely made of silicon, which is made from sand. Like beach sand. They're varying sizes, but most of them are, you can think about the size of your thumbnail or a postage stamp. These very small devices are packed with, in some cases, tens of billions of transistors.

Jason Moser: It's a lot.

John Rotonti: Yeah. Exactly right. Especially when you're packing them onto something the size of a postage stamp. These transistors amplify currents and actually turn electrical signals on and off. You've got these electronic brains that power devices. They are in everything from the remote control on your TV to the fastest supercomputers in the world, to healthcare devices, to our military's weapons systems. They are a matter of life and death, literally when it comes to healthcare, when it comes to national security.

They are the devices that power our modern digital economy and digital world. We would not have cloud computing without semiconductors, we would not have artificial intelligence or machine learning. We would not have video gaming. We will not have the metaverse if that comes to play. All of these things, EVs, 5G, all of these modern technologies, all of these innovations are powered by semiconductors. To sum up, I would say they are the critical infrastructure and modern building block of the digital economy.

Jason Moser: Yeah, it really does feel like we're only headed more and more in that direction. Their role, it really should only grow in importance. I think when we look at this industry, I find the actual value chain in semiconductors to be very interesting. I think there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes that maybe some folks don't realize in the market that comes to mind, it reminds me a little bit of the payments industry. If you look at it on the surface, you think it's just simple. Oh, well, companies make these semiconductors and boom, and it goes into your device and consumers use them.

But then when you look at the value chain behind the scenes and all of the different participants in this market. It's worth noting because there are a lot of different ways to capitalize on this as investors, so let's talk about the main touch points of this value chain. The semiconductor. Most people are probably familiar with names like Qualcomm or Intel. Those are semiconductor companies, but there are companies even before that, that are involved in making the actual physical material. I mean, you've got everything from foundries and the equipment companies and then designers. Walk us through that value chain if you could.

John Rotonti: Yeah, Jason, the value chain is fascinating because it is so complex and technologically advanced and capital-intensive that if you look at the value chain, which we'll go through in a second. At every step of the semiconductor manufacturing value chain, these global oligopolies or duopolies or in some cases, even earned monopolies have formed. Basically, the first stage of making a semiconductor, designing a semiconductor is designing it using software. You take a company like Nvidia or Apple that wants to design their next semiconductor, they're going to use software, very likely from one or two companies because these are the two companies that do it at scale globally. It's Synopsys, and Cadence Design Systems. If you think about a blue, an architectural blueprint for your house or building. This is the architectural blueprint for a semiconductor. Just much more complicated because like we said, there are tens of billions of transistors they need to map and blueprint onto the chip.

These two companies, they are electronic design automation software companies, really they're computational design software companies. This is highly, highly complicated. This software is using a combination of matrix algebra, multivariate calculus, AI, advanced geometry, and more. This is not a software that you take an online course in Python or something you learn how to use it. This is software run by specialists, masters and Ph.D.s in this software. That's the first stage is to, is to blueprint it out using this software. Then what happens after that is that software is is printed onto a mask, and then that mask, which is just like a stencil basically, or a model. That mask is then used to print the blueprint onto a silicon wafer, which is usually 12 inches in diameter. It's a circular, thin piece of silicon that's 12 inches in diameter.

To do that, you use extreme ultraviolet light and a series of lasers and mirrors to print that blueprint onto the silicon wafer. There's only one company in the world that does that extreme ultraviolet lithography. We'll get into that in a second, but it's ASML, a Dutch company. Then from there basically there's three main steps. You deposit a bunch of chemicals onto these chips and those depositions, there's basically three primary companies that do the deposition or deposit, and that's Lam Research, Applied Materials, and Tokyo Electron. Then you etch away or carve out little holes where the transistors go. That's called etch. There's basically three companies that do that and it's the same three. It's Lam Research, Applied Materials, and Tokyo Electron. So you have two main software companies.

You've got three main semi-capital equipment companies that do the etching and the deposition. You've got one company doing the light sourcing, that's ASML. Then you have a couple of companies that, that test it after the semiconductor is made. The two big ones there are Teradyne and Advantest, which is a private company. All of this takes place in a foundry. The big foundries are the largest foundry is Taiwan Semiconductor. Samsung is another leading player. There is a major player for lagging-edge semiconductors, foundry manufacturing, and that's GlobalFoundries. Then Intel's a fourth player trying to get into third-party manufacturing. That's the semiconductor manufacturing value chain in a synopsis.

Jason Moser: Well, very well done by the way and I appreciate it because I think you showed that this industry that just seems to be so simple on the surface as consumers we buy these devices, but the behind the scenes is just so much more involved. It's always great to know that from the investing perspective, knowing that value chain I think is key for whatever industry you're focused on. Semiconductors certainly you can see is a very involved value chain as well and it seems like there's a theme there in that. This is just very highly technically skilled work.

John Rotonti: Yeah.

Jason Moser: The barriers to entry just on understanding how to do this and getting the talent to be able to do this, and getting the equipment and the software to be able to do this. It just seems like those barriers to entry are very, very high.

John Rotonti: I would agree.

Jason Moser: Yeah. So you focus your coverage specifically on foundries and semi-cap equipment companies and so I wanted to dig into those a little bit more because that's where you pay most of your attention. Who are the major competitors? We talk about them a little bit but let's dig into the major competitors in that part of the value chain and the foundries and the semi-cap equipment companies and we'll talk a little bit about their advantages and their merits as investment ideas.

John Rotonti: Starting with foundries, we mentioned Taiwan Semi and Samsung. Those are the two leading advanced, leading-edge, semiconductor third-party manufacturing foundries. There's also GlobalFoundries, Intel, maybe a few smaller players, but you can't talk about foundries without talking about Taiwan Semi. The reason is because I think it's one of the if not the most indispensable company in the world. It has 50% market share of all of the outsourced chips manufactured in the world. That's roughly three times higher than the next-largest player, which is Samsung. They have so 50% market share of all chips manufacturered, but they have 85%-90% market share of the world's most advanced chips. Because of that, it generates 90% of global contract foundry profits. It really is this earned monopoly or duopoly with Samsung right now.

It got this position by investing heavily ahead of everyone else, heavily ahead of demand, and being an early adopter of extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography machines by ASML. Taiwan Semi owns more ASML machines than anybody else in the planet and Taiwan Semi has more experience using these extremely complex machines than anyone else in the planet. Because Taiwan Semi has 90% market share of the world's most advanced chips, it has a much, much larger library of recipes or process knowledge or process technology for manufacturing these chips. Each chip has its own recipe and each node builds off the recipe of the prior node.

With semiconductor manufacturing, Jason, scale and market share beget more scale, and more market share, and faster and better process learnings. Process knowledge is extremely capital-intensive. I think Taiwan Semi is going to spend somewhere on the order of $40 billion in capex this year or next year, 40 billion in one year. It's going to be very hard for competitors to catch up. Finally, Taiwan Semi has built up an ecosystem and works extremely closely with all of the major players in the semiconductor manufacturing supply chain that we already talked about. If you go to Taiwan and you go to their facilities, well guess what, Lam Research is located right there, Applied Materials is located right there, ASML has teams right there so they built up these ecosystems around the business.

Jason Moser: I think it's very clear the pros. I think it's very clear the competitive advantages that these businesses possess and I think that either the follow-up to that that I'd really have for you is just what do you consider the threats for businesses like these and so you talk about, are there really any threats for Taiwan Semi?

John Rotonti: I think so and that ties into the valuation right now, Jason. Taiwan Semi is at I looked yesterday, I haven't looked this morning, I know stocks are down. I think it's around 72 down from 145 stock price, so it's down 50% from its 52-week high, has 2.5% dividend yield, Jason, this company that I just explained to you, that is integral to the world is trading at a forward P/E of 12.

Jason Moser: Why?

John Rotonti: I think and just let me just put that into perspective. The S&P 500, the market is trading at about 15 or 16, so it's had a three or four turn discount to the market. I think the reason you asked the risk, I think the market is concerned that it's located in Taiwan and that China claims to control Taiwan and there's been talk and rhetoric recently that China maybe possibly could invade Taiwan. That's the risk and that's why I think there's this overhang on the stock, Jason.

Jason Moser: Yeah, the geopolitical risks. It's something always to keep in mind, obviously out of our control. Nothing we can really control, but it's always something to acknowledge. You see, obviously what's going on with Russia and Ukraine. Those are things that happen. You can't very well predict them but then it also, it goes to show even market leaders like that. There's always going to be a risk that you need to identify and that certainly seems to be very reasonable with Taiwan Semi.

John Rotonti: Even if you take China and geopolitical risk out of the equation, there are other risks. Intel is spending billions of dollars to try to catch up, billions. Competitive risk is there, technological obsolescence to an extent is there, and then semiconductors, the industry has historically been cyclical. I think it's less cyclical now than it's been in the past and we can maybe talk about that now or another time, but there is some cyclicality as well. There's a risk that you could be buying a stock at the top of a cycle, I don't think that's a risk right now. But over a long period of time there is a risk you could be buying at the top and then you have to maybe wait a couple of years for the stock price to catch up, but I think those are the big risks.

Jason Moser: I'm glad you brought up that cyclicality risk because I think that's something that definitely is worth touching on. I run a couple of services here at the Fool that focus on immersive technology, 5G, stuff like that. I've got my share of chip companies and they're your Qualcomms and your AMDs, and your Nvidias of the world. It does feel to me like the cyclicality risk isn't what it used to be. I guess that really goes back to what you were talking about at the top of the show, in that this is the lifeblood of virtually everything we do now, this technology. It's an everything that we do.

John Rotonti: Exactly right.

Jason Moser: It feels like the cyclicality now is more or less just based on where we are in the innovation cycle. But regardless, because this technology is so widespread all around the world, that cyclicality window just seems to be shrinking a bit.

John Rotonti: I think so Jason, 10-15 years ago the industry was largely driven by PC cycles and iPhone cycles, to be honest with you, but now like we said, they go into everything. Is demand for the cloud going to go away? I don't think so. Is demand for EVs and 5G going to go away? Is demand for AI and machine learning going to go away? The use cases, the end markets, the total addressable markets for semiconductors is just so much larger than it was. The other thing is that we've had a couple of major periods of consolidation across the industry. At some point in time there used to be 20-30 competitors, now you've got 3, 4, or 5 competitors. Because of that, I think the remaining competitors are much more rational in their pricing. That avoids the boom-bust pricing cycles of the past. Then if you look at the fundamentals, the last down cycle we had, I think was 2018, like real down cycle. We're in one now a little bit but if you look at the trough margins now and in 2018. The lowest the margins get at a down cycle, those are now higher than peak margins in previous cycles, Jason.

Jason Moser: Wow.

John Rotonti: The fundamentals of the industry have dramatically improved in my view.

Jason Moser: That's astounding. Another thing it's been in the headlines a lot lately, we've been talking a lot about it on the investing team, trying to get just a better idea of where we think, ultimately, how this plays out the CHIPS Act. This supply chain crunch that we've been going through, it's something that we see in virtually every earnings call because this technology is in everything, so it seems like every company on the face of the Earth has exposure to this.

John Rotonti: Sure.

Jason Moser: The CHIPS Act, I wonder, do you have an opinion there? We're talking about $50-plus billion ultimately, that's going to be devoted to spark domestic semiconductor manufacturing. It feels like on the surface, that's a smart idea, diversify that supply chain a little bit, yet I can't help but wonder if maybe this isn't money that's just disappear here and there and not really have as material an impact. I wonder if you have any strong feelings one way or the other on the CHIPS Act.

John Rotonti: I don't have strong feelings on how effective it will be yet, just because it's so new but I'd like to think, Jason, that it's a good start. If we want to build a homegrown semiconductor domestic supply chain, 50 billion is not enough and we talked about Taiwan Semi is going to invest 40 billion on its own this year.

Jason Moser: Just one year.

John Rotonti: Just one company in one year, Jason. The U.S. used to manufacture a lot more of the world's chips, so it used to be 30% or 40% of the world's semiconductors were manufactured in the U.S., now it's 12% and so that's a national security risk. It really came into play during the pandemic when we had all the supply chain bottlenecks, we could really feel it tangibly, you couldn't buy it. Auto manufacturers, for example, couldn't make new cars because they couldn't get the semiconductors because nowadays cars are just chips on wheels. What happened was everyone started buying used cars and that drove up used car pricing. I think it's a good first start, I think it's going to take a decade or more if we're going to be successful and it's going to take hundreds of billions of dollars but we have to start somewhere and so I'm hopeful, Jason.

Jason Moser: Yeah. I think that's a good way, I'm hopeful. It absolutely feels like it's just a start because like you said, it requires so much investment.

John Rotonti: Yeah. One more quick thing, Jason. When it comes to manufacturing, the U.S. is at a deficit, most of the chips are manufactured in the East, that's just a fact. Two-thirds to 70% of the world's chips flow through the island of Taiwan. They're made in the East but we should also point out that the IP, Jason, exists in the West, so those two software companies, Cadence and Synopsys, those are U.S. companies.

Jason Moser: Oh, yeah.

John Rotonti: Those three large semi-cap equipment companies, Lam Research, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron is in the East but throw in Teradyne and let's throw in KLAC, four huge semi-cap equipment companies all located in the West. Then ASML, maybe the most important of the semi-cap equipment companies, that's a European Dutch company, so a lot of the IP, the majority of the IP is in the West. There is this dichotomy of the IP versus the manufacturing, we're just trying to bring back some of that manufacturing.

Jason Moser: Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Given that, let's wrap up the show today. You and I were reading an article the other day, from CNBC, it was just an interesting view. It struck me as the past versus the future. This was an article that dug into Intel and Nvidia. Intel is saying that Moore's law is still alive and well, Nvidia says, no longer. Really quickly, what's Moore's law and what did you think about this article?

John Rotonti: Jason, Moore's law states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every two years. If we assume the price of the chip stays the same, then the cost of that chip falls in half every two years. Basically, Moore's law says, that chip performance doubles over two years. If we look back in the 1970s, Intel was a chip leader. The chips it was putting out in the 1970s had between 2,000 and 6,000 transistors on them. Today, the Apple M1 Chip, which was pretty revolutionary, Jason, has 16 billion transistors. A chip, the Graviton2 that goes into Amazon Web Services that runs their cloud in their data centers, it has 30 billion transistors on it. The question is Jason, how many of these transistors can we continue to pack onto something the size of your thumbnail?

Jason Moser: But that's right, we run into a physics problem at some point? It's what should be a physics problem.

John Rotonti: Yeah. The edge of physics. What we do is, we do two things. One is we make 3D chips and we start building transistors on top of each other, it's like a skyscraper. Then the other thing is we use extreme ultraviolet light and these machines by ASML. The reason you have to use this extreme ultraviolet light, it's because you need extremely small wavelengths of light in order to trace the pattern of the transistors. You have to bring the transistors closer and closer together and the only way to do that is to use extremely small wavelengths of light. I think in that article, Intel was talking about getting to 100 billion transistors on a chip and we're like 50 billion today.

Once again, that's doubling from 50-100. Can we get there? I hope so because I want to see what the world looks like with 100 billion transistors on a chip. Nvidia is saying, we're up against the limits of Moore's Law and so to get around that, you're going to have to make highly specialized chips used for highly specialized devices and purposes and that's what Nvidia. Nvidia doesn't make commodity chips, Jason, Nvidia makes chips that only it can make and so who's going to be right? I really don't know but I tell you what, Nvidia is an amazing company and Intel was a company that was once amazing and it's trying to turn itself around. I think if anyone could do it, it's Pat Gelsinger, their new CEO, so it will be fun and interesting to watch.

See why I do not believe that MSFT stock is a great short pick at current valuations.,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4546707-microsoft-dont-lose-your-money,"BernardaSv

Article Thesis

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a very high-quality company with growth tailwinds that seems poised for compelling total returns in the long run from the current level. And yet, famous short seller Hedgeye recently recommended Microsoft as a compelling short idea. I do not believe that MSFT is a great short pick at current valuations, as I will lay out in this article, and I do believe that shorting Microsoft could be a money-losing idea. Both from a valuation perspective and from a business-quality perspective, there are way better short ideas available for those that are interested in shorting individual stocks.

One Of The Highest-Quality Companies In The World

I do believe that Microsoft can be described as a company of excellent quality. This belief is based on several factors. The first one is Microsoft's excellent balance sheet. As one of just two companies in the world, it holds an AAA credit rating, the other one being Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). In other words, rating agencies believe that a Microsoft default is less likely than a US government default, showcasing the exceptionally low financial risks for Microsoft.

Microsoft 10-K

The company holds a net cash position of $58 billion, as we can see in the above excerpt from Microsoft's most recent 10-K. That is equal to about 4% of the company's current market capitalization, which is a much stronger cash balance compared to what most other companies operate with.

Microsoft has many other strengths on top of that, however. Its returns on capital and margins are excellent, for example:

Data by YCharts

Microsoft's net profit margin stands at a very high level of 37%, which has several advantages. First, it means that Microsoft will earn a large amount of money on incremental sales, meaning that business growth is highly profitable for investors over time. On top of that, the very high profit margin protects Microsoft from downturns. If inflation (e.g., for employee compensation) were to hurt Microsoft's profit margins by a couple hundred of base points, the company could easily stomach that. A company operating with low profit margins would see its net profits get devastated in the same scenario.

Microsoft's quality is also showcased by its recession resilience. Many of the company's products are essential for business and how we live our lives, such as the Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite. Not surprisingly, MSFT has seen its revenue remain very resilient versus past crises:

Data by YCharts

Since the company went public around 40 years ago, there was barely any revenue decline. During the Great Recession and in 2016 revenues dropped marginally, but that was by far not enough to threaten the company's profitability meaningfully. The company thus also didn't have to cut its dividend in those times, although it should be noted that its dividend yield is rather low, making MSFT far from a great income pick. Still, the resilience versus recessions and other types of macro issues such as the pandemic is great for long-term holders, especially for those that are looking for a sleep-well-at-night pick.

Last but not least, Microsoft also has strong management in place. Its current CEO Satya Nadella has guided the company very well for years and has identified clear growth trends such as mobile and cloud computing.

Data by YCharts

Insiders own a little more than 6% of the company, and that amount has been growing over the years. That amounts to around $100 billion that insiders have invested in the company, leading to strong alignment with other shareholders -- there's thus little risk that the company's executives will pursue strategies that will not create value for the company's owners.

Microsoft thus is a company of great quality, but there are two other reasons on top of that why I believe that shorting MSFT is far from a great idea here.

Microsoft Has A Compelling Growth Outlook

First, the company should experience considerable business growth and even stronger earnings per share growth over the coming years. As we have seen earlier, recessions have barely any impact on Microsoft, thus the current economic downturn does not seem like a reason to worry too much. In the long run, several macro trends are poised to lead to significant revenue gains for the company. With Azure, Microsoft is one of the leading cloud computing companies in the world. The cloud computing market is forecasted to grow at an annual rate of 16% between 2022 and 2028 according to this study. As one of the leading players in this space, Microsoft should get a sizeable portion of the to-be-created market opportunity.

Its legacy businesses Windows and Office will be growing less, but will deliver some growth nevertheless. Price increases and some additions of new customers, e.g., due to digitalization in developing countries, should allow for a meaningful growth rate, even though double-digit revenue gains are unlikely in those segments in the long run. Microsoft's gaming business is not overly large yet, relative to the company's size overall, but keeps growing, and its pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI) should accelerate Microsoft's growth potential in that space further, due to MSFT getting access to strong IP and ATVI's talent.

Between these growth drivers, Microsoft is forecasted to see its revenue grow by double-digits every year through 2030:

Seeking Alpha

Of course, forecasting revenues 5 or 8 years from now comes with considerable uncertainties. So let's assume that actual growth will be just half as high as expected, even though Microsoft has a history of outperforming expectations -- it has beaten revenue estimates in 9 out of the last 10 quarters. If revenue growth is just half as high as expected, that would pencil out to an annual growth rate of around 6%. That would still be far from bad. Earnings per share growth should be higher, due to the impact of share repurchases. With Microsoft trading at a low 20s earnings multiple today, it can repurchase shares at a pretty meaningful pace.

Data by YCharts

Buybacks have totaled $31 billion over the last year, equal to around 2% of the company's market capitalization. The buyback amount has been steadily growing, however, which is why I believe that future buybacks will be higher. But even with 2% of its shares being bought back per year, Microsoft's earnings per share would likely grow at a pace of 8% in the 6% revenue growth scenario.

Thus, when we expect that MSFT will massively underperform expectations and grow just half as much as forecasted, even though MSFT has a history of performing better than expected, Microsoft still should deliver a high-single-digit earnings per share growth rate. Shorting unprofitable companies, or those with declining profits, seems like a better idea to me compared to shorting highly profitable companies with good earnings growth outlooks that can buy back shares at a hefty pace.

Microsoft: Valuation Is Undemanding

Last but not least, there's a final reason why I believe that Microsoft is far from a great short today. In fact, I believe that MSFT is suitable for a long investment at current prices.

The company's valuation was pretty high a year ago, but has come down to a very reasonable level in the recent past:

Data by YCharts

At current prices, Microsoft trades for a low-20s earnings multiple, while next year's earnings multiple is even lower, at just 19. That is, I believe, an inexpensive valuation for a company of great quality that has a compelling growth outlook. Also, very telling, it represents a clear discount compared to how Microsoft was valued over the last three and five years. In fact, its valuation could expand by close to 50% for the company to trade in line with the averages over the last 3 and 5 years. The 10-year median earnings multiple is lower, but still around 20% higher than the company's current valuation. This suggests that right now is a relatively opportune time to add shares of Microsoft. At the same time, with MSFT trading below the historic valuation norm today, it looks like a rather bad time to enter a short position. Microsoft was trading at a historically high earnings multiple of 36 at the beginning of the year -- it would have been a much better short back then. But shares have dropped more than 30% since then, and now they don't look like a good short at all, I believe.

Takeaway

Microsoft is a great company with a compelling long-term growth outlook. At the same time, its current valuation is below the historically normal range today. I thus believe that right now is a bad time to enter a short position in Microsoft stock, especially as it has proven to be very resilient versus recessions in the past.

Of course, every stock could decline during an ongoing market downturn. But if one wants to speculate on that, shorting the indices could be a better idea. Alternatively, shorting non-profitable or highly leveraged companies could be a solid way to play an ongoing market downturn. But shorting one of the highest-quality companies in the world while it is trading at a clear discount compared to how it used to be valued does not seem like a good strategy to me -- it could lose short sellers a lot of money.",cloud computing,seeking alpha

This groundbreaking collaboration will bring to market the world’s first dedicated 5G handheld console — equipped with the world’s most advanced display of any gaming handheld, powered by the latest Snapdragon® G3xFort Gen 1 Gaming Platform, and running on Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband, the 5G network for gaming. It is specifically engineered to provide the best gaming performance while on the go.



“The core concept of every product we put out always boils down to one thing, our ‘For Gamers. By Gamers.’ motto,” said Richard Hashim, Head of Razer’s Mobile & Console Division. “With the Razer Edge, we’ve created the ultimate handheld gaming platform. Together with Verizon and Qualcomm, we designed the Razer Edge 5G to be a true gamer device, capable of supporting gamers’ entire catalogs of AAA games or allowing them to stream endlessly online, taking their gaming experience on the go with low latency.”

Game anywhere and everywhere

No longer held back by cords or older-generation Wi-Fi, the Razer Edge 5G features absolute cutting-edge 5G Ultra Wideband connectivity, giving you the option to get off the couch and experience true mobile gaming on the go. Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband network is like having the power and performance of the best home broadband network right in your pocket. Gamers no longer need to be wired to their home network or endlessly searching for a reliable Wi-Fi hotspot when out and about.



“With the Razer Edge 5G you’ll have, in your hands, a full mobile gaming system with a reliable connection that can provide ultra-fast speeds, with low lag all on Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband — the 5G network for gaming,” said Brian Higgins, SVP, Device and Consumer Product Marketing, Verizon. “In other words, you’ll soon be able to smash the competition, all while giving your favorite gaming chair a bit of a break for the day.”

Thousands of games on one device

From day-one, the Razer Edge 5G will have thousands of AAA games compatible with the device, whether it be native Android games and pre-installed launchers like Epic Games, cloud streaming services like Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) and Nvidia GeForce Now, or remote play options offering full access to PC libraries like Steam Link, Moonlight, Parsec, and Xbox. With unlimited access to catalogs of games on the go, the Razer Edge 5G delivers ultimate quality without sacrificing remote accessibility or content availability.



“It’s our mission to make gaming available to more players around the world, whether it’s those already in the Xbox community or someone who wants to play Xbox for the very first time,” said Catherine Gluckstein, Vice President of Xbox Cloud Gaming at Microsoft. “Working with hardware partners like Razer to include Xbox Cloud Gaming on new gaming handhelds opens up all-new possibilities for players to experience Xbox on the go.”

Stunning visuals

The Razer Edge delivers uncompromising performance and fidelity starting with its display. The 6.8” AMOLED™ touchscreen display pushes up to a 144hz refresh rate at 2400x1080 FHD+ resolution, providing upwards of 87% more pixels than competitive offerings. AMOLED technology delivers better color contrast with deeper blacks, faster response times, lower temperature performance, and a nearly limitless viewing angle, all while consuming less power than typical LCD displays. AAA games shine to their full potential at home or on the go with this best-in-class display. Steam Link users can enjoy gameplay at 144Hz on the Razer Edge, fully leveraging both the fast display, and Valve's extensive catalog of games.

Ultimate gaming hardware

Built with gaming in mind with every component, the Razer Edge 5G is engineered to be the ultimate handheld gaming hardware. Starting with the platform, the Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 Gaming Platform is built from the ground up to deliver superior Android gaming performance. The Snapdragon G3x features a 3Ghz octa-core Kryo CPU and an Adreno GPU built for maximum graphics and industry leading performance per watt, so gamers will never have to compromise power for performance in long gaming sessions. Early benchmark testing shows the Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 performing 2-3x speeds of standard mobile platforms like the Snapdragon 720G.

It's time to think about using cash you have in the bank to fight back! Khanchit Khirisutchalual

Brian Dress, CFA -- Director of Research, Investment Advisor

If you’ve read this newsletter over the past year, there is no doubt you are tiring of hearing the constant drumbeat of the inflation and interest rate narrative. Believe me, inflation is exhausting me too.

However, the reality is that we remain deeply entrenched in the inflation story, with little end in sight. Though these figures can be backward-looking in nature, this week we saw fresh prints in the Producer Price Index (PPI) of +8.5% year-over-year and in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of +8.2%. Despite whether we quibble with the way these numbers are calculated, the Federal Reserve continues to use these metrics in their decision making process.

The upshot: we expect rate hikes to continue with fervor in the near term, which continues to weigh on markets. As we’ve said over the past few months, we continue to approach markets, particularly stocks, defensively. We have just seen a more-than-a-decade long bull market come to an end and, even after all that carnage, we see household name stocks still carrying premium valuations. These include Microsoft (MSFT; price/sales ratio of 8.9x), Nvidia (NVDA; price/sales of 10.2x), and Tesla (TSLA; price/sales of 11.4x). These are high-quality companies with strong business models and robust growth. With that said, markets became accustomed to high valuations on growth companies over the last decade of near-zero interest rates.

In investing, almost as important as the securities you own is the price you pay for them. Is it reasonable to expect that companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla will be higher in five years than they are today? Probably. But given the current valuation on these businesses, our view is that there will be turbulence for shareholders, so long as interest rates remain elevated. At this stage, given inflation data, we don’t expect this dynamic to change soon.

As active investors, we pride ourselves on reading the trends in the market. Not only do we want to be invested in companies with strong business fundamentals, but also we want those stock prices to be moving in the right direction. The mere fact that the stock associated with a quality business is down 30, 40, 50% (or more) does not define an appropriate investment thesis. In our view, we have yet to see investors fully throw in the towel on growth stocks and, until that day, it is hard to imagine large cap growth stocks to rebound meaningfully.

The flip side of lower securities prices is opportunity. Just like stocks, bond prices have dropped dramatically in 2022. We are starting to see investment grade bonds from well-known companies carrying yields of 6-9%, even in sectors that are actually performing well in today’s economy. We think investors sitting with cash in the bank, losing ground every day to inflation, need to act with some urgency. Now is the chance to lock in the types of yields we have not seen in the bond market in nearly a generation. Once the rate cycle does reverse, we think these securities will be some of the first to rise. In today’s letter, we will describe two such securities for you.

With that all being said, let’s get into it!

Below is the performance data of key indices, ETFs for the five trading days between 10/6/22 and 10/13/22:

Yahoo! Finance, Left Brain

What is/is not Working?

Despite an impressive counter-trend rally in Thursday’s session, the broad market S&P 500 still lost 2% in value over the past week of trading. Given the volatility that marked the last week, it certainly felt worse to us. Just two sectors gained on the week, consumer staples (up 1.74%) and energy (up 1.19%). Energy continues to be our highest conviction and most-overweighted sector.

We are warming to the story in consumer staples. This week we received the earnings report from PepsiCo (PEP). We learned that the company grew revenues by 10% in the last quarter, but prices were up 17% on a yearly basis. That report makes us look at consumer staples stocks with fresh eyes: they have struggled throughout the year, but it is clearly that these companies have pricing power. Further, food and other commodity prices have started to slide significantly. As that trend continues, we think margins could expand for these companies. We will study this theme more in depth in our future articles and videos, as additional earnings reports come in over the next few weeks.

In a week where both stocks and bonds sold off significantly, you would not be surprised that the best performing ETFs were those that bet against those markets, including Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3x Shares (TMV), ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ), AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF (HDGE), and ProShares Short High Yield (SJB).

Among the long-oriented funds that did well, there were a couple surprises. The first was the strength in the cannabis sector, which has been one of the most-downtrodden groups of stocks in the markets. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (MSOS) was the strongest of all the ETFs we follow, rising nearly 11% over the past week. Also, despite rising rates, we saw strong performance from the PIMCO Municipal Income Fund (PMF). We like municipal bonds for investors in high tax brackets, currently holding cash at the bank. Many municipals are tax-free and may be appropriate for those with funds in taxable brokerage accounts, looking for a place to hide.

Beyond those surprises, we saw four of our top 20 ETFs coming from the energy space, including the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) and the ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Fund Inc (CEM), which covers stocks in the pipeline side of the energy business. We will cover our thoughts on pipelines further later in the letter.

On the negative side of the ledger, we continued to see the biggest slides in the “risk on” segments of the market, concentrated in tech and tech-adjacent sectors. Crypto was hit especially hard this week (even though Bitcoin itself held up fairly well), with Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (OTCQX:ETHE), and Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) all down double-digits for the week.

Chinese internet stocks were the worst performing group this week, with the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) down a whopping 14.28% in just a week. We continue to preach caution to investors in terms of investing in emerging markets, particularly in China. Our preference for international exposure continues to be for US multinationals, who have plenty of economic sensitivity to those regions. Our favorite play on China continues to be Starbucks (SBUX).

Tech and other risk on sectors here in the US also are having a hard time finding footing. We saw major declines in VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY), Invesco Solar ETF (TAN), Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO), and the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). In practice, we have observed these particular segments of the market to be extremely interest-rate sensitive, with high multiple stocks moving with almost complete negative correlation to interest rates. We think caution continues to be warranted in these areas until interest rates stop rising so consistently.

Inflation Fighting Idea #1: Starwood Bonds

We have been as explicit as possible in this space, over the past months, that we think the best opportunities in financial markets lie in the fixed return space. This means we have oriented much of our research capacity to identifying new and novel opportunities in bonds. For years we were forced to reach down into the lower depths of the junk bond markets to find income for our investors in or near retirement. Though we had some reservations with the risk profiles of these instruments as an asset class, persistently low rates forced investors to bear more risk than was comfortable to generate the income that was essential to cover their expenses in retirement.

Clearly, higher interest rates have been a challenge for both stock and bond investors throughout 2022. On the other hand, for investors with cash in the bank still earning close to zero, we continue to unearth attractive opportunities to lock in generous income for many years going forward. Not only that, higher rates empower investors to find those generous annual yields in high quality income securities with relatively low default risk. For those straining to generate income with your portfolios over the last 15 years, you will know that this opportunity has not existed at all in that time.

Right now, we are carrying cash balances much higher than normal in investor accounts. The reason for this is that we have sold many stocks that we previously favored, understanding that we are in a bear market. One such company stock that we have sold over the past year is Starwood Property Trust (STWD). For those unfamiliar with Starwood, this is a diversified mortgage Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that provides financing for a variety of real estate projects, including residential, commercial, infrastructure, and beyond. The company is managed by one of our favorite CEOs in Barry Sternlicht, who has overseen the growth of the company since its 2009 IPO to become one of the largest commercial real estate financing companies in the world.

REITs (and real estate in general) has been one of the hardest hit corners of the economy, owing to the obvious interest rate sensitivity of the business model. As such, we have moved away from any stock positions in companies like Starwood. But we still like the underlying business and the superior management in place. Despite the challenges in 2022 from the interest rate perspective, Starwood has maintained its interest coverage ratio (one of the most important metrics for creditworthiness) at a constant value relative to historical levels. This gives us great confidence that the company remains strong and well-positioned to service its obligations, even in a higher rate environment.

We like a number of securities in the bond “stack” of Starwood, but one stands out. The 4.75% 2025 Starwood bonds do carry an investment grade credit rating. As rates have risen, the price of the bond has fallen and now trades at a discounted price of roughly 94 cents on the dollar. Considering both the capital appreciation potential and the coupon income involved here, investors have the opportunity to lock in roughly 7.7% of total annual return on these bonds. We also like the short-term nature of the bonds here. Once the bond matures, we are hopeful that the stock market will be on stronger footing. At that time, an investor can decide whether to move on and redeploy the money into stocks or, if rates remain elevated, roll into another fixed income investment.

FINRA Trace

Inflation Fighting Idea #2: Pipeline Bonds (and Stocks)

For most of 2022 (and some of 2021), our CEO Noland Langford has talked my ear off about the pipeline companies. Yes, we have long been in agreement that the energy sector is a great area of the market for investors to consider for overweighting their portfolio. But Noland has constantly banged the drum that the pipeline operators are especially attractive. He’s finally gotten through to me.

Over the last year, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), a basket of energy-related companies in all corners of the industry, has delivered more than 41% of return to investors. We also follow a basket of master-limited partnership companies, which is a more technical term for oil/gas pipeline operators. This basket is the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), and this group of stocks is up just 4% over the same period! We’ve included the yearly chart of the two funds below to show the stark difference in performance!

We think this represents a significant disconnect and we think it is potentially investible. Pipeline operators generally have fixed-rate contracts with the oil/gas companies that use them to move their product around the country. As a result, business results for pipeline operators are less sensitive to changes in oil prices than are stocks in the broader-energy index of XLE. However, when prices are high as those contracts come up for renewal, negotiated rates tend to be higher. As we are now in a period of persistently high energy prices, we think pipeline operators are in a strong position come contract renewal time.

As a result, we think pipeline securities are very attractive. The AMLP ETF itself pays a dividend yield to investors of more than 7% annually, so income investors should definitely take note. We think that the disconnect between the stock prices of energy broadly and of the pipelines could narrow over the coming months and years, suggesting an opportunity for capital appreciation, as well. Some individual components of the index, like Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP; dividend yield 8.45%) and Energy Transfer LP (ET; dividend yield 7.98%), carry even higher dividends than the overall index, so there are many ways to play the theme here.

Speaking of other ways to play the theme, we also like bonds in the space, should you want a more fixed return structure to your investment in pipelines. One such bond comes from Enbridge Energy Partners, LP (ENB), another pipeline operator. The Enbridge 6.3% 2034 bond trades at a slight premium to par, but carries a BBB investment grade credit rating and implies an average annual yield of 6.15%. We think there are ample ways to play the theme of investing in pipeline companies, which consistently deliver steady cash flows.

Takeaways from this Week

The inflation and interest rate theme continues to grip the narrative across investment markets of all types. There are certainly areas that investors should avoid, particularly growth stocks that still carry high valuations. However, lower prices do mean opportunity in some circles, especially for investors holding cash in the bank and still earning very little interest in those accounts.

We think investors should still be digging deep to find individual bonds and other income securities which now carry impressive income yields at current prices. Two such examples are Starwood Property bonds, as well as both the stocks and the bonds associated with the oil/gas pipeline industry.",cloud computing,seeking alpha
263,BMW to axe UK production of electric Mini and relocate to China,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8af7e931cea74c653928d7d656b13a798c0a589/0_53_5750_3452/master/5750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49d1cbe7a4ce8bb894bd24777e1d6a18,15/10/2022,"Cowley factory on outskirts of Oxford not up to challenge of creating electric vehicles, says Mini bossBMW is to axe all UK production of the award-winning electric Mini and relocate it to China, dealing a major blow to hopes that Britain could be a global hu…",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/15/bmw-axe-uk-production-electric-mini-relocate-china,"BMW is to axe all UK production of the award-winning electric Mini and relocate it to China, dealing a major blow to hopes that Britain could be a global hub for zero-emission vehicle manufacture.

BMW makes 40,000 electric Minis per year at its Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford.

In an article published by the Times on Saturday, it was confirmed that BMW Oxford’s production of electric vehicles will end next year as part of plans to reshape the carmaker’s lineup from 2024.

The move is a further blow to the UK’s ambition to become a leader in global electric car manufacturing, following Honda’s decision to quit Britain in 2016.

BMW’s joint venture with Great Wall Motor means their hatchback and small SUV models will now be made in east China, as will the next generation zero-emission Mini Aceman.

A new, electric version of the largest Mini model, the Countryman, will, BMW has confirmed, be manufactured at its plant in Leipzig.

The announcement follows confirmation by Mini boss, Stefanie Wurst, last week that a convertible model will join the all-new Mini Cooper range – due to launch in 2024 – and that it will be “coming home” in 2025 with production in the UK at the Mini Oxford factory.

Petrol Mini Coopers will be built in Oxford, in three-door, five-door and convertible forms, for export to markets such as the US, Japan and the Middle East, with BMW confirming that it will not halt production of Minis with internal combustion engines until 2030.

BMW’s decision comes after reports that Britain’s only planned large-scale battery factory, being built by Britishvolt in the north-east of England, will go bust if it does not receive a £200m rescue package.

Only a year ago, Boris Johnson, then prime minister, promised at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, to fund a “£1bn electric car revolution” in the UK “creating hundreds of thousands of jobs”. His predecessor, Theresa May, intended that Britain would become “a world leader” in electric vehicle manufacturing and made it one of the “pillars” of her short-lived industrial strategy.

Kwasi Kwarteng, who was sacked as chancellor on Friday and replaced by Jeremy Hunt, said last year when he was business secretary that the electrified automotive industry would be “front and centre of Britain building back better”.

Those commitments — and the seven-year model cycles typically employed by automotive companies — indicate that the Oxford plant will not assemble any new electric vehicles until the next decade.

The historic Cowley factory has been the subject of speculation that BMW wants to sell the plant to Great Wall, which has made no secret that its big sales push into the European electric market will eventually lead it to seek its own production facilities in Europe.

Wurst denied that, stating: “Oxford will always be the home of Mini.” She said the decision to halt the electric Mini assembly in the UK was not linked to post-Brexit supply constraints and cross-border friction with the EU, or the lack of a nearby gigafactory, but because the Cowley plant was running inefficiently by having to produce electric and petrol cars on the same line.

She said that when electric Minis were to be built again in Britain, it would be on an assembly-line platform developed by Great Wall, and that the existing Cowley lines would be stripped out as part of a major factory overhaul.

“Oxford is not geared up for electric vehicles,” she said. “It will need renovation and investment.” Asked when electric Minis will return to Oxford, she said: “There is no date.”

Asked whether Oxford could at some point in the future build both Minis and Great Wall brands such as Ora and Wey, she replied: “Maybe.”

A spokesman for Great Wall confirmed that the possibility of producing its own vehicles at Cowley had been the subject of “internal discussion”.

Wurst also dismissed suggestions that British consumers may balk at buying a Mini made in China, saying she could “see no reason”, as UK motorists are already buying some BMW models made in China.

A spokesperson for BMW said: “Oxford plays an important role in the BMW Group’s production strategy, with its high degree of flexibility, competitiveness and expertise and will remain at the heart of Mini production.”",electric vehicles,the guardian

HANOI, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Vietnam's VinFast said on Saturday it would recall 730 of its model VF e34 electric cars (EVs), which are available only on the domestic market, to make checks and replace their side crash sensors.

VinFast, which began operations in 2019, is a unit of Vietnam's biggest conglomerate Vingroup (VIC.HM) and has sold 2,208 EVs in total since its launch late last year.

""The side crash sensor of the airbag system equipped with the VF e34 model is likely to encounter an incompatibility error with the airbag controller... and therefore may send an incorrect signal to the controller,"" VinFast said in a statement.

The company said it has not recorded any breakdowns or complaints from customers about the sensor errors.

VinFast, which ceased gasoline-powered car production in August, is gearing up to expand in the U.S. market, where it hopes to compete with legacy automakers and deliver its first batch of 5,000 all-electric sport utility vehicles in November.

The company has registered almost 65,000 reservations globally, and it expects to sell 750,000 EVs per year by 2026, starting with the VF8 and VF9 all-electric SUVs.

In March, VinFast said it would build a production plant in North Carolina with an initial projected capacity of 150,000 EVs a year. It tapped banks in July to raise least $4 billion in funding for the project.

Hyundai plans to begin commercial production in the first half of 2025 with an annual capacity of 300,000 units. The Oct. 25 groundbreaking for the Hyundai Group ""metaplant"" in Savannah, Georgia is part of the Hyundai Group’s ""commitment of $10 billion by 2025 to foster future mobility in the U.S., including production of EVs,"" the company said.

The groundbreaking comes amid anger from Korea and the European Union over U.S. electric vehicle tax policy.

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by Biden in August, requires EVs to be assembled in North America to qualify for tax credits in the United States, but excluded Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Corp from EV subsidies, as they do not yet make the vehicles there, along with major European automakers.

The law made about 70% of EVs immediately ineligible for the tax credits of up to $7,500 per vehicle.

Biden has expressed willingness to continue talks with South Korea over recent U.S. legislation that denies subsidies to most foreign makers of electric vehicles (EVs), South Korea said earlier this month.

Biden has also repeatedly praised investments by major foreign automakers to build electric vehicles and battery plants in the United States, including an announcement on Tuesday by Honda Motor and LG Energy that they would locate a $4.4 billion battery plant in Ohio.

Biden gave the assurance in a letter to South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, who had asked the U.S. president last month for help to allay Seoul's concerns that the new U.S. rules would hurt South Korea's automakers, Reuters reported.

As a result of the August law, only about 20 EVs qualify for subsidies under the new rules, among them models from Ford Motor Co and BMW.

Now that electrification has taken root globally, and there’s a climate change believer in the White House, the U.S. has jumped into the fray in a bigger way than ever before. First, there was the $7 billion tucked into the infrastructure bill last year. Then, hundreds of millions made available by invoking the Defense Production Act. And now, the mother of them all, the Inflation Reduction Act, which extends generous tax credits to buy, build and charge EVs, and localize the battery supply chain to power them.

All this global competition gets a lot of attention, but there’s another subsidy battle raging within America’s shores: a cutthroat fight among states to land EV and battery investments.

There were lots of headlines following Ford’s announcement a year ago that it would invest $11.4 billion in Tennessee and Kentucky to build two new EV hubs, the largest outlay in its history. General Motors also set a company record with its $6.5 billion investment in Michigan early this year.

What often ends up in the finer print of stories about these developments — if it gets mentioned at all — are the tabs that taxpayers pick up. States rarely disclose the amounts in full, instead dribbling them out over months in bits and pieces, or in response to public information requests. Even then, calculating a full package is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.

Bloomberg dove into this in depth in this story yesterday, which coincided with a new report from Good Jobs First, a vocal critic of corporate incentives. Among the sweeping policy questions the nonprofit researcher raises: Why should states subsidize EVs when consumer demand is clearly taking off?

Also complicating matters: the notion that electric vehicles may end up being job killers, more so than job creators, if you net out all the losses linked to internal combustion drivetrain components that no longer will be needed.

Good Jobs First does a detailed analysis of some of the deals states have cut with car companies and battery manufacturers. Georgia’s $1.5 billion incentive package for Rivian, for example, prominently touts average annual wages of $56,000. One needs to scroll down 130 pages to find that the wage floor is $20 an hour, which works out to about $36,000 a year. The state’s economic development agreement also allows Rivian to use “employee leasing” companies to count toward its job-creation goals.

In Kansas, the incentive deal for Panasonic that Good Jobs First values at $1.27 billion includes some favorable clauses for the Japanese battery company. According to the report, Panasonic has to invest capital for five years to win income tax credits, but doesn’t have to guarantee certain levels of employment or wages. If the factory is unprofitable and doesn’t owe any tax, the state is still obligated to pay out money each year, as long as the investments are made.

People on the left and the right of the U.S. political spectrum say corporate incentives can be wasteful and unnecessary. Even state officials who participate in the “tax-break industrial complex,” as the Good Jobs First report calls this phenomenon, acknowledge that it’s an unsavory game. But the feeling is they have little choice if they want to compete for these new jobs.",electric vehicles,autoblog

Nearby, a group of Ukrainian deminers with the country's territorial defense forces worked to clear the area of dozens of other deadly mines and unexploded ordnance — a push to restore a semblance of safety to the cities, towns and countryside in a region that spent months under Russian occupation.

The deminers, part of the 113th Kharkiv Defense Brigade of Ukraine's territorial defense forces, walked deep into fallow agricultural lands on Thursday along a muddy road between fields of dead sunflowers overgrown with high weeds.

Two soldiers, each with a metal detector in hand, slowly advanced up the road, scanning the ground and waiting for the devices to give a signal. When one detector emitted a high tone, a soldier knelt to inspect the mud and grass, probing it with a metal rod to see what might be buried just below the surface.

Related video: Ukrainian civilians learn to clear mines

The detector's hit could indicate a spent shell casing, a piece of rusting iron or a discarded aluminum can. Or, it could be an active land mine.

Oleksii Dokuchaev, the commander of the demining brigade based in the eastern Kharkiv region, said that hundreds of mines have already been discharged in the area around the village of Hrakove where they were working, but that the danger of mines across Ukraine will persist for years to come.

“One year of war equals 10 years of demining,” Dokuchaev said. “Even now we are still finding munitions from World War II, and in this war they're being planted left and right.”

Russian forces hastily fled the Kharkiv region in early September after a rapid counteroffensive by Ukraine's military retook hundreds of square miles of territory following months of Russian occupation.

Story continues

While many settlements in the region have finally achieved some measure of safety after fierce battles reduced many of them to rubble, Russian land mines remain an ever-present threat in both urban and rural environments.

Small red signs bearing a white skull and crossbones line many of the roads in the Kharkiv region, warning of the danger of mines just off the pavement. Yet sometimes, desperation drives local residents into the minefields.

The local man whose body lay near the abandoned Russian camp was likely searching for food left behind by the invading soldiers, Dokuchaev said, an additional danger posed by the hunger experienced by many in Ukraine's devastated regions.

The use of the kind of tripwire land mines which killed him is prohibited under the 1997 Ottawa Treaty — of which Russia is not a signatory — which regulates the use of anti-personnel land mines, he said.

“There are rules of war. The Ottawa Convention says that it’s forbidden to place mines or any other munitions with tripwires. But Russians ignore it,” he said.

The deminers had cleared the road of anti-personnel mines the previous day, allowing them to search for anti-tank mines hidden beneath the ground that could destroy any vehicles driving over them.

They hoped to bring vehicles deep enough into the area to retrieve an abandoned Russian armored personnel carrier, the engine of which they planned to salvage. A vehicle would also need to be brought in by local police to retrieve the body.

The deminers reached the abandoned camp, set in a grove of trees and strewn with the remains of the months the Russian soldiers had spent there: rotting food rations in wooden ammunition boxes, strings of high-caliber bullets, a stack of yellowing Russian newspapers and trenches filled with refuse.

After a thorough scan of the area, the servicemen recovered two Soviet-made TM-62 anti-tank mines and six pneumatically armed fuses and placed them in a depression on the edge of the camp, taped into a bundle along with 400 grams of TNT.

Dokuchaev placed an electric detonator into the explosive charge and connected it to a long length of wire before taking cover with his men at a distance of more than 100 meters (yards).

When the charge was detonated — something the servicemen laughingly called “bada-boom” — the immense blast ripped through the air, causing a cascade of autumn leaves to fall from the surrounding trees and emitting a tall plume of gray smoke.

After the mines had been destroyed, Dokuchaev — a former photographer who enlisted with the territorial defense forces after the outbreak of war — said the work his brigade is doing is essential to keep civilians safe as they pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.

Despite the dangers, he said, he enjoys his work.

“I don't know what I'll do after our victory,” Dokuchaev said. “Life is boring without explosions.”

BMW now has the iX3, the iX, the i4, and the iX1 and i7 just arriving. Then, underneath BMW Group as a whole, you’ve got the MINI E. Overall, BMW Group 100%-electric models are now strongly on the upswing.

In the first 9 months of 2022, BMW Group sold 128,196 fully electric vehicles. That puts them up 114.8% compared to the first 9 months of 2021. That’s compared to overall BMW Group growth being 6.6%.

“Dynamic growth in fully-electric vehicles underlines the appeal of our products,” Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales, said. In other words: people like BMWs, and we’re finally making full electric vehicles beyond the i3.

Demonstrating that its EV sales are growing at a fast clip, BMW notes that 52,306 electric vehicles were sold in the 3rd quarter of 2022 — that’s well above the average across the first three quarters (which would be 42,732).

“Together with the BMW iX3*, the company’s two innovation flagships, the BMW i4 and the BMW iX, continue to drive growth, with particularly strong new orders. Additional momentum will come from the BMW brand’s two newest fully-electric models, the BMW i7* and the BMW iX1*. Both models, like the all-electric long-wheelbase version of the 3 Series in China, are receiving very positive customer feedback. The all-electric MINI Cooper SE* is also reporting strong growth and serves as an important pillar in the BMW Group’s fully-electric model line-up. The company is therefore on track to double its sales of fully-electric vehicles for the year 2022.”

At the moment, as BMW highlighted, it is still the best selling premium-class auto brand in the world. It saw 517,689 sales around the world in the 3rd quarter of 2022. How long can it hold off Tesla?

At 142.9 square miles, it’s not as vast as Houston, (599.6 miles), but you can spend hours motoring around the Motor City.

The auto industry still dominates here, including GM (GM), which has its headquarters downtown and assembly plants in the area. In addition, there’s GM’s Technical Center, the cradle of GM’s engineering efforts for almost 70 years. It is a campus befitting of an auto giant. Designed by Eero Saarinen, the grounds cover 710 acres, with 11 miles of roads, over a mile of tunnels, and a pair of lakes (one is some 22 acres) that are used as emergency fire reservoirs.

The campus also houses 38 buildings, including the famed GM Design Center with its distinctive Design Dome, “a secret, enclosed room where the company's leaders evaluate designs and decide which vehicles to build,” as the Detroit Free Press put it back in 2015. It’s also where I sat down with GM CEO Mary Barra (pronounced BAR-ah) on Wednesday.

Barra, who’s been CEO for eight and a half years, has a tough job. GM, once the biggest company in America and the world, is now the 25th biggest by sales in the U.S., according to Fortune. It's No. 64 on Fortune's global list. It’s the eighth-biggest automaker by sales in the world behind VW, Toyota, Stellantis (the old Fiat Chrysler plus Peugeot), Mercedes-Benz, Ford, BMW, and Honda.

GM is still large enough to be a massive global puzzle to manage, which keeps Barra plenty busy. I last checked in with Barra in May at the Milken Conference, where she was focused on coming out of COVID and mitigating the global semiconductor shortage. Those challenges remain, but now Barra is even more intent on moving past all that and transforming GM into an EV company.

Here are some highlights of the interview (edited and condensed), which will air in its entirety at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit this Monday, Oct. 17, beginning at 9 a.m. EST.

Story continues

I started off by asking Barra about the company’s new GM Energy business, but we also delved into GM’s EV product line-up, its stock price (roughly $33 a share, as of this week) and the overall economy.

Serwer: GM Energy, can you tell us what that's all about?

Barra: Well, sure. One of the things we want people to understand is not only is an electric vehicle your mode of transportation—how you get from point A to point B—but it can also be a power source. And I think that's going to be very important as we strengthen the grid in whatever country we're doing work in. And in addition, we can leverage the technology. We have the battery technology to provide clean energy, energy storage, and can also supplement the grid. So we're really excited about the business opportunity.

Serwer: How big is that business opportunity?

Barra: You know, we haven't put those numbers out yet, but we see it being significant. Not only are we moving into electric vehicles that we think in the near to medium term will be growth areas, we have an opportunity to perform better on the coasts because that's where EV adoption is happening more quickly. Getting into the electric commercial vehicle business is also a growth area for us.

[Travis Hester, vice president of GM’s EV growth operations, told CNBC the total addressable market here is “is between $125 billion and $250 billion…” And yes this is business that both Ford and Tesla have entered.]

Serwer: What GM vehicles on the road right now are EVs and which ones are coming out next year?

Barra: Well, right now we have the Bolt EV and the Bolt EUV, which I'm driving. We also have the GMC Hummer EV and we have the Cadillac LYRIQ that is just starting production. So that's all out right now. We've had such strong demand for the Hummer and the LYRIQ that we're into next year from an order perspective, in some cases beyond. But then in the first quarter we'll launch the Silverado EV, and then if you go a little bit longer into the second and third quarter, we'll have both the Chevrolet Blazer EV as well as the Chevrolet Equinox EV. So when we get to this point next year, we have a lot of models in the heart of the market, the largest segments in the market.

Serwer: Mary, GM stock has lagged a bit over the past year or so, and I'm wondering what you would say to shareholders. Why should someone buy the stock, or own the stock going forward?

Barra: I think there was so much attention earlier this year to how many EVs are you selling today? And we were in a difficult situation because we did the right thing for the consumer and for safety. When we found there was a manufacturing defect in the Bolt [battery] cell, we stopped producing so we could do the replacement cells for our customers. As we've moved through the year, we were able to, to start building the Bolt again. And we've actually had two record months in a row of sales of the Bolt, but I think that impacted the early view.

What I would say to shareholders is, take a little bit longer view, because this is not a one-year race. We are at the very early stages of driving EV adoption. And when you look at the vehicles that we have coming out next year with the Silverado EV, the Equinox and the Blazer, I think it is going to allow us to grow. And that's why we're confident that we're going to produce a million units and see strong demand for our vehicles by the time we're at 2025.

Serwer: Switching gears, where is the economy right now Mary, based on where you sit, and what do you see going forward?

Barra: It's very hard to know exactly what's happening in the market because we have been supply constrained for so long. So we know there's pent-up demand, but also there's challenges in logistics and moving vehicles once they're built. We’re still dealing with semiconductor shortages, but getting vehicles moved to get to the dealers has been challenging, as well. We still see strong demand for many of our products, especially our full-size trucks that are mid-size crossovers. So it's an interesting time.

We're preparing next year for a year that will actually have more demand, but a little less demand than what we would think. We're going to be conservative. Make sure we set our cost structure up that way, so then if things turn out better, we're well positioned. But most importantly, because we have so many important EV launches next year, we want to make sure that we can fund our future regardless of where the economy is—downturn, recession, all those words that are being used. We want to be prepared regardless of the environment.

Serwer: You mentioned the chip shortage and supply chain. Is that improving? And then what about some other supply chain issues you might have with batteries and the inputs there?

Barra: We do see semiconductor supply improving quarter by quarter, but we still see more volatility than we're used to. I think one of the reasons for that is the supply chain has been stretched so thin, so we're looking for improvement as we go forward. But it's still an issue. One of the things that's going to be key to unlocking more Hummers, more LYRIQs and all of our vehicles, is battery plants. And we're actually running the battery plant in Ohio now. And as that is able to ramp up, more cells will provide us with more ability to provide more electric vehicles. We actually have signed agreements for the production that we need between now and 2025 to get to our million units in 2025 in the United States and more than that in China.

Serwer: You are an engineer and my understanding is you really get down in the details when it comes to the specs and making sure that the car’s features are something that you think consumers will like. Right?

Barra: Well, absolutely. We have a very talented team at General Motors and we do the right amount of research, but yes, I'm also a consumer. So our leadership team comes into this room or at the plant. And we're looking at the vehicles to make sure that they're going to be what the customer is looking for, and that we're going to win the segment.

Now, our spy photographers have captured the next-gen 2024 M5 with its production body for the first time, and compared to the German automaker’s recent M releases, it’s a breath of fresh air.

As mentioned above, this is the first time we’re seeing the new M5 without heaps of camo on it, and while there is still plenty left to the imagination, it’s one of the best looks we’ve gotten yet. Unlike the M3/M4, which feature grossly oversized grilles that many still can’t get used to, and the new M2, whose brutal design full of basic shapes and openings is rather unrefined, this new M5 looks to keep some of the class of its predecessor while still retaining the aggressiveness of any good M car.

Read More: 2024 BMW M5 Flaunts Its Edgier Design, Will Pack Plug-In Hybrid Power

Up front, the overall design looks to be somewhat similar to the recently refreshed 3-Series. Most importantly, though, is that it appears to have normal-sized kidney grilles that are thankfully wider than they are tall. Another trait that looks to be inspired by the new 3-Series is the large central intake. As we’ve seen in previous spy shots, the trapezoidal design almost looks straight off the M3 minus the “coffin”-style kidney grilles splitting it down the middle.

Elsewhere, the M5 shows canted, straight-edged headlights, which are also reminiscent of those on the 3-Series. On that car, these lights feature “halo” DRLs that wrap around the top of the headlight rather than the bottom, but due to the camouflage, it’s unclear which way the DRL signature will go on the new 5er.

Like just about every other car in BMW’s lineup, the taillights have gone from an L-shape to a single line, and these ones in particular look as though they could borrow some cues from the new 7-Series. Other noteworthy items at the rear include the large quad tailpipes and chiseled bumper.

Moving to the side of the vehicle, as is the trend these days, many of the car’s character lines have been somewhat smoothed out. Other small details include flush door handles, aggressive side skirts, M side mirrors, and a retention of the Hoffmeister kink. We can also see split-spoke wheels that have a similar design, if not the exact same one, as the M2, M3, and M4.

Related: 2024 BMW M5 Will Embrace Electrification, Prototype Spotted Wearing Hybrid Badges

One of the biggest changes to this new M5 compared the outgoing model is the addition of electrification. The expected powertrain of choice will be a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 paired with an electric motor, not unlike the setup found in the XM Label Red. In that vehicle, the system makes a combined output of 738 hp (748 PS / 550kW) and 735 lb-ft (997 Nm), but there have been reports that the M5 could send as much as 790 hp (801 PS / 589 kW) to all four wheels via an 8-speed automatic transmission.

Regardless, as much as we already know, there is still plenty to find out about the next M5 before it arrives in 2023 as a 2024 model year vehicle.

273,Tesla Broke Its Monthly Sales Record in China -- but It Hasn't Caught Up to This Automaker Just Yet,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/704575/model-y-front-34-blue.jpg,15/10/2022,"Tesla still isn't the largest automaker in China, but investors may want to focus on the company's margins instead.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/15/tesla-broke-its-monthly-sales-record-in-china-but/,"Despite experiencing some significant hurdles over the past year with its Shanghai factory, Tesla's (TSLA -5.64%) vehicle production in China has found its stride.

The company sold 83,135 China-made vehicles in wholesale in September, according to the latest data from the China Passenger Car Association.

That's a record for Tesla and an impressive number to be sure, but Tesla is still facing stiff competition from China-based electric vehicle companies, including EV giant BYD (BYDDY 2.40%). The good news for Tesla investors is that the company doesn't need to dominate market share to benefit from China's growing EV market.

Tesla's Shanghai factory is firing on all cylinders

Investors will likely remember all the speed bumps Tesla's Shanghai factory went through in recent memory, including closing for COVID-related lockdowns and a temporary shutdown so that Tesla could upgrade the factory. But it appears that those temporary setbacks are now in the past.

Tesla's September sales in China beat the company's previous record (set back in June) of 78,906. The EV maker's sales during the month were also up 8% from its August figures.

Tesla's planned factory upgrade back in July aimed to bring the company's weekly output to 22,000 vehicles per week, from the previous 17,000.

While the production increase certainly helped Tesla sell more vehicles in China last month, its vehicle sales fell short of BYD's sales during the month -- and it could have a hard time overtaking the Chinese automaker.

The company still faces stiff competition in the Chinese market

Tesla's latest Chinese sales figure shows just how well the company's bet to sell EVs in the country has gone.

But Tesla was outpaced by BYD's wholesale EV sales in China, which reached 94,941 last month, up nearly 162% from Sept. 2021.

BYD is already a leader in China's EV market, with an estimated 28% market share in the first five months of 2022 -- compared to Tesla's nearly 7% market share.

Closing that large gap could be very difficult for Tesla, especially considering that BYD has recently focused its attention on building EV models (and ended combustion engine vehicle production earlier this year). Additionally, BYD manufactures its own EV batteries, which could give it an advantage over Tesla in vehicle production.

One thing Tesla has going for it

While gaining more market share could be an uphill battle, Tesla investors should remember that the company still enjoys an enviable operating margin of 16% -- compared to BYD's 3%.

Tesla doesn't need to constantly outsell BYD and other competitors in China. It just needs to ensure that it can continue producing cars at a healthy clip, maintain its market share, and keep its strong margins.

As the Chinese EV market continues to gain more competitors and homegrown automakers expand their footprint, it'll be even more important for Tesla to efficiently earn money from its vehicle sales. If it can do that, Tesla will be able to build on its success in China.",electric vehicles,motley fool
274,Battery Triage — HEV or PHEV or BEV?,https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/10/2021-Toyota-bz4x-EV-vs-RAV4-Prime-KYLE-FIELD-CleanTechnica.jpg,15/10/2022,"Toyota claims that by producing 900,000 conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), it has effectively produced and sold the equivalent of 300,000 BEVs.

Whether this is true or not, I will leave the mathematicians and the wise ones who understand the battery chemistry way better than I do to chime in. I just wonder if Toyota is really engaged in battery triage for the greater good of humanity.

For the newcomers, a HEV is a traditional hybrid electric vehicle which runs a petrol engine which charges a battery which drives an electric drivetrain (think: Prius). It cannot be plugged in. A PHEV is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. It has petrol and an electric drivetrain. All-electric range, before the petrol engine starts running, varies from vehicle to vehicle. It can be plugged in. A BEV is a 100% battery electric vehicle. It has a plug but cannot be filled with petrol.

What concerns me is more the question: with the constant announcements of better and cheaper batteries and the opening of more and more gigafactories, do we have to engage in battery use triage? We are not short of lithium, or many other essential elements. If we are, the mining companies, with their eyes on future facing commodities, are racing to fill this lucrative gap.

Why the hesitation on Toyota’s part? Is it profit seeking from outdated technology? Is it misplaced hope in future technology (hydrogen cars, solid state batteries)? Or is it simply hubris? Can Toyota cope with being a follower — lagging behind Tesla, Volkswagen, and BYD? Even Honda is now steering toward BEVs.

According to The Guardian: “At … the launch of the Toyota Corolla Cross hybrid SUV in Sydney, Sean Hanley, vice-president of sales and marketing at Toyota Australia, expressed frustration over claims Toyota had slowed the transition to electric, citing the company’s early embrace of hybrids. ‘What we’re disagreeing on is … how and when you get there.’ Hanley argued Toyota has not received credit for helping to reduce emissions with the introduction of its hybrid vehicles and stressed the company is ‘not stopping, lagging or preventing [electric cars]’.”

Every monthly sales figure coming out of Europe sees a decrease in HEVs and PHEVs and an increase in BEVs. Rethink Energy projects that the transition to electric will only accelerate:

Toyota has done a great job in the past. Now it is time to follow, or get out of the way — it can no longer lead.

[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2022/10/15/how-i-collaborated-with-brands-as-a-photographer-for-my-tesla-model-y/,"As creatives, more specifically as a photographer and filmmaker, we tend to get gigs all over the city. From big production to small, low-budget clients, our commute can be taxing, especially with increased gas prices.



Electric cars are surfacing, from trucks and sedans to SUVs; you’ll pretty much see electric vehicles at every corner. This is why I purchased a Tesla Model Y; it’s efficient and roomy for all the gears and equipment I own.

The color options Tesla provides are minimal. Since green is my favorite color, I had to figure out how I could acquire this color. I have two options: get the car professionally painted or have the vehicle wrapped. So this is when my creativity started to develop a concept. We have seen many sports cars getting covered in a specific color, and most of them have been eye catchy, so we decided to call them wrapped instead.

A while back, I stumbled upon this studio location called “Light Box Garage,” which resembled a scene from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight. Where Bruce Wayne utilizes a secondary Batcave garage in the city, I gravitated to that location to do something creative with the Tesla Model Y.

I created a concept idea to film the car getting wrapped inside that location and made a pitch deck for 3M Wrap. So I reached out to 3M with a simple email.

Hi, I’m a film director based in Los Angeles and recently purchased a Tesla Model Y. I wanted to film myself wrapping the car at this incredible studio downtown. I was reaching out to offer a collaboration trade for materials in exchange for a cinematic video that we will create. You can use this video for your marketing purposes, and I feel that it will generate some traction for you. I can even cover a few topics you would like your viewers to know. Here are my links so you can check them out. www.isaacalvarez.com

After a few days, I got a response that they were very interested. I chatted with my partner and decided to make the video pop. We needed a few more companies to collaborate with to beef up the Tesla and match the beautiful 3M wrappings that will be added.

We narrowed down some selections that could match the car’s aesthetic and decided to reach out to other companies, such as 3D Mats, Temari, AZA Auto Wheels, and Zink wheels, to customize the car fully. After using the same email pitch, everyone got excited and decided to collaborate.

Then we got to work, booking the studio and contacted our good friends at RC1 Wraps to put their skills to the test. It took about two days to wrap the car, and right after, we decided to take it for a drive to get some beautiful B-Roll shots up Angeles Crest.

Our goal was to capture the Tesla transformed from its original order line to a beefed-up machine. From there, we drove to Angeles Crest and used the below-mentioned gear.

So the main takeaways from this story are from a creative point of view. It is to cultivate creativity. If you have an idea and a plan, don’t hesitate to reach out to brands that align with your concept. This way, you can keep on growing in your craft and still manage to create partnerships along the way.

No matter how complex your ideas might be or how simple, you can accomplish anything if you have the right plan and help others along the way.

276,BYD’s ATTO 3 Electric SUV Scores A 5-Star Rating In Latest Euro NCAP Safety Tests,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Euro-NCAP-BMW-X1-Mazda-CX-60-Citroen-C5-X-main.jpg,15/10/2022,"Other five-star earners included the Mercedes EQE, BMW X1 and Mazda CX-60.",https://www.carscoops.com/2022/10/byds-atto-3-electric-suv-scores-a-5-star-rating-in-latest-euro-ncap-safety-tests/,"Euro NCAP published the safety ratings for ten new models, with eight of them achieving the highest score of five stars and two of them getting four stars. Among the top performers are the Mercedes-Benz EQE, the BMW X1 and 2-Series Active Tourer, the Mazda CX-60, the BYD ATTO 3, the mildly updated VW Golf, as well as the Seat Ibiza and Arona. The Citroen C5 X and Mobilize Limo missed the top rating, getting four stars.

Starting with one of the few EVs of the bunch, the Mercedes-Benz EQE proved to be quite safe in all different aspects, scoring 95% on adult occupants, 91% on child occupants, 83% on vulnerable road users and 81% on safety assist for a clean five-star rating. Euro NCAP praised the optional Active Emergency Stop Assist function which safely maneuvers the car to the slowest lane and brings it to a halt when the driver becomes unresponsive. This feature contributed to a “Very Good” grade and one of the highest Euro NCAP scores on assisted driving.

The next model is the BYD ATTO 3 (Yuan Plus), a budget-friendly EV which proved once more the progress of Chinese automakers in terms of safety, following the recent successful results of the ORA Cat and WEY Coffee 1. The BYD ATTO 3 scored 91% on adult occupants, 89% on child occupants, 69% on vulnerable road users and 74% on safety assist thanks to the generous ADAS suite included in the standard equipment.

The other two Chinese-built vehicles in this leg of testing came from French automakers and scored four stars. Both the Citroen C5 X produced by Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën Automobile and the fleet-focused Mobilize Limo produced by Renault-Jiangling performed well in the crash tests but missed the top rating due to the lack of certain ADAS features, or their marginal performance in the active safety tests.

Despite being classified in the B-Segment (supermini and B-SUV), the recently facelifted Seat Ibiza and Arona qualified for five stars with very similar ratings in each category. More specifically the models scored 83% on adult occupants, 82% (83%) on child occupants, 66% (65%) on vulnerable road users and 70% on safety assist.

BMW also put two mechanically-related models to the test – the all-new X1 and the 2-Series Active Tourer. The premium compact SUV scored 86% on adult occupants, 89% on child occupants, 76% on vulnerable road users and an impressive 92% on safety assist. Similarly, the minivan scored 88% on adult occupants, 81% on child occupants, 79% on vulnerable road users and a matching 92% on safety assist since it is offering the same ADAS. The five-star ratings for both BMWs are not surprising, since we are talking about new-generation models that debuted in 2022 in premium segments.

Another five-star earner is the Mazda CX-60 with good individual scores including 88% on adult occupants, 91% on child occupants, 89% on vulnerable road users, and 76% on safety assist.

The VW Golf VIII had already been awarded a five-star rating in 2019, however back then, the assessment criteria were not as strict as today. Volkswagen didn’t rest on its laurels, updating the popular hatchback with the addition of a center airbag, lap pretensioners, junction assist and a fatigue detection system. All those features resulted in a fresh five-star rating with 2022 standards. Interestingly, VW is working on a facelifted Golf which is expected to retain its top safety score.

Speaking of the current situation in the automotive world, Michiel van Ratingen, Euro NCAP’s Secretary General, said: “There is a lot of pressure on car manufacturers to extend the lifetimes of their vehicles, especially those of combustion-engined cars which will soon be replaced by all-electric models. Most vehicle manufacturers tend to ride it out, some may even consider safety cutbacks to maintain competitiveness. So it is excellent to see Volkswagen continually improving the safety of the Golf, to keep abreast of the latest developments and keep pace with competitors.”

The last model in this batch was the Nissan Juke Hybrid which inherited the five-star rating of the regular ICE-only Juke from 2019 without further tests, which is why there is no footage in the press material.

277,"After 3 weeks without power, this P.E.I. neighbourhood banded together to clear trees from street",https://i.cbc.ca/1.6618072.1665858551!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/anthony-saez.jpg,15/10/2022,"About 20 people on Prince Edward Island are still without power three weeks after Fiona hit. Nearly a dozen of those still in the dark are in Wheatley River. On Friday night, they got tired of waiting.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-fiona-power-oyster-bed-1.6618064,"They had been without power for 21 days and the propane running their generators was getting low.

They still weren't sure who was supposed to clear the 70 or so trees that made their one-kilometre lane impassable.

So, Friday night, 10 residents of Oyster Bed Park Drive in Wheatley River — some of the last people on P.E.I. without electricity from post-tropical storm Fiona — took matters into their own hands.

They grabbed chainsaws, clippers and whatever else they could find and, using lights from the vehicles, spent about four hours clearing the debris from the lane.

""We know that the linesmen were out there doing a heck of a job clearing the lines but we weren't seeing any,"" said Anthony Saez, one of the residents on the lane.

The problem, he said, was a breakdown in communication.

A Maritime Electric visited the site Saturday to assess the situation. (Tony Davis/CBC)

When the residents first reported the power outage the day after the storm, they were under the impression Maritime Electric would do the work.

Still, they began doing the work themselves right from the beginning. Later, they said the utility told them it was only responsible for trees touching the wires, and they should get a professional tree cutter to remove the rest because it would require heavy equipment.

""It seems funny how the message was it was a big job, we've got to get special equipment in so we're going to leave it till next week,"" said Michelle Holmes, another resident on the lane.

""And we were able to come in — there was a retired person, a nurse, a lawyer and you know, three chainsaws — and we did it on foot.""

Kate Saez, left, and Michelle Holmes, were among the residents working in the dark Friday night to clear the lane. (Tony Davis/CBC)

Saez and Holmes wanted to make it clear they have no issue with Maritime Electric. The residents were without power for seven days after post-tropical storm Dorian in 2019, and were prepared to go at least that long after Fiona.

""We know it was a tough challenge for them and we appreciate that,"" Saez said.

The issue, they said, was the confusion around tree clearing. They had been getting in and out of the area by cutting through a farmer's field, with his permission, until the lane was unblocked.

We didn't know whether we should do something or not do something and wait. — Anthony Saez

""We didn't know whether we should do something or not do something and wait,"" Saez said.

""If we'd known at the very beginning that we had to clear the road ourselves we would have had it done within days and we would have had power probably at least two weeks ago.""

A Maritime Electric crew visited the area on Saturday to assess the situation. Saez said they were told it would likely be Monday when their power would be restored; however, by 7 p.m. Saturday the lights finally came on.

Alex Saez, 8, is eager to get the power restored. (Tony Davis/CBC)

That's at least some relief for the residents, including Saez's eight-year-old son, Alex, who said he's had to reduce his time playing video games when the generator is running.

""I was really surprised about how many trees came down because I thought it was just going to be a little hurricane,"" he said.

As of Saturday at 5 p.m. the Maritime Electric outage map showed 20 people without power. A Maritime Electric spokesperson said anyone who is still without power or who needs assistance should call 1-800-670-1012.",electric vehicles,cbc news
278,Australian fuel prices likely to rise as Opec+ countries cut oil production to ‘squeeze the market’,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/368e74cc9916601fa2eb31e2d41bc88f49934ba7/0_117_8138_4883/master/8138.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c5b90fcc83e4aec096cecbacafa7a05,15/10/2022,"Cuts by world’s biggest petrol producers will work against other governments’ efforts to tame inflation by releasing fuel stocks<ul><li>Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast</li></ul>Australian motorists could be hit by hig…",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/15/australian-fuel-petrol-prices-likely-to-rise-as-opec-countries-cut-oil-production-to-squeeze-the-market,"Australian motorists could be hit by higher petrol prices as the world’s largest oil exporting nations cut production, analysts say.

The Australian government reinstated the full fuel excise tax in September after the Morrison Coalition government introduced a temporary, six-month cut to lower the cost of fuel at a time of rising inflation.

Since it was reintroduced, 24c has been added to the cost of fuel by the litre, but petrol prices have largely remained stable and not yet returned to the more than $2 highs in May. However, a recent decision by the Opec+ oil cartel to slash output has analysts predicting prices will increase.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been a key factor in driving up the price of oil, which climbed to US$130 a barrel earlier this year, but has since fallen back to under $100 a barrel.

High oil prices have exacerbated the cost of living crisis and inflation globally.

Q&A What is Opec? Show Founded in 1960, the cartel of the world’s biggest oil producers emerged as a political and economic force with the 1973-74 US oil embargo, which caused oil prices to spike. The club consists of 13 countries, with Saudi Arabia the biggest producer, followed by Iraq and Iran.

In response to the 2014-16 oil price slump, Opec partnered with Russia in December 2016 to agree a cut in production of 1.8m barrels a day. That curb, the first of its kind in 15 years, drove up the price of oil. In May 2017, the cuts were extended until the end of March 2018.



Opec's official members are: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Indonesia and Qatar's membership has lapsed. The Opec+ group, sometimes known as ""Vienna Group"", adds 10 non-member nations, including Kazakhstan, Mexico and Russia. Between them these nations supply 55% of oil production and hold 90% of the planet's oil reserves. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

According to the Australian Institute of Petroleum, the price of petrol for the week ending 9 October averaged 182.5c a litre nationally. The highest average was in Adelaide at 186.9c a litre, with the lowest in Darwin at 173.6 cents a litre. Prices averaged 183.2c a litre in Sydney and 182.9c a litre in Melbourne.

Dr Ian Jeffries from the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland said the price of petrol in most capital cities follows a month-long cycle and is currently in a “cheap phase” that will begin to lift over the next few weeks.

“That’s when we’ll start to see the effect of the fuel excise increase,” Jeffries said. “In Brisbane we’d expect prices to jump to $2.10 and that includes the return of the fuel excise.”

Jeffries said it was difficult to predict what exactly was going to happen to the price of fuel over the medium to long term as there were “several factors pulling and pushing” on the global oil market that created significant uncertainty.

Governments around the world, primarily the US, are currently releasing stocks from strategic oil reserves in an attempt to push down prices and tame inflation, but Opec cuts will work against that.

Joaquin Vespignani, an associate professor of the Tasmanian School of Business and Economics, said Opec was “trying to squeeze the market for its last big profit”.

“They know the market is moving away from oil and that’s why they’re going to cut production to keep prices high for as long as they can, basically,” Vespignani said.

“There is a tension between short-term gains and long-term pain. They want to squeeze for more profits, but if the price is high the transition to renewables will be faster.”

He added there was “common agreement” among economists that cutting the fuel excise was “a very bad policy” as it temporarily created a false perception and blunted the growing demand for alternatives such as electric vehicles.

It is expected this demand will grow as prices rise, though Vespignani said Australia was being held back by a lack of policy and planning to help facilitate the transition.

Despite a sharp increase in the number of electric vehicles sold in Australia as of September, electric vehicles only make up 3.39% of all new car sales.",electric vehicles,the guardian

Sen. Rick Scott is demanding action from both the Department of Transportation and vehicle makers as the ticking time bombs created by salt water interacting with EV batteries is draining the resources of first responders. In a letter, Sen. Scott wrote: “This emerging threat has forced local fire departments to divert resources away from hurricane recovery to control and contain these dangerous fires.”

Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) is now demanding action from the Transportation Department and automakers — including Tesla, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis — after several fires involving electric vehicles transpired in connection to Hurricane Ian, according to a report by Bloomberg.

“This emerging threat has forced local fire departments to divert resources away from hurricane recovery to control and contain these dangerous fires,” Sen. Scott said. “Car fires from electric vehicles have proven to be extremely dangerous and last for a prolonged period, taking in many cases up to six hours to burn out.”

Sen. Scott joins Florida Chief Financial Officer and State Fire Marshal Jimmy Patronis, who recently sent a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requesting information on the fire risks created by saltwater mixing with the batteries of electric vehicles.

“The State Fire Marshal’s Office is in need of immediate guidance regarding the response to fires produced by electric vehicles (EVs) that are compromised as a result of lithium batteries corroding from exposure to salt water,” Patronis said in his letter.

Moreover, the State Fire Marshal added that two houses in Florida burned down on Monday as a result of an electric vehicle catching fire.

Electric vehicles were seen catching on fire in Florida after becoming waterlogged during Hurricane Ian, giving firefighters “a new challenge” they “haven’t faced before,” Patronis said.

The NHTSA says it is aware of multiple fires involving Tesla vehicles, according to a letter obtained by Bloomberg.

In its reply to Patronis, the NHTSA said, “Lithium-ion vehicle battery fires have been observed both rapidly igniting and igniting several weeks after battery damage occurred.”

In a separate statement to Bloomberg, the NHTSA said fires involving electric vehicles “pose unique challenges” for firefighters.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration aims to quickly expand electric vehicle usage across the country — by having 50 percent of all new cars sold in the U.S. be electric by 2030 — and other Democrat lawmakers are seeking to make EVs mandatory.

In August, California announced that all new cars sold in the state must be zero-emission by 2035.

280,Electric-vehicle fires have burned down homes after Hurricane Ian saltwater damage. Florida officials want answers,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iF0wMQSpEKPBZ8JwSz9uXw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/c4ff67d3dafbb087615380aaa6313d7c,15/10/2022,"“Florida homes which survived Hurricane Ian, have now been lost to fires caused by flooded EVs.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electric-vehicle-fires-burned-down-224822440.html,"It sounds counterintuitive, but electric vehicles that have been submerged in saltwater can catch fire. That’s proven to be a problem in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian, which flooded parts of the state last month.

Now, Florida officials are seeking answers. This week, U.S. Senator Rick Scott wrote about the issue to the Department of Transportation and electric-vehicle makers. In a letter addressed to transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Scott wrote:

In addition to the damage caused by the storm itself, the saltwater flooding in several coastal areas has had further destructive consequences in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian by causing the lithium ion batteries in flooded electric vehicles (EVs) to spontaneously combust and catch fire. This emerging threat has forced local fire departments to divert resources away from hurricane recovery to control and contain these dangerous fires. Car fires from electric vehicles have proven to be extremely dangerous and last for a prolonged period, taking in many cases up to six hours to burn out. Alarmingly, even after the car fires have been extinguished, they can reignite in an instant. Sadly, some Florida homes which survived Hurricane Ian, have now been lost to fires caused by flooded EVs.

Scott asked Buttigieg what guidance his department has provided—or asked EV makers to provide—to consumers, as well as what protocols it’s developed for the carmakers themselves.

Electric vehicles 'may be a ticking time bomb'

Jimmy Patronis, Florida’s chief financial officer and state fire marshal, also weighed in on the issue. Last week, he wrote to Jack Danielson, executive director National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, asking for “immediate guidance” and noting, “In my experience, Southwest Florida has a significant number of EVs in use, and if those EVs were left behind, exposed to storm surge, and sitting in garages, there is a risk of fires.”

He noted that, based on his research, “much of the guidance on submerged vehicles does not address specific risks associated with exposure of EVs to saltwater.” He added that earlier this month, “I joined North Collier Fire Rescue…and saw with my own eyes an EV continuously ignite, and continually reignite, as fireteams doused the vehicle with tens-of-thousands of gallons of water.”

Story continues

He also warned that ""EVs may be a ticking time bomb.""

On Twitter, Patronis shared a video of firefighters trying extinguish a burning Tesla. He wrote in the tweet, “There’s a ton of EVs disabled from Ian. As those batteries corrode, fires start. That’s a new challenge that our firefighters haven’t faced before. At least on this kind of scale.”

https://twitter.com/JimmyPatronis/status/1578050503279316992

In a reply to Patronis, Danielson wrote:

Test results specific to saltwater submersion show that salt bridges can form within the battery pack and provide a path for short circuit and self-heating. This can lead to fire ignition. As with other forms of battery degradation, the time period for this transition from self-heating to fire ignition can vary greatly.

He added:

It may be helpful for persons who are not involved in immediate lifesaving missions to identify flooded vehicles with lithium-ion batteries and move them at least 50 feet from any structures, vehicles, or combustibles.

So, with 3 months to go and ships already arriving, will we see the fulfillment of Robyn Denholm’s prophecy that Tesla would double the number of its cars on the road by the end of the year? It looks likely.

It is hard to keep up with the numbers of electric vehicles being sold here at the moment, as a new record seems to be reached every month. Veda Prime tells us that the first shipment for the 4th quarter from Tesla Shanghai onboard the Turandot has now docked. The Tesla Facebook community is speculating that it contains 800 Model Ys. Some who have ordered the Model 3 are disappointed.

The Electric Vehicle Council lists the penetration rate in a “state of the states” report within a broader State of Electric Vehicles report. Although the numbers are small, the graph looks like it is heading to the vertical. See page 8. Over 50% of EVs sold in Australia are Tesla Model 3s and Model Ys. There are 25 models that have sold more than 200 units. Hopefully we will see the market develop as it has in Europe, where there are OEMs that can truly compete with Tesla for market share. Of the 15 top selling EVs, 12 were BEVs and 5 were new models to the Australian market — reflecting the trend we are now seeing overseas.

“Every Australian state and territory government has now introduced some form of incentive for the purchase of electric vehicles. These incentives include: upfront rebates off the purchase price of the vehicle, zero interest loans, and stamp duty and registration discounts.

“While it is still too early to assess the impact of these policies — with many launched in the past 12 months — as shown we can see that the ACT continues to lead the country on EV sales (as a proportion of new vehicle sales) at 9.5%, followed by New South Wales (3.7%), Victoria (3.4%), Queensland (3.3%), Tasmania (3.3%), Western Australia (2.8%), South Australia (2.3%), and the Northern Territory (0.8%).

“It is notable to also mention that New South Wales has seen a 84% increase in EV sales during 2022 so far compared to 2021, followed by a 76% increase in the ACT, and a 75% increase in the Northern Territory.”

The next three months should prove to be exciting as ships arrive, and as new models are introduced to market so charged up that a carmaker can sell out within minutes! That’s what happened recently with the Hyundai Ioniq 5, which happens to be a contender for the 2022 CleanTechnica Car of the Year award.

VinFast, which began operations in 2019, is a unit of Vietnam's biggest conglomerate Vingroup and has sold 2,208 EVs in total since its launch late last year.

""The side crash sensor of the airbag system equipped with the VF e34 model is likely to encounter an incompatibility error with the airbag controller... and therefore may send an incorrect signal to the controller,"" VinFast said in a statement.

The company said it has not recorded any breakdowns or complaints from customers about the sensor errors.

VinFast, which ceased gasoline-powered car production in August, is gearing up to expand in the U.S. market, where it hopes to compete with legacy automakers and deliver its first batch of 5,000 all-electric sport utility vehicles in November.

The company has registered almost 65,000 reservations globally, and it expects to sell 750,000 EVs per year by 2026, starting with the VF8 and VF9 all-electric SUVs.

In March, VinFast said it would build a production plant in North Carolina with an initial projected capacity of 150,000 EVs a year. It tapped banks in July to raise least $4 billion in funding for the project.

The EU is set to solely permit the sale of zero-emissions cars from 2035. One question is, will electric freight trucks become commercial long-haul trucks soon enough to meet that necessary transition as well?

Truck pollution and the resultant greenhouse gases make the case for stopping those bigger polluters as swiftly as possible. Can they adapt to this date? On that topic, Transport & Environment and Agora Verkehrswende, a think tank for climate-neutral mobility based in Berlin, commissioned a new study that explores how to get to 100% zero-emission truck sales.

The report clearly established that running an electric freight truck was the cheaper option economically. By 2035, that includes long-haul trucking. The report is proof to quell doubts over whether electric trucks can match diesel trucks. The report showed they will.

“The TNO report compares the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of diesel, BEVs and FCEVs and assesses when zero-emission alternatives become cheaper to own and run. Operational requirements — such as sufficient driving range, no additional time losses due to recharging or refuelling, and similar payload capabilities — are also important conditions for hauliers when switching to zero-emission trucks, and were included in the analysis.”

In fact, by 2035, T&E concludes that 99.8% of new electric freight trucks will be cheaper to own and run than diesel trucks. The study explains that this is while carrying the same weight of goods over the same distance and journey time. In fact, in nearly all cases, electric trucks will outcompete their diesel competitors in total cost of ownership sooner than that. Regarding that last 0.2%, don’t fret. “The tiny gap to 100% can be easily bridged by a handful of trucks making an extra stop, beyond what is legally required, to charge. Even with that additional stop, they would still be cheaper to buy and run.”

Fedor Unterlohner, clean freight manager at T&E, said: “Cheaper, stronger, further. EU lawmakers can set a 2035 deadline to reach zero emissions sales with confidence that electric rigs will beat diesel trucks every time. This will cut costs for hauliers and clean up trucking while allowing European truckmakers to retain their global leadership.”

Wiebke Zimmer, Deputy Director of Agora Verkehrswende, said: “Progress towards climate neutrality in transport is not as fast as it needs to be. This makes it all the more important to fully exploit the technical and economic potential for emission-free road freight transport right from the start. In addition to ambitious CO2 standards for trucks, this also requires further measures such as purchase subsidies and CO2-based tolling.”

T&E notes that “the European Commission will make a proposal to tighten climate targets, including targets for heavy-duty vehicles in the coming months.” It seems that any such proposal should include a timeline for phasing out fossil-fueled freight trucks similar to the timeline for phasing out fossil-fueled light-duty vehicle sales.

LONDON: BMW will stop manufacturing its electric Minis in the United Kingdom and move production to factories in China, dealing yet another blow to Britain’s ambitions in battery-powered vehicles, the Times has reported.

The German car manufacturer builds around 40,000 electric Mini vehicles a year at its factory outside Oxford but will call a halt by the end of next year, the newspaper said on Saturday, citing an executive who leads the Mini brand. BMW plans to shift production of the electric vehicles to its joint venture in China.

Stefanie Wurst, the new chief of Mini, told the newspaper that the Oxford plant was running inefficiently by having to produce electric and petrol-engine cars on the same line.

She said the factory needed “renovation and investment” to build electric vehicles, with the old assembly lines stripped out. Still, there was no date for a return to the UK, she said, according to the Times.

BMW will continue to assemble internal combustion-powered Minis in the UK into the 2030s — predominantly for export to the United States, Japan and the Middle East, according to the newspaper. However, the electric Minis will be built by BMW’s joint-venture partner Great Wall Motor in China and at its plant in Leipzig.

Meanwhile, three-year-old Britishvolt Ltd, the UK’s attempt to develop a homegrown electric-vehicle battery giant, is under threat as it seeks emergency funding. Bloomberg this week reported that the firm was considering selling its UK site.

The Financial Times said the company needs some £200 million to fund it until next summer and is holding talks with strategic investors.",electric vehicles,bangkok post
287,"Sony & Honda Will Build Electric Cars In America, May Bypass Dealers",https://cleantechnica.com/files/2022/06/Sony-electric-car-concepts.png,15/10/2022,Sony Honda Mobility says its cars will go on sale in 2026 and will feature emotional spaces that focus on entertainment.,https://cleantechnica.com/2022/10/14/sony-honda-will-build-electric-cars-in-america-may-bypass-dealers/,"In June, Sony and Honda announced the creation of a new company — called Sony Honda Mobility — that will manufacture electric cars together. At the time, Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said, “Sony’s purpose is to fill the world with emotion through the power of creativity and technology. Through this alliance with Honda, which has accumulated extensive global experience and achievements in the automobile industry over many years and continues to make revolutionary advancements in this field, we intend to build on our vision to ‘make the mobility space an emotional one,’ and contribute to the evolution of mobility centered around safety, entertainment, and adaptability.”

In a joint press conference this week, the new company said the cars will be manufactured at one of Honda’s 12 US manufacturing facilities, most likely in Ohio, where Honda has been making motorcycles and automobiles for decades. It will begin accepting orders in late 2025, with the first deliveries taking place in 2026.

According to Nikkei Asia, the new EVs will be developed with a focus on their role as entertainment spaces that provide music and games, in addition to traditional elements such as performance and safety. “The first delivery is expected to be in North America in the spring of 2026. In Japan, delivery is planned to begin in the second half of 2026,” Yasuhide Mizuno, chairman of the joint venture, said on Thursday. Sales in Europe may follow.

The joint venture intends to promote its EVs as places to enjoy even while not driving. The company will pursue “new entertainment possibilities” such as integrating the real and virtual worlds, utilizing the metaverse, and “creating new communities” within the mobile space, Mizuno said.

Online Sales A Possibility

The joint venture will focus on online sales as part of its strategy to “connect directly with customers,” Mizuno said. The vehicles will be priced at “a reasonable amount,” appropriate to “added high-value” components such as software. Sony will develop the in-vehicle software and entertainment technologies, while Honda will take on the task of building the car itself and developing safety technologies.

“Until now, cars competed on manufacturer elements” like driving performance and safety, Mizuno said. Such factors would continue to be important, but the company hopes to add value by combining them with software technologies and to “compete in these areas.”

Sony Honda Mobility & Dealers

According to Autoweek, Honda and Acura dealers in America are feeling nervous about this online sales strategy. Some suggest that doing so would violate their franchise agreements, but if the cars are sold under a new brand, there may not be much they can do about it.

“These issues are certainly a concern,” Brian Benstock, general manager of Paragon Honda/Acura in Queens, New York, told Autoweek. “The best path forward is with the dealers. We have a role (automakers) can’t replicate. There’s no way that Honda wants to hurt their existing dealer body.”

Mike Law runs eight dealerships, including a Honda store, for LaFontaine Automotive Group in Dearborn, Michigan. He believes the heavy investments required to develop electric cars favor using existing dealers. “As much as maybe some people want to push the dealers out, I believe the consumers still enjoy the process of the purchase,” he said.

That remark brought gales of laughter at CleanTechnica headquarters where the staff were enjoying tabbouleh and Melba toast around our biogas-fueled outdoor fire pit. “Enjoy the process of the purchase?” Can we have some of what you’re smoking, Mike?

The Takeaway

The engine driving the new Sony Honda Mobility juggernaut is a familiar one in the industry. Companies continue to believe there are piles of money to be made by getting people to pay for the privilege of accessing online content in their cars. Some of us aren’t so sure. Will people really leave the comfort of their living rooms to go watch re-runs of My Mother The Car or listen to the latest mega-hit on Spotify in their Sony Honda? That seems unlikely, except for rare occasions while camping or waiting for the power to come back on after a storm. And yet that is the heart of the Sony Honda Mobility joint venture.

In any event, Honda has broken out of its anti–electric car funk recently. It will build at least two battery-powered cars in conjunction with General Motors at its Spring Hill factory in Tennessee and has just announced a major investment in electric car production in Ohio this week. It also has taken the wraps off the Honda Prologue, a rather tasty looking electric SUV that will probably be built in Ohio. The Sony/Honda mashup could be seen as a preemptive strike on Apple, which has been threatening to jump into the car business for nearly a decade.

Honda did not choose to take the lead in the EV revolution, but may yet become a serious electric car company. A concept of the first car from Sony and Honda is scheduled to be unveiled at CES in Las Vegas this January.

The first busy week of the earnings season will feature big reports across sectors with Bank of America (BAC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Netflix (NFLX) and Procter & Gamble (PG) all due to step into the earnings confessional. Meanwhile, the economic calendar will include updates on industrial production and the closely-watched Empire manufacturing index. On the global stage, the Communist Party Congress begins in Beijing with President Xi Jinping expected to secure a historic third term. Inflation readouts and reactions are also likely to be a major factor and historians will be quick to circle October 19 as a day for hard hats.

Earnings spotlight: Monday, October 17 - Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and Bank of New Yok Mellon (BK)

Earnings spotlight: Tuesday, October 18 - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Lockheed Martin (LMT), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Netflix (NFLX).

Earnings spotlight: Wednesday, October 19 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Procter & Gamble (PG), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Travelers Companies (TRV), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), and IBM (IBM).

Earnings spotlight: Thursday, October 20 - Philip Morris International (PM), AT&T (T), Union Pacific (UNP), Dow (DOW), and Tractor Supply (TSCO).

Earnings spotlight: Friday, October 21 - Verizon (VZ), American Express (AXP), and Barclays (BCS).

IPO preview: Immune therapeutics developer Alopexx (NASDAQ:ALPX) is expected to start trading on October 19. The quiet period ends on Loop Media (NYSE:LPTV) on October 17. Watch Context Therapeutics (CNTX) and FRNT Financial (OTCPK:FRFLF) with IPO lockups hitting next week for blocks of shares.

Tesla earnings preview: Tesla (TSLA) will report earnings on October 19 in what is likely to be one of the more closely-watched reports of the earnings season. Wells Fargo is one of several firms over the last week that has moved up expectations for a slight Q3 beat even though the electric vehicle maker's deliveries report rattled investors. One of the big question marks with Tesla (TSLA) is how to model benefits for TSLA from the Inflation Reduction Act, which sets up well for the company on the demand side. As for Tesla's sputtering share price, research from Bespoke Investment Group revealed that when Tesla stock has fallen more than 20% over a seven-day stretch - the stock averaged gains of 37%, 84%, and 238% over the next month, three month, and one-year timespan, respectively.

Netflix earnings preview: Netflix (NFLX) will report earnings on October 18 with analysts looking for revenue of $7.85B and EPS of $2.17 to be reported. Consensus also calls for 1.1M paid subscriber additions for the quarter, a tally that was likely skewed by Stranger Things. The conference call is likely to dive into the issue of the streamer's new AVOD tier. Morgan Stanley said it does not believe there has ever been a global media business of the scale of Netflix that moved from ad-free to ad-supported. ""For marketers, this represents a massive increase in potential premium video ad impressions around the world and we expect strong demand,"" noted analyst Benjamin Swinburne. A wildcard with the Netflix (NFLX) report will be the updates on FX pressures. That could come during a post-earnings video interview with co-CEO Reed Hastings, co-CEO & Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, CFO Spence Neumann, and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters. The discussion will be moderated by J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth.

Johnson & Johnson earnings preview: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) heads into earnings report with some expectations already dialed back. However, Bank of America warned that JNJ could lower 2022 guidance nominally due to the macro backdrop, as well as continued F/X headwinds and inflationary pressure. Recent management commentary at conferences suggests that the healthcare giant expects improving trends in the early part in 2023. On the earnings call, analysts will be looking for the ex-vaccine growth forecast and color on the medtech business.

Paris Motor Show: The Paris Motor Show will open with a number of brands hoping to create some buzz. Renault's (OTCPK:RNSDF) Alpine brand will show off the lightweight A110 R and a concept vehicle called the Alpenglow. Meanwhile, Renault's budget brands will reveal the all-electric Manifesto off-road vehicle. Chinese automaker BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDF) will display the Atto compact full-electric crossover, the Tang midsize crossover and the Han midsize sedan in hopes of creating engagement for the brand in Europe. Another Chinese automaker, Great Wall Motor Company (OTCPK:GWLLF), is anticipated to show its Funky Cat compact EV model and detail plans for European expansion for Ora and the Wey brand. Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) will have a big presence in Paris with the public debit of the Peugeot fastback 408. The model is said to be designed for efficiency and intelligent electrification, with two 180 hp and 225 hp rechargeable hybrid engines. The Jeep brand will introduce the all-new fully electric Jeep Avenger in Paris and showcase other all-electric models. Premium Stellantis brand DS Automobiles will feature the DS 7 with its 360 hp plug-in hybrid performance package. Mercedes-Benz (OTCPK:MBGAF) is not planning on having a stand at the show, but will reveal the EQE SUV at the Rodin Museum in Paris during the weeek. Independent German electric vehicle manufacturer Next.e.GO Mobile SE will be presenting its new vehicle lineup, which includes the 2022 urban BEV e.wave X as well as a new urban delivery EV. One of the mostly highly-anticipated vehicles to be displayed in Paris will be the Fisker (NYSE:FSR) Ocean midsize SUV that is set for mass production in November. The EV startup will display a production-intent top trim Fisker Ocean Extreme and is expected to issue new details on Ocean pricing, performance, and features. Finally, a sleeper at the auto show could be Vietnamese automaker Vinfast with its VF9 electric SUV. The reveal will be ahead of a planned launch in Europe and the U.S. Of note, Vinfast parent Vingroup is reportedly still considering an IPO in the U.S.

Corporate events: Shareholders with iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) will vote on the acquisition offer from Amazon (AMZN) on October 17. On the same day, BitNile Holdings (NYSE:NILE) will host a conference call to provide additional information on the planned spin-offs of the company’s subsidiaries. Adobe (ADBE) will host a meeting on October 18 with financial analysts and investors at Adobe MAX. The company's executive team will provide update on the long-term market opportunity, strategy and innovation roadmap. On October 19, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) will host its Securities Analyst Meeting with discussion on the company's vision, strategy, and financial outlook. Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) will host an investor day event on October 20 with an update on the company's long-term strategy followed by a Q&A session. Check Seeking Alpha's Catalyst Watch for more events that move shares next week.

Barron's mentions: Deckers Outdoor (DECK) is called out this week by the publication as a stock that has more attraction than just the Ugg business. While the shoe seller is at risk of pulling back on guidance for double-digit revenue growth due to sector-wide demand and inventory issues, Deckers is called a long-term winner with multiple brands performing well. In particular, Hoka is noted to now be the number two brand in the specialty running category behind industry leader Brooks. Hoka is growing so quickly that some estimate have it accounting for half of Deckers' sales by 2025. On a valuation basis, Deckers trades with an earnings multiple of 16.5X vs. the five-year average of 18.6X.

289,2023 Nissan Ariya First Drive Review: An impressive overture,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1062x597/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2022/10/14112802/2023-Nissan-Ariya-20.jpg,15/10/2022,"Wee drove the 2023 Nissan Ariya electric SUV, and found it to be easy-driving with a classy, interesting interior. More like this please, Nissan.",https://www.autoblog.com/2022/10/15/2023-nissan-ariya-first-drive-review/,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Let’s say you write a screenplay and get an agent, manager or producer to read it. If they like your script, the first question they’ll ask you is, “What else do you have?” Movie execs prefer to invest in someone they know has more than one good idea.

If the 2023 Nissan Ariya were the script and I was the producer, the first question to Nissan would be, “What else do you have?” I spent a workday behind the wheel of the new battery-electric crossover, and quite enjoyed my first read. Here's to hoping Nissan’s coming EVs are as good or better.

So much of the good vibe comes from the interior. After expressing a difference of opinion with colleague James Riswick about the Volkswagen ID.4’s infotainment system, I agree with all Riswick had to say about the Ariya cabin, summed up as “fashionable and futuristic while still being functional.” Uncluttered yet inviting. Gorgeous displays with heaps of configurability. Features that are served best by buttons and a knob get buttons and a knob. Excellent material choices, save for one item I’ll get to in a moment. And, huzzah, a real live sunroof that opens with a simple toggle switch.

There’s plenty of room for people, and there’s plenty of room for the notions and trifles people carry, although not in the usual places. The sliding console between the seats doesn’t house the capacious bin we’ve begun to expect in EVs. The only item under the armrest is a slim dock for the wireless charging pad. The cubbies live under the instrument panel — a manually retractable pocket-slash-tiny-table under the HVAC controls, a glove compartment in the usual location. A note on that sliding console: It moves about 5 inches fore and aft, but it’s not a disappearing console, so the room gained by occupants in the front seats is subtracted for occupants in the rear seats. The area forward of it is also open, not unlike an old-school van or BMW i3, meaning that only items too heavy or weirdly shaped to roll into the driver's area can be put on the floor. Some may prefer an enclosed bin like what you'll find in a Kia EV6, even as an accessory.

Roominess takes a hit behind the second row, however, as designers stressed occupant room and an arced greenhouse over cargo space and the arced greenhouse. There’s but 22.8 cubic-feet of storage behind the second row, which is small for the segment. That’s 7 cubes less than found in the Ford Mustang Mach-E, and 7.5 cubes less than in the ID.4. It's equal to the Kia Niro EV. Putting the second row down improves load space to 59.7 cubic-feet, matching the Mach-E, but falling 4.5 cubic-feet short of the ID.4. The ICE-powered Nissan Rogue Sport, which is 10 inches shorter than the Ariya, can hold 22.9 cubic feet behind the second row, 61.1 cubic feet with the second row folded.

That one questionable materials decision mentioned above concerns the crosshatch motif inspired by Japanese Kumiko lanterns placed throughout the cabin, including on the doors, the speaker grilles and a rectangular panel under the dash (it's the thing that looks like a cold air return in the below right photo). When dark outside, a soft glowing light comes through the pattern and as shown in the below right photo, is a nice touch. When light outside, however, the plastic pieces look like a low-res imitation of wicker. That's less nice. At least the pattern carpet looks modern and expensive regardless of the time of day.

Rumor alleges the Ariya was meant to be an Infiniti. As a Nissan, however, it makes a superb reset for what the brand can do after previous leadership starved it of vision, attention and resources for so long. The Ariya’s quarters are premium enough to suit the elevated expectations and MSRP of an electric vehicle, still leaving plenty of room for an Infiniti variant to express genuine luxury.

One other quibble: the shifter required a moment of attention to figure out the button on the side was for getting into Reverse but not Park, and then another moment to find the “B” mode that calls up additional regen braking. Owners will learn the mechanism and never think about it again. It's only worth calling out because the shifter was the only item in the cabin that seemed like a functional issue. Everything else is intuitive.

There were no such hitches on the road. Nissan engineers said their guiding ethos was to make the Ariya easily comprehensible to someone making the switch from an ICE vehicle. The battery level charge icon, for instance, is a gas pump with a plug sticking out.

The transitional brief comes through in the driving experience. The Ariya cabin lets in a wee bit more wind noise on the highway than the ID.4 driven the previous day, a bit of ruffle at the cowl and around the mirrors. The margin is small enough that anyone not listening for it won’t notice it. The upside is that the driver picks up more subconscious cues about speed. It wasn't necessary to glance at the speedo to realize we were doing well over the speed limit moving with the flow of traffic.

Our Empower+ FWD tester — starting at $54,985 with $1,295 in destination charges — packed a motor on the front axle making 238 horsepower — 24 horses up on the $44,485 base spec — and 221 pound-feet of torque. The battery holds 91 kilowatt-hours total, 87 kWh of that usable. In a 4,608-pound crossover, this was plenty of gumption to have fun, never enough to be frightening. In relation to the kinds of crossovers buyers will come from and make comparisons to, the Ariya’s 7.2-second trot to 60 miles per hour is 2.6 seconds faster than the Nissan Rogue Sport, 0.7s second faster than the Rogue, and around a half-second quicker than the 201-hp ID.4.

The controls are super light. The steering is injected with far too much Novocaine, but neither too fast nor too slow. The throttle and brake pedals deliver easily modulated responses. The 19-inch 235/55 Dunlop Grand Trek rubber puts ample contact patch on the ground for the kind of driving an Ariya buyer would engage in. Those contact patches are well spaced, too. The Ariya’s overall length is 0.1 inches short of the Rogue; its wheelbase 2.8 inches longer, and its track 2 inches wider front and back. Coupled with instant torque delivery, a near 50/50 weight balance and a well-damped suspension, whisking the Ariya through back roads reveals crisp dynamics and copious pep. It's quick, fluid and never asks too much of you.

That's especially true when using the available Nissan ProPilot 2.0 system that enables hands-free driving on approved stretches of HD-mapped divided highway. On top of the second shark fin it puts on the roof and the hands-free functionality, new features in the five-year-old safety suite include lane change prompts, automatic lane changes and lane-specific guidance when using the crossover’s native navigation system. Drivers are notified of Pro Pilot’s operational level via a colored dashboard display. A white ADAS display means adaptive cruise control only, green means Steering Assist is also activated, blue gets those two plus hands-free. Regrettably, the system in our car had been accidentally disabled for the first part of the drive. Even after activation, though, green was as good as it got for the rest of the day, despite driving a corridor of I-65 where the system said it should have been able to go hands-free. High marks go to the standard lane keeping assist, at least, which never felt intrusive.

The Nissan Ariya isn’t a follow-up to the Leaf, it’s a reboot of the automaker’s EV franchise and the most interesting Nissan I’ve driven in too long. The automaker’s Ambition 2030 plan aims to get 15 new all-electric vehicles on the roads in the next five years, the Ariya being the first, and a very good start. The sequel can't come soon enough.

While the benchmark S&P 500 index is down by 25% year to date as of this writing, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has lost 34%.

But when you zoom out and compare their performances over the past five years, the picture looks very different. The Nasdaq-100 is up by 77%, which is nearly double the S&P 500's gain of 40%. This supports the widely held view that investing for the long term typically delivers the greatest benefits.

Investors could apply that strategy to semiconductor stock Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -1.73%), which has declined by 65% from its all-time high. Semiconductors continue to grow rapidly in importance, and the sector could be worth as much as $1.5 trillion annually by 2030. AMD is a best-in-class producer, and one that investors should consider buying now.

Semiconductors are down, but certainly not out

Semiconductors are the computer chips that power our everyday digital experiences, from smartphones to cars. The pandemic led to disruptions in their manufacture as fabrication facilities were temporarily closed and supply chains became snarled, resulting in chip shortages throughout 2020 and 2021. At the same time, demand soared as people working and attending school from home realized they needed to upgrade their computers and devices, and the inability to take part in many group leisure activities gave the popularity of video games a boost.

Those trends have largely reversed in 2022, and AMD is far from the only company in its niche that has experienced a steep decline in value. The iShares Semiconductor ETF, which is a barometer for the broader sector, is down 43% year to date. But it's up 112% over the last five years, crushing even the Nasdaq-100 index.

AMD has one of the most diversified product lines in the industry in terms of its end users. It produces chips for gaming consoles, computers, virtual reality headsets, and Tesla's electric vehicles. But the data center segment is the most important one for the company. It has deals with some of the largest providers of cloud computing services in the world, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

Data centers have become more than just places to store information. They're now hives of computing activity where artificial intelligence and machine learning models are trained to make sense of mountains of data that humans could never process manually. Valuable insights can be drawn from those analyses, helping businesses serve customers more efficiently -- and, ultimately, make more money.

AMD might be set for a bumpy end to 2022

On Oct. 6, AMD released preliminary results for the third quarter, saying it booked an estimated $5.6 billion in revenue for the period. That was a big miss from the $6.7 billion the company had previously forecast.

The main drag on its results was the client segment, where sales shrank by 40% year over year due to falling demand for personal computers. But the big winner was the data center segment, where revenue grew by a whopping 45% to $1.6 billion. In the gaming and embedded segments, AMD delivered modest gains, and while the company's overall revenue missed expectations, it was still up 29% compared to the same period last year.

The key for investors here, though, is to focus on the big picture, because AMD is still on track for a 49% jump in annual revenue despite its third-quarter struggles. Plus, there's no denying its long-term trajectory based on the chart below.

AMD's acquisition of Xilinx could be key

AMD recently closed its $49 billion acquisition of Xilinx, which could set up the next five to 10 years of gains for shareholders. Xilinx is a global leader in adaptive computing, creating innovative chips that can repeatedly be optimized in real time -- after they have been installed -- to adapt their capacities to whatever specific application that is needed.

AMD believes this is the next big opportunity in high-performance computing, especially in areas like artificial intelligence, where solid-state chip hardware isn't evolving fast enough to meet demand. The capacity of adaptive chips to be reconfigured many times after they've been manufactured stands in stark contrast to typical chips that need to be fully replaced in order to upgrade.

To put it simply, AMD stock's 65% decline has most likely created a buying opportunity for the long term. This year has been more challenging in some ways for the company than 2020 or 2021, and 2023 may bring its own set of hurdles, but AMD continues to drive its business forward. Five years from now, it's likely that investors will be looking back and realizing that AMD stock was trading at bargain levels in autumn 2022.",electric vehicles,motley fool
291,'Con Man:' Founder of Electric Truck Company Nikola Convicted of Fraud,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/Nikola-Motors-founder-Trevor-Milton-640x335.jpg,15/10/2022,"Trevor Milton, the founder of electric truck maker Nikola, was convicted of fraud after being accused of bragging about nonexistent technology in an attempt to inflate his company's stock price. ""Trevor Milton is a con man,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jordan Est…",https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2022/10/15/con-man-founder-of-electric-truck-company-nikola-convicted-of-fraud/,"Trevor Milton, the founder of electric truck maker Nikola, was convicted of fraud after being accused of bragging about nonexistent technology in an attempt to inflate his company’s stock price. “Trevor Milton is a con man,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jordan Estes said. “He lied to investors to get their money, plain and simple.”

On Friday, a federal jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan found Milton guilty of defrauding investors by lying about the supposed technical achievements of Nikola, according to a report by the New York Times.

Milton was convicted of one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. The more serious of the counts carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.

The jury reportedly delivered the verdict after about six hours of deliberation, following four weeks of testimony. U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos allowed Milton to remain free on a $100 million bond until sentencing in January.

After hearing the verdict, Milton was seen shaking his head in apparent disbelief while his wife, Chelsey Milton, sobbed with her head leaned up against the back of a courtroom bench.

During the trial, prosecutors described Milton as a “con man,” who lied to investors, claiming Nikola was close to producing long-haul trucks that could run emission-free on cheap hydrogen.

“Trevor Milton is a con man,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jordan Estes said on Thursday. “He lied to investors to get their money, plain and simple.”

Milton’s defense attorneys argued that the Nikola founder never intended to defraud anyone.

“He loved Nikola,” one of Milton’s defense lawyers, Marc Mukasey, told the jury on Thursday.

Mukasey also reportedly claimed that Milton would at times speak in the present tense about accomplishments he hoped for Nikola to achieve in the future. The attorney also likened his client to “an overenthusiastic parent who brags about his child,” the New York Times noted.

Nikola was reportedly able to avoid regulatory scrutiny typically applied to initial public offerings by making a deal with a so-called “blank-check” corporation, the report adds.

Milton, who owned 25 percent of Nikola shares, then went on a luxurious shopping spree after the stock market made him wealthy. Among his purchases included a Gulfstream jet and a multimillion-dollar home in the Turks and Caicos Islands.

The Nikola founder spent more than $80 million in just six months during 2020. After that, investment firm Hindenburg Research accused Milton of making false statements about Nikola’s technology.

The case provides a lesson in the dangers of investing in “pre-revenue” electric vehicle makers, which have proven to be struggling at the outset.

Electric truck and SUV maker Rivian Automotive, for example, said last week that it is recalling nearly all of its vehicles because the company had improperly installed fasteners, which could potentially cause the loss of steering control. Moreover, this is Rivian’s third recall since it started vehicle production late last year.

In fact, BMW has gone the extra mile with the G70 as there are many gasoline and diesel powertrains joined by plug-in hybrids (including an M760e) and the purely electric i7. But what if you want the most affordable version? Enter the 735i, which won’t be sold in Europe or the United States.

The 2023 BMW 7 Series in the 735i is seen here at the local media launch in Singapore. It’s also going to be sold in China and other select markets. You still get an inline-six mild-hybrid gasoline engine just like in the 740i, but power is substantially down from 380 hp (280 kW) and 520 Nm (383 lb-ft) to 286 hp (210 kW) and 425 Nm (313 lb-ft).

Interestingly, the 735i in Singapore is even less powerful as its turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six makes just 268 hp (200 kW) and 400 Nm (295 lb-ft). Usually, these detuned engines come as a response to higher taxes imposed by some governments on luxury vehicles with powerful engines.

How much performance are you losing? Well, BMW quotes the new 740i at 5.4 seconds for the sprint from 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) while the 735i takes 6.7 seconds. Both have electronic top speed limiters programmed to kick in at 155 mph (250 km/h). Fewer than 300 horses in a fullsize sedan that weighs over two metric tons are not overly impressive, but not all owners want to break Nürburgring records with their luxobarges.

The ”735i” badge has been around since the late 1970s during the E23 era when it received a 3.5-liter engine making a respectable 218 hp from an M90 engine. The namesake version introduced in the United States in 1985 had to make do with only 185 hp from an M30 unit, which was also used in the fancy L7.

Beyond the badge and engine, the 7 Series shown here has the pricey Individual two-tone paint option and 20-inch wheels. It has been configured with Merino leather upholstery with a Tartufo finish and has the automatic door function we used to see only on Rolls-Royce models.

This will further go up with increasing focus on energy storage capacity unless the country opts for circularity and retrieves valuable materials.The government launched the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme last year to give a push to domestic manufacturing of advanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries. While that will take care of the import bill to an extent, its success in a scenario of scarce ‘natural mining’ resources (lithium, nickel, cobalt) will depend on how well a circular economy model takes shape in the country based on an approach combining ‘ urban mining ’ – extracting recyclable materials from waste or end-of-life products – and technological advancement.Since the global battery recycling industry is conservatively projected to be worth $10 billion by 2025 and $30 billion by 2030, concerted efforts must be made in India to embrace circular economy principles within the lithium-ion battery (LIB) space to gain a 5-10% share in the world circularity domain.Indian government think tank Niti Aayog , which is the nodal agency for steering a committee on LIB circularity, in association with RMI and RMI India – not-for profit organisations working on the transition to a clean and inclusive energy future – has already come out with three comprehensive reports analysing all aspects of recycling and reuse of batteries. Suchreports also indicate how ‘urban mining’ with suitable technology would be the future of the circular economy, specifically in resource-starved countries.“It is alarming that the world reserves of lithium, cobalt, and other metals are not only limited and unevenly distributed, but their extraction process requires surplus labour and creates considerable pollution. Upcycling battery electrode materials through various approaches, such as surface engineering and electrode restructuring, could be a potential pathway towards a sustainable and circular economy,” said Shaijumon M M, associate professor at the Schoolof Physics, and head of the DST-IISER Thiruvananthapuram consortium on Solidstate Battery Technology.The institution is currently working on transforming electrodes from used batteries into products with higher value that could be a way to offset the processing cost. “Given the huge demand for establishing high-capacity,long-cycle, low-cost, and sustainable energy storage systems, it would be interesting to explore new recycling approaches combined with novel energy storage systems, such as dual ion batteries,” said Shaijumon.Industries, mainly startups, have gradually been entering the space ever since the government launched the PLI scheme with momentum having been built up by the new Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, released by the environment ministry in August.“Without any considerable resources of cobalt, nickel and lithium in India, we are highly dependent on imports of these rare materials in the short term. This exposes us to the uncertainties of geopolitical tussle. Even though India lacks a natural mine of lithium, we will build an ‘urban mine’ for it. This might not be enough in the short term but will be pivotal to fulfilling India’s needs in the long term,” said Shubham Vishwakarma, founder and chief of process engineering at Metastable Materials — a Bengalurubased ‘urban mining’ startup working on providing environment-friendly solutions for reducing the batteries’ overall life-cycle cost.“Even though it’s a long road ahead, the new Battery Waste Management Rules is a step in the right direction to achieving a circular economy. A clear outline of roles and responsibilities for all the stakeholders to ensure the development of an ecosystem intended to maximise the collective output of the recycling industry is always a welcome step,” Vishwakarma said. The government had launched the PLI scheme with the goal of achieving manufacturing capacity of 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of ACC and 5 GWh of “niche” ACC with an outlay of Rs 18,100 crore.ACCs are the new generation of advanced storage technology. These cells are used in LIB and account for 80% of the cost of such batteries. They can store electric energy as either electrochemical or chemical energy and convert it back to electric energy as and when required. Their role will increase with the growth of consumer electronics, electric vehicles, advanced electricity grids, solar rooftop, etc.“Given the growth in portable devices and EVs, massive quantities of end-of-life LIBs have also been generated. LIBs contain toxic and flammable chemicals that need safe disposal. Currently, there is no production of cobalt and lithium from primary ores in India. Therefore, LIB recycling will aid in resource efficiency and circular economy, further mitigating import dependency,” said Nikhil Dhawan of the department of metallurgical and materials engineering at IIT Roorkee.",electric vehicles,the times of india
294,Electric-vehicle fires have burned down homes after Hurricane Ian saltwater damage. Florida officials want answers,"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243831716.jpg?resize=1200,600",15/10/2022,"“Florida homes which survived Hurricane Ian, have now been lost to fires caused by flooded EVs.”",https://fortune.com/2022/10/15/electric-vehicle-fires-homes-burned-hurricane-ian-saltwater-flooding-ev-batteries/,"It sounds counterintuitive, but electric vehicles that have been submerged in salt water can catch fire. That’s proved to be a problem in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian, which flooded parts of the state last month.

Now Florida officials are seeking answers. This week, U.S. Senator Rick Scott wrote about the issue to the Department of Transportation and electric-vehicle makers. In a letter addressed to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Scott wrote:

In addition to the damage caused by the storm itself, the saltwater flooding in several coastal areas has had further destructive consequences in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian by causing the lithium ion batteries in flooded electric vehicles (EVs) to spontaneously combust and catch fire. This emerging threat has forced local fire departments to divert resources away from hurricane recovery to control and contain these dangerous fires. Car fires from electric vehicles have proven to be extremely dangerous and last for a prolonged period, taking in many cases up to six hours to burn out. Alarmingly, even after the car fires have been extinguished, they can reignite in an instant. Sadly, some Florida homes which survived Hurricane Ian have now been lost to fires caused by flooded EVs.

Scott asked Buttigieg what guidance his department has provided—or asked EV makers to provide—to consumers, as well as what protocols it’s developed for the carmakers themselves.

Electric vehicles “may be a ticking time bomb”

Jimmy Patronis, Florida’s chief financial officer and state fire marshal, also weighed in on the issue. Last week he wrote to Jack Danielson, executive director of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, asking for “immediate guidance” and noting, “In my experience, Southwest Florida has a significant number of EVs in use, and if those EVs were left behind, exposed to storm surge, and sitting in garages, there is a risk of fires.”

He noted that based on his research, “much of the guidance on submerged vehicles does not address specific risks associated with exposure of EVs to salt water.” He added that earlier this month, “I joined North Collier Fire Rescue…and saw with my own eyes an EV continuously ignite, and continually reignite, as fire teams doused the vehicle with tens of thousands of gallons of water.”

He also warned that “EVs may be a ticking time bomb.”

On Twitter, Patronis shared a video of firefighters trying extinguish a burning Tesla. He wrote in the tweet, “There’s a ton of EVs disabled from Ian. As those batteries corrode, fires start. That’s a new challenge that our firefighters haven’t faced before. At least on this kind of scale.”

In a reply to Patronis, Danielson wrote:

Test results specific to saltwater submersion show that salt bridges can form within the battery pack and provide a path for short circuit and self-heating. This can lead to fire ignition. As with other forms of battery degradation, the time period for this transition from self-heating to fire ignition can vary greatly.

He added:

It may be helpful for persons who are not involved in immediate lifesaving missions to identify flooded vehicles with lithium-ion batteries and move them at least 50 feet from any structures, vehicles, or combustibles.",electric vehicles,fortune

Nikola Corporation founder Trevor Milton was found guilty of three counts of criminal fraud on Friday after he was accused of defrauding investors last year.

Two counts of wire fraud and one count of securities fraud are the charges that will stick with Milton following the conclusion of his case, which occurred on Friday in Manhattan. Milton pleaded not guilty to all counts but now faces a maximum prison sentence of up to 25 years for the top charge, Bloomberg reported.

“I did nothing wrong,” Milton said after the trial concluded. “I was talking about a business plan,” he said.

Jurors had another perspective. “I thought the evidence was clear,” a juror reportedly said.

Milton’s promises as Nikola’s frontman were lofty. After promising the launch of several vehicles, talking about their manufacturing development, and even claiming its marquee product was operational, Milton was bound to be the next big thing in the EV industry. Things started not to add up, however. Hindenburg Research released a scathing report on Milton in 2020 that accused the company of misleading investors, most notably with a low-grade hill that was used to make its Nikola One semi-truck appear to be self-propelled. The company eventually admitted that it was not, and the hill assisted the vehicle in appearing to be operational.

Milton eventually stepped down from Nikola in early 2021. By June 2021, charges from a federal grand jury had accused Milton of lying about “nearly all aspects” of Nikola’s business.

“Milton’s scheme targeted individual, non-professional investors — so-called retail investors — by making false and misleading statements directly to the investing public through social media, and television, print and podcast interviews,” prosecutors said after the indictment was unsealed on July 29, 2021.

Since Milton’s exit from the company, Nikola has rebounded dramatically. The company has started producing and delivering the battery-electric Nikola Tre semi-truck in North America and recently launched orders for the vehicle in Europe. Earlier this week, Nikola completed its acquisition of Romeo Power, a transaction that started in May after the companies announced an all-stock transaction. Nikola also paid the SEC a $125 million fine to settle charges that it had misled investors with its products.

“The company has cooperated with the government throughout the course of its inquiry. We remain committed to our previously announced milestones and timelines and are focused on delivering Nikola Tre battery-electric trucks later this year from the company’s manufacturing facilities,” the company said in a statement after the indictment was passed down.

299,War colliding with recession risks leave energy markets on uncertain path,https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/10/NYT-1-1.jpg,15/10/2022,"Brent crude, the closely watched benchmark for global oil prices, fell almost 25% during the third quarter, finishing September trading around $85 a barrel, although it has since moved higher as OPEC+ announced significant cuts.",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/war-recession-risks-energy-markets-uncertain-8210021/,"Written by J. Alex Tarquinio

Forecasting the direction of the volatile energy markets has never been easy. But experts say the complexity of market forces brewing now, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, makes it especially difficult to predict the direction of both energy prices and the industry.

“I’ve never seen such a spicy bouillabaisse of ingredients that could wreak havoc on energy prices,” said Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. “You have to look and say that the world changed on Feb. 24,” the day of the Russian invasion.

A variety of forces could sustain high energy prices, including the recent production cuts by the producer group OPEC+, the winding down of a U.S.-led program to release oil from the strategic reserves of the United States and other countries, subsidies by several European nations to help citizens pay higher energy costs and slow industry investment in drilling operations. On the other hand, prices could fall on fears of a global recession, the potential for energy rationing in Europe this winter and an effort by the Group of 7 industrialized nations to impose a price cap on Russian oil.

Brent crude, the closely watched benchmark for global oil prices, fell almost 25% during the third quarter, finishing September trading around $85 a barrel, although it has since moved higher as OPEC+ announced significant cuts. The U.S. government forecasts that oil will trade at an average price of $95 a barrel in 2023.

Funds that invest in U.S. energy companies, which typically mimic price movements in the oil markets, rose exponentially along with oil prices in the first quarter of this year. By contrast, those funds fell by an average of less than 1% in the three months that ended in September. Energy is the only stock sector fund category that posted gains, on average, in the first nine months of this year, according to Morningstar Direct.

Experts say the G-7 agreement on Sept. 2 to cap the price of Russian oil is generating much of the uncertainty about oil prices. The plan aims to limit Russia’s export revenues while keeping its oil flowing through global markets. Skeptics, though, say a price cap may be difficult to enforce. Oil embargoes are notoriously leaky, and shippers can use legal measures like ship-to-ship transfers at sea to try to obscure the origins of a cargo.

Goldman Sachs issued a research report the same day as the price cap agreement was announced, calling it “bearish in theory, bullish in practice” for oil prices and predicting that Russia, which pumps about 10% of the 100 million barrels of oil produced globally each day, might retaliate by cutting its exports to drive up global energy costs. That, the report said, “would turn this into an additional bullish shock for the oil market.”

That day, Russian-owned energy giant Gazprom announced that it would postpone restarting natural gas flows from Russia to Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Later in September, gas leaks were discovered in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines under the Baltic Sea. The European Union and several European governments blamed sabotage for the damage.

But Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management, who has been studying the impact of Russia’s war on the energy industry through the Chief Executive Leadership Institute that he founded at the school, recently wrote an opinion piece expressing his confidence in the G-7 plan. In an interview, he pointed to the small number of major shippers and insurers, mostly based in Europe, saying that should make enforcement easy because “you can count on both hands the number of parties you would need to enforce it with.”

He also cast doubt on the idea that Russia would switch off its oil spigots as readily as it had stopped sending natural gas to Europe. Russia has more options to sell its oil, and shutting down wells could create future problems for the Russian industry, Sonnenfeld said, so President Vladimir Putin “would be poisoning the Russian economy for years.”

Philip K. Verleger, an energy economist who began his career as a Washington policy adviser 50 years ago, said that the production cuts announced by OPEC+ are likely to have less of an impact now because the circumstances are quite different. The United States was more dependent on foreign oil in the 1970s, he said, so OPEC’s aggressive moves led to gas rationing and lines at filling stations. But the United States is a bigger producer today, and some drivers are choosing vehicles that use little to no gas.

“Electric vehicles are beginning to penetrate the market so rapidly that if OPEC pushes too hard now, they could really accelerate the move off oil,” Verleger said.

In past economic cycles, higher energy prices have reduced demand, ultimately putting a lid on prices. European governments are providing a test case by spending billions of dollars on price controls and direct stimulus payments to offset higher energy costs while encouraging their citizens to voluntarily turn down the thermostats. President Emmanuel Macron of France has called such voluntary conservation efforts “energy sobriety.”

But Europe is also investing heavily in new infrastructure to support imports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, which is supercooled so it can be shipped on tankers. A flurry of deals have been signed to construct the facilities required to reconvert LNG to vaporous gas in Germany, France, Belgium and elsewhere. U.S. exporters may be among the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. The United States began exporting LNG six years ago and became the world’s largest exporter in the first half of this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Paul M. DeSisto, executive vice president of the wealth management firm M&R Capital Management, says that whatever direction energy prices take, he sees the big energy companies in the S&P 500 index returning to something closer to their 20-year average of 8.3% of the market value of the index. At the end of September, energy stocks represented 4.5% of the S&P 500. “Given how important energy is to the world economy, I think it will return to something closer to the longer view,” he said.

His firm uses two energy-focused exchange-traded funds in client portfolios: the $35 billion Energy Select Sector SPDR, managed by State Street Global Advisors, and the $7 billion Vanguard Energy fund. The two funds have a slight difference in composition as they track different market indexes. The State Street fund owns the 21 energy stocks in the S&P 500 index, while the Vanguard fund includes a mix of more than 100 large, midsize and small U.S. energy companies. But the returns after the 0.1% management fee charged by both funds tend to be similar because Exxon Mobil and Chevron are the two biggest holdings in each fund, representing more than one-third of the total assets. The State Street fund returned 33.76% in the first three quarters of the year, and the Vanguard fund returned 34.71%.

Despite the substantial geopolitical risks, commodity prices may ultimately be most influenced by the rate at which companies choose to invest profits in their own operations. So far, companies have been focused on returning profits to shareholders through dividends.

The Biden administration is keen to see more investment in the energy industry. “Ultimately our goal here in the United States and around the world has got to be to increase the supply of energy,” Wally Adeyemo, U.S. deputy secretary of the Treasury, said at a recent energy conference at Columbia University. He pointed out that the president has taken steps in this direction by releasing petroleum from the country’s strategic reserves, but also by calling on the private sector to increase production. “We want to make sure that supply chains are stronger in the United States, but also among our friends and allies.”

But the industry may still be reluctant to risk lowering prices too quickly. Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service said he thought the industry had learned its lesson from past boom and bust cycles and wouldn’t dramatically ramp up drilling. “They’ve gotten the message,” he said. “The companies are not going to kill the golden goose.”",electric vehicles,the indian express

But never before have we seen something quite so elegant-looking as this early automotive era replica, complete with all the bells and whistles you could possibly ask for in a Chinese knock-off. And that makes it a perfect selection for this week’s Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week!

This vintage-looking electric car rolled straight out of a 100-year-old time capsule and directly into my heart.

For a reasonable $10,000 (at least compared to most electric car prices these days), it could be rolling into your heart and driveway too!

It won’t be getting there very quickly, at least not with its top speed of 30 km/h (18 mph).

But when you have a car like this, you’re going to want to be driving by slowly to make sure everyone gets a good look. This is a car for cruising Sunday morning parades, not picking up pink slips on Saturday night.

You also might want to make those few miles you get count, since the old-fashioned lead acid battery bank takes a claimed eight hours to recharge fully after its 80-km (50 mile) range is depleted.

Hey, the options are fast, pretty and cheap. Pick two.

Speaking of options, I’m not sure it comes with many in the traditional sense, but it does still seem to arrive nicely outfitted. This five-seater Monopoly-car-come-to-life is fully-stocked for an awesome joyride, even if it’s a slower joy ride.

Your $10,000 wire transfer gets you white wall tires on wire wheels, hydraulic brakes, enough head lights to permanently blind a deer, old-school trumpet horn, fenders for days, leather-ish interior that looks fairly comfortable (but also looks like it might fuse to your legs on a hot summer day), a fold-up Bimini convertible top, and more! The paint option is even listed as “car painting,” so you know it’s good.

I just don’t think you can find a classier set of wheels in all of China for this price!

I often poke a bit of fun at the design choices and build quality of many of these Alibaba electric vehicles, but this one actually has me pleasantly surprised.

They seem to have outdone themselves with the attention to detail of this fun little classically styled EV.

It may not be very fast or powerful, but it sure looks like a million bucks despite only costing 10 thousand of them.

That being said, you shouldn’t expect to get this debonair runabout into your driveway for just 10 g’s. When I bought my electric mini-truck from China last year, it came with several thousand dollars in extra import fees, taxes, and shipping charges.

Speaking of shipping though, it looks like the Alibaba vendor has that pretty well thought out, based on the freight images shared on the product page. They’re ready to slightly disassemble, crate up, and then ship this awesome little electric roadster.

And lest you think for a minute that the vendor isn’t serious about this little electric Alibaba Roadster, they put those concerns to bed.

Just check out the video of the car in action below! Unless they filmed the video going downhill, then it looks functional to me!

What do you think? Could a classic Alibaba EV be in your future? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!

Michigan Deems Carvana An “Imminent Threat” To The Public, Suspends Their License To Sell Cars

Michigan has become the latest state to take issue with how used-car dealership Carvana operates and has suspended its license to sell cars. The reasons are numerous, including cases of alleged fraudulent acts by Carvana employees, such as destroying title applications, as well as improper odometer disclosure records. Given the multiple violations, Michigan says Carvana is an “imminent threat” to the “health, safety or welfare of the public, requiring emergency action.”

The 2023 BMW M2 Shakes Off Conservative Design, Retains Driver-Oriented Focus

The all-new 2023 BMW M2 is here, with a design that has proved to be as Marmite as just about any other modern BMW. But, if you look past the wide horizontal-slatted grilles and blocky air intakes (those wanting even more shock and awe may be interested in the M Performance parts), you’ll find a car that, on paper, is still designed to appeal to enthusiasts. There’s a 3.0-liter straight-six engine with a healthy 453 hp (343 kW / 459 PS) and 406 lb-ft (550 Nm) of torque. There’s a manual six-speed automatic with auto-blip. And BMW has resisted the temptation to offer all-wheel drive, with power being sent to the rear wheels exclusively. One big issue, however, is weight. At 3,814 lbs (1,730 kg) in manual guise or 3,867 lbs (1,754 kg) with an automatic, it’s quite the porker. Fancy a convertible version? While unlikely, we’ve made up a render of what one would look like.

2024 Chevrolet Trax Debuts With Better Looks, More Room And A Lower Price

The new 2024 Trax will be Chevrolet’s entry-level car going forward, and at just $21,495, it makes it $205 less than the outgoing model’s starting price. However, rather than appearing to be a bargain basement special, the new Trax seems to be an upgrade in many areas. The design takes cues from the larger Blazer, while the interior has a more cohesive aesthetic. Power comes from a turbocharged 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine that produces an estimated 137 hp (102 kW / 139 PS) and 162 lb-ft (219 Nm) of torque.

2024 Polestar 3 Is An Electric Luxury SUV Priced From $84k With Up To 510 HP And A 379-Mile Range

Polestar is looking to target the likes of the Porsche Cayenne with their latest and largest offering: the 3 SUV. Pricing will start at $83,900 in America, and it comes with a rear-biased dual-motor setup putting out 483 hp (489 PS) and 620 lb-ft (840 Nm). There’s also an optional Power Pack that raises those numbers to 510 hp (517 PS) and 671 lb-ft (910 Nm) and cuts the sprint to 4.7 seconds. Polestar says the new SUV will do 379 miles (610 km) on the WLTP cycle, and can be recharged at up to 250 kW.

We Talk To Ex-Koenigsegg Head Designer Sasha Selipanov About EVs, Annoying Design Trends And More

When it comes to automotive designers, Sasha Selipanov has already made a name for himself, working on some iconic vehicles. At Lamborghini, he played a role in the design of the Huracan. At Bugatti, he led the exterior design team that created the Chiron and the Vision Gran Turismo. And, at Genesis, he penned the gorgeous Essentia concept. Most recently, he served as the head of design at Koenigsegg, where he inked the Gemera four-seater hypercar before working on the new CC850, and Carscoops managed to sit down and have a chat with him.

Ford Won’t Give “Unauthorized Tuners” Access To The 2024 Mustang S650

It’s bad news for tuners who have made a living off of extracting more power from a car’s stock engine. Ford has locked down the “full stack” or the complete package of electronic hardware and software in the S650 Mustang, meaning that it will be harder for third-party tuners to get in there. The reasoning is to protect the car against vulnerabilities from hackers while keeping users’ personal info private. However, while Ford has worked with aftermarket tuners in many different instances over the years and we expect that to continue in the future, when asked by Musclecarsandtrucks if just any third party would be able to tune the S650’s engines, the chief engineer of the all-new Mustang, Ed Krenz, responded with a resounding “NO.”

2025 Fiat 500X: Next Gen Keeps Italian Flair And Grows In Size To Compete With Compact SUVs

The next-generation 500X is expected to graduate into a larger class of vehicle, with the 600 taking the crossover’s spot. The 500X will therefore become a C-Segment SUV, with the equivalent Jeep Avenger and the larger next-gen Renegade expected to follow suit. Our speculative renderings created by Jean Francois Hubert/SB-Medien for CarScoops predict what such a car will look like when it arrives, rumored sometime around 2024.

Jaguar F-Type Riding Into The Sunset, Getting 75 Edition As A Final Sendoff

Jaguar is about to go through a period of extreme change, as the company repositions itself as a more upmarket automaker that solely deals in EVs. That means cars like the F-Type will soon be no more. To celebrate the F-Type’s final model year, the company has created the F-Type 75 and F-Type R 75 special editions, featuring a Giola Green metallic paint job, front fender badges that depict the F-Type’s unmistakable silhouette, LED headlights, and 20-inch wheels.

Even if it does fight off Russia completely and regain and secure its borders, the country has been demolished, countless citizens have been murdered, many more have been traumatized and terrorized, and rebuilding the nation will be no easy task. But I have also wondered a lot about Russia. And much of this wondering relates to energy and its economy.

First of all, it’s worth noting that, aside from the many Russians who have invaded Ukraine and died in the process, the country is losing population from a massive exodus of citizens who do not want to be drafted and who do not support the invasion. People — often more educated, more skilled, and with a more open mind than your common Ivan — have had enough and are leaving Russia with a dimmer future in order to pursue a new life elsewhere. “Over 3.8 million Russians left from January to March this year, according to the Federal Security Services’ own estimates,” Fortune writes. In August, before the recent “mobilization” and exodus, The Economist had a headline titled “Much of Russia’s intellectual elite has fled the country.” “On Oct. 4, Forbes Russia reported that the number of people who have left the country since Putin ordered the draft could be as high as 700,000,” Reuters reports.

Russia has a rich history in the arts, in sport (a couple of my favorite tennis players are Russian, including the former world #1), and in science and technology. There’s no denying that. However, the country already had a problem with economic diversification before this large-scale emigration. And that problem is related to energy — dirty energy. “The oil and gas sector accounted up to roughly 40% of Russia’s federal budget revenues, and up to 60% of its exports in 2019,” Wikipedia writes. Much of Russia’s economy and development depends on oil & gas revenues, and those won’t last forever. Europe and the US have been turning off the spigot, and it’s hard to see right now how they would decide to turn it on again even once this war is over. Why create dependency on the nation again or help boost it economically after all of this? For now, Russia has been able to find an outlet and buyers for its oil and gas anyway — it’s a big global market and some nations, like China and India, have been fine getting a better deal on Russian oil. However, the market will shrink. In Europe, 13% of new cars sales are fully electric and 21% have a plug. In China, 22% of new cars are fully electric and 30% have a plug. It will take time for growing EV sales to make a serious dent in oil demand, but it will happen. With more limited markets and less demand overall for oil, an economy centered on oil will start to feel the crunch in very real ways.

So far, that all ignores the question of what will happen with Vladimir Putin. Dissent is no longer being totally wiped out — it’s growing and is even coming from big Putin supporters at times. With so many people opposed to Putin’s militaristic efforts having left country, however, there is less potential for mass dissent — but almost no one is happy with how things have been going since Russia invaded Ukraine. People are losing their sons and husbands, the “patriots” who expected Ukraine to become part of Russia in a matter of days are disillusioned, the economy is in the trash, those in the upper echelons of the military are embarrassed, and oligarchs and other members of the business community are frustrated. Many wonder if Putin’s days are shorter in number than we typically presume. If his rule does end and he’s toppled, who takes his place? Who takes over Russia, and will they look to bring back the brains and diversify away from fossil fuels? Or will they be even more entrenched in the fossil fuel world? How hard will it be to rebuild the Russian economy with eventually dwindling fossil fuel revenue?

If Putin does remain in power, well, it’s hard to see much changing. The society will remain massively unbalanced economically, and even if Russian energy revenue declines, the oligarchs will remain rich and the poor majority will continue to get by month to month. John McCain said Russia was “a gas station masquerading as a country.” It would remain a gas station, just a smaller one or one bringing in less revenue. The country won’t be turned from a gas station into a Starbucks.

I think Putin’s departure is more likely than not in the next few years (but it’s clearly very hard to predict). I just have a hard time seeing the people demand a more open and democratic system of rule now that millions have fled. It seems more likely that a power-hungry, money-hungry person will look at the pot of gold sitting in the oil & gas industry and will be sure to keep it flowing and reap the benefits rather than try to restructure everything and give up the short-term economic benefits of sitting on top of the food chain. More likely than not, the highly corrupted state will remain highly corrupted and certain well connected people will score big even while budgets are drained and the poor get poorer. From Wikipedia:

“Russia was the lowest rated European country in Transparency International‘s Corruption Perceptions Index for 2020; ranking 129th out of 180 countries.[110] Corruption is perceived as a significant problem in Russia,[111] impacting various aspects of life, including the economy,[112] business,[113] public administration,[114][115] law enforcement,[116] healthcare,[117] and education.[118] The phenomenon of corruption is strongly established in the historical model of public governance in Russia and attributed to general weakness of rule of law in Russia.[119] As of 2020, the percentage of business owners who distrust law enforcement agencies rose to 70% (from 45% in 2017); 75% don’t believe in impartiality of courts and 79% do not believe that legal institutions protect them from abuse of law such as racketeering or arrest on dubious grounds.[120]“

With or without Putin, it’s hard to see that changing. Just as it’s hard to see whoever is in power ignoring the short-term benefits of black gold and investing in an energy and economic transformation. While neighbors in Ukraine will continue their fast-paced push into solar power, battery storage, electric vehicles, and Starlink-based communications, who in Russia is going to lead a drive into the same, and a cleaning up of its oil & gas industry? Who in Russia is going to make the historical giant a more modern, more diversified, more robust economy?

305,From immigration to the environment: Five things we learned about Sweden's new right-wing government,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/11/73/38/1000x563_cmsv2_e4edd084-6cd6-5a84-8719-4194a76ac9b1-7117338.jpg,15/10/2022,"Despite being out of the formal coalition government, it's clear the far-right Sweden Democrats wield a great deal of power behind the scenes.",https://www.euronews.com/2022/10/15/from-immigration-to-the-environment-five-things-we-learned-about-swedens-new-right-wing-go,"Sweden's new prime minister Ulf Kristersson was confirmed in a parliament vote on Monday 176-173, with MPs voting strictly along left-right party lines.

Kristersson leads a formal three-party coalition with his Moderates joined by the the Christian Democrats and Liberals.

But it's the far-right Sweden Democrats, the biggest of the four parties in terms of MPs, who will be a not-so-silent partner: technically outside the government, but holding the reigns of power in practice.

The new government has released its 62-page policy agenda, so what have we learned about the direction Sweden will take? Here's our look at five key areas:

1. The Sweden Democrats hold a lot of cards

The whole relationship between the three parties which form the coalition government, and their partners, the Sweden Democrats, is underpinned by the agreement they've all signed.

And it's clear that the far-right anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats hold a lot of power. They might not have cabinet minister jobs, but as the biggest party out of the four, they're outside the government in name only.

""Parties that are not in government have full and equal influence on issues in the cooperation projects in the same way as the parties in government,"" the 'Tidö Agreement' — named after the castle where the negotiations took place — states in black and white.

The Sweden Democrats' influence goes even deeper: they'll have a say in drafting any and all new laws, amendments to regulations and budget decisions. And they'll be able to place their own political operatives into government ministries to check up on the work of the other parties who hold ministries handling the seven core policy areas the government wants to tackle during its first year.

There are also restrictions in the agreement on parties in the government working with parties outside the government, which pretty much puts an end to any notion of cross-party cooperation on some of the biggest issues facing the country.

2. Sweden is getting tougher on immigrants

The new Swedish 3+1 government is about to get much tougher on the Nordic nation's immigrant population and for people who want to come to Sweden in the future.

Asylum-seekers can still show up and make a claim, but they'll be expected to stay only temporarily — and even then, only if they're refugees from countries ""in the vicinity of Sweden."" Regional authorities will also be able to launch their own campaigns to encourage migrants to go back home voluntarily.

The new government wants to approve family reunification for asylum seekers only after two years of permanent residency, which means potentially a long wait for families separated by conflict before they can be together again.

Anyone who wants to stay in Sweden longer ""must take responsibility for becoming party of Swedish society"", which means, at the very least, a requirement to learn the language before you can get citizenship, but it doesn't say how far this integration should go or how it will be tested.

There's also a proposal that wants to make people from outside the EU subjected to DNA testing, with their genetic profiles ""stored in searchable registers.""

3. Sweden's international profile is changing

The headline here is that Sweden will cut the number of quota refugees from 5,000 people per year to just 900.

There are also plans to cut the country's international aid budget from 1% of GDP to 0.85%.

And as the country tightens its borders, the incoming government wants to be able to send Swedish border police to EU airports to do passport and identity checks at locations where there have historically been a high number of migrant or asylum passengers.

If you're travelling to Sweden from another country, even from within the EU, the new right-wing coalition wants to reintroduce identity checks on buses, trains and ferries.

4. There's a crime crackdown coming

Sweden has seen a surge in violence related to crime gangs over the last few years, which is described in the agreement as ""Sweden's main social problem"" and which the parties have linked with immigration and integration and vowed to tackle.

Unsurprisingly, they're getting tough on criminal activity with a range of proposals in the new government programme, including double penalties for members of crime gangs; tougher sentences for rape; making begging in the street a crime; promising more money for the police — and giving them stop-and-search powers in parts of the country designated as high crime zones.

""The aim is to increase security, prevent more young people from becoming involved in crime, investigate more crimes that lead to prosecution, and to combat serious organised crime,"" the agreement says.

In particular, the new government wants to know how many foreign nationals are involved in organised crime gangs, making it an offence even to be a member of a gang and to be able to deport foreigners who are suspected of being gang members, even if they haven't been convicted in court.

5. More tools to fight the climate crisis

The new government has plans to do more to tackle the climate crisis while sticking to Sweden's current commitments to carbon reduction.

For starters, there's more money earmarked for nuclear, with €36 billion credit guarantees to build new nuclear power stations, and also rules to make it more difficult to shut down nuclear plants.

And to ensure the safety of electricity supply in the shorter term (and to keep prices low), the government will investigate whether it's viable to reopen two nuclear power stations in the south of the country which were closed over the last few years.

There will be a price cap for energy bills, funded by the government, introduced by November, and the country's network of charging points for electric vehicles will be expanded.",electric vehicles,euronews

He had been to the future, and it was China.

Now, 14 years after his initial investment in China’s premier manufacturer of electric vehicles, Buffett is quietly pulling the plug on this and his other China plays. It is worth asking why.

After all, this is the same man who parlayed a small investment into a failing New England textile company called Berkshire Hathaway nearly 70 years ago into a fortune now worth close to 100 billion dollars. If Buffett is ditching China, it means that, in his view, the risk/reward ratio has tilted decisively into the red.

Here’s my take on what I think the aptly named Oracle of Omaha is thinking.

In a few days, the 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will open. Party leader Xi Jinping will be supposedly “elected” to a third five-year term, but in reality he will really be locking down his control of China for life.

Buffet, who’s worth nearly $100 billion, paid $230 million for a 10% stake in BYD almost 15 years ago. AP

The 70-year-old dictator is, like the late Chairman Mao whom he greatly admires, a radical Communist ideologue. This means his decade-long drive to concentrate all power in the hands of the state—which is to say his hands–will not only continue, but accelerate. China’s hugely successful private sector will be bled dry, and the deadly assault on the most productive members of society—people like Alibaba-founder Jack Ma–will continue.

So will Xi’s insane Covid-Zero policy.

After the likely Wuhan lab leak, Xi announced that he was personally overseeing the pandemic response. And the policy that he settled upon to stop the spread of the coronavirus was to lock down entire cities, even provinces.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping is set to further consolidate his hold over every element of Chinese finance and politics during the upcoming 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. REUTERS

Because the lockdowns are so closely identified with Xi himself, no one in China has dared to criticize this fruitless effort to stamp out the coronavirus, even as it continues to wreak havoc in the economy. Indeed, the immediate imposition of a rigid lockdown as soon as a handful of cases of Covid are detected has become almost a kind of loyalty test for Communist officials, a pledge of allegiance to the new Chinese emperor.

Worse yet for China’s economic prospects, a new series of articles in the People’s Daily suggests that the deadly lockdowns, which arguably kill more people than Covid, will continue for several more years. The official press has been at pains to stress the correctness of the Chinese response, even as every other country on the planet has abandoned it.

It is largely because of these two “C”s—Communism and Covid—that China’s economy is in crisis. Buffet is undoubtedly aware that official statistics show the country’s growth has been cut in half—and the actual situation is undoubtedly far more dire. The property sector is bust, banks are going belly up, and Chinese consumers are tightening their belts. The Chinese economy is headed for a very hard landing, as political controls tighten and Covid lockdowns continue.

Even without these domestic political headwinds, Buffet is undoubtedly also factoring in recent U.S. actions that will further hamstring China’s technological and military advance. Under the bipartisan CHIPS act, the U.S. has just imposed new export controls on semiconductor chips—not just those made domestically but those made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment—that will make it much harder for China to successfully produce state-of-the-art electric vehicles, cell phones, or computers in the future.

Any such attack on Taiwan would dramatically speed up the decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese economies. The outcome, if not Armageddon, would be to divide the world into two competing blocks, with the U.S. and Europe on one side, facing a hostile China-Russia axis on the other. The value of Buffet’s investments in China would plummet.

China recently flexed its military might via a series of menacing fly-overs across Taiwanese territory, which the government considers an inviolable part of China itself. AP

Such sanctions, unseen since the days of the Cold War, raise the specter of open conflict, especially since they will also deny China the ability to import to chips manufactured in Taiwan. If Xi wants the island’s chips, he will have to take the state-of-the-art chipmaking facilities by force. His escalatory rhetoric and increasingly aggressive actions—recently sending drones and missiles over Taiwanese territory—suggests he is contemplating just that.

Even in the absence of open conflict, public sentiment in the West has already turned strongly against China. It is not just that Beijing likely released a pandemic on the world, killing millions and causing trillions of dollars in economic damage. The genocide of the Uyghurs, the crushing of a free Hong Kong and its support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have all progressively hardened attitudes against China. Some 82 percent of Americans now have a negative view of the East Asian giant, with anti-China sentiment running even higher in Australia and Japan.

Recent US sanctions have made it far harder for China to import goods made in Taiwan such as these semi-conductor chips, which are crucial components of China’s electric-car industry. REUTERS

The big box stores of America may still be packed with cheap Chinese goods, but those in the market for a big-ticket electric vehicle probably don’t want to support a genocidal regime that is openly hostile to America. Add to this the growing anti-CCP sentiment in the US, and BYD may well find itself shut out of the American car market in the future, by consumer boycotts, if not by tariffs.

Warren Buffet has plenty of reasons to take his money and run.

And, as always, where Buffet leads, others will follow.

State Rep. Bob Rommel and state Fire Marshal Jim Patronis have been particularly vocal about the threat of EV fires in the aftermath of the hurricane.

Rommel tweeted on Monday about a house that had managed to outlast the hurricane, but couldn’t survive the EV fire that later started in the garage.

“This house survived Hurricane Ian with very little damage that was until the Tesla in the garage caught on fire. House is now destroyed,” Rommel wrote.

Patronis later tweeted pictures of the destroyed house.

“This is the house [Rommel] pointed out yesterday that caught fire from an EV. Burned to the ground. Caught the neighbor’s house on fire too,” he wrote on Tuesday.

This is the house @bob_rommel pointed out yesterday that caught fire from an EV. Burned to the ground. Caught the neighbor’s house on fire too. We’re forwarding this information to @NHTSAgov.

“Electric vehicles are catching on fire due to electrical system failure caused by saltwater storm surge from Hurricane Ian, catching homes on fire, endangering first responders and FL families. I’m calling on EV companies to partner with us to find solutions. We must take action,” Patronis tweeted.

In a video Patronis shared along with those comments, firefighters can be seen fighting a Tesla fire. A woman is heard saying that the firefighters had already dumped 1,500 gallons of water on the car, but the fire just kept burning.

Patronis pointed out in another tweet that “if an EV catches fire, there’s not a lot fire teams can do. The second you stop dousing an EV with water, it flames up again.”

If an EV catches fire, there’s not a lot fire teams can do. The second you stop dousing an EV with water, it flames up again.

How many are compromised? https://t.co/EnPfYadLnb — Jimmy Patronis (@JimmyPatronis) October 11, 2022

Last week, Patronis wrote a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ask for more information about the risks to EVs from saltwater damage.

“On October 6th, I joined North Collier Fire Rescue to assess response activities related to Hurricane Ian and saw with my own eyes an EV continuously ignite, and continually reignite, as fireteams doused the vehicle with tens-of-thousands of gallons of water,” Patronis wrote.

“Subsequently, I was informed by the fire department that the vehicle, once again reignited when it was loaded onto the tow truck. Based on my conversations with area firefighters, this is not an isolated incident. As you can appreciate, I am very concerned that we may have a ticking time bomb on our hands.”

As Patronis has pointed out, EV fires are notoriously hard to put out due to their lithium-ion batteries. Bloomberg noted that this is one of the major obstacles facing EV adoption.

The technological advancements of electric vehicles are amazing. But there are still a lot of kinks to work out.

“Lithium-ion is a technology that has really been a revolutionary advance for us as a society. … I think there are some surprises about some of the challenges that we are going through,” Haresh Kamath of the Electric Power Research Institute told Bloomberg.

Kamath noted that although battery fires are not frequent, “in rare cases when you have a problem — it’s very dramatic.”

EVs are getting more popular and, one day, maybe they will completely take over the auto industry.

But it’s important to remember that there are still a lot of problems to overcome and technology has to keep advancing to develop safe and effective EVs.

This doesn’t spell doom for the EV industry. It’s simply a serious growing pain.

It’s all part of technological evolution. But in the midst of that evolution, consumers need to be aware of the risks.

311,Explained: How Americans In Chinese Tech Firms Might Have To Choose Between US Citizenship And Job - Outlook India,https://imgnew.outlookindia.com/uploadimage/library/16_9/16_9_5/Depositphotos_7331896_S_1642210441.jpg?utm_source=fb,15/10/2022,"The Joe Biden administration has further tightened technology export to Chinese technology industry, targeting semiconductor industry in the latest rules announced this month.",https://www.outlookindia.com/international/explained-how-americans-in-chinese-tech-firms-might-have-to-choose-between-us-citizenship-and-job-news-230218,"Under the latest US technology export rules, US citizens working in Chinese firms might face a tough choice — quit their jobs or risk losing US citizenship.

The latest tech export rules by the Joe Biden administration are an attempt to further regulate the flow of technological know-how from the United States to China and to affect the Chinese ability to produce semiconductors —commonly called chips— which are the bedrock of modern electronic industry and are used in everything from our personal computers to electric vehicles and high-end military technology.

Coupled with increased funding for domestic chip production, Biden's latest tech export rules are an attempt to wean the United States and the world off Chinese techonology and target its manufacturing base.

Here we explain what are the latest US tech export control measures, how US executives in Chinese firms could be impacted, and what Biden aims with it.

What are latest US tech control rules?

The latest tech export control rules announced by the Biden administration not just target companies but also target individuals.

Under these rules, companies would require licenses to export sensitive technology to China-based entities.

The Verge reported, ""The new rules require manufacturers, like Intel and Micron, to receive a license from the Commerce Department in order to export semiconductors and chip-making equipment to Chinese companies. In addition, the administration issued several foreign direct product rules, banning international companies from exporting chips built with US technology.""

The total size of the chip-based industry that might see substantial disruption with the rules is around $550 billion.

Bloomberg lists the following measures announced by Biden administration:

1. Ban on sending chips for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing and gear for chip production to China.

These restrictions are ""intended to sever the flow of US know-how to China's military and surveillance systems"", notes Bloomberg, which adds, ""China’s AI chipmakers, including Biren, may face some restrictions on outsourcing production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).""

2. Chip-making gear restrictions covering production of both logic and memory chips.

Bloomberg explains, ""Logic chips using so-called nonplanar transistors made with 16-nanometer technology or anything more advanced than that. Generally speaking, the smaller the nanometers, the more capable the chip...Foreign companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. can apply for licenses to continue acquiring machinery they need for their plants in China.""

3. Rules also effectively prohibit US persons from ""supporting"" the development or manufacture of chips covered by the restrictions.

It is this rule that puts US nationals in Chinese chip-related companies in a difficult spot.

4. The rules expand Unverified List that acts as a precursor to the Entity List, which bans exports of US designs and technology to entities such as Huawei.

US nationals in Chinese firms in tough spot

Under latest tech export control rules, American citizens are permanent citizens are barred from supporting the development and production of advanced chips at Chinese factories, according to Fortune, which adds that such a norm was earlier only applicable on companies.

The effect of this rule is already being felt as companies have started taking Americans off chip development and production.

The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that there are dozens of chief-level executives that are covered under this rule.

""Most of these executives are naturalised citizens who were born in China and studied at American universities or worked in the US chip industry,"" reported SCMP. It further reported that top Chinese chip company Naura Technology Group has asked its American executives to stop working on chip research and development (R&D).

Effects of the rule are being felt outside China too. Bloomberg reported that Netherlands-based ASML Holding, which manufactures critical chipmaking equipment, told its US-based staff on Wednesday to halt all engagement with China.

Why US is squeezing tech export to China?

The basic idea is to not allow China to benefit from the US technology and expertise.

Moreover, China has in recent decades emerged as the manufacturing hub, which means that it uses technology developed outside to manufacture products for the world. It is also accused of great theft of R&D progress and intellectual property (IP).

Biden is working on to make United States the hub of chip production. This also becomes important as repeated lockdowns in China under its Zero Covid policy means that international supply of chips is at the risk of frequent disruption. Great reliance on China has made the world aware of supply line crises during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

Earlier this year, the US Congress passed a bill, which Biden signed into law, which aims to boost domestic chip production.

""In August, President Joe Biden signed the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act, providing $52 billion in subsidies to boost companies choosing to build chip manufacturing plants in the US,"" reported The Verge.",electric vehicles,outlook india
312,3 Dividend Champions With Yields Well Above 3%,http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/08e61a62-b80e-11e7-8ef6-b791ad60a287.png,15/10/2022,3 Dividend Champions With Yields Well Above 3%...KMB,https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/3-dividend-champions-with-yields-well-above-3--16105456,"Companies with long track records of dividend growth are among our favorite to own as these names have proven business models that hold up better in recessionary environments.

This is especially true for the Dividend Champions, those companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth. These companies have successfully navigated multiple recessions and still raised their dividends, making them ideal candidates for investment for those looking to create a strong portfolio.

Here, we'll look at three high-quality Dividend Champions that have yields of up to ~4%, including:

Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB)

Matthews International Corp. (MATW)

Old Republic International Corp. (ORI)

3 Dividend Champions with Yields Above 3%

Kimberly-Clark

The first name to discuss is Kimberly-Clark, a leading consumer products company that is valued at more than $38 billion. The company generates annual revenue in excess of $19 billion.

Kimberly-Clark is a global leader in its industry, with operations in 175 countries around the world. The company operates three segments, including Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, and K-C Professional. The Personal Care segment sells well-known brands such as Huggies, Pull-Ups, Depend, Poise, and Kotex while Consumer Tissue offers Kleenex, Scott, and Cottonelle. K-C Professional sells workplace health and safety products, such as apparel, wipers, soaps, and sanitizers.

The company's products have long been trusted by consumers, which is why Kimberly-Clark holds the top or second spot in market share in many of the categories that it competes. It is because of this industry leadership that the company has effectively used price increases to largely offset inflationary pressures. Consumers have been more willing to pay up for top brands. In addition, the company is also seeking cumulative savings of $1.5 billion over the next three years as it aims to slim down its operations.

To help maintain its leadership position, Kimberly-Clark often brings extensions of product lines to market to capitalize on the popularity of its brands. The company is also making more of an effort to gain market share in regions where its not the top name. This includes developing and emerging markets such as China and Latin America. This is an important aspect of the business model as organic growth in developing and emerging markets typically runs ahead of company-wide results.

Kimberly-Clark's leadership position in its industry has put the company in a position to pay and raise its dividend for 50 consecutive years. This qualifies the company as a Dividend King, of which there are just 45 names in the market place. The dividend has a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.9% since 2012, though that growth has slowed slightly in recent years.

The shares yield 4.1%.

Matthews International

The next name to consider is Matthews International, a personal services company that generates annual revenue of $1.7 billion.

Matthews International provides brand solutions, memorialization products, and industrial technologies around the world. The company has three reportable segments, including SGK Brand Solutions, which markets brand development services, printing equipment, embossing tools, and creative design services to customers in the consumer-packaged goods and packaging industries. The Memorialization business sells memorials, caskets and cremation equipment to funeral homes, and the Industrial segment offers coding and automation solutions.

Memorialization and SGK Brand Solutions are the two largest businesses within the company, contributing 46% and 43%, respectively, revenue for fiscal year 2021. The company is very diversified in its product offerings, which helps it to successfully navigate impairments to any one area the business.

The company is actively looking to expand its footprint, which currently consists of operations in 26 countries, though most revenue comes from the U.S. This includes Matthews International's recently completed $45 million purchase of two German engineering firms that improve the company's positioning in the area of electric vehicles and industrial automation.

With a market capitalization of just $722 million, Matthews International proves that Dividend Champions can come in all sizes. Despite its size and cyclical nature of its business, the company has increased its dividend for 28 years. The dividend CAGR is almost 10% over the last decade and the shares yield 3.7%.

Old Republic

Finally, the last Dividend Champion to discuss is Old Republic, an insurance company that provides products to customers of all sizes. The $7 billion company has produced revenue of $8.8 billion over the last year.

Old Republic's primarily competitive advantage is that it sells a wide variety of insurance products through its different segments. First, General Insurance is responsible for marking, underwriting, and managing property and underwriting insurance. Title Insurance issues policies to real estate purchasers and investors. In total, Old Republic's insurance products address needs for insurance in the areas of automobile, marine, travel, financial indemnity, and others.

The diversified business model helps provide balance for Old Republic. For example, revenue for Title Insurance fell more than 7% in the prior quarter as mortgage refinancing was down considerably as interest rates have greatly increased. This was offset by solid growth in the general insurance business

Despite this drop in revenue from what had been a very lucrative business, Old Republic underwriting endeavors have remained very profitable. As of the most recent quarter, the company had a general insurance combined ratio of 90.9% and a title insurance combined ratio of 91.4%. These ratios show that Old Republic is generating healthy profits from its activities.

The ability to continue to remain profitable even in the face of strong headwinds is a major reason why Old Republic has a very long track record of raising its distributions. Dividend growth hasn't been exceptional over the last decade as the company's CAGR is slightly more than 2% for the period, but Old Republic's dividend growth streak stands at 41 years.

The stock offers a yield of 4%.

Final Thoughts

Dividend Champions can come in a wide variety of sizes and from different sectors of the economy, but they all have one thing in common: strong business models. Kimberly-Clark, Matthews International, and Old Republic are among the leaders in their respective industries. This has allowed each company to compile dividend growth streaks that are at least a quarter-century long. In the case of Kimberly-Clark, the dividend growth streak is at a half-century.

While nothing is guaranteed in investing, the ability to grow dividends through multiple recessions speaks to the strength of each company and likely means that the next economic downturn won't impair these names' ability to continue to raise payments to shareholders. Even better, each stock offers a very generous yield, making all three stocks a good choice for investors looking for safe high yields.",electric vehicles,thestreet

The figures for the third quarter, along with a salvo of other economic indicators, will be unveiled in the middle of the week-long political meeting that is expected to grant President Xi Jinping a historic third term in charge.

A group of experts interviewed by AFP said they expected an average GDP increase of 2.5 percent on last year's July-September quarter.

In the previous quarter, growth in the world's second largest economy collapsed to only 0.4 percent compared to the previous year, the worst performance since 2020. The country posted 4.8 percent growth in the first quarter of 2022.

Many economists think China will struggle to attain its growth target this year of around 5.5 percent, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its GDP growth forecast to 3.2 percent for 2022 and 4.4 percent for 2023.

AFP's panel of experts predicted average growth of three percent in 2022, a long way off the 8.1 percent seen in 2021.

That would be China's weakest growth rate in four decades, excluding 2020 when the global economy was hammered by the emergence of the coronavirus.

""The big policy challenge is accepting that the economy has reached a state of maturity that means growth numbers are likely permanently reset to the zero to 4.5 percent range for the coming decade,"" Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, told AFP.

- Zero-Covid -

Another factor that has had an enormous impact is Beijing's zero-Covid policy.

China is the last of the world's major economies to continue to follow the strategy, which imposes tight travel restrictions, mass PCR testing and obligatory quarantines.

It also involves sudden and strict lockdowns -- including of businesses and factories -- which has disrupted production and weighed heavily on household consumption.

Story continues

But despite the impact on the economy, ""there is no clear sign of a significant easing of the zero-Covid strategy"", Nomura's Ting Lu said, noting that so far the opposite had happened.

In the week leading up to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Congress, state media have published multiple editorials warning the policy should not be relaxed, and officials have pounced on outbreaks across the country over the last week with increased curbs.

Some lockdown restrictions have returned to major financial hub Shanghai, prompting some to fear a repeat of earlier this year when the city was shut down for two months.

Meanwhile, China is also battling an unprecedented crisis in its real estate sector -- historically a driver of growth in the economy and representative of more than a quarter of the country's GDP when combined with construction.

Following years of explosive growth fuelled by easy access to loans, Chinese authorities launched a crackdown on excessive debt in 2020.

Property sales are now falling across the country, leaving many developers struggling and some owners refusing to pay their mortgages for unfinished homes.

- 'Modern economy' -

Despite the problems, ""many economic indicators have actually recovered reasonably well from the mass lockdowns of March and April"", according to analyst Thomas Gatley from Gavekal Dragonomics.

Car sales held strong in September, driven by strong demand for electric clean vehicles.

August exports increased by 7.1 percent compared to the previous year, and Beijing has invested in infrastructure to support activity.

However, ""those pillars of growth are becoming more fragile"", Gatley said.

And ""the Chinese economy faces more fundamental problems"" of transformation, sinologist Jean-Louis Rocca told AFP.

After decades of growth fueled by investment and exports, he said China ""no longer wants to be 'the world's factory'"" -- instead it aspires to be a ""modern economy"", geared towards new technology and consumption -- and the transition is still ongoing.

Another worry for the CCP, which draws a large part of its political legitimacy from its economic success, is that this type of modern economy does not create very many jobs, Rocca said -- which has serious implications for China's growing middle class.

The jury found Milton guilty on one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud after deliberating for around five hours. Milton was acquitted on an additional count of securities fraud.

During the trial in federal court in Manhattan, prosecutors depicted Milton, 40, as a “con man” who sought to deceive investors about the electric- and hydrogen-powered truck maker’s technology starting in November 2019.

Milton, wearing a blue suit and green tie, shook his head as the jurors confirmed their verdict. His attorney said he will file court papers challenging the verdict.

Milton, of Oakley, Utah, was indicted in July 2021. He left Nikola in September 2020 after a report by short seller Hindenburg Research called the company a “fraud.”

Prosecutors accused Milton of using social media and interviews on television, podcasts and in print to make false and misleading claims about Nikola’s trucks and technology.

They said Milton’s improper statements included that Nikola built an electric- and hydrogen-powered “Badger” pickup from the “ground up,” developed batteries in-house that he knew it was purchasing elsewhere and had early success in creating a “Nikola One” semi-truck he knew did not work.

Milton’s statements about Nikola came as the company joined the mounting number of tech and EV companies going public through special purpose acquisition vehicles or SPACs. He also was accused of defrauding the seller of a Utah ranch, who accepted Nikola stock options as part of the purchase price based on Milton’s claims about the company.

The defense and the prosecution delivered closing arguments to the jury on Thursday in a trial that began on Sept. 13. The prosecution said Milton was obsessed with the company’s stock price and made the statements to inflate it and his own net worth. The defense said prosecutors had distorted Milton’s statements about Nikola’s plans to shake up the automotive industry.

Sentencing for Milton was set for Jan. 27.",electric vehicles,new york post

The company said it has not recorded any breakdowns or complaints from customers about the sensor errors.

VinFast, which ceased gasoline-powered car production in August, is gearing up to expand in the U.S. market, where it hopes to compete with legacy automakers and deliver its first batch of 5,000 all-electric sport utility vehicles in November.

The company has registered almost 65,000 reservations globally, and it expects to sell 750,000 EVs per year by 2026, starting with the VF8 and VF9 all-electric SUVs.

In March, VinFast said it would build a production plant in North Carolina with an initial projected capacity of 150,000 EVs a year. It tapped banks in July to raise least $4 billion in funding for the project.

Now, before we get all gaga over this news, a couple of important caveats are in order.

First, Credit Suisse is having some problems lately, including a possible criminal investigation in America and probe by the US Congress, according to Bloomberg News (paywall). Second, although this story is all over Twitter and has been picked up by The Atlantic, no one has provided an actual link to the Credit Suisse report. A diligent Google search by yours truly failed to discover one. But Robinson Meyer of The Atlantic seems to have read it and here’s what he has to say.

“Late last month, analysts at the investment bank Credit Suisse published a research note about America’s new climate law that went nearly unnoticed. The Inflation Reduction Act, the bank argued, is even more important than has been recognized so far: The IRA will ‘will have a profound effect across industries in the next decade and beyond’ and could ultimately shape the direction of the American economy, the bank said. The report shows how even after the bonanza of climate-bill coverage earlier this year, we’re still only beginning to understand how the law works and what it might mean for the economy.

“The report made a few broad points in particular that are worth attending to. First, the IRA might spend twice as much as Congress thinks. Many of the IRA’s most important provisions, such as its incentives for electric vehicles and zero-carbon electricity, are ‘uncapped’ tax credits. That means that as long as you meet their terms, the government will award them. There’s no budget or limit written into the law that restricts how much the government can spend. The widely cited figure for how much the IRA will spend to fight climate change — $374 billion — is in large part determined by the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of how much those tax credits will get used.

“But that estimate is wrong, the bank claims. In fact, so many people and businesses will use those tax credits that the IRA’s total spending is likely to be more than $800 billion, double what the CBO projects. And because federal spending tends to catalyze private investment, that could send total climate spending across the economy to roughly $1.7 trillion over the next 10 years. That’s significantly more money flowing into green-energy industries than the CBO projected, though it’s unclear if that additional money will lead to more carbon reductions than earlier analyses have projected.

“Second, the U.S. is ‘poised to become the world’s leading energy provider,’ according to the bank. America is already the world’s largest producer of oil and natural gas. The IRA could further enhance its advantage in all forms of energy production, giving it a ‘competitive advantage in low-cost clean electricity and hydrogen production, infrastructure, geologic storage, and human capital,’ the report states. By 2029, U.S. solar and wind could be the cheapest in the world at less than $5 per megawatt-hour, the bank projects. It will also become competitive in hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and wind turbines.

Credit Suisse also thought about what might happen if reactionaries and fossil fuel apologists win control of the White House or Congress. They don’t think there’s much of a chance the IRA would be repealed because “Republican-leaning states are likely to see the most investment, job, and economic benefits from the IRA.” That seems like specious reasoning, since people vote against their own best interests all the time.

If there is a stumbling block ahead for the IRA, it is building out America’s energy infrastructure. Powerful business groups are already lobbying to revise the most transmission-friendly sections of the IRA, Credit Suisse says.

The Opportunity Is Huge

Meyer writes that clean energy is now the safe, smart, government-backed bet for conservative investors. It’s really a shocking reversal of the past 40 years. It is such a change that it hasn’t yet been metabolized by the world of people involved in the issue. Then he offers some predictions of his own.

1. The number of Americans working in a climate-relevant industry is going to explode. It is going to undergo what you might call a techification. The opportunity will be too large, the money too persuasive, the problems too intriguing.

2. Managing climate change is a legitimately difficult technical and cultural problem — it’s going to require as many attentive and enthusiastic brains as possible. If you don’t yet work in the industry, but have always cared about climate change as an issue, this is your moment to get involved. These companies are going to need engineers, programmers, accountants, marketers, HR staff, general counsels — there is space for everyone now.

“The fight against climate change is going to change more in the next four years than it has in the past 40. The great story of our lives is just beginning. Welcome aboard,” he concludes.

Others Are Piling Into Renewable Energy

This is once again a 'thanks Putin' moment. The government proposed this plan back in August as a response to high energy prices and the geopolitical risk of being dependent on others for power — Sam Morgan (@SamJamesMorgan) October 12, 2022

In Europe, most countries are racing to show Putin they can get along without cheap Russian gas. Estonia is the latest example. Late last month, its government approved a plan to use only electricity from renewables by 2030. But there’s more to the story. Estonia’s current goal is for 42% of its electricity to come from wind or solar by 2030. That target will now be raised dramatically and the 40% target is moved ahead to 2025.

The rest will come from burning biomass — trees and wood products. This is a topic that is fraught with controversy. While it is arguably better than burning coal or unnatural gas, it still produces carbon emissions, unlike wind and solar, which generate none. According to ERR News, the government has recently issued a tender for 540 GWh of renewable energy generation, with much more in the pipeline.

“Clearly, the current high electricity prices are due to a lack of generation capacity. High fossil fuel prices and a lack of generating capacity have put all consumers in a precarious situation, which must be dealt with immediately,” Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Riina Sikkut (SDE) said on Thursday.

“Fortunately, these market signals have prompted companies to make investment decisions to increase renewable energy generation capacity, and the state is doing everything it can to support these efforts. In this climate, it is critical that the government sends a clear signal to encourage investment: by 2030, all of the electricity we consume must be generated from renewable sources,” the minister added.

The Takeaway

We are all witnesses to a tipping point in human history. There is a giant nuclear reactor in the sky that supplies all the energy the Earth needs to meet its needs. All we have to do is harvest it. (Winds are also a product of the energy we get from the sun.) Some may quibble that the US should not be telling the rest of the world what to do and there is merit to that argument, but nevertheless, it does have an outsized influence on other nations.

The Inflation Reduction Act will have knock-on effects that will reverberate around the world, particularly in countries ruled by tyrants like Russia (and China and Saudi Arabia as well). Even if you don’t like the idea of renewable energy, most of us would be happy to see the influence of those countries diminished as the demand for fossil fuels withers away. The clean energy revolution has begun in earnest. There can be no turning back now.

Tata Power Company Limited had a cyberattack on its IT infrastructure impacting some of its IT systems, a BSE filing from the Mumbai-headquartered company said.

The company has taken steps to retrieve and restore the systems, it informed.

All critical operational systems are functioning; however, as a measure of abundant precaution, restricted access and preventive checks have been put in place for employee and customer facing portals and touch points, it added.

A senior official from the Maharashtra Police's cyber wing said an intelligence input had been received about threat to Tata Power and other electricity companies.

All the concerned companies have been alerted, the official said, adding that an audit and check of firewalls is underway.

Meanwhile, earlier this year, Tata Power had announced partnerships with Kolte-Patil Developers and Hyundai to set up e-charging stations and electric vehicle infrastructure across the country. Tata Power partnered with Kolte-Patil Developers Limited (KPDL), a real estate company, to set up e-charging stations across its projects in Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru for convenience of electric vehicle owners. As part of the wider green mobility adoption, EVs and the charging infrastructure play a key role to mitigate climate change challenges in the urban mobility space, Tata Power had said in a statement.

Hyundai Motor India, in May this year, said it had joined hands with Tata Power to set up fast charging electric vehicle infrastructure across its select dealerships in the country. Under the collaboration, 60kW DC charging stations will be installed at the company's 34 EV dealerships in 29 cities to cater to all kinds of electric vehicles through Hyundai and Tata Power EZ Charge mobile app. Hyundai would facilitate, through its dealerships, space and necessary administrative approvals, while Tata Power would operate and maintain the charging stations.

Vintage car lover David Tomlinson wonders what the future may bring for old cars.

Rotorua Vintage and Veteran Car Club chairman David Tomlinson is working hard to ensure a future for historic cars.

""We've got to find somewhere to move our cars on to so another generation looks after them and keeps them going.""

Tomlinson is particularly concerned that new mechanical apprentices aren't being taught how to maintain older vehicles.

""People who are going to polytech to learn how to fix cars are being taught how to fix modern cars. Really we need more people to be trained to fix old cars.""

But Academic Leader of Mechanics at Toi Ohomai, Joe Nathan is certain the future is in safe hands.

""Traditional mechanics will still be here,"" he said.

""It's only the engine that's electric. The rest of it is still a car.""

Both men have their own future predictions. For Nathan, it is geared to new technology, specifically hydrogen engines.

""It's the next thing that everyone's putting technology into. Probably even more than EV at the moment.""

But for Tomlinson the future still lies in the past. He predicts that Japanese cars will be the next vintage craze.

""They've been so spurned and looked down on by car aficionados over the years, I think we're coming up to that age where Japanese cars are going to be more and more popular.""",electric vehicles,new zealand herald

Nearby, a group of Ukrainian deminers with the country’s territorial defence forces worked to clear the area of dozens of other deadly mines and unexploded ordnance – a push to restore a semblance of safety to the cities, towns and countryside in a region that spent months under Russian occupation.

The deminers, part of the 113th Kharkiv Defence Brigade of Ukraine’s territorial defence forces, walked deep into fallow agricultural lands along a muddy road between fields of dead sunflowers overgrown with high weeds.

Two soldiers, each with a metal detector in hand, slowly advanced up the road, scanning the ground and waiting for the devices to give a signal.

When one detector emitted a high tone, a soldier knelt to inspect the mud and grass, probing it with a metal rod to see what might be buried just below the surface.

The detector’s hit could indicate a spent shell casing, a piece of rusting iron or a discarded aluminium can. Or, it could be an active land mine.

Oleksii Dokuchaev, the commander of the demining brigade based in the eastern Kharkiv region, said hundreds of mines have already been discharged in the area around the village of Hrakove where they were working, but that the danger of mines across Ukraine will persist for years to come.

“One year of war equals 10 years of demining,” he said. “Even now we are still finding munitions from the Second World War, and in this war they’re being planted left and right.”

Russian forces hastily fled the Kharkiv region in early September after a rapid counter-offensive by Ukraine’s military retook hundreds of square miles of territory following months of Russian occupation.

While many settlements in the region have finally achieved some measure of safety after fierce battles reduced many of them to rubble, Russian land mines remain an ever-present threat in both urban and rural environments.

Small red signs bearing a white skull and crossbones line many of the roads in the Kharkiv region, warning of the danger of mines just off the pavement. Yet sometimes, desperation drives local residents into the minefields.

The local man whose body lay near the abandoned Russian camp was likely searching for food left behind by the invading soldiers, Mr Dokuchaev said, an additional danger posed by the hunger experienced by many in Ukraine’s devastated regions.

The use of the kind of tripwire land mines which killed him is prohibited under the 1997 Ottawa Treaty – of which Russia is not a signatory – which regulates the use of anti-personnel land mines, he said.

“There are rules of war. The Ottawa Convention says that it’s forbidden to place mines or any other munitions with tripwires. But Russians ignore it,” he said.

The deminers had cleared the road of anti-personnel mines the previous day, allowing them to search for anti-tank mines hidden beneath the ground that could destroy any vehicles driving over them.

They hope to bring vehicles deep enough into the area to retrieve an abandoned Russian armoured personnel carrier, the engine of which they plan to salvage. A vehicle would also need to be brought in by local police to retrieve the body.

The deminers reached the abandoned camp, set in a grove of trees and strewn with the remains of the months the Russian soldiers had spent there: rotting food rations in wooden ammunition boxes, strings of high-calibre bullets, a stack of yellowing Russian newspapers, and trenches filled with refuse.

After a thorough scan of the area, the servicemen recovered two Soviet-made TM-62 anti-tank mines and six pneumatically armed fuses and placed them in a depression on the edge of the camp, taped into a bundle along with 400 grams of TNT.

Mr Dokuchaev placed an electric detonator into the explosive charge and connected it to a long length of wire before taking cover with his men at a distance of more than 100 metres.

When the charge was detonated – something the servicemen laughingly called “bada-boom” – the immense blast ripped through the air, causing a cascade of autumn leaves to fall from the surrounding trees and emitting a tall plume of smoke.

After the mines had been destroyed, Mr Dokuchaev – a former photographer who enlisted with the territorial defence forces after the outbreak of war – said the work his brigade is doing is essential to keep civilians safe as they pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.

Despite the dangers, he said, he enjoys his work.

“I don’t know what I’ll do after our victory,” Mr Dokuchaev said. “Life is boring without explosions.”",electric vehicles,independent.ie

By

LtCol Brent Stricker[i]

After withdrawing from much of the territory it occupied in Kharkov Oblast, the Russian military has turned to a new strategy of attacking civilian infrastructure, such as the power grid and dams. On September 14, 2022, Russian Aerospace Forces attacked the Karachunivske dam at Kyvyi Rih, the hometown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Evidence from various Telegram Channels show that water flow to the city has ceased, forcing civilians to purchase bottled water. Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Minister tweeted, “Rockets were directed at hydraulic structures. This caused water level of Inhulets river to increase, threatening the city.” Russia conducted a second attack with ballistic missiles on the Pechenihy dam on the Siverskiy Donets river on September 24. These attacks on civilian objects are controversial because they may violate the law of armed conflict.

The relevant law applicable to the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine is Additional Protocol I, to which both states are Parties. Articles 48 and 52 of Additional Protocol I describe the principle of distinction between valid military targets and protected civilians and civilian objects. Article 48 notes that military operations should only be directed against military objectives. Article 52(1) notes “civilian objects shall not be the object of attack.” Article 52(2) goes on to define military objectives as being “limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”

The United States would view these actions under customary international law (CIL) since it is not a signatory to AP I. The U.S. statement on CIL appears in publications like the DOD Law of War Manual and the Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Land Warfare (Commander’s Handbook). Both publications express a similar definition to AP I on distinction between military objects and protected civilians and civilian objects (here, and here).

Can the Ukrainian power grid be considered a military object whose destruction or degradation confers a military advantage to Russia? The DOD Law of War Manual notes “electric power stations are generally recognized to be of sufficient importance to a State’s capacity to meet its wartime needs of communication, transport, and industry so as usually to qualify as a military objective during armed conflicts.” The Ukrainian power grid is certainly assisting Ukraine’s capacity to meets its wartime needs, in particular its support to the transportation system.

In the present case, Russian strategists may hope Ukrainian success in the North may sow its failure in the South. Having completed its Kharkov Offensive, Ukraine will need to turn its attention either east to the Donbass or south toward Kherson and Zaporizhzya Oblasts. This requires the movement of its armored units south or east, and the most efficient way of moving armored vehicles is by rail. Attacking the power grid disrupts the rail network, thereby impeding the movement of armored forces south or east and delaying another offensive by Ukraine. This allows time for Russian forces to withdraw from Kharkov to be redeployed, and more importantly, for fortifications in Kherson and Zaporizhyzya to be strengthened. The Ukrainian power grid is therefore a valid military object whose destruction or degradation would confer a military advantage to Russia and allied forces.

Similarly, is there a military advantage to be gained by attacking a dam and causing flooding along the Inhulets and Siverskiy Donets rivers? Ukrainian forces are continuing their efforts in Kherson and Donbass and are using bridges, to include pontoon bridges, to cross these rivers. The attack on the Karachunivske dam has caused the Inhulets river to rise, risking damage or destruction of these crossings. The attack on the Pechenihy dam is believed to have been intended to cause similar damage to crossings on the Siverskiy Donets river. By attacking the dams, the Russians have created a water barrier that could trap Ukrainian forces on the wrong side of the river, thereby preventing Ukraine from re-supplying its forces and continuing its offensive operations.

If the dams are valid military targets, one must consider whether the affects upon the civilian population violates the principle of proportionality. Article 51(5)(b) of AP I prohibits indiscriminate attacks where the expected “incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof [are] excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.” This prohibition is repeated in Article 57(2)(b) requiring precautions in the attack. Under CIL, as stated in U.S. doctrine, belligerents are required to conduct a proportionality analysis of the effects of an attack and the risk of damage to civilians or civilian objects. This risk must not be excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained from the attack.

A proportionality analysis of the Russian strikes on the Ukrainian electric grid is not difficult due to the widespread nature of the disruption. If this had occurred in winter, the Russian attacks could have led to thousands of deaths due to exposure with urban areas in particular having difficulty heating homes since these rely on centralized district heating systems that needs electricity to function. Rural homes in Ukraine, Russia, and other former Soviet states are typically heated using a fire burning stove, known as a Russian Stove. As long as there is fuel to burn, these homes will be warm. Fortunately, this attack did not occur in winter. Damage to the power grid has not been permanent. If it had and the attack occurred in winter, the risk to the urban civilian population would make this attack’s effects disproportionate.

A proportionality analysis of the attack on a facility that contains dangerous forces is complicated due to the contrast between U.S. CIL and AP I. Examples of such facilities besides dams are nuclear power plants and facilities producing weapons of mass destruction. Articles 55 and 56 of AP I tend to prohibit attacking dams. Article 55 prohibits attacks that “are intended or may be expected to cause such damage to the natural environment and thereby to prejudice the health or survival of the population.” Article 56(1) has a more specific prohibition on attacking dams and similar installations stating they should not be attacked “even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.” Article 56(2)(a) has a very narrow exception allowing dams to be attacked if they are being “used for other than its normal function and in regular significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support.”

The US interpretation of CIL regarding attacking dams or similar facilities is much more permissive than AP I. The Commander’s Handbook states “the fact that materials or forces contained within a military objective may be released as a result of the attack does not immunize it from attack.” The Commanders Handbook permits dams and similar facilities to be attacked so long as they are a valid military object and the attack employs additional precautions to minimize the release of dangerous forces it contains to stay within the bounds of proportionality.

The extent of the flooding damage caused by these attacks has not yet been fully assessed. It is likely that this flooding could result in deaths, destruction of civilian objects, and environmental pollution. There is no evidence showing the dams were not in normal use and were providing “regular, significant and direct support of military operations” allowing the AP I Article 56(2)(a) exception for attack. Under US interpretation of CIL, a limited breech of the dam with limited flooding to provide a temporary water barrier and disruption of river crossings might meet the proportionality restrictions of incidental and collateral damage to civilians and civilian objects. The attack on the dam is a clear violation of AP I, but may be permissible under US interpretation of CIL.

The conflict in Ukraine continues to provide examples of alleged violations of the law of armed conflict. Civilians are always at risk in an armed conflict, but as the seasons change and General Winter enters the conflict, hopefully both sides will take precautions in similar attacks on public utilities like water and power.",electric vehicles,smallwarsjournal.com

HRAKOVE, Ukraine -- Beside an abandoned Russian military camp in eastern Ukraine, the body of a man lay decomposing in the grass — a civilian who had fallen victim to a tripwire land mine set by retreating Russian forces.

Nearby, a group of Ukrainian deminers with the country's territorial defense forces worked to clear the area of dozens of other deadly mines and unexploded ordnance — a push to restore a semblance of safety to the cities, towns and countryside in a region that spent months under Russian occupation.

The deminers, part of the 113th Kharkiv Defense Brigade of Ukraine's territorial defense forces, walked deep into fallow agricultural lands on Thursday along a muddy road between fields of dead sunflowers overgrown with high weeds.

Two soldiers, each with a metal detector in hand, slowly advanced up the road, scanning the ground and waiting for the devices to give a signal. When one detector emitted a high tone, a soldier knelt to inspect the mud and grass, probing it with a metal rod to see what might be buried just below the surface.

The detector's hit could indicate a spent shell casing, a piece of rusting iron or a discarded aluminum can. Or, it could be an active land mine.

Oleksii Dokuchaev, the commander of the demining brigade based in the eastern Kharkiv region, said that hundreds of mines have already been discharged in the area around the village of Hrakove where they were working, but that the danger of mines across Ukraine will persist for years to come.

“One year of war equals 10 years of demining,” Dokuchaev said. “Even now we are still finding munitions from World War II, and in this war they're being planted left and right.”

Russian forces hastily fled the Kharkiv region in early September after a rapid counteroffensive by Ukraine's military retook hundreds of square miles of territory following months of Russian occupation.

While many settlements in the region have finally achieved some measure of safety after fierce battles reduced many of them to rubble, Russian land mines remain an ever-present threat in both urban and rural environments.

Small red signs bearing a white skull and crossbones line many of the roads in the Kharkiv region, warning of the danger of mines just off the pavement. Yet sometimes, desperation drives local residents into the minefields.

The local man whose body lay near the abandoned Russian camp was likely searching for food left behind by the invading soldiers, Dokuchaev said, an additional danger posed by the hunger experienced by many in Ukraine's devastated regions.

The use of the kind of tripwire land mines which killed him is prohibited under the 1997 Ottawa Treaty — of which Russia is not a signatory — which regulates the use of anti-personnel land mines, he said.

“There are rules of war. The Ottawa Convention says that it’s forbidden to place mines or any other munitions with tripwires. But Russians ignore it,” he said.

The deminers had cleared the road of anti-personnel mines the previous day, allowing them to search for anti-tank mines hidden beneath the ground that could destroy any vehicles driving over them.

They hoped to bring vehicles deep enough into the area to retrieve an abandoned Russian armored personnel carrier, the engine of which they planned to salvage. A vehicle would also need to be brought in by local police to retrieve the body.

The deminers reached the abandoned camp, set in a grove of trees and strewn with the remains of the months the Russian soldiers had spent there: rotting food rations in wooden ammunition boxes, strings of high-caliber bullets, a stack of yellowing Russian newspapers and trenches filled with refuse.

After a thorough scan of the area, the servicemen recovered two Soviet-made TM-62 anti-tank mines and six pneumatically armed fuses and placed them in a depression on the edge of the camp, taped into a bundle along with 400 grams of TNT.

Dokuchaev placed an electric detonator into the explosive charge and connected it to a long length of wire before taking cover with his men at a distance of more than 100 meters (yards).

When the charge was detonated — something the servicemen laughingly called “bada-boom” — the immense blast ripped through the air, causing a cascade of autumn leaves to fall from the surrounding trees and emitting a tall plume of gray smoke.

After the mines had been destroyed, Dokuchaev — a former photographer who enlisted with the territorial defense forces after the outbreak of war — said the work his brigade is doing is essential to keep civilians safe as they pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.

Despite the dangers, he said, he enjoys his work.

“I don't know what I'll do after our victory,” Dokuchaev said. “Life is boring without explosions.”

329,The new EV tax credits explained,https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/10/electric-vehicle.jpg?w=1280,15/10/2022,The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 revises electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid tax Incentives.,https://wgntv.com/news/the-new-ev-tax-credits-explained/,"(iSeeCars) – Most consumers know there are various electric vehicle tax credits available if they buy a new electric vehicle. The original credit, officially known as the “Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit”, was instituted over a decade ago. It created a tax credit amount between $2,500 and $7,500 based on a specific qualifying vehicle’s battery capacity. There was also a 200,000-unit limit to how many zero-emissions electric cars a single manufacturer could sell before the credit would phase out and eventually be eliminated. Two automakers, General Motors and Tesla, had already hit this limit in recent years, with a few more getting very close in 2022

But the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has altered the existing rules for the federal tax credit, removing the 200,000 limit, extending the up-to-$7,500 credit through 2032…but also adding a new set of eligibility requirements based on the final assembly location of the vehicle and its battery components. New vehicle pricing and adjusted gross income requirements have also been enacted. The new rules are a reaction to China’s dominance in the EV space, a dominance President Biden and the U.S. Department of Energy would like to reverse by encouraging the production of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and battery components in North America.

The Inflation Reduction Act – Pros and Cons

Encouraging the American production of clean vehicles, including plug-in electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), is commendable. However, the change in eligibility requirements could actually limit new vehicle tax credits more than the outgoing legislation. Let’s take a closer look at where this new legislation helps, and hurts, your chances at seeing a rebate.

Pros:

No 200,000 Vehicle Limit per Manufacturer – which means brands like Cadillac, Chevrolet and Tesla will be back in the running for a $7,500 tax break, along with every other automaker selling EVs, PHEVs (with a battery of 7 kilowatt hours or larger), or FCEVs. However, the cap is still in place until January 1st, 2023, so GM and Tesla vehicles can’t earn the credit until then. Income and MSRP Restrictions – the previous legislation had no limit on household income or eligible vehicle pricing, which meant a lot of taxpayer money was spent helping millionaires get a $7,500 price break on their $100,000-plus Tesla. Starting on January 1st, 2023, the new legislation puts an MSRP limit of $80,000 on electric vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks, and a $55,000 MSRP limit on electric sedans, coupes, wagons, and convertibles. The IRS also puts a $125,000 annual income limit on single tax filers, a $250,000 limit on head-of-household filers, and a $300,000 limit on joint filers. Used EVs Count Too – For the first time ever, car buyers seeking a lower cost of entry into EV ownership don’t have to choose from pricier current or new model year vehicles. A tax credit on used vehicles, worth either $4,000 or 30% of the used EV’s sales price (whichever is lower) will be available on used models costing less than $25,000. This credit is only available to single filers below $75,000, head-of-household filers below $112,000, and joint filers of $150,000. Commercial Tax Credit – If you happen to be a business owner looking to go electric the new bill provides up to $7,500 for electric vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) under 14,000 pounds and up to $40,000 for vehicles with a GVWR above 14,000 pounds. The rebate is based on either 30 percent of the total vehicle cost, or the incremental cost of a commercial EV over the cost of an equivalent non-EV vehicle. For instance, the Ford F-150 Lightning has a starting MSRP of $46,974, but you can buy an equivalent crew-cab F-150 with an internal combustion engine for around $50,000. There’s no incremental cost to buying the Lightning, so a commercial buyer could only benefit from 30 percent of the truck’s $46,974 price (around $15,680). Point of Sale Price Reduction: Starting on January 1st, 2024, buyers can transfer their credit to the selling dealer, essentially providing an immediate reduction in the price of an EV during purchase versus waiting to receive the benefit as part of their next tax filing.

Cons:

Final Assembly Must be in North America – Starting on August 17th, 2022, only plug-in electric vehicles assembled in North America are eligible for tax credits. As of this writing, that includes 26 EVs from model year 2022, but only 8 EVs from model year 2023. A vehicle’s VIN (vehicle identification number) will be used to determine where a potential candidate was built. Popular EVs like the BMW 330e, Chevrolet Bolt, and Nissan Leaf have already been approved for model year 2023, and we’d expect other models assembled in Canada, Mexico, or the U.S. to be approved soon, including the Audi Q5, Ford Mustang Mach E, and every Rivian and Tesla model. However… Critical Mineral and Battery Component Requirements – Even if an electric vehicle is assembled in North America it will need to meet increasingly stringent battery requirements over the coming 5 years. Starting in 2023 an EV’s battery will need 40 percent of its critical minerals value to have been extracted or processed in the U.S. or a U.S. free-trade agreement partner to receive up to $3,750 in tax credits. This percentage will increase 10 percent a year, up to 80% of the battery’s critical mineral value in 2027 and beyond. Additionally, starting in 2023, 50 percent of the value of an EV battery’s components must be assembled in the U.S., increasing 10 percent a year until it reaches 100 percent in 2029.

The newest bill’s final assembly and critical mineral battery requirements are meant to shift the production of electric vehicles back toward the U.S. and its allies, and away from foreign entities of concern, including China. Given the supply chain issues we’ve experienced over the past 2 years this is a wise long-term goal. However, the time and resources needed to transplant the electric vehicle alternative fuels industry from the Asia Pacific region to the U.S are substantial.

Foreign automakers like Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Toyota have already committed to high-volume North American vehicle production in recent decades. There’s every reason to believe they can relatively quickly do the same for their electric vehicle fleets to meet the final assembly requirement for successful new models not yet produced here, like the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Several automakers with smaller U.S. production capacity, including BMW, Volkswagen, and Volvo, also continue to expand their U.S. presence.

But battery production is an entirely different process compared to vehicle assembly. It involves significant investments in land assessment/exploration, permit applications, approval, mining, extraction, refining, etc. You can imagine the processes and time frame involved in, for instance, setting up a lithium mine in California. Investing in, and establishing, those capabilities will take several years at least, and could easily prove a limiting factor on how many new EVs can fully qualify for the latest tax credits under the current legislation.

We pulled together cities that have a reputation for extreme weather conditions or are at high risk for natural disasters for this list.

With devastating storms like this year's Hurricane Ian, many people think of Florida when it comes to dangerous weather. But it is not the only state with residents that are no stranger to wind warnings and evacuation orders — and you won't find any of the Sunshine State's cities on this list.

Here are 15 U.S. cities that deal with harsh heat, heavy snowfall or severe weather events — or all of the above — each year, ranked in no particular order.

Comments from Reddit and Quora are edited for spelling and clarity.

15. New Orleans, Louisiana

@bethanyellis28 / Twenty20

The Big Easy suffers the worst from urban heat, according to a recent report from nonprofit research group Climate Central.

The study found that the city’s abundance of dark, impermeable surfaces, like asphalt roads — which absorb and then radiate back heat — largely contribute to extreme heat events in the city.

For a retiree, this means putting yourself at further risk for heat-related illnesses, which disproportionately affect people who are 65 or older or who have chronic health conditions.

And that’s not all that residents have to deal with. “New Orleans residents have learned to live with the dreaded annual hurricane season. Most seasons are rather quiet, but everyone prepares for these storms which require evacuation,” says Beth Taylor on Quora.

Story continues

14. Fairbanks, Alaska

@jngan1 / Twenty20

Sure, residents get stunning views of the Aurora Borealis in the Last Frontier state, but your average retiree would probably prefer sunshine and beaches to the north’s perpetual cold.

Fairbanks hit record lows for the month of April this year, at a chilly -24 degrees, and also experienced a late-season 13-inch snowstorm.

“There’s the horrible freezing weather in a very small city that's pretty far from any large cities with things to do. It gets like -50,-60. People throw hot cups of water out the window to watch it freeze before it hits the ground,” says Kelli L Port on Quora.

13. Houston, Texas

@kristankremer / Twenty20

Hot and humid Houston recorded temperatures of 100 degrees in June — the earliest that mark has reached in a decade, according to Bloomberg.

The city’s also considered one of the worst urban heat islands in the nation and has dealt with several extreme weather events over the years, from tornadoes to snowstorms — in February, the entire state’s power grid collapsed.

The higher temperatures, the more money retirees spend on cooling their homes down as well. “Cost of electricity, and we use a lot of it to cool our homes in this climate, is really high in comparison to other places. In the summer we pay at least $300 a month for our remodeled 100-year-old house,” says Wayne Evans on Quora.

12. Bismarck, North Dakota

@bwilz / Twenty20

Bismark in North Dakota certainly gets chilly, with temperatures falling as low as -45 degrees and snowfall averaging 51 inches each year — and, as if that’s not enough, the city’s no stranger to twisters either.

In 2000, five tornadoes touched down in Bismarck and its surrounding areas, damaging over 40 homes. A blizzard reportedly stormed through the city not long after.

The city air is currently clogged up with smoke from wildfires in the western U.S. and Canada. The elderly — and anyone with an existing heart or lung condition — should stay well away for the time being.

11. Phoenix, Arizona

@bdrudsaz / Twenty20

Often named one of the hottest cities in the country, the Valley of the Sun might lure tourists and vacationers to its high-end spa resorts and desert landmarks, but it’s not ideal for retirees.

Last year, Phoenix contended with its two hottest back-to-back months on record. In August 2020, temperatures soared up to an average high of 110.7 degrees. And 2021 saw Phoenix break its record for hottest June in history.

The Washington Post says the city’s temperatures have been escalating over the years due to urban sprawl and greater use of heat-absorbing surfaces, like asphalt and concrete. On top of that, greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere across the world have risen as well, making Phoenix even more susceptible to major heat events.

Oklahoma City’s nestled near the heart of Tornado Alley — between 1893 to 2020, 171 tornadoes have racked the area in total — so make sure you’ve got a good home insurance policy to cover any related damages.

May is considered a peak month for all tornadoes, while more dangerous tornadoes are more likely to occur in April. The Washington Post dubbed OKC one of the worst cities for extreme weather this year.

A vicious ice storm in October 2020 disrupted power lines and toppled trees, while flash flood warnings are issued quite frequently.

9. Grand Forks, North Dakota

Grand Forks in North Dakota gets its fair share of blizzards — one of the most recent being Blizzard Aaliyah, which landed in December 2020.

They’re so common, in fact, that the Grand Forks Herald names each snowstorm for a local resident or a famous or mythical figure.

Grand Forks is considered the Peace Garden State’s coldest city — the winter months can drop to subzero temperatures.

Several super cell thunderstorms also hammered North Dakota and northwest Minnesota in August this year, ripping branches and limbs off trees and damaging a couple structures across Grand Forks.

8. Santa Cruz, California

Wildfires have been ravaging the state of California for years — the state’s fire record reportedly dates back to 1932 — and the city of Santa Cruz and its surrounding areas are no exception.

This city is prone to both wildfires, flooding and the occasional earthquake. In 2017, mudslides and flooding cost the city over $10 million in damages, and the CZU Lightning Complex fire last year resulted in widespread devastation across the entire Santa Cruz county.

Almost 1,500 homes were damaged or destroyed in the 37-day CZU fire and around 65,000 people were evacuated.

7. Las Vegas, Nevada

@3happytails / Twenty20

Las Vegas has plenty to entertain a retiree, it’s true, but beyond its (air-conditioned) casinos and vibrant nightlife, the city struggles with an intense heat problem.

In the summer of 2021, Sin City underwent a massive heat wave, with temperatures shooting up to 117 degrees in July. Dust and smoke from nearby wildfires also settled over the valley in a brown haze, says The Guardian.

The city’s reportedly warming faster than almost any other area in the U.S. — and its bustling crowds, concrete and overheating vehicles are only contributing to what’s becoming a serious environmental concern. Heat-related deaths in Southern Nevada are on the rise as well.

Retirees better dig out their shovels and prepare for the winters if they’re settling down in Denver for the remainder of their golden years.

The Mile High City is known for its heavy snowfall — averaging about 54 inches each year, according to The Washington Post.

It’s also prone to volatile temperature swings. During Labor Day weekend in 2020, the city broke a heat record at 101 degrees on the Saturday before swinging into a snow storm a few days later with temperatures in the 30s. Snowfall ended up continuing all the way through May, not uncommon for the area.

5. Tucson, Arizona

Tucson hit a record high for the fifth day in a row in June 2021 at 114 degrees — the previous record was 109 degrees in 1985, over 35 years ago.

The Old Pueblo experiences dry heat for most of the year and humidity during the monsoon season. The Guardian says the elderly who live in the city are especially at risk of heat-related illnesses and deaths.

“Your skin will suffer due to the heat, dry climate and sun — use a lot of moisturizer, lip balm and hand lotion. Even with that expect dry skin and more wrinkles,” warns Kent Thornell on Quora about retiring in Tucson.

4. Riverside-San Bernardino, California

According to FEMA, the cities of Riverside and San Bernardino land in one of the riskiest areas in the country for natural disasters.

The San Andreas Fault, which inspired the 2015 disaster film San Andreas, runs through San Bernardino and has triggered several real earthquakes in the past.

Wildfires aren’t uncommon in the area either. A 30-acre brush fire in Jurupa Valley this summer prompted evacuations and caused damage to around 20 homes — thankfully, it wasn’t as widespread as the 150-acre fire that broke out the previous year.

3. Boston, Massachusetts

@PugventurePhoto / Twenty20

Remember the infamous “blizzard blitz” of 2015? Boston managed to get nearly an entire season’s worth of snow in just 10 days.

The New England city’s not just pricey to live in, it’s often racked with bad weather, even through the summer. This year marked Boston’s third wettest July in history, with nearly 9 inches of rainfall logged in the books.

Since the city’s situated on the coast, it’s also at a higher risk of flooding, particularly as climate change worsens. And while hurricanes are nowhere near as common as snowstorms, Sandy pummeled trees and triggered power outages throughout Boston in 2012.

2. Los Angeles, California

@reinasierra/ Twenty20

The City of Angels poses several weather hazards to its residents due to its geography — it has many fault lines running through the area and lies near ravines and basins, as well as dry hillsides and brushes.

Los Angeles County overall received the highest score on FEMA’s National Risk Index. It ranked highly in particular for earthquake and wildfire risk, but also relatively highly for tornadoes, heat waves, flooding and lightning.

2017’s fire season hit the city directly in Bel-Air, destroying homes and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents.

1. San Jose, California

The Capital of Silicon Valley is not only expensive to live in and it’s also prone to natural disasters.

No retiree wants to worry about getting caught in a flood or losing their home to a wildfire — insurance website Insurify says San Jose, which lies on the southern shore of the San Francisco Bay, is one of America’s riskiest cities for flooding, and like much of the rest of California, the city’s susceptible to wildfires.

A large brush fire broke out just this summer, starting in Milpitas before making its way over to Coyote Creek and San Jose. It has been made worse by the ongoing drought conditions in the region.

They fear that the technology will be used to further monitor and control Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples.

By Gulchehra Hoja for RFA Uyghur 2022.10.14 -- China's rollout of thousands of 5G base stations throughout its far-western Xinjiang region has raised suspicions that the technology will not be used for economic development but for enhanced digital surveillance of Uyghurs and other Muslims, experts say.

The build-out in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is part of a nationwide expansion of the fifth-generation, or 5G, technology standard for broadband cellular networks that mobile phone companies began deploying worldwide in 2019. China is rolling out 5G to further digitize its economy and society.

With an area of 642,800 square kilometers (248,200 square miles), Xinjiang has the largest land area of all the provinces and autonomous regions in China, though most of the vast region consists of uninhabited deserts and mountains.

Xinjiang's regional capital Urumqi (in Chinese, Wulumuqi) was one of China's first cities to adopt 5G technology in October 2019, followed by a network rollout that covered other urban areas in prefecture-level cities.

The 5G network rollout across the entire region will augment an existing pervasive digitized system that monitors the movement of residents through surveillance drones, facial recognition cameras, mobile phone scans as part of China's efforts to control the predominantly Muslim population, experts said.

China has built more than 30,000 5G base stations in Xinjiang, adding another roughly 10,000 this year at a cost of 1.65 billion yuan (U.S. $230 million), according to an Oct. 10 report by state-run Tianshan Net-Xinjiang Daily, the official news website of Xinjiang.

There are nearly a dozen 5G base stations for every 10,000 people in the region with a total population of roughly 12 million, the report said. All prefecture-level urban areas and county urban areas, and 90.5 percent of townships and towns, now have 5G network coverage.

""The 5G network will further deepen the coverage of counties and townships, and 'county and county access to 5G' will further consolidate the foundation of digital Xinjiang,"" the report said.

5G applications are ""injecting strong impetus into enabling the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry and promoting high-quality economic development,"" the state-run report said. Xinjiang already employs technology in more than 70 5G applications, primarily in manufacturing, agriculture, medical care, education and cultural tourism.

But experts on surveillance in Xinjiang say that the new 5G infrastructure is helping authorities keep a closer eye on the Uyghur population, already subject to tight digital scrutiny for years.

""It's definitely an interesting development. I have to imagine it will only make surveillance that much more pervasive and efficient,"" said Josh Chin, a journalist with The Wall Street Journal and co-author of Surveillance State: Inside China's Quest to Launch a New Era of Social Control.

'See everything, know everything'

China has used digital technology to monitor and censor Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples in Xinjiang, amassing huge amounts of data from cell phones, personal computers, and security cameras to impose political and social control of the Muslim groups.

For years, Chinese authorities have subjected Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities in Xinjiang to arbitrary arrests and restrictions on their religious practice and culture.

Geoffrey Cain, a U.S. journalist who wrote the book The Perfect Police State: An Undercover Odyssey into China's Terrifying Surveillance Dystopia of the Future, said the rollout of 5G base stations across the vast, sparsely populated region is ""overkill.""

""It's very extreme, and it also strikes me as very suspicious,"" he told RFA.

Any technology deployed in Xinjiang will be used for surveillance, Cain said.

""The government of China has made it clear that the purpose of technology is first to develop the region, but that's the optimistic version,"" he said. ""The second reason is to control the people of the region, to control the Uyghur people, and the goal is to create a total security state. The government of Beijing wants to be able to see everything and know everything.""

This year, China introduced a fleet of 20 driverless electric patrol vehicles in Karamay (Kelemayi), an oil-rich city in the northern part of Xinjiang as a new method of surveillance. The self-driving cars are equipped with eight surveillance cameras that can rotate 360 degrees and equipped with facial recognition and tracking technology to collect data on suspicious incidents to send to the Integrated Joint Operation Platform, the main system for mass surveillance in Xinjiang.

As part of the repression, it is believed that as many as 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslims have been held in a vast network of internment camps purportedly set up to prevent ""religious extremism"" and ""terrorism"" in the region. Beijing has insisted that the camps were vocational training facilities and that they are now closed.

""One of the reasons the government is closing camps and releasing the Uyghurs people is because they've turned the whole region into one concentration camp,"" Cain said. ""They have the tools they need to monitor everyone to control them, and they don't need to spend all this money on camps to make it happen.""

The predominantly Muslim groups have also been subjected to torture, forced sterilizations and forced labor, as well as the eradication of their linguistic, cultural and religious traditions, in what the United States and several Western parliaments have called genocide and crimes against humanity.

A report issued by the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in late August documented widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang, including torture, arbitrary arrests, forced abortions, and violations of religious freedom, and said the repression there ""may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.""

""This is a very extreme form of surveillance because a data network is the easiest way to spy on people,"" Cain said. ""More than any other technology that we have for the population, installing a data network all over the region will guarantee that everybody is constantly being monitored.""

""Their data is on the network,"" he said. ""They cannot escape the network no matter where they go.""

Nearby, a group of Ukrainian deminers with the country’s territorial defense forces worked to clear the area of dozens of other deadly mines and unexploded ordnance - a push to restore a semblance of safety to the cities, towns and countryside in a region that spent months under Russian occupation.

The deminers, part of the 113th Kharkiv Defense Brigade of Ukraine’s territorial defense forces, walked deep into fallow agricultural lands on Thursday along a muddy road between fields of dead sunflowers overgrown with high weeds.

Two soldiers, each with a metal detector in hand, slowly advanced up the road, scanning the ground and waiting for the devices to give a signal. When one detector emitted a high tone, a soldier knelt to inspect the mud and grass, probing it with a metal rod to see what might be buried just below the surface.

The detector’s hit could indicate a spent shell casing, a piece of rusting iron or a discarded aluminum can. Or, it could be an active land mine.

Oleksii Dokuchaev, the commander of the demining brigade based in the eastern Kharkiv region, said that hundreds of mines have already been discharged in the area around the village of Hrakove where they were working, but that the danger of mines across Ukraine will persist for years to come.

“One year of war equals 10 years of demining,” Dokuchaev said. “Even now we are still finding munitions from World War II, and in this war they’re being planted left and right.”

Russian forces hastily fled the Kharkiv region in early September after a rapid counteroffensive by Ukraine’s military retook hundreds of square miles of territory following months of Russian occupation.

While many settlements in the region have finally achieved some measure of safety after fierce battles reduced many of them to rubble, Russian land mines remain an ever-present threat in both urban and rural environments.

Small red signs bearing a white skull and crossbones line many of the roads in the Kharkiv region, warning of the danger of mines just off the pavement. Yet sometimes, desperation drives local residents into the minefields.

The local man whose body lay near the abandoned Russian camp was likely searching for food left behind by the invading soldiers, Dokuchaev said, an additional danger posed by the hunger experienced by many in Ukraine’s devastated regions.

The use of the kind of tripwire land mines which killed him is prohibited under the 1997 Ottawa Treaty - of which Russia is not a signatory - which regulates the use of anti-personnel land mines, he said.

“There are rules of war. The Ottawa Convention says that it’s forbidden to place mines or any other munitions with tripwires. But Russians ignore it,” he said.

The deminers had cleared the road of anti-personnel mines the previous day, allowing them to search for anti-tank mines hidden beneath the ground that could destroy any vehicles driving over them.

They hoped to bring vehicles deep enough into the area to retrieve an abandoned Russian armored personnel carrier, the engine of which they planned to salvage. A vehicle would also need to be brought in by local police to retrieve the body.

The deminers reached the abandoned camp, set in a grove of trees and strewn with the remains of the months the Russian soldiers had spent there: rotting food rations in wooden ammunition boxes, strings of high-caliber bullets, a stack of yellowing Russian newspapers and trenches filled with refuse.

After a thorough scan of the area, the servicemen recovered two Soviet-made TM-62 anti-tank mines and six pneumatically armed fuses and placed them in a depression on the edge of the camp, taped into a bundle along with 400 grams of TNT.

Dokuchaev placed an electric detonator into the explosive charge and connected it to a long length of wire before taking cover with his men at a distance of more than 100 meters (yards).

When the charge was detonated - something the servicemen laughingly called “bada-boom” - the immense blast ripped through the air, causing a cascade of autumn leaves to fall from the surrounding trees and emitting a tall plume of gray smoke.

After the mines had been destroyed, Dokuchaev - a former photographer who enlisted with the territorial defense forces after the outbreak of war - said the work his brigade is doing is essential to keep civilians safe as they pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.

Despite the dangers, he said, he enjoys his work.

“I don’t know what I’ll do after our victory,” Dokuchaev said. “Life is boring without explosions.”",electric vehicles,the washington times

After a thorough scan of the area, the servicemen recovered two Soviet-made TM-62 anti-tank mines and six pneumatically armed fuses and placed them in a depression on the edge of the camp, taped into a bundle along with 400 grams of TNT.

Dokuchaev placed an electric detonator into the explosive charge and connected it to a long length of wire before taking cover with his men at a distance of more than 100 meters (yards).

When the charge was detonated — something the servicemen laughingly called “bada-boom” — the immense blast ripped through the air, causing a cascade of autumn leaves to fall from the surrounding trees and emitting a tall plume of gray smoke.

After the mines had been destroyed, Dokuchaev — a former photographer who enlisted with the territorial defense forces after the outbreak of war — said the work his brigade is doing is essential to keep civilians safe as they pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.

Despite the dangers, he said, he enjoys his work.

“I don’t know what I’ll do after our victory,” Dokuchaev said. “Life is boring without explosions.”

The historic climate legislation President Joe Biden signed in August offered a federal tax break — worth up to $7,500 — to households that buy new electric vehicles. But it may be tough for consumers to get the full value of the tax credit — at least initially. That's largely due to the structure of the clean vehicle credit and certain requirements for consumers and car manufacturers. Those roadblocks, however, are poised to ease in the longer term, experts said.

The tax credit 'bummer': It's nonrefundable

The legislation, called the Inflation Reduction Act, made the tax credit ""nonrefundable."" That means consumers can only get the full financial benefit if they have a federal tax liability of at least $7,500. A nonrefundable credit offsets a consumer's federal tax bill but any leftover value is lost. Let's say a consumer buys an electric vehicle today. When filing their 2022 tax return, the person finds they owe $5,000 in federal taxes. This person wouldn't get the full $7,500 tax credit — they'd be able to claim $5,000 and cut their tax bill to zero. But the remaining $2,500 would be lost. In other words, those funds wouldn't be issued to the consumer in a tax refund. In addition, unlike some other tax credits in the bill — such as the ""residential clean energy"" credit for home solar panels and other installations — any unused value doesn't carry over to future tax years to offset a future tax bill.

These colleges promise no student debt

What to look for in a credit report to lower your borrowing costs ""That's kind of the bummer"" of the credit, said Dan Herron, a certified public accountant and certified financial planner based in San Luis Obispo, California. High-income consumers would generally be most likely to benefit from the full credit value relative to those with more modest earnings, since they typically have larger tax bills, Herron said. But the credit comes with some additional restrictions — such as an income cap, explained in more detail below — that will restrict how many of those households can benefit. Meanwhile, middle- and lower-income buyers typically have smaller tax bills, meaning it's more likely they wouldn't collect the full credit, Herron said. States, municipalities and utilities may also offer financial incentives for electric vehicle purchases.

How to tinker with your tax bill

Consumers who want to buy an electric vehicle and think their tax bills will be too small to get the full $7,500 can take steps to boost their tax liability — and therefore maximize the credit's value. For example, investors can consider converting a pretax retirement account to a Roth, a type of after-tax account; they'd owe income tax on that conversion. Investors can also consider selling winning stocks or other assets, thereby incurring capital gains tax.

""If you can harvest some gains or have additional income you can pull into 2022, maybe you consider that,"" Herron said. Workers can also adjust the tax withholding on their paychecks, opting to withhold less and thereby increasing the taxes they owe at tax time. While doing so won't affect your overall tax liability, it can help you keep more money in your paycheck during the year, with the aim of using the vehicle tax credit to offset the bigger tax-time bill. However, Herron doesn't recommend this route due to potential unknowns. For example, an unexpected bonus during the year might mean a larger-than-expected tax bill, depending on the withholding adjustment.

Parameters that may reduce the credit

Aside from the tax credit's structure, the Inflation Reduction Act set requirements around the new clean vehicles themselves that may limit the value of your tax break. As of Aug. 16, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, final assembly of the car must occur in North America to qualify for a tax break. The U.S. Department of Energy has a list of vehicles that meet this standard. Additional rules take effect in 2023. First, there are income caps. A tax credit isn't available to single individuals with modified adjusted gross income of $150,000. The cap is higher for others — $225,000 for heads of household and $300,000 for married couples who file a joint tax return. (The test applies to income for the current or prior year, whichever is less.) And certain cars may not qualify based on price. Sedans with a retail price of more than $55,000 aren't eligible, nor are vans, SUVs or trucks over $80,000.

There's a lot of uncertainty. Joel Levin executive director of Plug In America

Two other rules apply to manufacturing: One carries requirements for sourcing of the car battery's critical minerals; the second requires a share of battery components be manufactured and assembled in North America. Consumers lose half the tax credit's value — up to $3,750 — if one of those requirements isn't met; they'd lose the full $7,500 for failing to meet both. It's unclear which electric vehicles will meet these standards and qualify for a tax credit next year. There's a chance none may immediately qualify, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. ""There's a lot of uncertainty,"" said Joel Levin, executive director of Plug In America. ""If you need a car, I think it's risky to delay buying in hopes of getting the credit,"" he added. ""It may not work out or it may be a couple years until it's eligible.""

watch now

One other consideration: Consumers who buy a Tesla or General Motors model before the tighter rules kick in Jan. 1 aren't eligible for a tax break based on earlier parameters around sales caps that are set to lapse at the end of the year. There's also another option: buying a used EV instead of new one. The Inflation Reduction Act created a ""credit for previously owned clean vehicles"" worth up to $4,000 starting in 2023. The tax break comes with some restrictions (like a $25,000 cap on the car's sticker price and lower income caps for consumers) but doesn't carry the manufacturing and assembly requirements of new cars.

GUWAHATI, Oct 15: On a historic occasion, Meghalaya’s first ever five-star hotel, the Vivanta Meghalaya, Shillong was inaugurated by the chief minister of Meghalaya, Conrad K. Sangma. The event was attended by cabinet ministers, the member of Rajya Sabha from Meghalaya, the chief secretary, the Director General of Police, the chairperson, MTDC, senior government officials, delegates from the media and members of the civil society.

The chief minister called this a truly momentous occasion in the history of Meghalaya. He highlighted that the work for the hotel had been going on since 1986 and could be completed only after a strong push was given by the current government. He congratulated and thanked all the stakeholders for completing the project despite the Covid-induced disruptions. With a built-up area of about 8,800 sq. m., the hotel has 101 rooms and other facilities including a speciality restaurant, coffee shops, bar, retail shops, and a banquet hall. It is owned by the Meghalaya Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) and has been leased out for a period of 33 years on a PPP mode to be operated by the IHCL. The chief minister said, “The Vivanta Meghalaya, Shillong along with the upcoming hotel Courtyard by Marriott will give a huge boost to high-value tourism in the state. This model will be further replicated going forward to transform Meghalaya into the most preferred destination for ecotourism. Today we have handed over the hotel to IHCL and the hotel will soon be open for guests.”

The chief minister reiterated his vision of transforming Meghalaya into the top 10 states within the next 10 years and said that tourism is at the core of realising this vision. He said that the government is developing tourism on a hub and spoke model wherein Sohra, Jowai, Shillong, Umiam and Tura will act as hubs and nearby rural tourist destinations will be developed as spokes. In line with this strategy, the government has taken a number of initiatives to augment the accommodation infrastructure in the state. These include the construction of large resorts and tourism infrastructure in Sakaladuma in West Garo Hills, Shnongpdeng in West Jaintia Hills, Sohra in East Khasi Hills, Mawlyndep and Nongmahir in Ri Bhoi, Nongkhnum in West Khasi Hills, Thadlaskein in West Jaintia Hills and Pelgawari in South West Garo Hills. Tourism infrastructure and amenities at a cost of Rs 5 -10 crore each, will also be set up in several villages.

To further augment the accommodation infrastructure, the ‘Homestay Scheme’ has been launched, wherein 2,500 accommodation units will be built over the next five years in convergence with the PMEGP. A subsidy of 35% is being given on loans of up to Rs 10 lakh by the state government which is over and above the 35% subsidy being given by the Government of India under PMEGP. The residents stand to earn a monthly revenue of up to Rs 50,000 by paying an EMI of just Rs 5,000. The government has received over 480 applications to date and has sanctioned Rs 7.1 crore to build about 75 homestays.

In addition to accommodation infrastructure, the connectivity infrastructure is also being upgraded to decongest Shillong and provide connectivity to new destinations. A fleet of electric buses and luxury tourist vehicles will be introduced to add capacity to the transport sector. Further, the works for the iconic Shillong Peak Ropeway, being taken up at a cost of Rs 140 crore, are also expected to commence by the end of this year. The chief minister also spoke about the ‘Meghalaya Grassroots Music Project (MGMP)’ as part of which regular musical performances are being organized in Shillong, Sohra, Tura and Jowai. Apart from providing livelihood opportunities to the artists and entrepreneurs, MGMP is also playing an important role in promoting the musical culture and heritage of the State and at the same time is also providing a unique experience for the tourists.

The state faces a shortage of high-quality rooms and the presence of five-star hotels in Shillong would allow the government to attract high-value tourists, host national and international music and sports events, and other seminars and conferences. The chief minister said that the Vivanta Meghalaya, Shillong would herald an era of luxury tourism in the state and will go a long way in fulfilling the aspirations of the residents of the state.",electric vehicles,thehillstimes.in

Beside an abandoned Russian military camp in eastern Ukraine, the body of a man lay decomposing in the grass — a civilian who had fallen victim to a tripwire land mine set by retreating Russian forces.

Nearby, a group of Ukrainian minesweepers with the country's territorial defense forces worked to clear the area of dozens of other deadly mines and unexploded ordnance — a push to restore a semblance of safety to the cities, towns and countryside in a region that spent months under Russian occupation.

The deminers, part of the 113th Kharkiv Defense Brigade of Ukraine's territorial defense forces, walked deep into fallow agricultural lands on Thursday along a muddy road between fields of dead sunflowers overgrown with high weeds.

Two soldiers, each with a metal detector in hand, slowly advanced up the road, scanning the ground and waiting for the devices to give a signal. When one detector emitted a high tone, a soldier knelt to inspect the mud and grass, probing it with a metal rod to see what might be buried just below the surface.

The detector's hit could indicate a spent shell casing, a piece of rusting iron or a discarded aluminum can. Or, it could be an active land mine.

Oleksii Dokuchaev, the commander of the minesweeper brigade based in the eastern Kharkiv region, said that hundreds of mines have already been discharged in the area around the village of Hrakove where they were working, but that the danger of mines across Ukraine will persist for years to come.

“One year of war equals 10 years of demining,” Dokuchaev said. “Even now we are still finding munitions from World War II, and in this war they're being planted left and right.”

Russian forces hastily fled the Kharkiv region in early September after a rapid counteroffensive by Ukraine's military retook hundreds of square miles of territory following months of Russian occupation.

While many settlements in the region have finally achieved some measure of safety after fierce battles reduced many of them to rubble, Russian land mines remain an ever-present threat in both urban and rural environments.

Small red signs bearing a white skull and crossbones line many of the roads in the Kharkiv region, warning of the danger of mines just off the pavement. Yet sometimes, desperation drives local residents into the minefields.

The local man whose body lay near the abandoned Russian camp was likely searching for food left behind by the invading soldiers, Dokuchaev said, an additional danger posed by the hunger experienced by many in Ukraine's devastated regions.

The use of the kind of tripwire land mines which killed him is prohibited under the 1997 Ottawa Treaty — of which Russia is not a signatory — which regulates the use of anti-personnel land mines, he said.

“There are rules of war. The Ottawa Convention says that it’s forbidden to place mines or any other munitions with tripwires. But Russians ignore it,” he said.

The deminers had cleared the road of anti-personnel mines the previous day, allowing them to search for anti-tank mines hidden beneath the ground that could destroy any vehicles driving over them.

They hoped to bring vehicles deep enough into the area to retrieve an abandoned Russian armored personnel carrier, the engine of which they planned to salvage. A vehicle would also need to be brought in by local police to retrieve the body.

The minesweepers reached the abandoned camp, set in a grove of trees and strewn with the remains of the months the Russian soldiers had spent there: rotting food rations in wooden ammunition boxes, strings of high-caliber bullets, a stack of yellowing Russian newspapers and trenches filled with refuse.

After a thorough scan of the area, the servicemen recovered two Soviet-made TM-62 anti-tank mines and six pneumatically armed fuses and placed them in a depression on the edge of the camp, taped into a bundle along with 400 grams of TNT.

Dokuchaev placed an electric detonator into the explosive charge and connected it to a long length of wire before taking cover with his men at a distance of more than 100 meters (yards).

When the charge was detonated — something the servicemen laughingly called “bada-boom” — the immense blast ripped through the air, causing a cascade of autumn leaves to fall from the surrounding trees and emitting a tall plume of gray smoke.

After the mines had been destroyed, Dokuchaev — a former photographer who enlisted with the territorial defense forces after the outbreak of war — said the work his brigade is doing is essential to keep civilians safe as they pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.

Despite the dangers, he said, he enjoys his work.

“I don't know what I'll do after our victory,” Dokuchaev said. “Life is boring without explosions.”

VW investing $2.3 billion in Chinese autonomous driving venture originally appeared on Autoblog on Sat, 15 Oct 2022 09:00…",https://www.autoblog.com/2022/10/15/vw-china-autonomous-partnership/,"Volkswagen will invest €2.4 billion euros ($2.3 billion) to set up an autonomous driving joint venture with China’s Horizon Robotics Inc. to strengthen the automaker’s tech presence in its biggest market.

The new unit will develop automated and assisted driving systems for China, integrating numerous functions on one chip to save costs and lower energy consumption, VW said Thursday. The technology will be built for the carmaker’s battery-only models sold in China to accelerate innovation in a market where consumers increasingly pick local EV brands.

The joint venture “will enable us to tailor our products and services even faster and more consistently to the needs of our Chinese customers,” said Ralf Brandstaetter, who runs VW’s China business. Teaming up with Horizon will help “drive the repositioning of our China business.”

VW is under pressure to improve its offering in China, its biggest market with roughly 40% of deliveries. Sales last year slid, outpacing an overall drop as the company struggled to keep up with local consumer tastes, particularly on digital offerings with many VW models exasperating drivers with frozen screens and complex functionality.

Cariad, the manufacturer’s software subsidiary will take a 60% stake in the joint venture, with the transaction due to be completed next year. Cariad is attempting to get back on track after software development hiccups delayed several models, including the important electric Porsche Macan. The disarray culminated in the departure of Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess with Oliver Blume now in charge at Europe biggest carmaker.

Horizon, backed by investors including Intel Corp., Hillhouse Capital and electric-vehicle maker BYD Co., has technology that can be installed in everything from cars to smart speakers, and already counts Volkswagen’s Audi among its partners, according to its website. As part of the deal, VW will take a stake in the company, gaining a board seat, and invest €1.3 billion to set up the joint venture.

VW’s move to start making advanced chips in China for local models also comes at a time of deep upheaval for the global chip industry. The US on Friday outlined restrictions on doing business with China to hamper its ability to develop the most advanced chips and equip its military, prompting manufacturers to reel in servicing customers in the country.

Having development capability “in China and for China” will help with offering an “independent solution here for the future,” Cariad CEO Dirk Hilgenberg said on a call with reporters.",electric vehicles,autoblog

The country posted 4.8 percent growth in the first quarter of 2022.Many economists think China will struggle to attain its growth target this year of around 5.5 percent, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its GDP growth forecast to 3.2 percent for 2022 and 4.4 percent for 2023.AFP's panel of experts predicted average growth of three percent in 2022, a long way off the 8.1 percent seen in 2021.That would be China's weakest growth rate in four decades, excluding 2020 when the global economy was hammered by the emergence of the coronavirus.""The big policy challenge is accepting that the economy has reached a state of maturity that means growth numbers are likely permanently reset to the zero to 4.5 percent range for the coming decade,"" Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, told AFP.Another factor that has had an enormous impact is Beijing's zero-Covid policy.China is the last of the world's major economies to continue to follow the strategy, which imposes tight travel restrictions, mass PCR testing and obligatory quarantines.It also involves sudden and strict lockdowns -- including of businesses and factories -- which has disrupted production and weighed heavily on household consumption.But despite the impact on the economy, ""there is no clear sign of a significant easing of the zero-Covid strategy"", Nomura 's Ting Lu said, noting that so far the opposite had happened.In the week leading up to the Chinese Communist Party CCP ) Congress, state media have published multiple editorials warning the policy should not be relaxed, and officials have pounced on outbreaks across the country over the last week with increased curbs.Some lockdown restrictions have returned to major financial hub Shanghai, prompting some to fear a repeat of earlier this year when the city was shut down for two months.Meanwhile, China is also battling an unprecedented crisis in its real estate sector -- historically a driver of growth in the economy and representative of more than a quarter of the country's GDP when combined with construction.Following years of explosive growth fuelled by easy access to loans, Chinese authorities launched a crackdown on excessive debt in 2020.Property sales are now falling across the country, leaving many developers struggling and some owners refusing to pay their mortgages for unfinished homes.Despite the problems, ""many economic indicators have actually recovered reasonably well from the mass lockdowns of March and April"", according to analyst Thomas Gatley from Gavekal Dragonomics.Car sales held strong in September, driven by strong demand for electric clean vehicles.August exports increased by 7.1 percent compared to the previous year, and Beijing has invested in infrastructure to support activity.However, ""those pillars of growth are becoming more fragile"", Gatley said.And ""the Chinese economy faces more fundamental problems"" of transformation, sinologist Jean-Louis Rocca told AFP.After decades of growth fueled by investment and exports, he said China ""no longer wants to be 'the world's factory'"" -- instead it aspires to be a ""modern economy"", geared towards new technology and consumption -- and the transition is still ongoing.Another worry for the CCP, which draws a large part of its political legitimacy from its economic success, is that this type of modern economy does not create very many jobs, Rocca said -- which has serious implications for China's growing middle class.",electric vehicles,the times of india

Union Road Transport and Highways Minister virtually addresses at the 12th International Convention of Association Of the National Exchanges Members Of India



Green express highway between Mumbai and Bangalore to reduce journey time to 5 hours

Mumbai, 15 October 2022

The Ministry of Road Transports and Highways is planning to take over the State Highways with high traffic density from the State Governments for a period of 25 years. Therafter, those state highways will be converted into 4 or 6 lane highways and then the Centre will collect toll from those highways. This was stated by Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari in a virtual address at Association Of National Exchanges Members Of India (ANMI)'s 12th International Convention which was held in Mumbai today. After a period of 12-13 years, the investments will be fully recovered from those state highways along with intersts and land acquisition costs, further added Shri Gadkari. He urged that investments in the infrastructure sector of the country will be risk-free and yield good returns and called for cooperation in the investment for infrastructure. “The financial markets need to come up with innovative models to fund India’s Infrastructure growth. We are inviting investments in the PPP model. We can export energy to the world if we channel our investments to waste management, green hydrogen, solar, and several such projects. Innovation, Entrepreneurship, Science, and Technology is the wealth of future India.” The Centre has given the highest priority to development of infrastructure in the country, he added.

Speaking about infrastructure development, he informed, “We are planning a green express highway between Mumbai and Bangalore”. It will be a 5 hrs journey between Mumbai-Bangalore and 3.5 to 4 hrs between Pune and Bangalore, he added. The Mumbai-Pune Express Highway will take a turn from near the Ring Road of Pune and start as the Highway towards Bangalore, he further mentioned.

Likewise, 27 green express highways are coming up in the country. By end of this year, there will be highways connecting Delhi - Dehradun in 2 hrs, Delhi-Hardwar in 2 hrs, Delhi -Jaipur in 2 hrs, Delhi - Chandigarh in 2.5 hrs, Delhi - Amritsar in 4 hrs, Delhi - Srinagar in 8 hrs, Delhi - Katra in 6 hrs, Delhi - Mumbai in 10 hrs, Chennai-Bangalore in 2 hrs and Lucknow- Kanpur in half an hour, stated the Union Road Transport and Highways Minister. Highway projects connecting Gorakhpur to Siliguri and Varanasi to Kolkata are also on the cards. “Just like the National Water Grid, we want to develop a National Highway Grid”, he said. He also stated that income from tolls have come to Rs 40 thousand crore at present and it will rise to Rs 1 lakh 40 thousand crores by the end of 2024..

The Ministry is also in the process of constructing 75 tunnels at a cost of Rs 2,50,000 crores, stated the Minister. On an average, 40 kms of roads are constructed per day in the country, informed Shri Gadkari. He further stated that, presently there exists 65 lakh Km of road length in the country and out of it, 1.45 lakh Km are of National Highways. In the future, before making highways, the plan is to acquire land in cooperation and JVs with private sector investors, stated the Union Road Transport and Highways Minister.

Shri Gadkari further said that there is a huge potential for development of public transport in the country. There is good economic viability in introducing e-buses, he said. Some of the projects taken up by his ministry include starting electric vehicles, trolleybuses and bus-ports in cities. Also, AC Luxury buses may be started for tourists, he added. Under the Parvatmala scheme, ropeways, cable-cars and funicular rail are being developed in hilly areas. The restaurants and parking plazas that will come up surrounding these projects will also add to the sources of revenue, said the Minister.

The Road Transport and Highways Ministry is also looking at diversifying fuel base to include ethanol, methanol, bio-diesel, bio-LNG, BIO-CNG, electric and green hydrogen. Under the National Hydrogen Mission, the Centre wants to make India a green hydrogen hub and export this form of energy to the world, stated the Minister. He further said that there is economic viability in making ethanol from sugar-cane, bamboo and other agricultural products. “By making bio-fuels, we may increase India's GDP in agriculture”, he said. Bio-fuels are import-substitute, cost-effective, pollution-free and indigenous, he added.

Stating that the country’s automobile industry's size is Rs 7.5 lakh crores, Shri Gadkari said that there is a plan to make it a Rs 15 lakh crore industry within 5 years. Automobiles industry has maximum employment potential and brings in maximum GST to the Centre and states, he added. The Minster also said that investments in areas of solid waste management and liquid waste management are going to yield good returns.

Maharashtra Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “I am sure that lots of brilliant ideas will be generated for the development and growth of financial markets in India. I am delighted that the theme of our conference is based on Amrit Kaal which is also the vision of our honorable prime minister Shri Narendra Modi.”

The dignitaries present on the occasion included Whole Time Director of SEBI Ashwini Bhatia. During the convention, Mr. Kamlesh Shah, President of, ANMI announced a major Cybersecurity initiative. “Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) has been assigned the important task of onboarding members for the SEBI committee on cybersecurity which has been formed in alliance with stock exchanges. The committee is mandated to create an appropriate framework for cyber security for all financial intermediaries.”

About ANMI:

347,Some Key Questions About Prop 30 Answered,https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/GettyImages-1146607789.jpg,15/10/2022,The plan to raise the income tax on Californians who make more than $2 million by 1.75% each year to pay for electric-vehicle incentives and wildfire prevention has split Democrats and Gov. Gavin Newsom.,https://www.kqed.org/news/11929046/some-key-questions-about-prop-30-answered,"So why is he opposing? He has said that the plan is unnecessary, pointing to the fact that the state invested billions of dollars this year on clean car rebates, electric vehicle chargers and other transportation projects.

In opposing Proposition 30, Newsom villainized Lyft, saying the ride-hailing company “devised” the measure to “funnel state income tax to benefit their company.”

Lyft certainly has skin in this game — and has dumped, at this writing, more than $45 million into the Yes on 30 campaign. Last year, California required that nearly all trips on ride-hailing platforms be in electric vehicles by the end of this decade.

Proposition 30 doesn’t mention the company’s name, nor would it funnel money directly to it. But it would make electric vehicles cheaper for its drivers (and all Californians) and pay to install public charging stations that these cars would use.

Did Lyft devise the measure to direct state tax money its way?

Newsom has claimed that Proposition 30 was “devised by a single corporation” (read: Lyft).

But the measure was actually designed by a coalition of environmental and other advocacy groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, SPUR and other groups. (Environmental attorneys told The Sacramento Bee that Lyft was involved in drafting the measure.)

There are receipts here. Back in 2020, Denny Zane, former mayor of Santa Monica and head of Move LA, a transit advocacy group based around Los Angeles, hosted a series of events about air pollution.

At one event, he asked state climate leaders, including Mary Nichols, Newsom's former top air regulator, this question: If you had $30 billion to spend fighting climate change, what would you do? Many responded by saying they would invest in electric vehicles.

Zane has a long history of pushing Californians to raise taxes to pay for clean transportation. He persuaded Los Angeles voters to pass a sales tax hike to pay for public transit with Measure R in 2008 and again with Measure M in 2016.

“We went to the ballot and it worked,” Zane told KQED in an interview. “LA now has about $120 billion over the next 40 years coming to invest in transportation.”

He thought Newsom would be a partner on a statewide version.

“We finally had somebody who was going to help back the signature drive,” he said. “Suddenly, it's like a scheme. That's just wrong. It's just a mistake.”

Lyft President John Zimmer has also pushed back on Newsom's assertion.

“This is about the health of our neighbors and communities,” he said. “That's why we agreed to get involved when environmental leaders approached us with their plan to reduce California emissions.”

How would it affect the state's finances?

Newsom’s opposition has him siding with conservatives and anti-tax groups like the California Chamber of Commerce and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.

They point out that the state already has the highest income tax rate in the country. But they also argue that it could disrupt the state’s notoriously complicated finances, in a couple of ways.

Remember, the measure would raise the income tax only on the state’s wealthiest, many of whom rely on the stock market and other investments for their income. Their taxes can fluctuate widely, and one strong recession could crater the program; that’s one reason the LA Times editorial board issued an endorsement for No on Prop. 30. “It doesn’t make sense to pin another priority on such a volatile funding stream,” they wrote.

Also, California’s constitution limits how much the state can spend, and it has reached that limit in recent years. Here, the measure could have another unintended consequence, as it requires California to spend more money, up to $3 billion each year.",electric vehicles,kqed

KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Ugandan authorities on Saturday imposed a travel lockdown on two Ebola-hit districts as part of efforts to stop the spread of the contagious disease.

The measures announced by President Yoweri Museveni mean residents of the central Ugandan districts of Mubende and Kassanda can’t travel into or out of those areas by private or public means. Cargo vehicles and others transiting from Kampala, the capital, to southwestern Uganda are still allowed to operate, he said.

All entertainment places, including bars, as well as places of worship are ordered closed, and all burials in those districts must be supervised by health officials, he said. A nighttime curfew also has been imposed. The restrictions will last at least 21 days.

“These are temporary measures to control the spread of Ebola,” Museveni said.

Ebola has infected 58 people in the East African country since Sept. 20, when authorities declared an outbreak. At least 19 people have died, including four health workers. Ugandan authorities were not quick in detecting the outbreak, which began infecting people in a farming community in August as the “strange illness” described by local authorities.

The new measures come amid concern that some patients in the Ebola hot spots could surreptitiously try to seek treatment elsewhere — as did one man who fled Mubende and died at a hospital in Kampala earlier this month, rattling health officials.

Ugandan authorities have documented more than 1,100 contacts of known Ebola patients, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Sudan strain of Ebola, for which there is no proven vaccine, is circulating in the country of 45 million people.

Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever, can be difficult to detect at first because fever is also a symptom of malaria.

Ebola is spread through contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.

Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River after which the disease is named.",electric vehicles,associated press

Sony, which gave us the Walkman, PlayStation, and films like Spider Man, Jumanji, and The Karate Kid, will have an equal, 50% stake in the newly formed Sony Honda Mobility Inc. (SHM).

""SHM aims to evolve the mobility space into the entertainment and emotional space, by seamlessly integrating real and virtual worlds, and exploring new entertainment possibilities through digital innovations such as the metaverse,"" Honda says.

Interior of the Honda Prologue, the company's first electric vehicle announced last week.

Translation: The cars will eventually be able to drive themselves, allowing passengers to relax with content created by Sony, like games, movies, and even AR-like experiences.

Together, Honda and Sony will design and manufacture new vehicles for delivery in 2026, first to the US (spring) and then Japan. The announcement did not reveal pricing or range of the vehicles, but preorders will begin in the first half of 2025, with formal sales starting later that year.

The company's slogan revolves around what it calls the ""three A's:

Autonomy - The vehicles will aim for Level 3 self-driving (Level 2+ in urban scenarios) through Sony-led sensor development.

- The vehicles will aim for Level 3 self-driving (Level 2+ in urban scenarios) through Sony-led sensor development. Augmentation - In-vehicle and cloud-based software will eventually bring drivers to the metaverse and offer other entertainment like augmented reality (think Pokémon Go).

- In-vehicle and cloud-based software will eventually bring drivers to the metaverse and offer other entertainment like augmented reality (think Pokémon Go). Affinity - SMH hopes customers will fall in love with their fun, experiential vehicles, making them loyal customers for life.

Other EV makers have found success with a similar approach. Tesla drivers are notoriously brand loyal, and can entertain themselves with games and streaming services while charging. (Autopilot is still a work in progress.) BMW also has a strong battery-powered lineup, which will soon include console gaming.

But partnering with an entertainment conglomerate like Sony could distinguish Honda's EVs from the rest. Sony will be responsible for much of the car’s cloud-based systems, electronics, software, and infotainment. Its vast library of movies, photos, and beloved characters could generate revenue through subscriptions to watch content and interact in the metaverse while the vehicle eventually drives itself.

Yasuhide Mizuno, SHM CEO, and Izumi Kawanishi, SHM President and CEO

Honda will focus on EV production. The vehicles will be manufactured in one of Honda's 12 US factories, though today's press release did not specify which one. (Honda also recently announced a new $4.4 billion battery plant in Ohio.)

SHM did not commit to manufacturing a certain number of entertainment-based EVs, but it suggested the numbers may be lower than Honda's mainstream EV line. “A high value-added product is what we are looking at, so it’s not like we’re looking at mass production,” says Yasuhide Mizuno, the new CEO of SHM.",electric vehicles,pcmag.com

Beijing (AFP) – As China's leaders gather for a crucial party congress, the country is expected on Tuesday to announce some of its weakest quarterly growth figures since 2020, its economy hobbled by Covid restrictions and a real estate crisis.

The figures for the third quarter, along with a salvo of other economic indicators, will be unveiled in the middle of the week-long political meeting that is expected to grant President Xi Jinping a historic third term in charge.

A group of experts interviewed by AFP said they expected an average GDP increase of 2.5 percent on last year's July-September quarter.

In the previous quarter, growth in the world's second largest economy collapsed to only 0.4 percent compared to the previous year, the worst performance since 2020. The country posted 4.8 percent growth in the first quarter of 2022.

Many economists think China will struggle to attain its growth target this year of around 5.5 percent, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its GDP growth forecast to 3.2 percent for 2022 and 4.4 percent for 2023.

AFP's panel of experts predicted average growth of three percent in 2022, a long way off the 8.1 percent seen in 2021.

That would be China's weakest growth rate in four decades, excluding 2020 when the global economy was hammered by the emergence of the coronavirus.

""The big policy challenge is accepting that the economy has reached a state of maturity that means growth numbers are likely permanently reset to the zero to 4.5 percent range for the coming decade,"" Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, told AFP.

Zero-Covid

Another factor that has had an enormous impact is Beijing's zero-Covid policy.

China is the last of the world's major economies to continue to follow the strategy, which imposes tight travel restrictions, mass PCR testing and obligatory quarantines.

It also involves sudden and strict lockdowns -- including of businesses and factories -- which has disrupted production and weighed heavily on household consumption.

But despite the impact on the economy, ""there is no clear sign of a significant easing of the zero-Covid strategy"", Nomura's Ting Lu said, noting that so far the opposite had happened.

In the week leading up to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Congress, state media have published multiple editorials warning the policy should not be relaxed, and officials have pounced on outbreaks across the country over the last week with increased curbs.

Some lockdown restrictions have returned to major financial hub Shanghai, prompting some to fear a repeat of earlier this year when the city was shut down for two months.

Meanwhile, China is also battling an unprecedented crisis in its real estate sector -- historically a driver of growth in the economy and representative of more than a quarter of the country's GDP when combined with construction.

Real estate sales are falling across the country, leaving many developers struggling Johannes EISELE AFP

Following years of explosive growth fuelled by easy access to loans, Chinese authorities launched a crackdown on excessive debt in 2020.

Property sales are now falling across the country, leaving many developers struggling and some owners refusing to pay their mortgages for unfinished homes.

'Modern economy'

Despite the problems, ""many economic indicators have actually recovered reasonably well from the mass lockdowns of March and April"", according to analyst Thomas Gatley from Gavekal Dragonomics.

Car sales held strong in September, driven by strong demand for electric clean vehicles.

August exports increased by 7.1 percent compared to the previous year, and Beijing has invested in infrastructure to support activity.

However, ""those pillars of growth are becoming more fragile"", Gatley said.

And ""the Chinese economy faces more fundamental problems"" of transformation, sinologist Jean-Louis Rocca told AFP.

After decades of growth fueled by investment and exports, he said China ""no longer wants to be 'the world's factory'"" -- instead it aspires to be a ""modern economy"", geared towards new technology and consumption -- and the transition is still ongoing.

Another worry for the CCP, which draws a large part of its political legitimacy from its economic success, is that this type of modern economy does not create very many jobs, Rocca said -- which has serious implications for China's growing middle class.

Nearby, a group of Ukrainian deminers with the country's territorial defense forces worked to clear the area of dozens of other deadly mines and unexploded ordnance — a push to restore a semblance of safety to the cities, towns and countryside in a region that spent months under Russian occupation.

The deminers, part of the 113th Kharkiv Defense Brigade of Ukraine's territorial defense forces, walked deep into fallow agricultural lands on Thursday along a muddy road between fields of dead sunflowers overgrown with high weeds.

Two soldiers, each with a metal detector in hand, slowly advanced up the road, scanning the ground and waiting for the devices to give a signal. When one detector emitted a high tone, a soldier knelt to inspect the mud and grass, probing it with a metal rod to see what might be buried just below the surface.

The detector's hit could indicate a spent shell casing, a piece of rusting iron or a discarded aluminum can. Or it could be an active land mine.

Oleksii Dokuchaev, the commander of the demining brigade based in the eastern Kharkiv region, said that hundreds of mines have already been discharged in the area around the village of Hrakove where they were working, but that the danger of mines across Ukraine will persist for years to come.

""One year of war equals 10 years of demining,"" Dokuchaev said. ""Even now we are still finding munitions from World War II, and in this war they're being planted left and right.""

Russian forces hastily fled the Kharkiv region in early September after a rapid counteroffensive by Ukraine's military retook hundreds of square miles of territory following months of Russian occupation.

While many settlements in the region have finally achieved some measure of safety after fierce battles reduced many of them to rubble, Russian land mines remain an ever-present threat in both urban and rural environments.

Small red signs bearing a white skull and crossbones line many of the roads in the Kharkiv region, warning of the danger of mines just off the pavement. Yet sometimes, desperation drives local residents into the minefields.

The local man whose body lay near the abandoned Russian camp was likely searching for food left behind by the invading soldiers, Dokuchaev said, an additional danger posed by the hunger experienced by many in Ukraine's devastated regions.

The use of the kind of tripwire land mines which killed him is prohibited under the 1997 Ottawa Treaty — of which Russia is not a signatory — which regulates the use of anti-personnel land mines, he said.

""There are rules of war. The Ottawa Convention says that it's forbidden to place mines or any other munitions with tripwires. But Russians ignore it,"" he said.

The deminers had cleared the road of anti-personnel mines the previous day, allowing them to search for anti-tank mines hidden beneath the ground that could destroy any vehicles driving over them.

They hoped to bring vehicles deep enough into the area to retrieve an abandoned Russian armored personnel carrier, the engine of which they planned to salvage. A vehicle would also need to be brought in by local police to retrieve the body.

The deminers reached the abandoned camp, set in a grove of trees and strewn with the remains of the months the Russian soldiers had spent there: rotting food rations in wooden ammunition boxes, strings of high-caliber bullets, a stack of yellowing Russian newspapers and trenches filled with refuse.

After a thorough scan of the area, the servicemen recovered two Soviet-made TM-62 anti-tank mines and six pneumatically armed fuses and placed them in a depression on the edge of the camp, taped into a bundle along with 400 grams of TNT.

Dokuchaev placed an electric detonator into the explosive charge and connected it to a long length of wire before taking cover with his men at a distance of more than 100 meters.

When the charge was detonated — something the servicemen laughingly called ""bada-boom"" — the immense blast ripped through the air, causing a cascade of autumn leaves to fall from the surrounding trees and emitting a tall plume of gray smoke.

After the mines had been destroyed, Dokuchaev — a former photographer who enlisted with the territorial defense forces after the outbreak of war — said the work his brigade is doing is essential to keep civilians safe as they pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.

Despite the dangers, he said, he enjoys his work.

""I don't know what I'll do after our victory,"" Dokuchaev said. ""Life is boring without explosions.""",electric vehicles,voa news

HRAKOVE, Ukraine (AP) — Beside an abandoned Russian military camp in eastern Ukraine, the body of a man lay decomposing in the grass — a civilian who had fallen victim to a tripwire land mine set by retreating Russian forces.

361,Associated Press: Biden administration teams with Mexico to craft new strategy for Venezuelan migrants seeking to reach U.S.,https://images.mktw.net/im-644986/social,15/10/2022,"Successful, lawful applicants are to arrive in the U.S. via airports, while Venezuelans who walk or swim across the border will be returned to Mexico under Title 42 authority put in place early in the pandemic",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-administration-teams-with-mexico-to-craft-new-strategy-for-venezuelan-migrants-seeking-to-reach-u-s-01665807607,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Biden administration agreed to accept up to 24,000 Venezuelan migrants at U.S. airports, similar to how Ukrainians have been admitted since Russia’s invasion, while Mexico has agreed to take back Venezuelans who come to the U.S. illegally over land, the U.S. and Mexico said Wednesday.

Effective immediately, Venezuelans who walk or swim across the border will be immediately returned to Mexico under a pandemic rule known as Title 42 authority, which suspends rights to seek asylum under U.S. and international law on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Any Venezuelan who illegally enters Mexico or Panama after Wednesday will also be ineligible to come to the U.S. under the offer.

The U.S. offer of parole for up to 24,000 Venezuelans is modeled on a similar program for Ukrainians who fled Russia’s invasion and will hinge on Mexico “keeping in place its independent but parallel effort” to take back Venezuelans who come illegally, the Department of Homeland Security said.

“ ‘These actions make clear that there is a lawful and orderly way for Venezuelans to enter the United States.’ ” — Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas

The moves are a response to a dramatic increase in migration from Venezuela, which leapfrogged over Guatemala and Honduras in August to become the second largest nationality arriving at the U.S. border after Mexico.

“These actions make clear that there is a lawful and orderly way for Venezuelans to enter the United States, and lawful entry is the only way,” said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. “Those who attempt to cross the southern border of the United States illegally will be returned to Mexico and will be ineligible for this process in the future. Those who follow the lawful process will have the opportunity to travel safely to the United States and become eligible to work here.”

Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Secretary said in a statement that “those who seek to enter the United States will be able to do so in a more orderly, safe, regular and humane manner. The program discourages undocumented crossings that put migrants’ safety at risk.”

“ Homeland Security is to make available nearly 65,000 temporary work visas for lower-skilled industries, roughly double the current annual allotment, with at least 20,000 be reserved for workers from Haiti and northern Central American countries. ”

In a related announcement, Homeland Security said it will make available nearly 65,000 temporary work visas for lower-skilled industries, roughly double the current annual allotment. At least 20,000 of those temporary visas will be reserved for Haiti and northern Central American countries.

Until now, Mexico has agreed to accept migrants expelled under Title 42 only if they are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, in addition to Mexico, resulting in highly uneven enforcement. The U.S. struggles to expel other nationalities due to costs, strained diplomatic relations and other considerations.

Poor relations with the Venezuelan government have made it nearly impossible to apply Title 42. The pandemic rule has been used 2.3 million times since March 2020 but applied only 2,453 times on Venezuelans.

In August, Venezuelans were stopped 25,349 times, up 43% from 17,652 in July and four times the 6,301 encounters in August 2021, signaling a remarkably sudden demographic shift.

The announcement amounts to a potentially major expansion of Title 42 even though the administration recently sought to end it. Senior officials told reporters they are bound by a federal judge’s decision in May to keep Title 42 in place.

Venezuelans who successfully apply online will come to the United States through an airport, similar to an effort that began in April to admit up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing war for stays of up two years. The U.S. has admitted tens of thousands of Ukrainians since then, including including nearly 17,000 in August.

Venezuelans, like Ukrainians, must have a financial sponsor in the United States.

They also must figure out how to reach the U.S. There are currently no flights allowed from Venezuela due to U.S. concerns about the safety of Venezuela’s aviation industry. The restriction applies to charter and commercial flights.

Also: ‘We all live in some kind of limbo’: It’s been six months since Russia invaded Ukraine, and Ukrainian war refugees long for home

Venezuelans do not have to be in Venezuela to be eligible and may come from other countries, administration officials said.

It also remains to be seen if Mexico has limits to how many Venezuelans it will accept from the United States. Mexico said in its statement that it will “temporarily allow some Venezuelan citizens” to be returned. The 24,000 slots that the U.S. is offering is less than the number of Venezuelans that crossed the border illegally from Mexico in August alone.

An estimated 6.8 million Venezuelans have fled their country since the economy tanked in 2014, mostly to Latin America and Caribbean countries. But the U.S. economy’s relative strength since the COVID-19 pandemic has caused Venezuelan migrants to look north. The Biden administration’s inability to apply Title 42 has provided more incentive.

Mexico, under pressure from the U.S. administration, introduced restrictions on air travel to limit Venezuelan migration to the United States in January, but many then shifted to a dangerous route over land that includes Panama’s notorious Darien Gap.

The surge in Venezuelan migration has emerged as a major challenge to authorities in the U.S., Mexico and Central America and a test of a hemispheric agreement reached in June in Los Angeles for countries that host migrants to confront issues together.

362,Cars That Qualify for the New Federal EV Tax Credit,https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/f572482b406ac5f6fb25ec7d79c02ca765ea6c39/hub/2022/05/09/445bc5de-358c-4540-b401-6f67f0424d8e/lightning-promo.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=630&width=1200,15/10/2022,"The rules are complicated, but this list of Tesla, GM, Ford and other cars should make it clearer.",https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/cars-that-qualify-for-the-new-federal-ev-tax-credit/,"This story is part of Plugged In, CNET's hub for all things EV and the future of electrified mobility. From vehicle reviews to helpful hints and the latest industry news, we've got you covered.

The new $7,500 federal tax credit for a new electric car is complicated, factoring in where a car and its battery are made, what it costs and when you buy it. To make that easier, here's a short list of the cars that qualify. It's based on research by Consumer Reports and the Department of Energy, with my margin notes.

Available now

Chevrolet Bolt and Bolt EUV

General Motors

The Bolt is a real solid choice though it has a black eye from a past battery flaw associated with some fires. That, along with the fact that GM is about to switch to its new Ultium electric platform for all its EVs, might give you pause. If you do select a Bolt, wait until Jan. 1, 2023, when GM is allowed to offer federal tax credits again after maxing out of the old program some time ago.

Ford F-150 Lightning

Ford

The F-150 Lightning is currently the only electric full-size pickup on the market and it's a huge hit. You'll have to keep its total price under $80,000 to qualify for the new tax credit, which shouldn't be too hard even though the truck's had two big price hikes: The original base of $41,669 with destination is now $53,769. You may also want to wait to compare it to the electric Silverado coming in 2023 -- a suggestion of brand-hopping that used to be almost unheard of in truck country.

Ford Mustang Mach-E

Antuan Goodwin/CNET

The Mustang Mach-E sits squarely among a bunch of Teslas at the top of sales charts, inspiring Ford to double production plans. Its next major redesign is way off in the 2026 model year so the main question is whether you wait until calendar 2023 for somewhat better Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries it will get and to compare it to the electric Chevy Blazer that should be the Mach-E's most direct competitor.

Nissan Leaf

Nissan

The Leaf doesn't set anyone's hair on fire -- it's lacking soul in reviewer Jon Wong's opinion -- but Nissan knows how to build a good piece of electric transportation. Word is that the Leaf might be discontinued for the US in 2026 but that's far enough out to be unrelated to buying one today.

Rivian R1S and R1T

The Rivians are truly fresh and exciting but you'll have a tricky time fitting even the least expensive one under the $80,000 tax credit price cap for trucks and utilities. Another concern is that Rivian just recalled almost every vehicle it's ever made to tighten a nut. It's an important fastener, related to steering control, but I'm less concerned than if it was for a battery, motor or computer.

Tesla Model 3 and Model Y

Tesla

What hasn't been said about these two Teslas except that you can't get the new federal tax credit on one until 1/1/23 when Tesla re-enters the program after being the first company to max out of the old program. Because the Model 3 is classified as a car you'll face a price cap of $55,000 while the Model Y is classified by the EPA as a utility vehicle so should enjoy the higher $80,000 price ceiling. Both allow enough room to get most options except the $15,000 Full Self Driving technology, but that might be a good thing.

Volkswagen ID.4

Volkswagen

This one's a little tricky: The new tax credit rules specify cars made in North America, which means they apply if you buy an ID.4 from made in the brand new plant in Tennessee, which just started cranking out cars as I write this. Previous ID.4s were made in Germany, which is verboten under the new tax credit rules. Since the ID.4 is classed as a small SUV it should have an $80,000 price limit; No problem, you could buy two for that amount.

Available soon

When we turn the corner on Jan. 1, 2023 not only will some manufacturers qualify for the tax credit again, but some new models hit the market as well.

Cadillac Lyriq

Andrew Krok/CNET

The Lyriq is the sexiest member of an electric phalanx that GM will introduce in 2023-2024. It's also a flagship for the company's vaunted Ultium platform, upon which rides a whole new ball game at GM. As of this writing the Lyriq shows up on the EPA's listings as a utility, which would mean an $80,000 price cap.

Chevrolet Blazer EV

Chevrolet

This is the big shoe waiting to drop if you're considering a Ford Mustang Mach-E. The new electric Blazer will channel the Camaro that way the Mach-E channels a Mustang. Know that the electric Blazer is a new model, not a conventional Blazer with an electric retrofit. As of today I don't see an EPA classification for it but it's clearly a utility that should have an $80,000 price cap.

Chevrolet Silverado EV

Chevy

Ford has validated the electric pickup category but Chevy will be first to bring it some choice, which any smart vehicle buyer should expect before making a move. While history indicates that truck owners seldom change brands, the move to electric power is so profound that I think many will consider switching. Fords never lost their eligibility for a federal tax credit unlike GM vehicles that won't get it back until 1/1/2023, so if you need an electric pickup right now, say for business tax reasons, the F-150 Lightning is your huckleberry. And it's not clear to me that Chevrolet will offer many versions of the electric Silverado in 2023 that fall under the $80,000 price cap, especially when you consider dealer price gouging which will count against you. Here's a wild card: The electric RAM pickup arrives in 2024 and while it will be late to the party it may learn from first movers' mistakes.

Tesla Cybertruck

Tesla

This perennial ""next year"" vehicle supposedly is coming next year, when Tesla vehicles will again qualify for federal tax credits for the first time in years. I don't have any confidence in the Cybertruck's promised $39,900 base price in a world where Ford couldn't hold the line on about the same base price for an electric F-150. On the other hand, I can't imagine a single buyer of the Cybertruck would change their mind if it doesn't qualify for a tax credit.",electric vehicles,cnet
